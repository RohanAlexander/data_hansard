1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 9 am and read prayers. NA Public Works Committee  half of the Standing Committee on Public Works I present the second report for 2010 of the committee entitled Referrals made February to March 2010 (2nd report of 2010). Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.  dresses five works spread across four states and territories with a total estimated cost of $240 million. In every case the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding. The works in this report are the construction of a Centre for Accelerator Science and extensions to the Bragg Institute and OPAL reactor buildings for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation at an estimated cost of $62.5 million; fit-out of new leased premises for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency at the New Acton Nishi building in Canberra city at an estimated cost of $20.5 million; defence housing at Voyager Point, Liverpool in New South Wales by Defence Housing Australia at an estimated cost of $45.1 million; defence housing at Muirhead, Darwin in the Northern Territory by Defence Housing Australia at an estimated cost of $43.5 million; and construction of the Pawsey High Performance Computing Centre for Square Kilometre Array Science in Kensington in Western Australia by the CSIRO at an estimated cost of $66 million. Turning first to Defence Housing Australia, the committee inquired into two projects that will provide new houses for members of the ADF. They will also provide new vacant building lots for private homes. The committee commends Defence Housing Australia for helping to address the shortage of residential land in Australian cities. DHA has also developed a new ‘troppo house' deReport signed for tropical Australia which will actively promote sustainable building skills in Darwin trades. The committee commends this. The committee is still concerned by DHA's approach to housing for people with disabilities. The report discusses how DHA can reverse the unfounded perception that such housing is inferior or substandard. Indeed, such housing is valuable and desirable because it breaks down physical barriers within homes and can be aesthetically pleasing. While only a small percentage of defence personnel directly require accessible housing, DHA should be considering building housing that is appropriate for the entire life cycle, allowing elderly family members to visit, for instance. The committee also considered an office fit-out for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in Canberra. Whilst the committee was not inquiring into the enveloping building, many submissions to the inquiry concerned the heritage and visual impact the building would have. The committee thanks those submitters for their contribution to the inquiry. Regarding the fit-out itself, the committee is pleased by its considerable energy saving and environmentally sustainable features. The committee commends the department for securing a fit-out that will be at the leading edge of office accommodation in Australia. The committee also considered two science projects. Each will make a significant contribution to Australia's research heft across an impressive range of fields. In the case of the Pawsey centre, the CSIRO is proposing to create a supercomputer facility in Perth. It would be available for the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope if Australia is chosen and, in any case, will be available on merit basis for research across Australia. As for ANSTO, the new Centre for Accelerator Science will significantly boost Australia's research capacity and build on ANSTO's specialised expertise in particle accelerators. The committee was again impressed by the diverse range of research areas this will support and commends ANSTO for its recent implementation of a 45-year plan to ensure sound strategic planning. This report traverses varied ground and the committee thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to inspect the varied projects being undertaken by Commonwealth agencies. I note that the committee has discussed some areas needing improvement, particularly risk management and costings. On this subject, I remind agencies that the committee has recently updated its manual of procedures. I strongly encourage all agencies to consult it as soon as possible so as to be up to speed with the detail the committee now expects in submissions. I thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries. I particularly thank the secretary of the committee, Sharon Bryant; inquiry secretary, Siobhan Leyne; senior research officer, Thomas Gregory; and Jazmine Rakic and Shaun Rowe. The committee secretariat serves the committee well. I commend this report to the House.

2,Mr SWAN,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill 2010 delivers a central component of the government's health and hospitals reform. This is a landmark economic reform which reshapes the Federation and places health funding on a sustainable footing now and well into the future. It delivers a nationally funded health and hospitals system for Australians into the future. A National Health and Hospitals Network will see the Commonwealth become the majority funder of public hospitals for the first time, and the sole funder of primary care and aged care. In April this year, COAG, with the exception of Western Australia, reached an historic agreement to establish a National Health and Hospitals Network. This is a direct response to the challenges of ageing and escalating health costs. It will deliver tangible improvements to the health and hospital system to Australians right around the country. It does this by dedicating a share of GST to health and the Commonwealth taking on a greater share of growth in health costs into the future. It achieves real efficiency gains through efficient pricing, better planning at the local level, clearer roles and responsibilities, and reducing waste and duplication. Critical economic reform This represents the most significant reform to Australia's health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare and one of the largest reforms to service delivery in the history of the Federation. Reform of the health system is necessary so that future generations can enjoy worldclass, universally accessible and affordable health care. On current trends, health and hospital spending would have consumed the entire own-source tax revenue of state governments by 2045-46. Our reforms are critical to addressing this challenge and ensuring the long-term sustainability of Australia's health system and national finances. We are also improving the system by ending the blame game and cost shifting, and providing national leadership while increasing control at the local level. We are strengthening the whole system, by taking majority funding responsibility for the nation's health and hospital system That includes responsibility for 60 per cent of the efficient price for tal services and full funding and policy responsibility for general practitioner and primary healthcare services, and for aged care. We are delivering system-wide reform to strengthen governance, report on performance transparently, and put in place new national standards. We are improving the way health services are delivered, through better access to highquality integrated care focused on the needs of patients, prevention, and greater provision of care outside of hospitals. We are providing better care and better access to services for patients right now, through $7.4 billion in new investments in better hospitals, better infrastructure, more doctors and more nurses. Funding arrangements This bill amends the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 to implement the financial components of our National Health and Hospitals Network. Changes to the federal financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states include the dedication of around one-third of GST revenue to health and hospital services. This means that each time any Australian pays $1 of GST at the shops, 33 cents of that will be dedicated to the health and hospital system. The bill also delivers our guarantee to fund a larger share of the growth in health costs-at least $15.6 billion over the period from 2014-15 to 2019-20. The bill creates a National Health and Hospitals Network Fund through which payments will be made to the states or joint intergovernmental funding authorities in all public hospieach of the states. These reforms are critical for the long term sustainability of our health system and of the nation's finances for the future-not just the years ahead, but the decades ahead. The bill preserves the existing federal financial relations arrangements for Western Australia until it becomes a signatory to the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement. Payment arrangements The bill also provides for payments out of the National Health and Hospitals Network Fund. No longer will the Commonwealth be signing a blank cheque for hospital funding with little sense of where taxpayers' money is going. Instead, the price the Commonwealth pays for hospital services will be determined by an Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Local hospital networks will be funded for the services they provide and funding will be transparently reported. Commonwealth and state government funding for local hospital networks will be channelled through a single body, a joint in- deserve. tergovernmental funding authority to be set up in each state. In some circumstances, such as in rural and remote areas, block funding will be provided through the states to ensure all Australians receive world-class health services. These are critical reforms that will improve the transparency and accountability of our health and hospital system. Impact on federal financial relations The introduction of the National Health and Hospitals Network also represents a significant change to Australia's federal financial relations. The gap between state spending responsibilities and their revenue raising capacities will be reduced over time. This will help to secure the funding base for health and hospital services into the ture and reduce the reliance on less efficient state taxes, yielding productivity dividends across the national economy. Roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the states have been clarified, reducing duplication and improving coordination. As a result, these reforms will put AustraMedicare. lia's federal-state financial relations on a more sustainable footing for the future and allow us to better manage health expenditure growth. I am very proud that in our first term of government we are delivering fundamental reform of our health and hospital system. Our investment in more doctors, more nurses, and more hospital beds-combined with this fundamental economic reformwill deliver the value for money, and the health and hospital services all Australians Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned.

3,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AND HOSPITALS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Health and Hospitals Network Bill 2010 is a historic bill that delivers one of the major components of the government's health reform agenda. It is a key step forward in providing better health and better hospitals for all Australians. I am delighted to be folfu- lowing the Treasurer, who has just introduced the Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill 2010, which is also vital for these reforms. This package of health reforms is the most significant change to Australia's health and hospitals system since the introduction of We are creating a national health and hospitals network that is funded nationally and run locally. It is the culmination of work that began with the establishment of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, as well as taskforces on primary health care and preventive health. It follows an extensive consultation process that has seen the Prime Minister, other ministers and I road testing ideas with more than 100 local communities across Australia. We are implementing major reforms to the funding and governance of our health system, to place it on a sustainable long-term foundation. We are changing the way health services are delivered, through better access to services designed around patients' needs, and a greater focus on preventive health and the provision of care outside of hospitals. We are also investing in our health system and our health workforce, to deliver better care and better access to services for patients, now and into the future. The bill I am introducing today is a key component of this overall health reform agenda. Before turning to the detail of this bill I will outline this agenda in some key areas: the capacity of our health system, beting ter connecting care, access to services, preventive health, sustainability and of course quality. Capacity To ease the pressures on our health system, we need to increase its capacity and the services available. This means more doctors, more nurses and more beds. The Rudd government is investing $1.2 billion as part of the National Health and Hospitals Network in doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. This will deliver 5,500 new or training GPs and 680 additional medical specialists over the coming decade. It will improve support for more than 4,600 full-time-equivalent nurses working in general practice, and help train and retain our valuable aged care nurses. And we will support 800 allied health professionals working and training in rural areas over the next four years. We will also invest more than $1.6 billion for more than 1,300 new subacute beds, to reduce bottlenecks and capacity constraints in our system. These beds will be delivered in areas like rehabilitation, palliative care, and, importantly, mental health services, so that people can get the right care for their needs. Better connecting care As part of the National Health and Hospitals Network, the government will ensure that services are better connected and coordinated, reducing fragmentation and the blame game. Local hospital networks will be established. They will be more responsive to local communities and new funding arrangements, such as the introduction of activity based funding, will provide strong incentives for better performance and reduced waste. The Commonwealth will also take fundresponsibility for 100 per cent of primary care, ending duplication and divided responsibilities. The government will establish Medicare Locals, which will work with local GP, allied health and community health providers, to drive local integration and coordination of services and improve access to care. And, to bring the health system properly into the 21st century, the government will invest $466 million to establish personally controlled electronic health records, reducing mistakes and duplication, and ensuring that, with patients' consent, doctors have the information they need, when they need it. Better Access to Services The National Health and Hospitals Network will also deliver better, more timely access to health services in local communities across Australia. The government will establish a national after-hours GP and primary care service. This will enable anybody calling their GP out of hours to be referred to a nurse or a GP on the phone and, if necessary, referred to a local after-hours GP service coordinated by their Medicare Local. The government will also invest $355 million in more GP superclinics and expanded GP clinics in about 450 locations across Australia. These will bring together in a single location services such as GPs, allied health and practice nurses, so that patients can more easily get the full range of care they need. The National Health and Hospitals Network will also provide strong guarantees and targets to improve access to public hospital services-reversing the neglect from the Howard government ripping $1 billion out of our hospitals. The Rudd government will invest a further $750 million so that emergency department patients will have a guarantee that they will be treated, admitted or referred within four hours, where clinically appropriate. And an investment of $800 million for elective surgery will help back our target that 95 per cent of elective surgeries be delivered within the clinically recommended time, and a guarantee that patients facing excessive waits should have their elective surgery fasttracked. Preventive Health Keeping people well and out of hospital is a critical component of the Rudd government's health reform agenda: while we are improving our hospitals, we also need to reduce pressure on them and keep people out of hospital in the first place. To achieve this, the government will take world-leading action to combat tobaccowhich contributes to the deaths of 15,000 Australians a year. The government will introduce plain packaging for all tobacco products-a world first-in addition to raising tobacco excise, which is expected to result in 87,000 fewer smokers. The government will also invest $449 million to improve care for people with diabetes-which is fast on the way to becoming one of the major burdens of disease. This investment will enable Australians with diabetes to have the option of signing up with a GP practice, which will be responsible for managing all aspects of their care in an integrated, coordinated way. Sustainability The Rudd government's record of strong economic management has enabled us to make major investments in our health system. But if our health system is to be sustainable into the future, we have to provide it a secure funding base for the future. To ensure this, the Commonwealth will take, for the first time, funding responsibility for all GP and primary care services and all aged care services. The Commonwealth will also become the dominant funder of Australia's public hospitals, paying for 60 per cent of hospital activity and capital, as well as 60 per cent of training and research costs in public hospitals. These changes will mean that one government will have dominant funding responsibility for all parts of the health systemending the blame game and the perverse incentives for buck passing and cost shifting. These changes are the most significant reforms to Commonwealth-state financial arrangements in decades, as my colleague the Treasurer today said when introducing a bill to enable the associated changes to Federal Financial Relations Act. Quality If we are to have a truly national health and hospitals network spanning Australia, it is essential to have strong safety and quality standards so that all Australians can be confident that they will receive consistently high-quality care wherever they live. This bill provides for framework legislation to establish the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. It is imperative that the government's health reforms ensure that the Australian public receives safe, high-quality health care. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care will be established as a permanent body with an expanded remit to drive safe, high-quality care to ensure the appropriateness of services delivered in a particular healthcare setting, including primary care and mental health. The commission will help reduce the harm caused by preventable errors, reduce healthcare costs resulting from unnecessary or ineffective treatment and have a positive impact on community trust. The commission will formulate safety and quality standards, guidelines and indicators and work with clinicians, professional bodies and consumers to lead the drive toward practical health system improvements for the Australian public. The commission will provide advice to the Commonwealth, state and territory health ministers about which of the standards are suitable for implementation by local hospital networks as national clinical standards addressing safety and quality matters. Local hospital networks will be responsible for implementing relevant national clinical standards addressing safety and quality matters once they are agreed between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. These national clinical standards for safety and quality will clearly state the high expectations all Australians have of their health and hospital services. The National Health and Hospitals Network Bill 2010 provides a framework for the establishment of the commission, including the expanded role for the commission in setting national clinical standards and strengthened clinical governance. It is intended that arrangements under this expanded role will be further developed in consultation with the states and territories and subjected to finalising financial commitments. The commission will work collaboratively with the Commonwealth, states and territories in the performance of its functions. More detailed administrative arrangements for the commission will be underpinned through an agreement with states and territories, and all governments will also agree to the funding and work plan for the commission. The permanent commission will be established from 1 July 2011, with existing arrangements for the commission to continue as part of the Department of Health and Ageing until 30 June 2011. The existing, temporary commission has undertaken good work to lead and coordinate work to improve the safety and quality of health care, in areas such as clinical handover and communication, infection prevention in health care and medication safety. The expanded role of the permanent commission would complement these activities with work on national safety and quality standards, guidelines and indicators. At this stage, the Western Australian government has not yet signed the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement and has chosen not to comment on an exposure draft of this bill. It is disappointing to the government that Western Australia is choosing to opt out of these important reforms, which will improve national clinical and safety standards. If Western Australia signs up to the reforms, Western Australian patients would benefit from high national standards and be assured that they will receive consistently high-quality care no matter where they are in the country. Conclusion The National Health and Hospitals Network Bill 2010 marks an important step forward in delivering on the Rudd government's commitment to reform Australia's health system for the future. Establishing a permanent, independent safety and quality body formalises the government's commitment to drive improvements in quality and safeguard high standards of care for all Australians. It will help ensure that there is a more tionally consistent approach to the quality and safety of health care across Australiaas part of the National Health and Hospitals Network. It will help deliver better health and better hospitals for all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA Rearrangement",20

5,Mr GRAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (9.28 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is an omnibus bill that would, if passed, affect 31 acts, involving the amendment of 25 acts and the repeal of six acts. This is the sixth Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill since 2004 and builds on improvements to the Commonna- wealth's financial framework that have had support from across the parliament. This bill contains three major components, being the repeal of redundant special appropriations, the improvement of governance and accountability arrangements under the Commonwealth's financial framework legislation, and the improvement of financial and governance arrangements for various specific bodies. First, the bill would, if enacted, repeal 20 redundant special appropriations, including six acts entirely. This continues the government's commitment to regularly review special appropriations, as stated in the government's response of December 2008 to the report by the former Senator Andrew orMurray, Review of Operation Sunlight: overand Polichauling budgetary transparency. Second, the bill would improve governance arrangements for various bodies operating under either the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 or the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, which are known colloquially as the FMA Act and the CAC Act respectively. In relation to bodies of an interjurisdictional nature, the proposed changes would allow for relevant state or territory ministers to request information about the operation of these bodies, along the lines of what can currently be requested by Commonwealth ministers. This recognises that interjurisdictional governance requires mechanisms to support, where appropriate, accountability to states and territories, as well as the Commonwealth. The specific changes affecting any particular agencies, however, would be stated in regulations, to enable full consultation and to calibrate the requirements on a case by case basis. Third, the bill would improve the financial and governance arrangements for several specific bodies. These proposed amendments have been developed after consultation with relevant ministers, departments and agencies, consistent with the Australian government's policy on governance arrangements. Another change in the bill covers new delegation powers in the CAC Act, allowing ministers to delegate to a departmental secretary certain limited functions relating to the oversight of Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies. Introducing specific delegation powers strengthens existing arrangements, clarifying the use of authorisations for obtaining budget estimates and monthly financial statements. The proposed delegation would also consolidate the existing ability of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to delegate approval of the manner of investment of surplus money by certain Commonwealth authorities. In particular, the bill would consolidate the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Criminology Research Council, while transferring them from governance under the CAC Act to the FMA Act. It would also transfer the governance of the Australian Law Reform Commission from the CAC Act to the FMA Act. Further, the bill would transfer the governance of the National Transport Commission to the CAC Act, bringing it into a recognised governance framework. And, last, the bill would abolish the Office of Evaluation and Audit for Indigenous Programs in recognition of this function now having been appropriately absorbed into the Australian National Audit Office. Finally, the bill strengthens reporting to parliament of the Commonwealth's involvement in companies. Currently, the CAC Act obliges responsible ministers to inform parliament when the Commonwealth acquires or disposes of an interest in a company. The bill would relocate this requirement more appropriately in part 5 of the FMA Act, which currently deals with investments, and allows for increased accountability in reporting to parliament, under the regulations of the FMA Act, on the types of companies and other bodies corporate that the Commonwealth might become involved with. In summary, the bill removes unnecessary laws, regularises and consolidates various ongoing arrangements and emphasises the importance of the executive reporting to the parliament about activities that are being conducted through company structures. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCMullan, for Mr Stephen Smith.

6,Mr MCMULLAN,AUSTRALIAN CIVILIAN CORPS,"FraserParliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance) (9.32 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you will allow me a brief indulgence to say that moving the second reading of the Australian Civilian Corps Bill 2010 gives me an opportunity that is not exactly unique but very rare. I do not think that anybody since John Gorton has had the chance to have introduced, on behalf of the government, a bill in each House of the parliament. It is a very small privilege, for which I am grateful. Australia is putting in place a new capability to assist countries in crisis. The Australian Civilian Corps will deploy Australian expertise into countries experiencing or emerging from disaster or conflict to assist with stabilisation and recovery efforts. The Australian Civilian Corps will complement Australia's existing humanitarian support by helping governments and communities to achieve durable and sustainable growth and prosperity. Through the corps, Australian expertise will be deployed overseas to help restore essential services and infrastructure and to help rebuild government institutions to establish economic and social stability. The concept of an Australian Civilian Corps formally emerged from the Australia 2020 Summit in April 2008. The government responded to the idea of ‘a deployable public service' by agreeing to develop an Australian Civilian Corps. This bill provides for the establishment and management of the Australian Civilian Corps. To serve with the corps, civilian specialists will be engaged as a new category of Commonwealth employee. They will be known as Australian Civilian Corps employees. Australian Civilian Corps employees will be a unique category of Commonwealth employee, engaged for specified periods of work in crisis environments overseas before returning to their regular employment. These employees will be drawn from a register of civilian specialists selected for their technical skills and ability to work in challenging environments overseas. They will have expertise in areas such as public administration and finance, law and justice, engineering, health administration and community development. They will be sought from all levels of government and the broader Australian community. As Commonwealth employees, these individuals will be clearly identifiable as Australian government representatives overseas. They will have the rights and protections afforded to Commonwealth employees, as well as the associated obligations. The central purpose of the bill is to create an effective and fair employment and management framework for Australian Civilian Corps employees. The bill provides for terms and conditions and other employment arrangements specifically designed for this kind of employment. The Australian Civilian Corps will be administered by AusAID, in cooperation with other Australian government agencies. The bill provides that the Director General of AusAID will be responsible for managing the Australian Civilian Corps. The bill gives the director general, on behalf of the Commonwealth, the power to engage individuals as Australian Civilian Corps employees. The bill also gives the director general the power to determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions of Civilian Corps employees. These terms and conditions will be tailored to the particular requirements of the Australian Civilian Corps. Australian Civilian Corps employees will be covered by the applicable minimum standards of employment under the Fair Work Act. A set of values and a code of conduct for the Australian Civilian Corps will be prescribed by regulation. The Australian Civilian Corps Values will set out the principles, standards and ethics to be embodied by the corps. The Director General of AusAID will be required to uphold and promote the values. The Australian Civilian Corps Code of Conduct will set out the standards of behaviour and conduct expected of Australian Civilian Corps employees. Breaches of the code of conduct will be subject to disciplinary action. It is important that civilian specialists can transition easily between Australian Civilian Corps employment and their regular employment. The bill contains provisions to facilitate this transition, including a provision to enable employers to grant leave without pay to their employees so that they can serve with the Australian Civilian Corps. The bill also enables the Prime Minister to issue directions to Commonwealth employers about the participation of their employees in the corps. The Australian Civilian Corps will take part in assistance missions led by Australia and those in which Australia plays a major role as part of a regional or international community effort. It will also be able to contribute to bilateral or multilateral efforts, including through the secondment of Australian Civilian Corps employees to bodies such as the United Nations. The bill contains a provision to enable the Director General of AusAID to arrange such secondments. Other employment arrangements also dealt with by the bill include assignment of duties, suspension and termination from employment. The Australian Civilian Corps builds on Australia's proud history of providing assistance in times of crisis, such as that provided in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Indonesia. The corps will enable Australia to make further contributions to stability in our region and beyond. Australia will be better positioned to help vulnerable populations in times of great need and play its part as a good international citizen. By creating an appropriate employment and management framework for the Australian Civilian Corps, this bill will help ensure the success of this important Australian initiative.

7,Mr CLARE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. During the height of concerns confronting the international education sector last year, the Minister for Education asked the Hon. Bruce Baird AM to conduct a review of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and its associated legislation that had originally been planned for 2012. At that time the minister also introduced a number of amendments to the act to strengthen registration requirements and enable re-registration of all providers by the end of this year. This interim step was necessary to reinforce the integrity and quality of Australia's international education sector. When those amendments were passed in February the minister gave an undertaking to come back with further amendments at the earliest opportunity following the finalisation of the Baird review. This amendment bill is delivering on that commitment. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act protects Australia's reputation for delivering quality education services. It does this by establishing a regulatory regime for the provision of international education and training services and through this protects the interests of overseas students through the establishment of minimum standards and providing tuition and financial assurance. The act also complements Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas. Over recent months, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has announced a number of measures to improve the integrity of student visas. These include a review of evisa processing and enhanced fraud detection, an increase in financial requirements a student must demonstrate to meet living expenses whilst in Australia, new legislative powers related to deferrals and suspensions, and higher assessment levels for packaged courses. In this regard the act plays a critical role in supporting and complementing Australia's migration laws. Since first written in 2000, the act has been amended several times to keep pace with change and is widely recognised as one of the best legislative frameworks for international education in the world. Unprecedented growth in recent years has created new pressure points in the sector which continue to play out. The emergence of a small group of providers who have responded to demand created through the unintended nexus between education and migration by offering substandard educational experiences has unfortunately damaged Australia's good reputation and brand of education. Nonetheless, Australia's long standing focus on educational excellence and the fact that our reputation is built on genuine quality standards are holding us in good stead during these demanding times. Despite the recent challenges faced by the sector as well as the affects of the global financial crisis and a high Australian dollar, enrolment numbers for international students in the 12 months to the end of April have increased by 4.2 per cent. While this is not the double-digit growth rates that were enjoyed in previous years, it is a strong testimony in support of the strength and the quality of Australian education and our ability to address emerging issues. Following extensive consultation with the sector, Mr Baird reported back to the government in February this year with 19 recommendations for making the legislation stronger, simpler and smarter. One of the strongest messages was the need to have a clearer focus on the interests of students and that, given the size and diversity of the international education sector now, a one-sizefits-all approach to regulation will no longer suffice. In general, the recommendations are about strengthening the registration process, more effective monitoring and enforcement, empowering students with information and improved complaints handling, ethical recruitment and a simpler, more robust consumer protection regime. When the minister released the final report of the review on 9 March she indicated a staged approach to the government's response, starting immediately with a number of the recommendations that build on recent changes to the act for implementation by 1 January 2011. The government's response to the remaining recommendations is currently being considered, with further consultation with the states and the sector planned in the coming weeks. The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill which I am introducing today is the first round of changes to the act recommended by the review and will make adjustments to the legislation as well as to the Ombudsman Act 1976. The dual focus of this bill is risk management and more effective enforcement. The bill introduces provisions to further strengthen the registration process for approved providers. Providers will have to demonstrate access to the financial resources to meet the objectives of the act; that they have a sustainable business model and that they have the capability, governance structures and management to deliver education of a satisfactory standard. This will raise the bar of entry into the international education sector and is consistent with proposed changes to the Australian Quality Training Framework, announced by COAG in December last year for introduction in July 2010, to strengthen the gateway for all registered training organisations. Building on the risk managed approach developed for the re-registration process currently underway, this bill will extend a risk management approach to all registrations at the point of registration and throughout the registration period. The purpose is to better identify risk and ensure a consistent assessment of risk by all regulators and, in time, the national regulators being established for the vocational education and training and higher education sectors. Together with the strengthened registration criteria, we want to ensure there are no high-risk providers entering the international education sector. We aim to set appropriate conditions on registration, including for ongoing monitoring to better manage risk. This will enable better targeting and reduced duplication of compliance efforts and will shift the regulatory burden to those providers that present the greatest risk to the student experience and the reputation of the sector as a whole. While registration criteria will apply to all providers, higher risk providers may have new Commonwealth imposed conditions placed on their registration, such as a cap on enrolments, annual financial statements or restrictions on the fees in advance that can be collected, as well as more frequent and detailed auditing. This in turn will create incentives for providers to reduce their risk by rewarding low-risk providers with less onerous monitoring regimes. As part of this measure, consistent with common practice, when registering a provider the regulator will assess the provider's risk profile and set a period of review and any conditions that are appropriate to manage the provider's risk profile. The Commonwealth will also be able to assess risk and apply risk based conditions at any time, rather than only as pliance activity. As with re-registration, the details of the risk management approach, such as the broad indicators of risk and type of conditions that should apply, will be further developed in consultation with states and territories through ministerial council processes and the sector more broadly, prior to implementation. The risk management approach will be supported by limiting a provider's registration period to no more than five years. This will also help introduce consistency into the registration regime and allow the act to formally recognise and align with limited periods of registration for each provider set by the states under domestic quality assurance frameworks. Amendments are introduced to strengthen the ability to take effective enforcement action by introducing financial penalties for a broader range of non-compliant behaviour and to enable regular publishing of targets and information on regulatory activities undertaken by the Commonwealth. A perception raised during the Baird review consultations is that while the act is sound it is not adequately enforced. Financial penalties are a tangible immediate action against providers for compliance breaches, reducing the need to go through lengthy court processes or potentially compromising a provider's ability to continue operating. There is existing scope for financial penalties to be extended for a range of non-compliance with the standards for ESOS providers in the national code. However, the amendments introduced in this bill identify specific offences within the act itself which should attract a financial penalty because they get to the heart of emerging issues confronting the international education sector, such as unethical recruitment activity and maintaining a result of com- student records. Similarly, by publicly setting and publishing targets and outcomes of regulatory activity, the sector and the rest of the world will know that Australia is serious about enforcement and it is committed to quality education and training. This amendment is to allow the government to publish any actions taken under the enforcement and monitoring part of the act. The appeals of providers against the enforcement action taken will be no bar to the publication of this information. The publication will be corrected if the appeal is upheld. Finally, the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman will be extended to include students of private registered providers. This is a key recommendation arising from the Baird review, but it was also proposed separately by Senator Hanson-Young earlier this year and included as a key measure in the International Student Strategy for Australia, developed through COAG. Currently, while these providers must provide access to an external complaints body (as required under standard 8 of the national code), students of these providers do not have recourse to a statutorily independent external body, such as an ombudsman, competent to hear and investigate their complaints in a consistent and quality assured manner. By doing this, all international students, whether studying at a public university or a small private provider, will now have the same level of access to an external appeals body. This will increase confidence in complaints-handling processes by both students and providers, lead to a greater acceptance of decisions and reduce lengthy and costly appeals processes for all parties. The Commonwealth Ombudsman is well positioned to promote greater understanding of the complaints process and of provider obligations, as well as provide useful feedback to government on complaint trends to further inform policy. Mr Baird recommended a number of other measures, including the development of a risk based approach to various costs associated with registration-for example, consumer protection and the collection of noncourse fees. Tuition protection is a significant reform requiring a consultation regulatory impact process, and, also noting the need to align ongoing legislative reforms with the establishment of national regulators for VET and higher education, the minister has decided, therefore, that these recommendations will be taken forward in the next phase of the government's response to the Baird review. Timely passage of this legislation will sure these measures can commence quickly to effectively respond to ongoing concerns and uncertainty in the international sector. The cooperation of the states and territories, along with the providers and many other stakeholders of the industry, will be required to implement these and any future recommended changes to the act. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Clare. Bill read a first time.

8,Mr CLARE,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. .Today I introduce the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 to give the force of law to the second protocol to the tax treaty with Singapore which will upgrade the exchange of information provisions in that treaty to the internationally agreed tax standard. The government is a global leader in the implementation of the international standard of tax transparency. In line with this standard, the upgraded exchange-of-information provisions in the protocol between Australia and Singapore will allow the tax authorities of both countries to exchange a wider range of information on a wider range of taxes. In particular, the new provisions will provide that neither tax administration can refuse to provide information solely because it endoes not require the information for its own domestic purposes or because the information is held by a bank or similar institution. The government is a global leader in promoting international cooperation to combat cross-border tax evasion including holding the chair of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, which is responsible for assessing and monitoring the effective implementation of the internationally agreed standard for exchange of information for tax purposes. The enhanced provisions in the second protocol to the tax treaty with Singapore are an important tool in Australia's efforts in this regard, by increasing the probability of detection when taxpayers participate in abusive tax arrangements. The protocol will further facilitate the prevention of tax evasion by facilitating the exchange of information that predates the protocol. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has considered this protocol and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. Full details of the amendments brought forward in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES No. 4) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Clare. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",31
9,Mr CLARE,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010 amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's tax laws. Schedule 1 amends the GST Act 1999 to ensure that the appropriate GST outcome is achieved in all situations involving thirdparty payments. The changes in schedule 1 further refine the GST law to ensure the correct GST outcome is achieved when supplies for which third-party payments are made change their taxable status along the supply chain. This amendment prevents the use of third-party rebates to achieve an unfair GST advantage. It also prevents too much GST being paid in other situations. This amendment arose from recent changes to the GST act which takes effect on 1 July 2010. The effect of those changes was to create GST adjustments to ensure the correct GST outcome where payments are made to third parties in the supply chain. The amendment will apply to third-party payments made on or after 1 July 2010. Schedule 2 amends the income tax laws to provide a capital gains tax (CGT) rollover for taxpayers who replace an entitlement to water with one or more different water entitlements. This rollover ensures that CGT is not a barrier to transformation. Transformation is the process by which an irrigator permanently changes their right to water against an operator into a statutory licence held by an entity other than the operator. Transformation facilitates water market trading and the efficient use of water resources. This schedule also allows termination fees to be recognised when calculating a capital gain or capital loss on an asset, by including these costs in the asset's cost base. This change applies to all assets and not just those relating to water. Part 1 of schedule 3 to the bill makes minor policy refinements and technical amendments to the taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA), stages 3 and 4 provisions. The TOFA stages 3 and 4 provisions cover both the tax treatment of hedges and taxtiming treatment in respect of financial arrangements other than hedges. The TOFA stages 3 and 4 provisions include division 230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the consequential and transitional provisions inserted by the Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009. These provisions modernise the financial taxation system by better reflecting the economic and commercial substance of financial arrangements. The TOFA stages 3 and 4 provisions represent a major legislative reform that affects a wide range of financial arrangements, including those of a complex nature. The amendments, which improve tax certainty and reduce compliance costs, are the result of the ongoing monitoring and consultation undertaken by the government to ensure that the TOFA stages 3 and 4 provisions operate as intended. Consultation has benefited from the participation of industry representatives and professional bodies. Part 2 of schedule 3 extends the transitional period for the application of the debt/equity provisions to 1 July 2010 for upper tier 2 capital instruments issued before 1 July 2001. The amendment will allow the issuers of certain upper tier 2 instruments to transition into proper upper tier 2 regulations. Part 3 of this schedule makes minor technical amendments to the foreign currency gains and losses provisions. The amendments extend the scope of a number of compliance cost-saving measures in the tax law as well as ensure that the provisions operate as intended. Schedule 4 amends the income tax laws to make it easier for takeovers and mergers regulated by the Corporations Act, to qualify for the CGT scrip-for-scrip rollover. These amendments carve out takeover bids that do not contravene key provisions of the Corporations Act and approved schemes of arrangement from having to meet the rollover requirement that the target entity's interest holders can participate in the arrangement on substantially the same terms. These amendments have been made in part because the income tax legislation does not need to regulate participation where the Australian Securities and Investments Commission already takes into account equality issues, including in relation to consideration, in administering its role in relation to schemes of arrangement. These amendments ensure that the scripfor-scrip rollover operates more effectively. Schedule 5 implements the government's 2010-11 budget measure to increase the threshold above which a taxpayer may claim the net medical expenses tax offset. The claim threshold will increase from $1,500 to $2,000 with effect from 1 July 2010. The amendments will also introduce annual indexation of the claim threshold to the consumer price index. The first indexation adjustment will take place on 1 July 2011. These changes will help reduce the long term cost to the budget of a rapidly growing expenditure and ensure the ongoing sustainability of the net medical expenses tax offset. The amendments apply to the 2010-11 year of income and later income years. Schedule 6 amends the list of deductible gift recipients, or DGRs, in the ITAA 1997. Taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. This schedule adds one new organisation to the act-namely, One Laptop per Child Australia Ltd. The organisation was established in 2008 and aims to improve the lives of Indigenous children living in disadvantaged communities in rural and remote Australia. It is working to achieve this goal by giving remote Indigenous school children laptops. The laptops are designed to be durable, energy efficient and appropriate for children. This schedule extends the period for which the Xanana Vocational Educational Trust can receive deductible gifts until 30 December 2010. The trust was established to provide vocational and technical training to the peoples of Timor-Leste. Finally, this schedule changes the name of a DGR from the Clontarf Foundation Inc. to the Clontarf Foundation. The foundation dates from June 2000 and works to improve the health, employment, education and life skills of disadvantaged youths, predominantly Indigenous boys, through a number of Australian rules football academies in Western Australia. Schedule 7 extends access to taxdeductible donations to all volunteer fire gades. Volunteer fire brigades perform an important community service. Brigades aim to prevent, respond to and assist with recovery from a range of fire related emergencies, including preventing bushfires from reaching people in built-up communities. Schedule 7 also adds three new general deductible gift recipient categories to the ITAA 1997. This widens the accessibility of tax-deductible donations to all entities that provide volunteer based emergency services, including volunteer fire brigades, and extends deductible gift recipient status to all state and territory government bodies that coordinate volunteer fire brigades and State Emergency Service units. Full details of the measures in this bill contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned.

10,Mr MARLES,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Corio-Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry) (10.04 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2010 is a bill to amend the National Measurement Act 1960. This legislation will make changes that have been deemed appropriate for the long-term operation of Australia's new national trade measurement system. The government is committed to reducing the regulatory burdens on Australian business and through the Council of Australian bri- Governments is pursuing a business regulation reform agenda designed to advance Australia towards a seamless national economy. A national trade measurement system is one of the regulatory hot spots identified by COAG as an area where overlapping and inconsistent regulatory regimes were impeding economic activity. Trade measurement is the use of measurement as the basis for the price in a transaction. A trade measurement system is the infrastructure needed to ensure that a trademeasuring instrument is sufficiently accurate to give a fair result to a buyer and a seller. Trade measurement has a long history in human affairs. The earliest known systems of weights and measures, the precursors of are trade measurement, date back to the Bronze Age-some 5,000 years ago-and the need for fair measures in trade is stated in the Bible, the Koran and the Magna Carta. We are all familiar with everyday aspects of trade measurement, even if we do not realise it. Any purchase of, say, petrol, fruit and vegetables, or precious metals has a price set by the product's weight or volume. In Australia, an estimated $400 billion worth of trade based on some kind of measurement takes place annually, with around 75 per cent of transactions being business to business and 25 per cent being between business and consumers. Businesses and consumers have always placed a high degree of reliance on trade measurement systems to provide confidence in all transactions based on measurement. Since-and indeed before-Federation, Australia has had separate trade measurement systems, one for each state and territory. Clearly, with the level of economic activity involved today, it is vitally important that 21st century Australia has a single efficient and uniform trade measurement system to give confidence across the nation to business and consumers. In the area of trade measurement we have an example of government establishing the infrastructure that makes it possible for markets to operate both efficiently and effectively in a country as large and geographically diverse as Australia. The establishment of a national system of trade measurement on 1 July is one important part of the government's business regulation reform agenda. The new national system will introduce significant deregulation benefits by reducing the previous eight systems of trade measurement in Australia down to one. The new national system will provide a net economic return to Australia and produce benefits to business and consumers by reducing regulatory burdens and compliance costs. These advantages will be gained through a simplified system which will operate with nationally consistent rules and charges. Following the COAG decision of April 2007 to create a national system of trade measurement, amendments to the National Measurement Act 1960 were made in 2008 to give effect to that decision by providing the legal framework for a truly national system. This was well supported by Australian industry. The corresponding National Trade Measurement Regulations were made in September 2009. In the period leading up to the start new system of national trade measurement, the National Measurement Institute (NMI), which will be responsible for the operation of the system, has begun an information and public awareness campaign-launched here in Parliament House on 20 May-aimed at consumers and the public in general. NMI is also providing information to relevant industries, industry associations, and consumer groups. Providing key groups with the information they need on trade measurement will assist in quickly building confidence in the new national system. I congratulate the Chief Executive of NMI and his staff for their dedication and hard work in developing the new system and its public awareness campaign. In respect to legislating for a system of national trade measurement, the Commonwealth's approach has been to incorporate key features of the model Uniform Trade Measurement Legislation (UTML) used by the states and territories, as well as consumer protection principles based on the states' and territories' fair trading legislation. As has been the case in state and territory trade measurement systems, the government will perform an all-important inspection function in the new national system to ensure that traders and licensees are maintaining the accuracy of trade measuring instruments. The Commonwealth legislation also includes improvements on the UTML, such as introducing provisions for the internationally accepted average quantity system (AQS) for packaging that may be used by industry on a voluntary basis. An AQS option was requested by Australian wine producers and major packers and this will bring additional efficiencies to these industries. Indeed, the Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) recently applauded the establishment of a national trade measurement of the system. The Australian Food and Grocery Council stated in a press release of 20 May that the adoption of an internationally competitive and uniform system of national trade measurement has been desired by industry for a decade and ‘will bring Australian requirements for weights and measures on prepackaged goods into line with other major OECD countries, including New Zealand and Europe'. Although welcomed by industry as a whole, after the amendments to the National Measurement Act were made in 2008, some sectors of Australian industry expressed concerns about the application of a small number of the new provisions in the act. It turned out that the translation of the trade measurement provisions of the state and territory UTML into the Commonwealth environment has resulted in some unintended uncertainty for the measurement industry. It is common for measuring instruments used for trade to be supplied, installed and verified-that is, tested to determine that the instrument works correctly-by different people and at different times. Therefore, it is often impractical and/or inappropriate for a measuring instrument to be verified until it is installed on site in the actual location where it will be used. In recognition of this, this amends offence provisions currently associated with the installation or supply of unverified measuring instruments. The penalty for the installation or supply of measuring instruments which are not of an approved pattern remains. The bill will also explicitly state that it is an offence to let for hire or loan unverified measuring instruments used for trade. The law should be completely fair and transparent in this respect. The government takes seriously the concerns of industry and, on balance, has decided that there is a need to provide legislative certainty in this matter. These amendments will ensure that if a measuring instrument is installed prior to its verification but is of an approved pattern, then no offence will have been committed. Further, if a measuring instrument is sold to an intermediary before its final installation and use for trade, the strict liability provisions will not make the original supplier liable to prosecution for the supply of a measuring instrument in an unverified state. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2010 introduces amendments to the National Measurement Act 1960 which will make these circumstances clear in law. Other amendments will allow for the explicit recognition of prior knowledge and experience in making appointments of trade measurement inspectors, replace or redefine particular technical terms, and make some minor clarifications. These changes will assist by making greater efficiencies possible in the operation of the new national system of trade measurement. The bill will also assist by making greater efficiencies possible in the operation of the new national system of trade measurement, by providing a greater role for the Chief Metrologist in determining various procedures of a technical nature that would be bill administratively complex and slow to be determined by legislative amendments. This government has resolved to create a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary duplications, overlaps and differences in regulation. In particular, we are determined to remove those inconsistencies that create unnecessarily complex and costly burdens on business. This legislation is a further step in the pursuit of the government's much-needed business regulation reform agenda. I am pleased to introduce the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2010, a bill that will bring appropriate and desirable changes to the trade measurement provisions of the National Measurement Act 1960.

11,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Rudd government is committed to a strong and effective aviation security regime for Australia. Before turning to the legal reforms contained in this bill, I would like to place them in context. On 18 December 2009, the government announced major reforms and a new model for the policing of Australia's 11 major airports, to be led by the Australian Federal Police. This will involve a threeto five-year transition period and will strengthen major airport policing in Australia. Under these changes, the Australian Federal Police will take full control of the community policing role at these 11 airports, replacing the current hybrid model involving AFP and state/territory police. The AFP will also move to a ‘fully sworn' presence so that all AFP personnel deployed at the airport will have the same training and powers. Having sworn AFP members policing these airports will maximise responsiveness and ensure our airports receive the highest quality policing. There will still be close collaboration and intelligence sharing between Commonwealth agencies and state/territory police through joint aviation investigation teams and joint aviation intelligence groups. We will be consulting the states and territories closely in implementing these reforms. On 9 February this year, the Prime Minister announced a series of measures to strengthen international and domestic aviation security totalling $200 million over four years. The government will provide $17.8 million to increase the number of firearms and explosive detection dogs at major international airports by 50 per cent. The government will provide $12.3 million in 2010-11 to maintain the AFP presence at major airports. $24.9 million will be provided to Customs and Border Protection to undertake a further phase of the Enhanced Passenger Assessment and Clearance (EPAC) Program. This will enable Customs to assess a larger number of passengers earlier and faster and share relevant data with intelligence, border management and law enforcement agencies in relation to visa applications and passenger risk assessment and response. $11.4 million is to be provided for advanced data analysis and risk profiling to better identify and alert intelligence agencies of visa applicants who may present a national security risk. A total of $54.2 million is being provided to assist industry to install cargo X-ray screening and explosive trace detection at selected locations; and $32 million is being provided to bring forward screening at a number of regional airports. The government will provide $28.5 million to assist the industry to introduce a range of new screening technologies at passenger screening points. It will also provide $18.2 million to strengthen engagement and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. As well as this series of measures, the government announced in this year's federal budget it will provide $759.4 million for policing at Australian airports over four years. The funding supports the AFP presence at Australia's 11 major airports, intelligence gathering and investigation capability, the AFP's regional rapid deployment capacity and the air security officer program. Legal framework The Aviation Crimes and Policing Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 builds on these initiatives by modernising the laws relevant to aviation and airports, to provide necessary deterrence, penalties and powers. Clear, effective and strong laws are a key element of airport security. These laws apply to a critical sector society and our economy. Last year, for example, 33 million passengers moved through Sydney airport-where thousands of people work-and more than 24 million people passed through Tullamarine airport in Melbourne. The Australian Federal Police and other agencies continue to meet complex challenges and threats within the aviation environment. To do their work effectively, the AFP need to be supported by appropriate laws that provide deterrence and recognise the gravity of aviation-related crimes. The Aviation Crimes and Policing Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 has three components. First, increased penalties are proposed for a number of offences in the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991. Second, the bill creates three new aviation related offences and an associated updating of a definition. Third, amendments are proposed to ensure that existing policing powers are available in the airport environment. I will detail each of these components in turn. Aviation Crimes-Increased penalties The first component of the bill concerns penalties. Earlier this year the Attorney General's Department reviewed the Crimes (Aviation) Act, which is now 19 years old. The act contains offences directed against aircraft and airports. It became clear that there are a number of penalties in the act that do not reflect the seriousness of these offences. For example, under the Criminal Code, a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment could apply to a person who is found guilty of making threats to contaminate goods. In comparison, under the existing provisions in of our the Crimes (Aviation) Act, a person who makes a bomb threat could only be imprisoned for a maximum of two years. This is a very low penalty, given the very serious disruption and potential danger that such hoaxes can create, for example, if a flight is redirected as a result or if an airport has to be evacuated. Under the amendments in this bill, the penalties in the act will now fall within four tiers. The severity of the penalty in each tier corresponds with the type of offence falling within each tier. Life imprisonment (tier 1), the most severe maximum penalty, will continue to apply to offences such as hijacking or destroying an aircraft while it is in flight. The attempted terrorist bombing of the American flight NW253 would have fallen within this tier if it had occurred on an Australian interstate or overseas flight. A maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment (tier 2) will apply to very serious offences that pose danger or cause harm to whole groups of people, such as endangering an aircraft while in flight. The offences in this tier have had their maximum penalties raised from either seven, 14 or 15 years. For example, assaulting a pilot, thereby impairing the operation of an aircraft, will now carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, rather than the 14 years it rently carries. Endangering the safety of an aircraft on an interstate flight, for example, by attempting to seize control of the aircraft, would carry a 20-year penalty, not seven years. A maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment (tier 3) would apply to offences that are generally against aircraft or aviation environments, such as disrupting a major airport or destroying its facilities, which currently carry maximum penalties of seven or 10 years. For example, damaging the runway or air traffic control facilities at Sydney airport would carry a maximum 14 years imprisonment rather than the current seven or 10 depending on the circumstances. Imprisonment for up to 10 years (tier 4) would apply to offences such as hoaxes and taking control of an aircraft which currently carry maximum penalties of two and 10 years respectively. For example, making a bomb threat to an airport would constitute an offence that would carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Determination of the proposed penalty for each offence has been undertaken in line with considerations spelt out in the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers. Details of the relevant benchmarks against which each penalty in the act have been set are in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. The second component of the bill concerns new offences and definitions. The bill inserts three new offences into the Crimes (Aviation) Act. These new offences are designed to cover gaps that existed in the coverage of the existing offences. There will be a new offence of assaulting an aircraft crew member. This offence will cur- carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. While there is already an offence in the act directed against the assault of a crew member, it can only be applied if the prosecution can prove that the assault has impeded the operation of the aircraft. The new offence provision will not require this. This offence has been particularly welcomed by the aviation sector during consultations with them. There will be a new offence directed against the reckless endangerment of the safety of an aircraft which is likely to cause death or serious harm. This offence will carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. This offence builds on the existing offence contained in the act of endangering an aircraft. The new offence, however, deals with more serious actions, and where the effect of the act in question is a likelihood of causing death or serious harm. Firing a weapon on board an aircraft would come within this offence, even if no-one was hit. The final new offence concerns possessing dangerous goods on board an aircraft which are likely to endanger life or cause serious harm. There is currently an offence concerning dangerous goods but not one where the effect is likely to endanger life or cause serious harm. The penalty for this offence is consistent with other provisions where the risk of serious harm can be shown. The bill also updates the definition of ‘Commonwealth aerodrome' in the Crimes (Aviation) Act to replace a repealed crossreference and to make clear the airports to which these offences in the act apply. Consultations have been held with key stakeholders on the amendments to the Crimes (Aviation) Act, including airlines, airports, state and territory governments, the Law Council of Australia and unions representing employees in the sector. The responses that have been received have been overwhelmingly supportive and welcoming of these measures that they are seen as an improvement to our existing aviation security regime. On 18 December 2009 the government announced a decision to accept the ‘Federal Audit of Police Capabilities' recommendation to move to an ‘all-in' policing model at Australia's eleven major airports. Under the ‘all-in' model, the AFP will become responsible for airport policing and security at 11 major airports, subject to the retention of mechanisms for close cooperation with state and territory police including joint airport investigation teams and joint airport intelligence groups. This new model will be implemented over a threeto five-year period in close consultalice tion and cooperation with the states and territhe tories. An ‘all-in' model led by the Australian Federal Police will provide a nationally integrated airport-policing service and a continued counter-terrorism first-response capability at our major airports. This bill contains amendments that support the move towards an ‘all-in' policing and security model. It amends two acts-the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 and the Australian Federal Police Act 1979-that impact on the powers of AFP members to investigate offences when committed at certain airports. The amendments to the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act overcome a technical anomaly in the act that prevented the AFP from using some of their standard arrest and search powers for state offences that occur at the airports that are classified as Commonwealth places. For example, if a murder, assault or theft occurs at Sydney or Melbourne airport, this is a state offence that applies as Commonwealth law because these are Commonwealth places. These amendments will ensure standard AFP powers-such as arrest and search-are available in response. Handling of these cases is also governed by protocols between the Australian Federal Police and state and territory police. The amendment to the AFP Act removes doubt as to the legal basis for AFP members to be appointed as members or special constables of state and territory police forces. The bill also makes clear the legal basis for AFP members to be appointed as members of police forces or other law enforcement agencies of foreign countries. Conferral of special constable status is an important tool for cooperation between poforces, and gives a member of a force powers of another police force, subject to appropriate controls and accountabilities. The amendments make clear that AFP members can participate in these arrangements. Special arrangements will be required for Cairns airport, which is not a Commonwealth place, and this has been raised with the Queensland government. One aspect of these arrangements will be the continued capacity for AFP members to be sworn in as special constables of Queensland Policewhich the proposed AFP Act amendments will support. A possible second element of these arrangements would be for Queensland to legislate for AFP members to be able to access relevant powers-the government has written to the Queensland government to progress this idea. The government has moved to strengthen aviation security in Australia through changes to the arrangements that are in place, through the funding that is provided, and through cooperation with other countries, states and territories and the private sector. This bill represents a further strengthening of Australia's aviation security regime and will ensure that Australia's law enforcement agencies are supported in their work to meet the complex challenges of policing in the airport and aviation environment. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony Smith) adjourned. NA BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time.

12,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill strengthens law enforcement agencies' powers to gather, examine and use evidence to investigate and prevent the commission of criminal offences. It builds on measures in the two serious and organised crime acts passed by parliament earlier this year. Before I outline the specific measures in the bill, let me put these legislative changes in context. The Rudd government is taking concerted action to detect, disrupt and deter organised crime. Organised crime costs the Australian community an estimated $15 billion each year. As was recognised in the Prime Minister's first National Security Statement, it is also a significant national security threat. The government developed the first Organised Crime Strategic Framework to ensure law enforcement and intelligence agencies work better together to combat organised crime. The framework recognised that we must ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the powers they need to tackle the flexible, evolving and resilient organised criminal networks operating across state, territory and national borders. The bill enhances the powers available to the Australian Federal Police. It also provides the Australian Crime Commission chief executive officer with powers, similar to those of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, to deal appropriately with staff who engage in serious misconduct and corruption. ACC Act Amendments Dismissal powers Given the powers that ACC staff are able to exercise and the information that they have access to, it is important that this agency is able to effectively deal with any ACC staff member who engages in serious misconduct and corruption. This bill will amend the ACC Act to provide the ACC CEO with similar powers that the AFP commissioner has to deal with police who engage in serious misconduct and corruption. The proposed changes will combat instances where there has been a serious abuse of power, a serious dereliction of duty, or any other seriously reprehensible act by a staff member of the Australian Crime Commission. The changes are not designed to replace the usual Public Service processes for dealing with misconduct, but are only to be utilised in exceptional circumstances where the normal processes are not appropriate given the serious nature of the misconduct or corruption. This will ensure the ACC CEO is able to protect the reputation of the organisation and to properly deal with staff who threaten the ability of the ACC to carry out its key law enforcement functions. The bill will require the ACC CEO to report to the minister and the ACC board each time the new power is used. This will ensure that the minister and the board have an appropriate level of oversight of the use of the power by the Australian Crime Commission's chief executive officer. The making of the declaration will be a reviewable decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, to ensure the correct use of the power. The bill will also allow the ready lawfully intercepted telecommunications information in investigating members of staff alleged to have engaged in misconduct or corrupt behaviour. This also mirrors powers currently available to the AFP. Telecommunications interception warrants will still only be available for the investigation of a serious offence, which is generally an offence that carries a penalty of at least seven years' imprisonment. The amendments will only allow information already lawfully obtained in the course of investigating a ous offence to be used to investigate conduct of a member of the staff of the ACC if it is also relevant for that purpose. The bill requires the government to review these new provisions after two years of operation to ensure they have operated as the government intended, to allow the CEO of the ACC to deal appropriately with the most serious cases of misconduct and corruption. ACC Examiners The bill will also amend the ACC Act to allow for the appointment of part-time examiners, consistent with the Organised Crime Strategic Framework goal of ensuring law enforcement agencies are appropriately equipped to carry out their tasks. The ACC currently has four full-time examiners. However, the need for an examiner can fluctuate depending on the status of a particular investigation or operation. As a result, the need for examiners cannot be estimated with any certainty. The appointment of both full-time and part-time examiners will allow for greater flexibility in the appointment and utilisation of examiners and ensure the ACC can approach examinations in a more strategic way. The amendments will also ensure broader geographic cover of examiners as part-time examiners could be appointed in different ACC to use alregions of Australia. The amendments also include appropriate safeguards to guard against any conflicts that may arise between a person's role as an examiner and other employment they may engage in. Crimes Act amendments The bill will also improve the ability of law enforcement officials to gather and examine evidence in light of rapid technological advancements. The bill includes a number of amendments to address operational seriimpediments identified by the Australian the mis- Federal Police. Searches of persons under warrant The Commonwealth has comprehensive provisions in place to enable effective and efficient searches of electronic equipment found during searches of premises such as a house or office under warrant. To address the increasing availability and use of portable electronic and data storage devices such as laptop computers, mobile phones and USB drives, the bill includes amendments to help police deal effectively with these items if they are located during a search of a person under a warrant. A key improvement will be the ability to seek an order from a magistrate requiring a person to assist with accessing data from equipment moved or seized under a warrant in relation to a person. For example, were investigating online child pornography, they could apply for an order requiring a suspect to provide their password or assist with transforming encrypted data into an intelligible form. Data may only be accessed to determine whether it constitutes evidential material. Orders The bill will also ensure that a seized item or document produced under the Crimes Act does not need to be returned if it would be likely to be used in the commission of a terrorist act, a terrorism offence or a serious offence. The bill will empower magistrates to make orders preventing the return of such items or documents in limited circumstances. Such orders can currently only be made for items seized under terrorism related stop and search powers in the Crimes Act. These amendments will ensure the Crimes Act deals consistently with all items seized and documents produced. The bill also improves safeguards relating to orders in relation to seized things and documents produced. Before applying for an order, an officer will be required to take reasonable steps to discover who has an interest in the thing or document and notify them of the proposed application. The magistrate must then allow a person with an interest to appear and be heard in determining the application. Fingerprint and photograph amendments The bill will also amend the Crimes Act to provide the Australian Federal Police with a standing power to take fingerprints and photographs of persons in lawful custody. This will bring the Commonwealth into line with the majority of the states and territories by allowing the AFP to take fingerprints and photographs as part of the process of dealing if police with an arrested person. The amendments will provide police with an efficient and reliable way of confirming the identity of suspects to assist in the management of suspects and offenders. It will also improve processes for establishing and maintaining records of arrested persons, which will in turn ensure that these records are admissible in court proceedings. The amendments will only apply where the person has been arrested in relation to an offence that is punishable by a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. This will ensure that fingerprints or photographs can only be taken in relation to offences which are generally considered to be serious or indictable and not in relation to minor offences. Existing protections in the Crimes Act will continue to cover arrested persons, including provisions that ensure that the taking of identification material is properly authorised and that any material taken is destroyed if the person is not charged with an offence. These amendments will not apply to other forms of identification material such as DNA. AFP Special Payments The bill will also amend the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to allow the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to authorise a payment in special circumstances that arise out of, or relate to, a person's engagement as an AFP employee. For example, where an AFP member is injured in the course of work while deployed overseas, the AFP Commissioner would be able to authorise the payment of costs involved in the spouse travelling overseas for such a purpose. The commissioner would also authorise a payment to the family of an AFP member who dies in the course of work. This amendment will bring the AFP into line with the Commonwealth Public Service, and would avoid the delays presently faced by AFP employees when applying for payments. Payments under the new AFP provision would be subject to the same conditions and limits as those authorised under the Public Service Act provision. Specifically, the payments would be limited to $100,000, and would be subject to any conditions attached by the AFP Commissioner. Conclusion The reforms in this bill reflect the government's continuing commitment to strengthening our agencies' capabilities to fight serious and organised crime. This bill builds on a range of measures the government has already implemented to prevent, disrupt and investigate organised criminal activity. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony Smith) adjourned. NA",41
13,Mr ALBANESE,STANDING AND SESSIONAL ORDERS,"I move: That standing order 4 be amended as follows: (1) After “When Parliament first meets after a general election, the procedure shall be as follows:” insert: “(a) Local Indigenous people shall be invited to conduct a ceremony of welcome prior to Members assembling in the House of Representatives.” (2) That paragraphs (a) to (i) be renumbered as paragraphs (b) to (j). I am pleased to move this amendment to the standing orders today and to speak on this amendment. This amendment seeks to amend the standing orders to formalise the inclusion of an Indigenous welcome to country ceremony at the first meeting of a new parliament after a general election. This amendment represents the government's implementation of recommendations made to it in an inquiry by the Procedure Committee. The Rudd Labor government is committed to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to progress reconciliation, and it is a key element of the government's objective of closing the gap in Indigenous disadvantage. The Rudd Labor government has invested in measures to support this commitment and reset the relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Rudd government's commitment was shown when, in February 2008, as the first order of government business in the 42nd Parliament, the Prime Minister apologised to Australia's Indigenous people for the treatment they received as a result of policies of previous federal governments. I note that the then Leader of the Opposition, the former member for Bradfield, Brendan Nelson, joined with the Prime Minister in that apology. On 20 December 2007, even before the first sitting of this parliament, the Prime Minister and the government began work which was directed towards reducing Indigenous disadvantage when the Council of Australian Governments agreed to important Closing the Gap targets. These include: within five years, all Indigenous four-yearolds in remote Indigenous communities having access to a quality early childhood education program; within the decade, halving the gap in infant mortality, halving the gap reading, writing and numeracy achievements by Indigenous children, and halving the gap in employment outcomes for Indigenous Australians; and, within a generation, at least halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2015, and closing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. With the leadership of the Prime Minister, these important targets were agreed upon to ensure that all governments are held to account for the progress and achievement of these goals. Since the agreement of the COAG targets and the national apology, all Australian governments have committed more than $4.6 billion in health, housing, early childhood and economic participation funding to achieve these goals. The government has made progress. As at 11 June 2010, 100 houses have been completed under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing across Australia. A further 316 are underway, with an additional 422 refurbishments of existing homes in poor condition. By April 2010, nine new creches had been constructed in the Northern Territory, including at Lajamanu, Peppimenarti, Robinson River, Areyonga, Docker River, Papunya and Yarralin. Fifty-four child and maternal health services have been approved for funding, of which 46 are in operation. The Remote Air Services Subsidy Scheme is ensuring access for remote communities to these vital services. Last year, as a result of extensive consultation with more than 100 remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory about the redesign of the Northern Territory Emergency Response, the Rudd government introduced legislation to the parliament to reindo state the Racial Discrimination Act in the Northern Territory, which had been suspended by the Howard government. I am in pleased to say that this legislation has now carried the parliament. In the 2009-10 budget the Rudd government provided $10.8 million for the continued operation of Reconciliation Australia, to promote respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Reconciliation Australia leads community-level education and awareness about reconciliation, and encourages commitment to reconciliation at the corporate, school, organisational and individual levels. Additionally, the Reconciliation Action Plan program has been particularly successful amongst these sectors, with over 300 organisations signing on each year and commitments of around 2,000 new jobs for Indigenous people. Being welcomed onto country by traditional owners is now acknowledged as an important gesture by many Australians. The Rudd government was pleased to have a welcome to country to open this parliament. That event received bipartisan support. This change to standing orders has bipartisan support. It is an important gesture to Indigenous Australians to acknowledge what is the oldest living culture on the planet. It is a matter of respect and it is something that should give pride to all Australians. We were indeed very proud to be members of the House of Representatives when the Prime Minister delivered the national apology on behalf of all Australians. This resolution will ensure that welcome to country has a formal place in the opening of all future parliaments, and I commend the motion the House.  tion Business) (10.46 am)-I will not delay the valedictory speech of the member for Chifley unnecessarily, suffice to say the opposition will not be opposing this motion. I make a couple of points. Firstly, it is quite unnecessary to include welcome to country in the standing orders as part of the opening of the parliament. As the Leader of the House mentioned, a welcome to country ceremony formed a part of the opening of this parliament, and it is a matter for the government how the ceremony for the opening of parliament should be conducted. Therefore, it is quite unnecessary to include it in the standing orders. It is the prerogative of the government to alter the standing orders if it so wishes, and to include matters that it thinks are important. That is what is happening with this particular motion. The opposition does not raise any objection to this, but we would also make the point that, while the Leader of the House said that this was part of the important task of bridging the gap, I do not believe, and nor would many members of the opposition, that a welcoming ceremony at the opening of parliament will make the slightest difference to the health, education, employment, housing or welfare outcomes of Indigenous Australians. Given the circumstances, and that it is the prerogative of the government to introduce such a measure, we certainly would not be churlish enough to oppose it. We do not believe it will make any difference to the outcomes for Indigenous Australians in this country, but we are quite prepared to see it passed. Question agreed to.

17,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Before calling the member for Chifley, I understand it is the wish of the House that there should be no points of order taken during his contribution.  by thanking my family, who are in the gallery today. To my wife, Robyn: thank you for all your love and support and bringing our children up single-handedly! You have always been my rock and the love of my life. I appreciate that I have over 25 years worth of accumulated jobs to do around the house, but I beg of you not all in one year! To our wonderful children, Michelle, Stephanie, Ben and Courtney and their partners, Jason, Scott and Katie: I cannot sufficiently convey the depth of joy and pride you inspire in us as your parents. Robyn and I are blessed to have wonderful grandchildren. To Kayleigh, Blake, Ellie, Braydon, Declan, Lachlan, Cody and Nathan, who could not be here: you are the light of our lives. I also thank my mum, who is at St Hedwig's home, and my late father, who may have been somewhat eccentric-this may go some way towards explaining my own behaviour! I used to joke that I had my in-laws about as close as I wanted them in Perth, Western Australia, but I very much miss Ruth and Jim Moloney, who have passed on. Our families exaggerate our successes, cushion our disappointments and often unfairly bear the brunt of any adverse publicity. Where and what would we be without them? Our staff make us look better than we really are. I have too many to be able to name them here, but in my electorate I thank Rose Maccarone, David Field, Nicole Seniloli and Barbara Williams. Barbara has been with me for 10 years. I also thank all my former staff. In Canberra I thank Anna George-who everyone knows runs the show-Joy Brogan and Matthew Tredwell. The whip's office can sometimes get a little willing, and Anna is a sea of calm. Anna is a magnet for the caucus children, and I sometimes wonder how we get any work done at all! I have worked very closely with Jill Hall throughout my time as whip, and she has provided me with invaluable advice and support on a whole range of issues. I also thank Michael Danby, who was our deputy whip when we were in opposition, and Chris Hayes, who is our deputy whip in government. We have been a whips team. Jill and Chris run the second chamber, still confusingly called the Main Committee, and I thank them and their staff. It has been a privilege to serve the caucus and leader as Chief Government Whip. As Chief Opposition Whip you work closely with the Manager of Opposition Business, and as Chief Government Whip you work closely with the Leader of the House. I thank Julia Gillard in her former role as Manager of Opposition Business and especially her successor in government, Anthony Albanese, for the opportunity to work closely with them. I thought Anthony and I made a pretty good team as leader and whip. I also mention Jo Haylen, his right-hand person. I very much enjoyed working with Kim Beazley when he was leader again in 2005. I commend the Leader of the House for moving on the very first sitting day of this government the motion to provide proxy voting by the chief whips for nursing mothers who are members of parliament. If anything denotes the change in this parliament since its inception as an old men's club, it is this resolution. I also thank Henry Thomson, the PLO, and his team. They seamlessly keep the legislation flowing into the chamber as well as to the occasional minister! I thank my counterparts, Kerry Bartlett and now Alex Somlyay. Whips constantly make handshake agreements and our word is our bond. We also deal with the human side of the parliament and face common challenges. When I was first elected in 1984 the parliament had been expanded. New temporary accommodation had been provided in the rose gardens with the building of a covered walkway. This was intended for the new members, of whom I was one, but as these suites were considerably larger than the dog boxes in Old Parliament House they were snapped up by the more senior members. It was my first brush with seniority, but I have always been pleased that I spent some time in the old parliament building. The flashiest bit of equipment members were provided with was an electric IBM typewriter. But I was determined to be ahead of the game and brought in my apple 2E computer, which had about as much memory as a modern day calculator. I eventually bought an interface for about $1,000 to connect the computer to the electric typewriter. This allowed me to produce about 300 letters at a time, which took a couple of days and produced a wondrous noise throughout. I used my computer for the Bass by-election when Neville Wran resigned and happily got the result out ahead of time. Unfortunately, though, we lost the seat of Bass in that by-election. Eventually we were provided with computers in both our electorate offices and Parliament House, although we had incompatible word-processing software. One of the word-processing packages was, by the way, called ‘whips'. Speaker Joan Child, as she then was, appointed me as the inaugural Chair of the Presiding Officers Information Technology Advisory Group and later the inaugural Chair of the Parliamentary Education Office Advisory Committee. Prior to entering parliament, I was employed by Telstra and had resisted the invitation to become involved in communications. That did not last long, and I was involved in a minor deregulation with John Saunderson and Knockers-Neil O'Keefewhile working for former Minister Gareth Evans. We were known as the gang of three. My job was to ensure that Knockers did not stray over to John, and I was mostly successful. In 1991, I was appointed to chair the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Telecommunications Reform, which comprised all sections of the industry. I was proud of the fact that we were able to achieve consensus and I wrote the industry paper. Kim Beazley sent me all around the country to address meetings of union delegates and the Western Australian state caucus. The experience was most character forming. I never did make the front bench but was appointed Bob Hawke's parliamentary secretary. It was not the happiest of times for Labor, but my appointment was an extraordinary privilege. When Paul Keating was elected Prime Minister, I was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, Robert Ray. Working in Defence was no doubt the happiest period of my career. The industry report we produced in record time was warmly welcomed, but I fear never implemented-perhaps because it was warmly welcomed! I have always enjoyed parliamentary committees, which generally reveal the best side of members of parliament, irrespective of their party affiliation. The first committee I ever chaired was the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which was somewhat ironic given that my parents were invited to withdraw me in 5th year-or year 12 today. It sounds so much nicer to say that, rather than that you were expelled. The restless years, which was about retention rates, and Student financial assistance were two reports I was proud of. For the latter report, we commissioned cartoons to enliven what could have been a somewhat turgid report. Two of the reports by the Defence Subcommittee I set great store on were From phantom to force, a radical report restructurWell, ing the Army, and that of the Military after next inquiry into officer training. Bronwyn Bishop still calls it ‘that dreadful Price report'. The Human Rights Subcommittee report on detention centres followed up on one by the Joint Committee on Migration, which did not contaminate their findings by interviewing detainees. The report caused a furious attack on coalition members of the committee by Minister Ruddock. It did lead to the closure of the notorious punishment Juliet Block at Port Hedland, whose existence the department had vigorously denied. I hope one day to see all the in camera evidence taken by the committee made public. I have been involved in a number of inquiries concerning child support and family law, and chaired one of them. Kevin Andrews and Belinda Neal served on that committee. We set up a hotline to the committee in my room manned by committee members and staff. The telephone traffic was so great that the stand-by PABX lit up like a Christmas tree and the trunk lines from WA were totally congested. We brought down an interim report, Thanks for listening, which was a common theme from all corners. It is important for members of parliament to see things for themselves and listen to views of their constituents. I have always tried to do that. Some time ago I was a recipient of some unexpected advice from an environmentalist in a letter dropped in my letter box:  What are you doing with the manure? It's good for your plants but bad for the people around the area to inhale the rotten smell & also polluting the environment, don't you know that it is damaging the ozone layer, you should know that. You are a politician with no brains. Why don't you get the manure and stick it right up your fat arse you stupid politician. naturally I did object to the use of the word ‘fat' and I thought the suggestion somewhat impractical. You are often asked what is your best achievement for your electorate. I would nominate the campaigns with Richard Amery MP and others to have a public senior high school firstly at St Marys and then at Mount Druitt, and the establishment of the University of Western Sydney after the then state Labor minister said we would never get one. I would describe myself and Con Sciacca as early adopters as far as the member for Griffith is concerned. I have been on an incredible journey to see him elected first as Leader of the Opposition and then in 2007 win the federal election against a formidable opponent. I would like to thank the PM and Therese for their friendship and for the opportunity to be a small part of the support team. The Rudd government has been a good one and I am in awe of the tremendous job that the Prime Minister and the team performed in getting Australia through the world economic crisis. I am chuffed at the tremendous impact Building the Education Revolution is having on government and non-government schools in my electorate. I was delighted that the last opening of the the parliament saw the first Indigenous welcome, which, given what the Leader of the House has just done, will be a part of every opening of the parliament, as well as the apology to the stolen generations. Both were highly emotionally charged and moving events. I could go on. We have a good ministry and a very talented backbench, none better in my opinion than the classes of 2004 and 2007. I need to thank my Chifley Labor Party members for their tremendous steadfast support, encouragement throughout my time and their forbearance when they did not agree with me. There are so many to thank but I mention Tom Kenny, secretary of the FEC, who has held that position for more years than I care to remember. I would also like to thank the community, who are proud and very direct people and who, in my opinion, are the salt of the earth. The Indigenous elders have been very kind to me. I cannot mention them all-Uncle Wes and Uncle Greg and Aunty Gloria and Aunty Mavis to mention just a few-but I thank them all. I thank the Holy Family parish and in particular Father Paul Hanna and Coral MCLean. You provided inspiration and a spiritual well which I dipped into frequently. I think I can have a glass of water now! I thank my group for the opportunities I have had and I thank Senator Forshaw as we have worked well together supporting each other for a long time. There are many people who assist us in our work-the cleaners, the gardeners, Comcar drivers, the clerks and officers of the liament-and I thank you all. I have spent the majority of my time in government and served under three Labor prime ministers, a rare privilege for a Labor member. They say if you want a friend in politics get a dog. I have formed friendships here but I will not out them-and I did it without acquiring a dog. As I bid you farewell I hope that I have left the odd footfall and fingerprint to signify that Price was here. If it is said that I was a good bloke, a good Labor man and a good member I am well satisfied. As a long chapter in my life draws to a close I face a new one undaunted. Thank you all for the journey. Debate (on motion by Mr Albanese) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.",47
18,Mrs MOYLAN,BUSINESS,"In continuation, the measures in the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 3) Bill 2010 apply to the most severely disabled people in the country. The one thing they and their families should be able to rely on is assistance from the Commonwealth and at least clear, unambiguous tax treatment of the one device available to assist families to make preparation for the future care of their dependants. The disability community has fought hard for change and has come to welcome any relief and assistance. Although this bill provides slight relief in the tax treatment of special disability trusts, it fails the test of clarity. Administration of the trusts is so complex, I have been told, that major trustee organisations such as Perpetual Trustees will not manage them. For instance, money can be parused from the fund for expenses related to the beneficiary's medical care but not for ordinary household maintenance. When put into practice, this means power bills cannot be paid from trust funds but recharging an electric wheelchair can, so the trustee must determine the precise individual power units used to charge a chair and contribute from the trust that exact amount to the power bill. As a concept, special disability trusts are a worthwhile vehicle for carers to ensure that their dependants have the care and accommodation they require to live their lives. But the criteria surrounding such trusts have made them complex and impractical. We must approach the subject with a renewed focus and keep foremost in this debate the individuals whose lives are affected. The bill before us will extend the allowable uses of trust funds to the maintenance of special disability trust properties, which will avert some of the problems, such as that just described, in administering the trusts. But there is a slight difference between a recommendation made by the Senate and the proposal in this bill. Recommendation 6 of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report advocates for a broader allowable application of funds, being day-today expenses which maximise the beneficiary's health, well-being, recreation and independence-not just their maintenance. The importance of this distinction is highlighted in a recent appeal by Mr Brian Broughton as trustee of his daughter's special disability trust. In evidence to the Security Appeals Tribunal, correspondence between Mr Broughton and Centrelink regarding authorised expenditure shows that Centrelink strictly applied the definition of maintenance costs. It raises the question: is the definition of maintenance wide enough to encompass positive changes to a special disability trust property that other homeowners can carry out? Can trust funds be used to create a garden or an extension that previously did not exist? It can be argued that such improvements would maximise the beneficiary's well-being or independence but strictly would not be maintenance as the items did not previously exist. Whether such a narrow view is adopted will largely depend on the guidelines issued to Centrelink as to what are accepted expenditures. As a matter of common sense, I would urge that the guidelines issued adopt the widest possible meaning. Related to recommendation 6 of the report is the government's intention to create a discretionary spending category. Up to $10,000 a year can be spent on any miscellaneous items for the beneficiary. In part, it circumvents the current prescriptive ‘allowable uses'. The change is welcome, but there appears to be no rationale for the limit. The Senate's recommendations do not mention any such limit. In fact, with recommendation 6 the Senate has essentially endorsed that any day-today expense, as long as it is constructive for the beneficiary, should be allowed. Flexibility to meet the needs of the beneficiary should remain core to the policy, and I worry that this arbitrary figure will constrain the beneficiary, especially as there is no mention of it being indexed. It is quite possible that the figure is designed to limit the potential losses in what would be a very rare case of a trustee misusing funds. The Social trustee's expenditure of SDT moneys, though, is overseen by Centrelink, with, as I understand it, comprehensive audits at least once a year. The potential for misuse of funds is minimal. Flexibility for a trustee to expend funds to care for the beneficiary in the manner they believe best should outweigh the unlikely possibility of abuse. The government should ensure that the $10,000 cap is at least indexed, or increased, if not entirely removed. Taxation of the trust's income is another area of discontent. Ray Walter, a passionate campaigner for disability equality, points out that all funds contributed to the trust by family members are after tax. He contends that taxing the money again is simply double dipping. The intention of the fund is to maximise its growth to cover the ever increasing cost of health care and living expenses, relieving the public purse. Stunting the trust's growth through taxing already taxed money is antithetical to its concept. Exempting SDTs from tax, at least until after the winding up of the trust following the death of the beneficiary, would certainly help the long-term growth of funds. Currently, funds distributed to the beneficiary are taxed at the applicable marginal rate, and unexpended income retained by the trust is taxed at 46.5 per cent. The current model has been rightly recognised as too harsh, and the report recommended that unexpended income should be taxed at the individual's marginal tax rate. The concept of taxing unexpended trust funds at a marginal rate has been widely endorsed, but the mechanics of bringing about this change have created a great deal of uncertainty. A discussion paper released by Treasury on taxing special disability trusts details proposed methodology of assessing both the individual and the trust's tax. First, the net income of the trust, whether expended or not, is worked out at the appropriate marginal rate. This is payable by the trustee. Then the individual combines any personal income with the net trust income and claims an offset for the tax payable by the trust. When the tax-free threshold is factored in, plus other low-income offsets, the situation becomes more confusing. To make matters worse, only the first of the discussion papers actually computed the amount of tax payable, albeit in a puzzling manner. The discussion papers released since do not work out the actual tax payable or even mention tax-free thresholds. Example workings from my office have been sent to Treasury in an effort determine how the tax will actually apply. Frankly, we are unsure whether the individual will be burdened by more tax or the situation will be improved. But perhaps the most devastating financial pitfall of the trust is the application of capital gains tax. A trust may purchase a property for the beneficiary to live in, but, if the property is found to be unsuitable and sold, the beneficiary's principal place of residence is subject to capital gains tax, as it is held in the trust. Bear in mind that these are the most disabled people in our community, who in most cases cannot manage their own affairs. Even transferring a property into a trust exposes the transferrer to capital gains. A potent example is that of Kevin and Olive MCGarry, living in Kardinya in WA. The couple previously purchased a property for their disabled daughter to live in when the time came that they could no longer care for her. The self-funded retirees have been hit by the global financial crisis and need income support. But, as the second house the intended for their daughter is held in their names, they exceed the asset test and are ineligible for financial assistance. Transferring the property to a disability trust for their daughter would allow Kevin and Olive to claim support so they can meet their own day-today needs, but it would also leave them with a liability to pay $45,000 in capital gains tax-a bill they cannot afford. To get by, the option they are faced with is selling the home so they can diligently invest for their daughter's future. The MCGarry's situation is not the only example. Mr O'Hart, also from WA, bought a property, in his name and his wife's name in 1988, for their severely disabled daughter to live in. To transfer that property into a special disability trust, an accountant has to calculated that Brian and Jean O'Hart will both be liable to pay over $63,000 in capital gains tax-a total of more than $126,000-to simply swap a name. Brian and Jean are self-funded retirees. The cost of transferring the property is prohibitive. But they are extremely worried about ensuring their daughter has appropriate accommodation in the future. Affected trustees and family members of disabled individuals have described the situation to me as perverse and unfathomable. The Building trust report specifically mentions the adverse application of capital gains tax. Recommendation 5 calls for a property transferred into a special disability trust to be exempt from capital gains. I echo the words of Ray and Wendy Walter in their submission to the inquiry, where they ask: Do you believe it is fair, just and reasonable that some people with disabilities have been gled out to be the only members of our community to pay Capital Gains Tax on the sale place of residence? The reforms before this House today represent only a handful of the changes that carers and trustees have been calling for. In its report, the Senate highlights a number of further areas in need of reform. Recommendation 8, for example, calls for the first home owner grant to be applicable to properties bought by a special disability trust. As many beneficiaries have no testamentary capacity due to their disability, they are unable to purchase a property in their own name and therefore are unable to receive the grant. Allowing first home owner grants to be extended to beneficiaries would remedy the inequality. But so far no indication has been given that this will be pursued. As I said in my speech at the beginning last night, this is positively discriminating against people with a disability, and I think it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Similarly, special disability trust beneficiaries are not eligible for other benefits afforded to first home buyers, such as home saving accounts. Although not specifically mentioned in the Senate recommendations, there is no reason why people with a disability should be excluded from these measures simply because the money is held in a trust. Special disability trusts were envisaged to help the beneficiary, and I do not think it was ever intended that they should exclude measures available to those in the wider community without a disability. Recommendation 7 of the Senate report also calls for unexpended funds from the special disability trusts to be able to be contributed towards superannuation. The recommendation does not suggest the measure to be mandatory, giving trustees the flexibility to determine whether it is suitable for the individual's circumstances. We should find a sin- way to accommodate ways so that people with a disability can contribute to their suof their perannuation through the trust system. In closing, I would like to recite the words of Ray and Wendy Walter, from their submission to the Senate inquiry. They say: Working together we believe we can find the best possible solutions to provide a better quality of life for those members of the community with a disability. The removal of the barriers … we believe can be done at little … cost to the Commonwealth and would be a huge step forward … bringing hope and providing some peace of mind to families who can see little light at the end of a very darktunnel … I look forward to working with my colleagues in this House to promote greater changes for the benefit of people with a disability.

19,Mr SHORTEN,BUSINESS,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (11.20 am)-First of all I would like to thank those members who contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 3) Bill 2010. In particular I appreciate the contribution of the member for Pearce. The amendments contained in schedule 1 will freeze indexation of the superannuation co-contribution income thresholds for a period of two years. They will also permanently maintain the co-contribution matching rate at 100 per cent and the maximum co-contribution payable at $1,000. These changes will generate budgetary savings while at the same time maintaining a generous dollar-for-dollar incentive for lowto middle-income individuals to make additional voluntary contributions to superannuation. These changes should also be seen in the context of the new low-income earners government contribution, which will directly boost the retirement savings of individuals on incomes of up to $37,000 through a contribution of up to $500. Schedule 2 amends division 820 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to adjust the thin capitalisation calculations for authorised deposit-taking institutions. In January 2005 Australia amended its accounting standards by adopting the Australian equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standards. This had flow-on tax and prudential consequences for authorised deposit-taking institutions. Transitional provisions have applied to insulate authorised deposit-taking institutions' thin capitalisation calculations from these changes by allowing such entities to elect to use the accounting standards that applied immediately before January 2005. These amendments effectively continue that transitional treatment for three types of assets. They are treasury shares, the business insurance asset known as the EMVONA asset, which is the excess market value over net assets, and capitalised software costs. This measure formed part of the government's 2009-10 budget announcement and achieves the government's specific objective of clarifying the operation of the law in this area and more generally reducing compliance costs and improving the tax law. Schedule 4 amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to empower the Director General of Security and the Director-General of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to declare that Commonwealth tax laws do not apply to specified transactions in relation to specified entities if they are satisfied that is necessary for the proper performance of their agency's functions. These amendments remove the possibility of conflicts arising between Australia's national security interests and obligations imposed by Commonwealth tax laws. A declaration has the effect of preventing tax liabilities, obligations and benefits from applying in relation to the specified transactions. Therefore, there will be no obligation to provide information about those transactions to the tax authorities and no requirement for tax authorities to seek that information. Consequently, information that bears on the operational activities of Australia's security and intelligence agencies will not be disclosed. Exercise of this power will, of course, be overseen and validated by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who will report on an annual basis to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The amendments in schedule 4 deliver on the government's commitment to help support people with severe disabilities, their families and carers. This measure will help families and carers to provide financially for the care and accommodation needs of people with a severe disability. Under the new arrangements, the unexpended income of a special disability trust is taxed at the principal beneficiary's personal tax rate rather than automatically at the top personal tax rate plus the Medicare levy. These amendments are part of the government's broader response to the treatment of special disability trusts. I note that the member for Pearce was talking on a range of matters concerning this legislation, not all to do immediately with this schedule but to do with her general concerns that not enough is being done to improve the operation of special disability trusts. I personally have some sympathy for her observations, and I thank her for her contributions in the past to improve the workings of these operations. I also note that she wrote to the Walter family, and I too thank the Walter family for the work they have done. I recognise that more needs to be done in this area to improve the operation overall of special disability trusts. However, some of the other parts of the government's response include broadening the eligibility requirements for beneficiaries, extending the allowable uses for the trust and granting a capital gains tax exemption for main residences. With these measures we want to make it easier for parents, friends and carers to support a person with a disability. We are aware of the enormous burden carried by families and carers in this country and how heavily our social obligation to care for people with a disability falls upon this dedicated group. Carers, particularly those who look after an adult child with a disability, are often described as ‘saints' or with phrase ‘I don't know how they do it'. I would like to suggest that they are not saints. They are just ordinary people who do an amazing job out of a DNA-hardwired love and out of the knowledge that, if they do not do it, it will not get done. This government has increased the amount it pays to carers, but I acknowledge that this is still just an early improvement and that the desperation and need is still out there. In fact, the 2005 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare analysis of the Commonwealth, State and Territory Disability Agreement funded services revealed a high level of unmet need. Noting that its estimate of community access to services was conservative, the analysis found that unmet need for accommodation and respite services was 23,800 people and unmet demand for community access services was 3,700 people. I do believe that they are conservative numbers. I also believe that it is appropriate to continue to try and improve the operation of special disability trusts to reward people who choose or who have the capacity to invest in the future of their adult child with severe or profound disabilities and that action in itself actually supports the distribution of the remaining funds available for disability services to those whose families are not in the same position to assist their loved ones themselves. The vast reservoir of goodwill and love possessed by carers has helped Australia cope up until now, but I do recognise that there is a limit to human endurance. There are 1.5 million people in Australia with a severe or profound disability and there are nearly 500,000 people who are full-time carers of a person with a disability. Demographers predict that the number of people with disability will rise to 2.3 million by 2030, while the number of carers drops. Our current systems are a scattered patchwork and the are too often constrained by rationed budgets rather than the actual needs in the community. I recognise the work of the previous government and former Minister Patterson in creating special disability trusts, but this government did also recognise upon election to office that the take-up had been very small. We have made some modest changes, which were the source of considerable debate, and the schedule will reflect some of those changes. I also happen to believe that a national disability insurance scheme, which the Rudd government has asked the Productivity Commission to investigate, may offer the hope for a better system which intervenes earlier, which provides services when they are needed and which gives long-term certainty to parents and carers of a person with a disability. That anxiety which ageing carers and parents face of wondering who will look after their adult child with significant needs is not a question which can be satisfactorily answered at this stage by the nation. We are currently spending, at all levels of government, over $22 billion on disability services, payments to carers and the Disability Support Pension. I do not believe that we are getting sufficient value for the money. We are paying a lot of money for an inefficient system. Whilst I do not believe that amount of money should be reduced, I do believe we can do better with it. We need to see whether more timely interventions can be made to improve the quality of the lives of people with a disability and their families. It will up to the Productivity Commission to independently crunch the numbers on this scheme to see whether it is indeed feasible or possible, but I do believe the principle of some kind of insurance scheme for people with a disability is the best chance. We have to improve a system that will provide real support for the growing number of people with disability in this country. Of course a disability trust, as I have said earlier, is not an appropriate solution for all families but, for those who can take advantage of them, this bill is important. One of the most difficult aspects, as I have said, for a parent who is caring for an adult child with a serious developmental delay is not knowing what will happen to their child, whom they love, when the carer dies or when the carer is no longer able to provide the care required. It is not to our credit as a nation that we cannot guarantee the answer to that question. To make it easier for families to provide some stability and some certainty for the future through a disability trust is one of the good things which is achieved by this bill. We will certainly study very carefully the contribution of the member for Pearce and those families who have worked hard to improve the operation of the special disability trust to see what further work is required. Turning to schedule 5, it amends the definition of a managed investment trust, or MIT, to more closely align the definition of withholding tax with the definition of the MIT capital account treatment. This measure extends the definition of an MIT to cover certain wholesale managed investment schemes and government owned managed investment schemes, commonly referred to as wholesale funds. The definition will apply for the purposes of the MIT capital account election rules recently passed by this parliament. The amendments will ensure that the rules apply appropriately to both retail funds be and wholesale funds that are widely held collective investment vehicles undertaking passive investments while ensuring that any changes to the definition for withholding tax purposes do not unfairly disadvantage existing investors and funds. These amendments will support the Australian funds management industry by limiting the operation of the MIT withholding tax rules to funds that carry out their investment management activities in Australia. The changes made by this schedule are in line with the government's objective to secure Australia's position as a pre-eminent financial services centre. This bill deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",53

(2) The trust is a managed investment trust in relation to the income year if: (a) the trust is a managed investment trust (within the meaning of section 12-400 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 immediately before the commencement of this Schedule) in relation to the income year; and (b) in relation to an income year starting before 26 May 2010, the trust: (i) was a managed investment trust (within that meaning); or (ii) would have been a managed investment trust (within that meaning) if the trustee of the trust had made the first fund payment in relation to the income year in that income year and before 26 May 2010. (20) Schedule 5, page 21 (after line 12), at the end of the Schedule, after proposed item 7, add: 8 Transitional-substituted accounting periods (1) This item applies if the first income year mentioned in subitem 6(1) starts after the first 1 July after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent. (2) For the purposes of working out liabilities to pay amounts in accordance with Subdivision 840-M of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, apply the following rules: (a) treat the income year of an entity (the actual income year) ending immediately before that first income year as being the following 2 income years of the entity: (i) an income year (the first notional income year) that starts at the start of the actual income year and ends immediately before that 1 July; (ii) an income year (the second notional income year) that starts on that 1 July and ends at the end of the actual income year; (b) do not apply the amendments made by this Schedule in determining whether the entity is a managed investment trust in relation to the first notional income year; (c) apply the amendments made by this Schedule in determining whether the entity is a managed investment trust in relation to the second notional come year; (d) for the purposes of determining rates of taxation applicable for the purposes of that Subdivision, treat the first notional income year and the second notional income year as both being the income year following the first income year mentioned in subparagraph 4(1)(a)(i) of the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Act 2008. These amendments will deliver more certainty around the definition of a managed investment trust by clarifying the operation of the rules, taking into account general financial sector industry practice. Doing so will advance the government's commitment to secure Australia's place as a leading financial services centre in the region and more generally improve the competitiveness of the Australian funds management industry by making the reduced withholding tax rates available on distributions from a wider range of funds. These changes will ensure that, while continuing to attract and retain foreign capital, the Australian funds management industry will continue to be supported and enhanced. This objective is achieved through a number of targeted amendments. Firstly, a substantial proportion of the investment management activities undertaken in relation to the assets of the fund connected with Australia are now required to be carried out in Australia. That is in amendment 1. Secondly, amendments (2), (5), (7), (8), (13), (14) and (15) expand the widely held rules for registered trusts to more appropriately recognise the nature of certain widely held members, including through reducing the wholesale member requirement from 30 to 25 wholesale members for wholesale trusts. These changes will better reflect industry practices. Amendment 11 expands the list of entities in- considered to be widely held, including foreign pension plans, sovereign wealth funds and certain government agencies, and widely held foreign equivalents of a managed investment scheme. A regulation-making power has been included to provide for further expansion of the list if warranted. Furthermore, a start-up period of 18 months is provided, during which a trust may be treated as a managed investment trust prior to meeting the widely held requirements in amendment 4. This extended period more appropriately facilitates new trusts to enter the managed investment industry without suffering a competitive disadvantage. Finally, the transitional rules have been significantly enhanced in a number of ways, including extending its period of application to seven years. That is in amendments (16) to (20).

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (FOREIGN SOURCE INCOME DEFERRAL) BILL (No. 1) 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Dr Emerson: That this bill be now read a second time.",62
22,Ms LEY,BUSINESS,"I am pleased to talk on the Tax Laws Amendment (Foreign Source Income Deferral) Bill (No. 1) 2010. This bill concerns the foreign investment fund measures of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The FIF measures, as they are called, are one of three components of the accruals taxation system, which has as its broad objective to tax Australian residents on an accruals basis on their share of income derived by certain foreign entities-income which has not been comparably taxed in an offshore jurisdiction. The three parts of the accruals taxation system are the controlled foreign company, or CFC, rules; the transferor trust measure; and the foreign investment fund measures about which this bill is concerned. The FIF measures are designed to counter tax avoidance opportunities that remained after the earlier introduction of the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. So they were the third measure implemented. The FIF measures apply where a foreign company or trust, though not controlled by Australian residents, is an attractive investment vehicle because it allows for the accumulation of income offshore in lowtax or tax-free countries, thereby allowing the investor to minimise or to defer payment of Australian tax. The FIF measures also apply to Australian residents who have invested offshore in life bonds or life policies that have an investment component. So these measures apply to Australian residents who have an interest in a foreign company or trust at the end of a year of income and those who held a foreign life assurance policy at any time in the income year. There are a large number of exceptions to the foreign investment fund measures. That describes the measures in general. Turning to this bill in particular, it implements changes to the FIF rules and the deemed present entitlement rules. These changes were announced by the government in the 2009-10 budget on 12 May 2009. I should note that the legislation before the House follows on from initiatives of the previous coalition government and therefore explain at the outset that we see this as entirely noncontroversial. The existing attribution rules which apply were introduced in 1992 and were based on the rules developed in the 1960s by the United States of America. The former coalition government recognised that those rules had become outdated and that the global economy had significantly changed since those rules were introduced. The former coalition government announced on 10 October 2006 that the Board of Taxation would conduct a review of the attribution rules. The terms of reference for the review were: to identify ways to reduce the complexity and compliance costs associated with the current foreign source income anti-tax-deferral regimes, including whether the regimes can be collapsed into a single regime; and to examine whether the anti-taxdeferral regimes strike an appropriate balance between effectively countering deferral and unnecessarily inhibiting Australians from competing in the global economy. In September 2008 the board provided its report to the current government. On 12 May 2009 the then Assistant Treasurer announced a number of changes to the tax law in response to the Board of Taxation's review. This bill implements some of the changes announced at that time. The amendments in this bill are based on the recommendations made by the Board of Taxation to reduce compliance costs for affected taxpayers. The bill abolishes the foreign investment fund rules and the deemed present entitlement rules contained within the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and is largely consistent with the operation of the tax law prior to the introduction of the FIF and deemed present entitlement rules in 1992. The amendments in this bill will mean that resident taxpayers who are beneficiaries holding interests in foreign trusts will apply the normal trust tax rules that are contained in division 6 and the transferor trust provisions in division 6AAA. The Board of Taxation argued that the abolition of the foreign investment fund rules would significantly reduce compliance costs for Australian managed funds and would enhance global competitiveness and attractiveness to foreign investors. The Board of Taxation argued that their recommended changes would also significantly reduce compliance costs for Australian companies and superannuation funds. They are clearly important initiatives. As I said, the coalition initiated this piece of legislation and we therefore support it. We recognise the good work that the Board of Taxation does. We think there is actually scope for it to do more and to involve itself in some of the difficult aspects of tax law and tax provisions that the tax office and the profession deal with on a day-today basis. I commend this bill to the House.",62
23,Mr RIPOLL,BUSINESS,"I too rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Foreign Source Income Deferral) Bill (No. 1) 2010. At the outset I want to congratulate the Assistant Treasurer and also the Treasury and the Board of Taxation for the work they have done in this area. This amendment bill does a range of things. In particular it amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to repeal the foreign investment fund, FIF, and the deemed present entitlement, DPE, rules. The schedule also makes consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 that are required as a result of the changes in the foreign investment fund and the deemed present entitlement rules. The repeal of the FIF and the DPE rules were announced, in the 2009-10 budget, as part of a wider reform program that we have taken on in terms of Australia's foreign source income and anti-tax-deferral attribution rules. The wider program has been initiated by the government since 2007 to ensure that we have the appropriate regulations and rules in place to protect consumers but at the same time, very importantly, ensure we do not have unjustifiable avoidance by a range of people of taxation responsibilities in this country. We are ensuring through these good reforms that people pay the appropriate amounts-their fair contribution-to the tax system and on behalf of all taxpayers. We are certainly trying to make sure that, while we do that, we do not put in place specific burdens or compliance costs or extra hurdles for small business. It is important to get that balance right. We acknowledge that in a whole range of areas. It is not limited to this particular amendment bill, although it is certainly an important element of it. You will see it in a whole range of reviews, from the Henry review in terms of general taxation right across the board to what Jeremy Cooper is doing in terms of superannuation. Mr Cooper is due to report by the end of this month. There are some significant changes, amendments and reforms that can come out of that review. I look forward very much to that report being handed to government on 30 June because of the significant contribution that superannuation makes in this country and the very important role it will continue to have in the future-and I might speak a little more about that in relation to this specific bill before us in a moment. The changes in this bill will mean a modernising of Australia's financial services sector, looking specifically at the issues of foreign income sources and how to most appropriately deal with income that is received by Australian residents and nonresidents from any foreign source they have. It is also important to note that while these changes are of a technical nature they are quite significant. They form part of some major steps that we are taking as a government to modernise our internal systems and to make sure that Australia remains competitive on a global platform. We need to remain competitive after these sorts of changes. We need to continue the good work to ensure that Australia becomes a financial services hub. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate Mark Johnson on his review and the government on its response. There is great potential growth in the financial services sector in the future of this country. We will export our widely regarded skills and expertise in these areas. The Johnson review covered a whole range of opportunities for Australia in the future. It has been a big part of my interest and the work that I have been doing in chairing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. We need to ensure that any of the reforms that we make and any of the changes that come about have a focus on Australia being a financial services hub. We need to be an exporter in the areas in which we are very strong. We are well regarded internationally in terms of our capacity and skills. In fact, Australia rates about fifth largest in terms of funds under management in the world. We are recognised for the capacity that we have, our expertise, our good corporate governance and our ability to deliver in all of these areas. We ought to take the opportunity and convert it into a stronger and larger export market. To do those things, you need to take reform right across a particular sector and not reform just one area. That is what we are doing with the bill that we have in front of us. What these reforms will deliver is significant compliance change and cost savings. They will also simplify what is a complex set of rules, rules which normally stream across a range of particular acts. It is important to get those right, and we have done that here. The changes will consolidate two acts in particular, one from 1936 and one from 1997the income tax acts. These changes will bring us a significant step closer to consolidating those two acts. Over time-as is the nature of thingscommunities, industries and sectors have changed. This has led to a whole range of inefficiencies, unforseen consequences and other problems that were not part of the debate at the time of the inception of those particular acts. What that means is that the operation of the attribution regime has become highly inefficient. In the light of that rising global interaction-it is a very different global market-and technological chance, an extensive range of exemptions now apply. Those exemptions operate to accommodate a range of those changes. But exemptions are not the best method or the most appropriate way to solve these problems. Those exemptions set up a compliance cost burden on people who operate in this area, particularly on people who manage funds. It is a disadvantage to Australian fund managers. For some time there have been discussions about what those disadvantages mean. They involve not just extra cost but the loss of business for Australian fund managers. From a government perspective, there is always concern about making sure that people pay their fair share of taxation. You always need to review specific areas to make sure that people are making their obligations. A foreign investment fund relates to either a foreign trust or a foreign company. They can be foreign investment funds or foreign life assurance policies as well. They were designed in the first instance to reduce tax. We want to reduce tax avoidance opportunities for Australian residents who accumulate passive income in offshore investment funds over which they have no control. They are often in low-tax regimes or even tax-free countries. There needs to be a balance. People should be able to legitimately use specific funds or other mechanisms but should not use them to deliberately and unjustifiably reduce their tax liability in Australia or their tax liability without any justification. These changes will apply to a taxpayer who was an Australian resident any time in a particular income year and who had either an interest in a foreign investment fund at the end of that income year or at any other time during that income year or an interest in a foreign life assurance policy at any time during that income year. However, instead of the usual income year period, a taxpayer may elect a different time period. That needs to be understood in context. While in Australia we have a financial year spanning 1 July to 30 June, it is the case in other jurisdictionsother countries-that different periods apply. Some use a calendar year; others use other time periods. So we need to take that into account in the way that we formulate our rules and the measures that we put in place. In these anti rollup fund measures, we have specifically replaced the foreign investment fund rules and targeted the most abusive of deferral cases, such as accumulation funds located in low-tax jurisdictions that reinvest low-risk returns. The anti rollup rule is scheduled to be introduced into parliament later this year. I look forward to its introduction and its support by the opposition. I know that the review of this area, which started in October 2006, was taken on board by the previous government. We are supportive of that review. The Board of Taxation took on that review and also released a positions paper and several other issues papers on these matters. Finally, in 2008, the board released its report to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, under the Rudd government, and we have acted upon that. We have taken that advice, we have gone through the consultation process and we have taken on board what is some good regulatory change. The board recommended that the Foreign Indefer vestment Fund provisions be repealed and replaced with specific anti-roll-up fund measures, which targeted very specifically accumulation funds that reinvest interest-like returns. It also recommended that closely held fixed trusts should also be brought into the controlled foreign company rules, the CFC rules, and that the deemed present entitlement rules should also be repealed. They are the two main elements of this amendment. What the board's recommendations demonstrate is the desire for us to increase our attractiveness as a financial services hub. We need to do that in a range of ways. Taxwithholding interest, for example, is one. We want to make sure that we look attractive as an investment destination, encourage Australian businesses to be more productive and competitive, and reduce compliance costs for managed funds, industry and other investors. This is a massive opportunity for Australia. This is an area where we can make enormous change in the future and really grow what is a vibrant high-employing sector in Australia-the financial services sector. It is good to note that in the short 2½ years that this government has been in power we have taken on board many reviews in this area. While some outside may think these reviews are in some way independent-and they all are absolutely independent-they are also strategically linked. We can look at the work my committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, has done, the extensive work that Henry has done through the independent tax review, the work that is being done by Jeremy Cooper on superannuation or, just as importantly, the work being done by Mark Johnson on Australia as a financial services hub. If you take all of those together and look at the very strategic financial services path that this government is setting for Australia, you can actually make sense of all of these. It is important to get them right. There is one more report that I have not mentioned, which probably ties all these in together really well, and that is the Intergenprovide erational report. Significantly, the reports states that by 2050-in a mere 40 years time-Australia will have twice as many 65year-olds as we have today. Frighteningly, depending on which way you look at it, there will be four times as many 85-year-olds-we will be living longer. It is also important to note that today there are five people in the workforce for every person aged over 65 years of age, but by 2050 the number of people in the workforce aged over 65 will only be 2.7. If governments today do not take heed of those warnings, then we are being derelict in our responsibilities to the people of Australia. If you take that information and look at the reform agenda that this government has put in place-fiscal responsibility, balancing budgets, sustaining health budgets into the future and making sure you do not just govern for the present but also govern for the future-then you can start seeing the link between those significant reviews we have done, some of the reforms we have already put into place and ensuring that we have the appropriate regulation in place. There should be not too much or too little but just the right amount you need to get the job done properly. You should reduce the compliance costs on small business-those regulatory burdens.",63
24,Dr EMERSON,BUSINESS,"Hear, hear!",66
25,Mr RIPOLL,BUSINESS,"I congratulate the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, who is in the House here, for the work he has been doing in reducing the compliance costs and burdens for small business. They are the backbone of Australia-there is no question of that. Whether it is corner shop type small businesses, small manufacturing businesses, Australian fund managers or people working in the financial services sector, if we can reduce their compliance costs, reduce their burdens, give them more opportunities to export their skills and services and mechanisms to put downward pressure on costs and fees-to make it more affordable for ordinary Australians-then I think we are on the right track. That is exactly what we have been doing. That is exactly what our agenda is. When people question how all of these things link, that is the explanation I give them about what our agenda is and where specifically we are trying to head into the future. The amendment we have put forward today is one of a number of amendments that I have spoken on this week. This week is an important week-it is the last week of the sitting before we go to the winter break. It is good to see that the government has had the capacity to deal with these very important reforms. I know some of these reforms may not seem too sexy to some members of parliament or even ordinary members of the community who may not be quite aware of the importance of some of these technical changes, but these amendments very much will form part of ensuring Australia's future sustainability in a whole range of areas, such as the way we are managing budgets and ensuring that we can maintain health budgets into the future. I do not know how many members of parliament have understood just how much the underlying costs of health actually represent. If the federal government does not do something today, by 2026 the complete budgets of every state and territory in this country will be consumed by health spending alone. I think it is an important point to note because you need to make decisions today that will have a massive impact into the future, and that is exactly what we are setting about doing. We are doing that through a whole range of different methods: increasing people's retirement security by increasing compulsory superannuation contributions from nine per cent to 12 per cent, looking at better forms of taxation through a resource tax to make sure that all Australians share the wealth of this country and sharing in the potential that exists there today through better taxation methods. In summing up, I thank the House for the opportunity to say some words on the amendments of this bill. While on their own these amendments may not seem that important, they certainly are to the people they affect. The legislation is an important part of Australia's strategic direction into the future, to make sure we have the right balance. I think we have that, and I commend the bill to the House.",66
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Thank you for your contribution. I now call and recognise the member for Herbert and would remind everyone that this is the member for Herbert's valedictory speech and that we do not take points of order, particularly on relevance.",67
27,Mr LINDSAY,BUSINESS,"I well remember, some 14½ years ago, making my first speech in this place. It was great because I was on the other side of the House-over there. Unfortunately, I am not going to get back there, but many of my colleagues will, in a short amount of time. What a privilege it is to wear this green pin. I think all of us wear it with pride. It does not matter which side of the House we are on, we wear it with pride. We know and understand what it means. My wife Margaret and my daughter Kylie have joined me here. In partnership with Margaret, I judged it was time to stand aside and allow renewal in the seat of Herbert. And that is a good thing, because the party needs others of ability to come along and bring new ideas. For a busy member of parliament, as you all know, there is never enough time to pursue so many personal interests, but I will now have that time. I will be able to sit and watch question time from Townsville! It was such a privilege to have worked with John Howard, Peter Costello and the team of the coalition, as we managed the difficult task of fixing the economic and social problems of Australia after the last Labor government. The next coalition member for Herbert will be part of the team that has to fix the mess that is being created by the current Labor government. It has been an honour to serve the people of Townsville. For 25 years now, as both the member for Herbert and also as councillor for Division 9 on Townsville City Council, I have been deeply grateful for our community and the support that they have given to me. I have particularly enjoyed the work done, at all levels, with the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. Whether the role is in war fighting, humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, training or mentoring, Australia can be mighty proud of the professionalism of the ADF. I have also invested considerable time in Australia's youth, through the Left Right think tank. It has been just so rewarding. Right was formed by Richard Newnham and Thom Woodroofe. It is an inspiring movement of young Australians dedicated to empowering all young people to contribute to public policy. Richard, you will be watching today and I want you to know that as CEO your energy, vision and leadership has been outstanding. You are truly a great young Australian and your parents, John and Susie, must be so proud of your achievements. Colleagues, I leave my job knowing that many of my achievements in Herbert have made such a difference. Major initiatives have included the Townsville Ring Road and the Douglas Arterial, which many of my colleagues say is the ‘Peter Lindsay highway'. Such works as the Woolcock Street extension and the Woodlands to Veales Road upgrade, including the Mount Low Parkway intersection have been achievements. I turn now to James Cook University. Back in 1997 I literally saved the university from financial ruin. The books were in a dreadful state but we were able to sort that out at the time with the help of Dr David Kemp. If you go out to the university you find that almost one-third of the university has been established under my watch and through my advocacy: the medical school and places; AIMS@JCU; Allied Health school; biotechnology places; Lightspeed; the communication facility, the pharmacy building and places; the microscope and mass spectrometry facility; veterinary science building and places; agricultural science places; a second medical school building and additional places, and the establishment of the Australian Tropical Sciences and Innovation Precinct. I am pretty proud of that. In terms of the environment, I was part of protecting the Great Barrier Reef for generations to come through the world acclaimed Green Zones process. And hasn't that been Left successful? All of the research now shows that it has worked and has produced more fish stocks for the fisherman and has locked up and protected our magnificent Great Barrier Reef for ever. I had Magnetic Island confirmed as a World Heritage listed area. The have been many Green Corps projects and a refurbishing of Reef HQ and so on. And I secured Townsville as one of the first of two Australian solar cities. I thank Ian Macfarlane for helping me do that. In terms of Defence, you just would not know Lavarack Barracks now. There has virtually been a complete redevelopment of the largest defence base in Australia. There have been significant numbers of new Defence homes built, hundreds of new singlesoldier accommodation units, redevelopment of port facilities for the LHDs that are coming along and the transfer of a new battalion to Townsville. Where is Dana Vale, the member for Hughes? I took the Third Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment from her! There has been massive redevelopment at the RAAF base in Townsville and at 5 Aviation Regiment at the Air Force base in Townsville. I move to a disappointment. I certainly got one of the first Australian technical colleges in Australia built in Townsville. It proved to be the best in the country, and then the Labor Party came along and defunded it. They say, ‘We're into skills training.' They were into skills training by defunding the best technical college in the country! That is a disappointment. In terms of health, we have established the Townsville after-hours GP service and I got funding for a bulk-billed MRI scanner at the Mater Hospital. In relation to the community, we handed over Jezzine Barracks. We had a huge community program to do that. I think the parliamentary secretary at the time ultimately said, ‘Lindsay, how did you do that?' because we handed over $45 million worth of defence land to the community and, on top of that, probably about another $25 million to redevelop that bookend of the Strand, and that is being done now. We secured funding for the Tony Ireland Stadium at Riverway and the redevelopment of the Murray Sports Complex. The member for Berowra is here; he will remember the first family relationship centre in Australia and the first Federal Magistrates Court in Northern Australia, and I thank him for his assistance in achieving that. I would like to think I have made a differment ence, and others will judge that. I certainly take quiet pride in the part I played in the Howard government's courage to take on the difficult issues. We have only got 11 of the class of 1996 here now: Don Randall is one, as are Danna Vale, Bruce Billson, Bob Baldwin, Jo Gash, Fran Bailey and Joe Hockey. We balanced the budget. We eliminated government debt. Do you remember the difficulties in doing that? We restored Australia's AAA credit rating. We reformed superannuation. We liberated industrial relations. We swept away a raft of taxes, we cut capital gains and income taxes, and we built the Future Fund. Under the Howard government, unemployment was at record lows and the incidence of industrial disputes was the lowest in Australia's history. What a mighty record. The Howard years saw higher wages, more productive workplaces, higher pensions, better living standards, more funding for health, education, defence and transport, better border protection-that rings a bell!and an economic resilience that was the envy of the developed world which did not happen by accident. It was a great distinction to be a part of that decision process. I would like to thank the people of Townsville for the opportunity to represent them in five Commonwealth parliaments. This is the third longest period of service by any member of Herbert since Federation, and Herbert was a Federation seat. Together we have achieved so much, with Townsville today being a confident, go-ahead city in which people enjoy living and working. That is of course why I proudly carry the tag of ‘the member for paradise'. I do have some regrets-for example, when I see the debate going on in Townsville now in relation to health. The government comes in and says, ‘We've got this great new program for health,' but what the governdoes not say is, ‘It's not going to start till 2014,' and we worry if it is going to start at all then. We need a PET scanner in the north. We have got to fly our patients to Brisbane at the moment, which is wrong. The government says, ‘We're going to give you a PET scanner but, by the way, not till 2014.' If there is a change of government, we will deliver a PET scanner immediately. Next week, construction will commence on the building that will house the PET scanner, and that is at Mater Park Haven Hospital. It will be ready. If there is a change of government, we will fund that PET scanner and it will be up and running as soon as we can buy a machine and install it-and that is how it should be. Then there are the GP superclinics. I do not know how many of my colleagues have been promised GP superclinics. Remember the last election? ‘We'll have a GP superclinic in Townsville and, by the way, we'll have a family medical centre for Lavarack Barracks, the first of two-one in Darwin, one in Townsville-and we'll build it straight away.' That promise is gone; it was canned. It translated into: ‘We'll put Defence into the GP superclinic.' So when do you think we will get a GP superclinic? Not in this term. ",67
28,Mr LINDSAY,BUSINESS,"The member for Sturt says 2020; I do not know whether it will happen by then. That is a bit early, Member for Sturt! Dr Southcott-Aim high!",70
29,Mr LINDSAY,BUSINESS,"Yes! Thanks, Member for Boothby. We have got to push that along. If there is a promise made to the people that they are going to get a GP superclinic, it should in fact be implemented. Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom-and, Mr Speaker, if you are listening-here is something for you. This is a regret: question time. Question time in the House of Representatives is when the opposition has the opportunity to hold the executive accountable. Former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating once said that question time was a courtesy extended to the House by the executive branch of government. But the philosophy of the Westminster system is that there has got to be a time when the opposition can ask a question and expect an answer. That is not happening. Day after day, we waste two hours in this place. It is a farce. Why do we come in here? We ask a question and then we get 15 minutes of blah, blah, blah back across the table. That is not democracy in action. That is not responsible government. Why is the government hiding from answering the questions? Senator Alan Ferguson, the former President of the Senate, took quite an interest in this as well. There has to be a reform of question time in the parliament. We need relevant answers and we need short answers. We could well look at models in other systems. The Indian system, the New Zealand system, the British system and the Canadian system all work far better than ours, and it is my view that currently question time is not a very good use of time whatsoever. I have a second point about the parliament that is a great disappointment to me. It is only a small matter. When I first came to this place-and those who have been here for some time will know this-if you had visitors from your electorate or other special guests and the parliament was not sitting, you could bring them onto the floor of the parliament. Right now you can go onto the floor of the House of Commons, you can go onto the floor of the Indonesian parliament, you can go onto the floor of the New Zealand parliament and you can go onto the floor of the United States congress. You can go into the UN General Assembly; you can go into the Security Council and sit in the president's chair. But you cannot bring your constituents onto the floor of the Australian parliament. This is the people's parliament; why shouldn't you be able to? What is the problem? Why shouldn't a member of parliament be able to conduct a group onto the floor of the parliament and talk about this great democracy that we have in Australia? I ask the Speaker and the President of the Senate to review that, please. The other thing I worry about in Australia is bureaucracy. I saw an instance of this at my local GP recently. I was getting a swine flu injection, and I cheekily said, ‘Can I have a jellybean please?' They said, ‘We don't give out jellybeans anymore.' When I asked why, I was told, ‘Well, it's a health and safety issue-you might choke.' So they don't give jellybeans to kids! What is happening to our country when you cannot give a kid a jellybean? Listen to this. For as long as anybody can remember, the Air Force cadets have paraded on the apron in front of Air Movements at RAAF Townsville. The cadets have always been resplendent in their uniform, all ironed and creased up properly and inspected. Because somebody has decided there is a workplace health and safety issue, they now have to wear orange safety vests and earmuffs in case their hearing gets affected. But there no aircraft on the tarmac, because the RAAF controls its own tarmac. Wouldn't it be better for somebody to actually say, ‘Look, this seems a bit silly; why don't we just get air traffic control to say, “There will be no aircraft on the tarmac during this parade”?' Bureaucracy has gone stupid in Australia. We are all part of that. Think about the Australian Army cadets who went to Bundoon, where the SAS train, for a camp. They could not use the refrigerator. Why couldn't they use the refrigerator? Because nobody had done a risk assessment on using a refrigerator. They were not allowed to use it. This is stupidity. I have a whole range of other examples, but I do not have time to go through them. I want to thank a few people in the time that is left to me. To my own staff, who are in the gallery today-Robin, Hawk, Lori, Matthew, Sharyn and Ella-thank you so much for the support that you have been able to give to me for such a long time. My thanks go to the staff of the parliament, and in particular to those in Broadcasting. Many of you will not know about Broadcasting, but down in mushroom corner, in the basement, we have Sharon, John, Eric, Phil, Ferg, Karlie and of course Mr Nightcart. Mr Nightcart's surname is actually Cathcart, but he has this great nickname. He is a legendthank you, Ken, for the fun we have had over the years. In IT and communications we have Ann Mackinnon and her staff, and Andrew Pang. In committees, Siobhan Leyne will be watching this now-you are the most impressive inquiry secretary that I have ever seen in any committee in my time. Thank you for your support. As for colleagues, Ian Macdonald and George Brandis are in the senators' gallery. Ian, you got me into this-it was you who did it. You have been such a good friend and mentor for so many years now, so thank you are so much. Thanks also to Brucey Billson-I am not allowed to say ‘Brucey Billson'Greg Hunt, Gary Nairn, Mal Washer and Alex Somlyay and his staff, and Nathan is sitting over there. Thank you all for your support. I wish our party and its leaders well. Tony, thank you for coming. I know Julie has something else she has to do at this time. Thank you to my colleagues for coming, and I wish all of you every success at the next election. We need you, Tony, and we need the team back here sitting on the other side. I thank also my former staff. Katherine is in the gallery-thank you, Katherine. There are Ross Jordan, Joe Nyhan, Robert Hardie, who is over here, and Mr Snuffleupagus, who is watching in Brisbane at the moment-g'day to you. We also have our support people, the HRG staff and the great people at Qantas. We have had a terrific time. I would like to thank my electorate committee, branch members of the Liberal National Party and so many friends who have supported me and worked tirelessly on five tough election campaigns. I am blessed to have lived long enough to witness the arrival of my first grandchild, Jessica, and to have her youthful laughs forever etched on the grooves forming on my face. So many have never laughed, and so many have died before seeing their children have their children. I can say no and mean it. I can say yes and mean it. As you get older, is easier to be more positive. You can care less about what other people think. I do not question myself anymore; I have earned the right to be wrong. I like getting older. It set me free, and I like the person I have become. While I am still here I am not going to waste time lamenting what could have been or worrying about what will be. In the last 60 seconds, I am going to bawl. To Margaret and Kylie, and my son Markisn't this ridiculous; 15 years in the parliament and I am bawling!-thank you so much; I love you so much. I am a softie. Thank you.",70
30,Mr ZAPPIA,BUSINESS,"I begin by acknowledging the service to this House of the member for Herbert, and extend my best wishes to him and his family for their future. I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Foreign Source Income Deferral) Bill (No. 1) 2010. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to repeal the foreign investment fund and deemed present entitlement rules. The schedule also makes consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 that are required as a result of the foreign investment fund and deemed present entitlement rules. In the 2009-10 budget, the government announced significant reforms to Australia's foreign source income attribution rules. In summary, the reforms mean that the controlled foreign companies rules and the transferor trust rules will be retained and modernised while the foreign investment fund rules and the deemed present entitlement rules will be repealed. The repeal of the foreign investment fund rules has been welcomed by the management fund sector as they contend it that the foreign investment fund regime imposes significant costs and an uncompetitive tax burden on Australian fund managers. The reforms advance the government's commithas ment to secure Australia's place as a leading financial services centre in the region and more generally to improve the competitiveness of Australian businesses competing offshore-in fact, it is in respect of that matter that I address my comments on this bill. The comparative stability of Australia's financial institutions has become abundantly clear in the fallout from the global financial crisis, when we saw the domino effect of the collapse of one financial institution after another. Of course, that stability was very much increased by the Rudd government's swift and decisive action to guarantee both bank deposits and bank wholesale lending. The performance of Australia's financial institutions attracted the praise of international commentators and has been held up as a model at G20 meetings. Worldwide, there are fewer than 10 AA-rated banks and, of those, four are here in Australia. We now have the opportunity to build on that financial strength and stability. We know that in recent years the Asian and South-East Asian regions have emerged as regions of strong economic growth, and we saw that again in reports in the media only this morning. A wellregulated financial institution sector in Australia therefore provides Australia with a unique opportunity to build a leading financial services sector for the region. The accumulation of superannuation funds over the last two decades has clearly contributed to the growth and strength of Australia's financial sector. Compulsory superannuation was introduced in 1986, when an agreement between government, the ACTU and industry ensured that, under industrial awards, workers were required to have three per cent of their wages paid as superannuation contributions. In 1987 the assets of superannuation funds totalled $41 billion. By 2007 this amount had grown to $1.1 trillion, and it is expected that by the year 2035 this amount will grow to around $5.3 trillion. The government's commitment to increase superannuation contributions from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the next decade as part of the measures associated with the resource super profits tax will significantly to the balance of superannuation funds available for investment. That in turn will lead to an even stronger financial sector, with more funds for reinvestment in Australia and further employment growth in the financial sector and in other sectors were those funds are invested. The Australian financial services sector has seen very strong employment growth in recent decades. The sector currently employs around 400,000 Australians, which is an increase of around 80,000 jobs in just 15 years. I said earlier that Australian-based investment managers currently manage $1.1 trillion in assets on behalf of domestic Australian investors. As the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law has previously stated in this House, these same Australian-based fund managers only manage $53 billion worth of overseas investments. This means that in the global economy less than five per cent of funds managed by our domestic fund managers are sourced from overseas. On 26 September 2008 the government announced the establishment of the Australian Financial Centre Forum, headed by Mark Johnson AO, to recommend ways that Australia could take advantage of its opportunity to become a leading financial services centre. The Australian Financial Centre Forum reported to the government, and on 11 May 2010 the government announced its response, which provided in-principle or direct support for nearly all of the 19 recommendations of the report. The Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law made a statement in the House only some days ago that those recommendations include: the introduction of an investment manager regime, providing greater certainty around the tax treatment of foreign funds managed by Australian add investment managers; the establishment of an online regulatory gateway, providing domestic and international investors with a one-stop shop for basic information about the Australian market; and the development of an Asia region funds passport, which would involve a multilateral framework to enable a complying retail investment fund in a country that signs up to the passport framework to offer its products in each of the other signatory countries. The announcement made by the minister two weeks ago will have been welcomed by the finance sector throughout this country. The announcement went to the heart of an opportunity that this country has ahead of it to establish a major industry-or at least an additional aspect to a major industry-in this country. It is not often that this country is in a position to compete with the rest of the world in a range of sectors. In most cases, we in fact find ourselves somewhat disadvantaged because of either our distance from the rest of the world or other competing pressures that seem to enable other countries to undercut our industries. I refer particularly to the manufacturing sector in this country. It may not be the case that we have seen a decline in that sector over the years, but it is certainly the case that we have seen many of our manufacturing industries relocate offshore. With the finance sector, however, it is entirely different. It is different because the financial industry does not have to be specifically located in a particular country. It operates on the basis of technology that is available to the world today and from which you can establish a major industry wherever you want in the world. Australia has demonstrated that it has the capability, the stability and the security of our financial sector to become a financial services sector for the rest of the Asia and we should grasp that opportunity. We know from what we have seen in recent years that it will be the Asian area where we see growth occur most rapidly. We know that China has been a country of rapid growth, but we also know that several other Asian countries equally withstood the global economic downturn and withstood it well. We know that those same countries are in a prime position to continue to grow and, as they do, they will also look not only to increasing their relationship with Australia but also to working with countries that have stability within. The financial services sector has certainly been rocked by the global financial crisis of the last couple of years. We saw that the financial hubs, whether in New York or in London, were very much rocked to the point where there would have to be without question a continuing degree of uncertainty as to whether they are the best places for governments and private enterprise to continue dealing with. I believe the global financial crisis presents Australia with a terrific opportunity to ensure that Australia builds on stability and security and does develop itself as a financial centre for the Asian region. As part of its package of reforms for the financial services sector, the Rudd government is committing $25 million to establish a regional centre for financial system regulation and innovation. The sector in Australia has been stable and secure, but we can always do better. The establishment of a $25 million regional centre for financial system regulation and innovation is something we should all embrace. Our financial regulatory system in Australia was a key part of ensuring that our financial systems in this country remained stable and secure during the financial downturn across the world. The regulatory system can always be improved. It can always be made better, it can always be streamlined and made easier for the finance sector members to operate within. We should also never lose sight of the fact that, no matter what industry we are in, we do compete with the rest of the world and, therefore, we need to constantly be innovative in what we do. The establishment of this centre is going to be critical in providing the innovation that is required by the sector as a whole to ensure that it does remain competitive and to ensure that it is able to provide the financial services that we are hoping will come to this country if it becomes a centre for financial services in the Asian region. I understand that the centre will provide tertiary education and training for financial regulators from Australia and the Asia Pacific region. I said a moment ago that it is the Asia-Pacific region that I believe will be at the heart of global economic growth in the years ahead. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister announce only yesterday the new deals that have been signed between Australia and the Chinese government with a number of the mining companies in this country. I have to say that certainly flies in the face of those who are opposed to the resource super profits tax and those who have been suggesting that that tax will drive investment away from this country. Clearly that is not the case, and we saw that with the signing of those multibillion dollar agreements with the Chinese government only yesterday. It will be in respect of other trade matters as well that the establishment of a financial hub here in Australia will benefit the Australian economy and the Australian people. One of the benefits of having a financial services centre in Australia and the increase of superannuation funds that will accumulate over the years is that this in turn provides Australian people with a source of revenue that can be used to reinvest in this country. I expect that much of that reinvestment may well be back into the resources sector from which we have heard criticisms of the increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. They will be one of the beneficiaries, because they cannot claim that the resource super profits tax is affecting the superannuation funds of millions of Australians without acknowledging that it is the superannuation funds of millions of Australians that are contributing to their very investments and to the very development of resources. The Australian government recognises that regulation and innovation of financial markets cannot be separate issues; they must keep pace with one another. A moment ago I was speaking about the establishment of the Centre for International Finance and Regulation here in Australia. That in itself will create additional employment in this country, but it will also ensure that in the future we are not likely to see the kinds of crises and problems that were encountered by governments across the world as a result of the global financial crisis, where governments were consistently being asked to bail out the financial services sectors within their own countries. Better regulations, better training and innovation, which all go hand in hand, will ensure a much stronger sector. We see announcements being made today by the new British government about how they are going to have to tighten expenditure across so many sectors in order to try and get their budget back in the black. You can contrast that with what happened here in Australia-stable banks, secure banks, a government that acted quickly and a debt and deficit regime that is much lower than most other countries, in fact, the lowest of all advanced economies. What we are seeing in this country right now is growth. With that growth the come new investment funds. With that growth comes the need to borrow funds in order to pay for new developments, and that in turn means that we will have a financial services sector that will be more and more important to the future of this country. The finance and tax laws of Australia are complex. It would be fair to say that most people would have little understanding of their complexities. Whether it is the taxation acts or the superannuation acts, they are very complex laws. Undoubtedly, because of their complexity these laws add to the cost of business in this country and will add to the cost of doing business into the future unless we begin a process of simplifying them. If we streamline and simplify the laws under which companies operate, we not only reduce their overheads-and that will be something that is welcomed by them-but also make them much more competitive. This bill, with these amendments, does exactly that. It is a bill that will simplify tax laws in this country. It is a bill that will make Australian business more competitive and, in doing so, will put us on the right track to securing Australia as a leading financial centre for the Asia-Pacific region. It is something that this country has been pursuing for some time. The Rudd government has recognised this and is doing what it can to ensure that we do become a financial hub. Disappointingly, I heard the minister make it absolutely clear that the opposition does not support the intent of the Johnson report and does not support Australia becoming a future financial hub in years to come. That is disappointing because we have an opportunity that we should not let go. As I said a moment ago, this bill simplifies our tax laws and makes business more efficient. Those measures can only be welcomed by the business sector of Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",72
31,Mr SHORTEN,BUSINESS,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (12.41 pm)-I would like to thank those members who took part in this debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Foreign Source Income Deferral) Bill (No. 1) 2010 bill, which gives effect to the repeal of the foreign investment fund, or FIF, and deemed present entitlement rules, delivers the first tranche of reforms that were announced in the 2009-10 budget. As part of wider reforms to Australia's foreign source income anti-tax-deferral attribution rules, this measure will assist Australian managed funds and other businesses to compete internationally by reducing complexity and compliance costs that are associated with the making of foreign investments. The repeal of the FIF and deemed present entitlement rules further contributes to the government's objective of promoting Australia as a pre-eminent financial hub in our region. This will support Australian jobs. This measure, being part of wider reforms to better target Australia's attribution rules, also further simplify the taxation law and bring consolidation of the two-income tax acts a significant step closer. This bill deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",76

34,Mr JOHN COBB,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Calare) (12.43 pm)Drought and all the issues surrounding it are supposedly the purpose of the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. I have dealt with drought most of my life in agripolitics, politics and as a farmer-I am still a farmer. The bill inserts a new part 9D to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to treat farmers receiving income support, under a pilot of drought policy will reform measures in Western Australia, as if they were receiving exceptional circumstances relief payments for welfare related purposes. Talking to my Western Australian colleagues, it is becoming apparent that Western Australia is having a slow start to the winter cropping season and there is a need for more rain. However, being a farmer, I am an eternal optimist and hope that the season can only get better. Right upfront of this debate I want to place on record my upset and my anger at the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's repeated comments that exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidies are causing mental health issues and should be scrapped because of it. This is a load of rubbish. If he had the practical experience of living in the areas and being affected by drought and the consequences of failing under it, he would see that the exact opposite of what he has suggested is, in fact, the truththat interest rates subsidies have provided relief for agricultural families rather than opposite. That is not a comment I want to hear ever again. The government will provide $18 million over five years, from 2009-10, to pilot new drought reform measures in selected regions of Western Australia. The 12-month pilot will commence on 1 July 2010, in a few weeks time, and will be delivered and funded in partnership with the government of Western Australia, which has agreed to contribute $5 million. This brings the total cost of the pilot to $23 million over five years, with the state government contributing approximately 20 per cent. The pilot includes $4.9 million for income support for eligible farmers experiencing hardship. Recipients will be eligible for the beneficiary tax offset and may be eligible for a healthcare concession card, youth allowance for their children and early release of superannuation benefits, as it does under exceptional circumstances wherever it is-in Tasmania, Western Australia or New South Wales. I am pleased that the income support component of this trial is not capped, unlike the vast majority of the funding for this trial drought program. It should be pointed out that the Western Australian trial is not a drought program; an efficiency program, and I would be loath to support it as the new drought policy across Australia. I welcome the acknowledgement by the government that investment in onfarm efficiency is a wise and sensible investment. However, it will do nothing for farmers in future in exceptional drought situations, be that for two, three or whatever drought years in a row. Heaven forbid we ever have eight or nine years as in recent times. Les White from the Weekly Times in an article headed ‘Drought aid trial, farms to get $60,000' states: The trial is expected to cost $23 million-$18 the million from the Federal Government and $5 million from the West Australian Governmenthowever as there is no cap on the number of grants, the costs could potentially be higher. Grants will continue to be paid even if the $23 million figure is exceeded. In a media release issued on 5 May 2010, Minister Tony Burke stated: Almost 6,000 farmers in the trial region are expected to be eligible for assistance under the package … for grants of up to $170,000. If it is uncapped, there is a potential liability of $405,000,000 from just two of the components of the trial. The government has allocated just $12 million when they know they have a potential liability of $405 million, or 40 per cent of their projected surplus, if each of the 6,000 eligible farmers took up only two of the components they were eligible for, namely, as the media release states: Building Farm Businesses-grants of up to $60,000 to help farm businesses prepare for the impacts of drought, reduced water availability and a changing climate, and on-farm Landcare activitiesallocated up to $8.4 million, with a total liability of $360,000,000-and: Farm Planning-support for farmers to undertake training to develop or update a strategic plan for their farm business with a focus on preparing for it is future challenges Farm Planningallocated up to $3.6 million, with a total liability of $45,000,000, if each of the 6,000 eligible farmers took up the grant offer. If it is capped, the program has been deliberately designed to fail and, as we found out at estimates, the Weekly Times had it wrong. These two components are to be capped, which, given there was no mention of the fact that the different programs within the drought trial would be capped-in fact, the minister for agriculture's press release stated there were 6,000 eligible farmers-suggests the government is deliberately misleading farmers in Western Australia and around the country about the true nature of the government's response to exceptional droughts. There is only enough money allocated in this year's budget for one of the 6,000 eligible farmers to receive the full farm exit support grant of $170,000; eight per cent to receive the $7,500 farm planning grant and just enough money for 2.3 per cent to receive the full $60,000 Building Farm Businesses grant. Minister Burke's media release stated: … grants of up to $60,000 to help farm businesses prepare for the impacts of drought, reduced water availability and a changing climate, and on-farm Landcare activitiesand allocated up to $8.4 million, but only 140 out of 6,000 eligible farmers would receive the full grant if the program was capped, as we now know it is. Furthermore: Farm Planning-support for farmers to undertake training to develop or update a strategic plan their farm business with a focus on preparing for future challengesand allocated up to $3.8 million, but only 480, or eight per cent, of the 6,000 eligible farmers would receive the full grant if the program is capped, as we now know it is. The media release went on: Farm Exit Support-grants of up to $170,000 to support farmers who make the difficult decision to sell the farm businessAnd allocated up to $0.3 million, but only one of the 6,000 eligible farmers would receive the full grant if the program is capped, as we now know it is. In his post-budget speech at the Rural Press Club, Brisbane, on 12 May 2010 the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, in relation to the drought policy reform pilot of new measures in WA stated: So, under the pilot, lines on a map are gone and we have one test-a hardship test. If you're in hardship you qualify and if you're not in hardship then you don't. I would appreciate the minister clarifying a number of issues not just for me but for every farmer within the pilot program-that is, for the 6,000 farmers in WA-and for the whole sector generally. What is the definition of ‘a hardship test' the minister referred to? What is the definition of ‘farmer' used by the department in this trial? How many farmers located within the region of WA will be covered by the trial program? If during the 12month trial period there were a hardship event-such as exceptional circumstances drought, locust plague, mice plague, bushfire, flood or dust storm-would the number of eligible farmers within the trial area increase? What is the name of the body that will decide whether a farmer qualifies for the help and is deemed to be in hardship, and how will this body be funded? Will the minfor ister-and, if so, which minister, Western Australian or federal-has the final determination on whether an event qualifies as a hardship event to be eligible for the drought trial program? Will the minister-and, if so, which minister, Western Australian or federal-has the final determination? I am interested to know the answers to these questions as the definitions in the hardship test are extremely important. The coalition do not oppose this bill and we will closely follow the so-called drought trial in Western Australia. We do not oppose the bill on these grounds. If there are farmers within this region of WA who are in strife and who can be helped, then far be it from us to deny them what the program is meant to do for them. But I have to say this: this is called a drought program, but drought as we know it is the kind of thing that would qualify as exceptional circumstances droughtand that is how we have dealt with it up until now-and it means pretty desperate times. It does not mean that you can spend $60,000 on a farm and drought proof it; you cannot. I am not suggesting for one second that drought measures cannot be improved on, but I have a terrible suspicion following the Productivity Commission report. The minister called for it and got it; and the Productivstances ity Commission does sit under Treasury, so it is not about handing out money. The report done by the Productivity Commission was scathing about drought, mainly because they are an arm of Treasury and they do not like money leaving. It was suggested that the interest rate subsidy had done harm rather than good; it has done good and it has held together areas within my electorate. There are areas that went into exceptional circumstances drought in June or July 2002-that is, eight years ago. There would be very few of them left, except for EC and except for the interest rate subsidy. That kept the banks on side, which kept farmers on the farms and gave them a chance when conditions improved to get some stock back and to do all those things. I take personal offence, as does the industry, to be told that the interest rate subsidy caused mental issues-and I would rather not go into those at this time. It saved them. It has done an awful lot for people. Whether or not you like the program, there is no getting around the fact that it has meant a lot to a lot of regional and rural Australians. We support the bill because it will give a chance to those in the trial area of WA, who might be in particularly bad circumstances, to get the sort of relief that people get under exceptional circumstances.",76
35,Mr ADAMS,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I would like to deal with a couple of matters that the member for Calare dealt with. I would have liked to have seen a little more spirit of the future from him. I would have liked to have seen him looking to the future and looking for new ways. His point about exceptional circumstances not causing any problems I think lacked a little bit of political thinking and a little bit of political giving. There are people who sometimes cannot see their way through. There were people who were in debt before exceptional circumand before drought came to their properties and to their enterprises. One way of looking at new ways in this field is to try to find new direction. Exceptional circumstances payments actually pay people who are in debt and subsidise the debt on those enterprises. Those who may have worked hard to drought proof their property and to build risk management into their processes do not get any payment. They may be next door to somebody who does. This is a part of thinking that we have to move forward on. We have to be considerate of the nature of the human beings that are involved in the enterprise, but we have to have efficiency in the process. The Productivity Commission's main role is to make sure that the country is spending money wisely and is being productive. It is taxpayers' money that is being spent. Therefore, the nation has to win from the programs. We have to make sure that that comes into play. It would be good if we could get some good modern thinking from the other side of the House. I am sure that not everybody would accept what was said by the last speaker. The Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010 inserts a new part 9D into the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to treat, for welfare related purposes, farmers receiving income support under a pilot of drought policy reform measures as if they were receiving exceptional circumstances relief payments. The pilot represents a dramatic shift in the way governments help farmers deal with the challenges of the future, from crisis management to risk management. The old system provides the most assistance to farmers who are in the most debt and fails to recognise those who have made the tough business decisions to stay out of debt. We need to reward those who are innovative and into using new ideas and moving forward, not those who may be into old thinking and who are unable to make decisions of a tough business nature. This legislation very much takes heed of the findings of part of the Farming the future report, which was submitted to the parliament earlier this year. Drought relief as such has played its role and, although we need to phase out exceptional circumstances relief, we do not want to ‘chop them off at the socks' as the president of the AIAST, Mr Geoff Thomas, said. He went on to say, however: … there is no question that it has caused less adjustment than there would otherwise have been. It would have been good if the National Party member for Calare had acknowledged that maybe that process had occurred. Mr Thomas also said: Even some of the people who have received itexceptional circumstances paymentwould admit privately that it probably has not done them a favour … because it has reduced their capacity to adjust. In the report, the pork industry, through Australian Pork Ltd, was quoted as saying: … future drought policy should be aimed at assisting the agricultural sector to adjust to climate change and prepare for extreme climatic conditions. This new approach to be trialled in Western Australia will help to make the farming sector more resilient and addresses mental health issues in farming communities. Importantly, the pilot will not affect farmers currently receiving income support payments and interest rate subsidies under the old exceptional circumstances scheme, but we must start talking about risk management instead of drought support. The National Rural Advisory Council will continue to consider proposals for exceptional circumstances declarations submitted by state governments and to reassess current declarations coming up for renewal. The pilot will run from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. It includes the farm family support measures which provide income support to assist eligible farmers facing hardship with basic household needs. Assistance is available regardless of the cause of hardship. The farm family support payment will be delivered through an executive scheme arrangement under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, rather than being fully legislated, due to the complex nature of the income support legislation and the short-term nature of this program. Guidelines will be published which will provide details of the operation of the executive scheme. The government wishes to ensure that the recipients of farm family support during the trial can access the full range of so-called ‘ancillary benefits' which are already available for exceptional circumstances relief payment and to other welfare recipients under existing legislation. As it is not possible to use the executive scheme arrangement to provide the full range of ancillary benefits to recipients, legislation is required to ensure those will be available. In order to meet the objective of making Commonwealth welfare assistance to this group consistent with exceptional circumstances relief payment, the bill will amend the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to effectively treat the farm family support as if it were exceptional circumstances relief payment for the purpose of providing access to a range of measures-the ancillary benefits referred to earlier-that are not available as part of executive scheme payments. These include an automatically issued healthcare card and some concessions relating to income and asset testing for student allowances paid to, or in respect of, the student children of recipients. Ancillary benefits available to exceptional circumstances relief payment recipients will automatically become available to farm family support recipients. This will be achieved through the linkages in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to other legislation-the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 and the Age Discrimination Act 2004. The bill does not make any amendment to any legislation other than the Farm Household Support Act 1992, but we must keep looking at the way government can drive change to help farmers help themselves in future. Although it is a gradual process, it is good to see the start put forward by this bill. Provisions of this bill can only be applied in respect of payments and services made under, and for the duration of, the Farm Family Support Scheme, an executive scheme created under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The drought policy reform pilot will test a comprehensive package of drought reform measures. These are designed to: (a) support farmers in managing and preparing for future drought and a changing climate; (b) increase the resilience and capacity of rural communities to cope with adversity; (c) better coordinate social support services in rural areas; help families meet immediate basic household expenses during financial hardship; and (e) connect farmers and former farmers to discuss opportunities outside of farming. As we know from many reports, farmers always underestimate their skill base and their ability to change direction especially, possibly, after generations on the one property. Farm Family Support is a program under the drought pilot which provides other key elements of: (i) income support paid at a fortnightly rate based on the Newstart allowance base rate to help farmers and their families meet basic household needs; (ii) case management to assist farmers to develop a plan to identify action which will improve their financial position on-farm and off-farm; and (iii) support for the implementation of these plans with assistance of up to $2,500 to fund the cost of financial advice to assess farmers' long-term financial positions and $5,000 to fund professional advice and/or training. The Farming the future report concluded that drought policy should be about developing industries and enterprises that can cope with drought, and both sides of the House would support that approach. It emphasises capacity building and long-term resilience rather than short-term survival. Climate change is an issue we have to contend with, and farmers are on the pointy end of that change. We have to ask ourselves how long we can subsidise farms with old methods and old mechanisms. We must come up with ideas whereby we can move our rural producers into a phase where they are discussing risk management in their farming practices, new processes, sustainable methods and recycling so that nothing is wasted. Our land is fragile, but it can be strengthened and the soil can be assisted and improved. But there is a limit to some of the farmlands and these limits have been pointed (d) out before, even as far back as the early 1800s. Drought has always been a part of the picture and we need to understand it so we can live with it, survive it and work within it. We need to help to innovate and fund opportunities for farmers to do this. Funding est rates on debt where, possibly, people do not make decisions that they need to is not moving us forward in this country. In the Farming the future report of the House committee, the committee made the point that change is not easy and we need to fund bodies like Rural Alive and Well, which is a support and counselling service in my state of Tasmania and in my electorate. It is leading in new ways of delivering these processes of help and support for the farming communities. It deals with real people by going down the track, sitting at the kitchen table, having a cup of tea and offering support, which is usually done by a local person that knows the region and usually knows the family and their needs. A key role of the service is to connect the support services of government with those people so that they get the services and the help that they need, and then also to keep an eye on the situation and make sure that things are happening and that there is change, help, direction and opportunity for those people. Exceptional circumstances are sometimes harming people and are not really giving them a way forward or helping them change and make the directions that, possibly, they should. Farms need to build a business plan. Farmers need to look into that sort of operation, work to achieve the plan goals and to accept the true risk of business and understand that risk is a part of enterprise. Government and, of course, the Australian people are better served by a robust farm sector using modern business practices than by paying to keep invalid or unviable enterprises going that are not re-adjusting as they need to. There are many, many farmers who are looking for new directions and new ways, especially younger ones, and they might need a bit of help to do that. This is the way interthat government should be funding assistance to the rural sector to make it a robust sector and to bring people forward into new ways. We know the challenges of water into the future. We know the challenges of productivity and that the rural sector will have to use less water but increase productivity because the need is going to be there for us to meet those demands into the future. We have that opportunity and it will need government to be innovative and find new ways to achieve that. This bill gives support to people in a trial that is endeavouring to do that. It is a very good intervention in an innovative way, and I congratulate the minister and the department for bringing it forward. I wish those involved with it the best of will. I certainly hope that we can get strong support for innovation and new ways of thinking in the rural sector in Australia so that we can go forward with this sector as they adjust, as do many other sectors of our economy. The taxpayer pays for exceptional circumstances. We have to make sure that there is a public good at the end of the line. In that sense we have to show that we care about people and assist people in whatever way we can to go forward. We need to make sure that they are not staying where they probably need not stay and that they do readjust for the future. I think this bill does that very well and I commend it to the House.",79
36,Mr TUCKEY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"O'Connor) (1.15 pm)The Farm Household Support Amendment (Additional Drought Assistance Measures) Bill 2008 is important legislation about which I will give credit where credit is due but take some part of my speech to identify a direction that I think would be more worthwhile. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke, is, nevertheless, to be congratulated. Through this pilot scheme, which I think is properly located in Western Australia, he has tried something different and something better, and recognised that the exceptional circumstances scheme has never been effective in giving appropriate support to the rural sector. One of its greatest failings, of course, is the fact that, if you are rather profligate and borrow a lot of money, you will get half your interest paid for you. If, on the other hand, you have been careful and even accumulated a few off-farm assets to protect yourself from seasonal and price cycles, you get nothing. The very nature of Western Australian farming is that today it generally covers very large farms and cropping programs of 10,000 or 15,000 hectares. The leading farmer puts in 100,000 hectares. Each of those people, I might add, are betting their farm virtually annually against the weather and against price movements, currency and everything else. The fact of life was that we in government sent the ‘drought bus' up to the northern sector of what was then my electorate. They had had three years of devastating drought when nothing grew. So in they went to the public servants to see what assistance they might give-and this program had been very successful in the dairying country-and one after another they were told, ‘You're too rich.' You had not grown a crop for three years but the asset valuation, which was often unsaleable, was such that you could get no money. The scheme failed through means-testing and it failed in other ways. The minister, to his credit, has come up with an alternative. I am not going to criticise that alternative, because I am prepared, as I think most farmers in my electorate are, to give it a go. I recognise that NRAC as we know it, the National Rural Advisory Council, will be a participant. I have also got a note down here in speaking of the minister's achievements that it was he with the cooperation of the Liberals-and it is interesting today when the Neanderthals were out there again complaining about the loss of the single desk-who had the courage, as did his predecessor John Kerin, to bite bullet on this. It is pretty handy if your opponents will take on the issues that are so hard for those with the constituency. But I wish the Labor Party took the same opportunity after we had fixed up the industrial relations sector for them. They should have just left it alone and said, ‘It seems to be working.' Might I add that some credit there goes of course to Paul Keating and Bob Hawke. People forget that both Whitlam and Hawke attacked the industrial relations stupidity by lowering tariffs. Whitlam also revalued the dollar and both of these put pressure on people to stop doing silly deals and try and get more efficient. Nevertheless, what has happened with the single desk deregulation is that farmers, particularly in my electorate, are now getting a separate account for their off-farm coststheir storage and the loading on ships and the freight. One of my constituents was horrified that that cost equalled his fertiliser accountand take it from me, that is a lot of money. The focus in my state now is not about crying tears of blood over the departure of the single desk, as it was known; in fact, 50 per cent of the crop is now handled in a single desk concept by the farmer cooperative CBH. That 50 per cent of farmers, as in other areas, has continued with the pooling system, but they have all got to understand that there is a huge cost burden being borne off the farm. It was all secret under the single desk-all bundled into the pooling. We knew that the corporate entity, AWB Ltd, was actually milking $40 million a year out of overseas freight contracts by contracting in their name for chartered shipping and then billing it at their chosen price per tonne to the pool. All those things are now exposed. It is pretty interesting to note that, as farmers measured the cost of delivering their wheat to a storage, they started to buy silos and said, ‘I'll pay for them in three years.' Interestingly enough, the farmer co-op then lowered the price of storage. But they put a bit more on the price of loading a ship, where they have still got a monopoly at this stage. I have got farmers going out there now to protect their business, by their own right, by simply looking to alternative loading arrangements. They are talking to people with a woodchip belt and with an iron ore belt. They are looking to the development, which is being slowed down by the Barnett government-and I am after them about it-of the Buckeridge private port, where they will be able to get access to loading facilities ficient to load a shipload of great; that is getting on with it. If you are growing 5,000 or 10,000 tonnes of wheat, which is typical, and you can save $5 a tonne, it is a lot of money and it is the difference between going broke and not. The other matter I want to talk about at length is to do with the farmers' right to insure their return and to have a form of cash management, which is typical around the world. I would have preferred that to this legislation, but the minister has gone with a pilot scheme. But I will come back to that. The reality is that the farming sector in my electorate now realises where its costs can be reduced. On-farm, they have gone from, in my living memory, 40 horsepower tractors and a three-pass approach to putting a crop into 500 horsepower tractors and actually seeding dry on a certain date and waiting for the rain. That effectively adds about two inches of rainfall to their cropping period. They are doing all that. They have learned every form of no-till farming and all those things to make sure that they are as efficient on their property as they can be. But now we have got to improve their local roads so they can use bigger trucks, if necessary, to go all the way to port. Again, I thank the minister because I convinced John Kerin to deregulate the transport of export wheat and Mr Burke, the now incumbent Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, reincluded that provision in the wheat marketing legislation, meaning that a farmer cannot be captured any more by a grossly inefficient rail system. When that came in under Mr Kerin, the then state government regulated rail authority of previous years thought it might be a good idea to put a loop down at Kwinana where the major exporter port is so they could actually bring a train back while a full one was going down. They sufdid not care about that while there was a wheat. That is all regulation. CBH is a good organisation. Its executive know that they have got to get it cheaper. At the moment and at present rates, if they do not get eight million tonnes of wheat into their system each year, they cannot even break even. These are the issues that are being exposed by the government's decision to deregulate the market and generate the transparency that is now allowing farmers to do it. I was a most unpopular boy in my electorate at the last election. Funnily enough, the two parties that supported deregulation were the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, and we still got 66 per cent of the vote. Fortunately, I got nearly 50 per cent. But the fact of life is that, in these circumstances, people did not thank us. As I said, we still have the Neanderthals parading outside the parliament when farmers in my electorate are already making more money because it is deregulated, because they can negotiate a price or they can choose the old-fashioned pooling system. They are better represented now because their co-op owns shares in flour mills overseas, which will not guarantee the price but will certainly guarantee a sale, and in the present environment we have a very significant oversupply of wheat and grain around the world, driven I might add by one year's spike in prices. Farmers, who typically and in recent years would have looked at a tonne of wheat per hectare as the break-even point, last year had to harvest two tonnes per hectare because of price and other influences. For much of the so-called better part of the area, there was a very bad finish and they did not get it. In region it is estimated by a constituent of mine, whose estimates I trust, that they lost $1 billion. Individual farms lost half a million dollars. If they do not get a good crop this year, then things could be very dangerous. Consequently, the response of governments around the world is to give support to what is generally referred to as multiperil crop insurance. That can be delivered in many ways. Typically, around the world it is underwritten. In other words, if the losses of the private insurers exceed a certain point, then governments come in and pay. I will make further comment about that. Multiperil crop insurance is compulsory in South Africa. You cannot put a crop in without giving evidence that you have insured it. So you literally bet with the insurer against your crop being less than one tonne per hectare, two tonne per hectare or whatever. I believe that, consistent with our policy on private health insurance, government funding would be best delivered upfront as a subsidy on that premium to make it attractive because, as we know with any form of insurance, the higher the rate of participation the lower the premium cost. Let us say the premium cost was-and this is purely a subjective figure-10 per cent. That would probably be beyond its worth. But at the moment farmers are deemed by the banking sector to be high-risk lending and they charge them accordingly-typically four or five per cent over what a home owner would pay for a home mortgage rate. Of course, if they have a bad crop, the friendly banker says, ‘You are an even worse risk now and you are struggling to pay me back, so I will charge you more.' It is a policy I have never been able to understand, but the reality is that, if a farmer went into his lender and said, ‘Here is my insurance policy, backed in a fashion by the that government, which says I will recover the full amount of your loan even if I get no crop at all,' how can the bank then say, ‘You are a bad risk'? One might say in that example that five or six per cent of that 10 per cent would be offset by interest rates. In my mind, this is a much better response. And, having congratulated the government on trying something new, might I say that there is a substantial accent in this pilot program relating to assisting people off their properties. Of course I do not think that should be the purpose of legislation, but I understand the reasoning. The words ‘to depart with dignity' are used, and for some people the circumstances are beyond retrieval. But I am saying that if this House were to legislate a progressive and transitional arrangement, even in legislation of this nature, to give farmers the option of a subsidised or underwritten insurance scheme by which they could cover their input costs or such greater amount for which they were prepared to pay a premium, then in fact their security would be guaranteed. This occurs in Canada, it occurs in the United States, it occurs in many parts of the world. It is a common practice. It is interesting. There have been numerous inquiries into this particular system, all designed to fail. In fact, one in Western Australia used as an excuse the fact that they sent out something like 1,300 or 1,500 survey forms to farmers to see if they would participate and they then said, ‘No, farmers aren't interested; they only sent 230 forms back.' I am surprised it was 230. You know what farmers do with survey forms; they chuck them in the bin. To use that as a judgment when they had figures in there that said that the premium rates could fall to two per cent if there were high levels of participationnow I am not recommending the South African system of compulsory participation but, if it happened, that would be extremely cheap. The thing has to be risk rated; cannot have a flat premium structure, because some properties represent a higher risk than others. Funnily enough, in the last couple of years in my electorate the so-called marginal country to the north has been doing pretty good after some very dry years, but the safe country has got another problem. It is called frost. One day they have a magnificent crop standing in their fields just maturing to head, and the frost comes along overnight and wipes it out. Unfortunately, and I think unwisely, in better times for cropping and with all the efficiencies achieved, many farmers walked away from their livestock component, their mixed farming component. At the moment they are all rushing to get back into sheepnot to sell the wool, but to sell the meat, which there is an ever-increasing international demand, particularly in the United States where the Latino population prefers mutton to beef. That is changing the buying habits of the United States, and of course they are such a huge consumer. We are talking now over $100 per lamb, and that in itself would make the difference. All of this comes into the management process, but more particularly, considering the huge costs involved in putting a crop in and the past variations, farmers need a system that initially must be supported by government. My view is that all the EC outlays could be transferred to that, but there would be a double whammy period for government because you cannot say to those, particularly in the Eastern States, who are still on EC, ‘You get off it and go and insure yourself.' No, you have to phase those sorts of people out. Maybe this is a step in that direction because it talks about self-reliance. I think we should be moving in that direction and, in the first instance, having a cost-neutral arrangement progressively so that the ongoing EC funding is committed to either a premium you just subsidy or an underwriting. It is funny. When I talk about all of these concerns, the insurance industry in Australia have typically said, ‘It's all too hard, we don't want to be part of it.' Yet I am pretty sure I read the other day that QBE have bought a company in the United States or Canada that specialises in crop insurance. I think they paid $700 million for it or something. So obviously they think those companies over there are profitable, but that is probably because of government underwriting. I congratulate the government on trying to do it better because exceptional circumstances is a dog and it does not work and it was very unfair, but I would say to the government and I would say to my colleagues, for as I do frequently, that we need to take another step and give people proper selfsufficiency through being able to insure, as everybody else does, and protect their actual asset through insuring their crop production. And if that requires some government assistance in the first instance, I think it would be worthwhile. (Time expired)",82
37,Dr KELLY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (1.36 pm)-I thank the member for O'Connor for his comments. I would like to echo what he has had to say in relation to the exceptional circumstances regime, based on the experiences of my own region. I would also like to congratulate the minister, Minister Burke; he has been an outstanding Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He has tremendous competence, and his straight talking and honesty have been well-received by all the men and women on the land who I talk to. This Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010 is very welcome, setting up this pilot project. It is a pilot of drought policy or risk policy, if you like, because we need to move away from an exceptional circumstances system that is based on consequence management to a risk management approach to better arm our farmers for the future. As has been mentioned, this trial will be operating in Western Australia from 1 July this year to 30 June 2011. They will have access to the same welfare related ancillary benefits as those receivvestments ing exceptional circumstances relief payments. All this includes the automatically issued healthcare card and concessional income and asset testing for youth allowance-so important, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, in relation to rural and regional areas in particular-and the farm family support scheme will be demand driven. As part of the trial, we will continue to provide income support to help eligible farmers facing hardship to meet basic household expenses. That support is provided under the farm family support measure. The assistance is available regardless of the cause of hardship, which is another important point. Due to the complex nature of the income support legislation and the short-term nature of the program, farm family support payments will be delivered through an executive scheme arrangement under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. This bill will amend the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to effectively treatthat is, deem-farm family support as if it were exceptional circumstances relief payments for the purpose of providing access to a range of measures. The farm support scheme that we are introducing in this trial includes farm family support, which is income support for basic household expenses, and farm social support, which will be directed towards stronger social networks for mental health and other social needs-mental health being a huge issue in the rural and regional areas, especially during these stressful years of the drought that we have had. For farm planning, farmers will be able to access $7,500 to undertake training to develop or to produce a strategic plan for their farm business. Building on that we will have funding available for grants of up to $60,000 for on-farm inidentified as a consequence of the strategic planning that will help them apply that strategic plan. We also support stronger rural communities, so there will be grants to local councils for activities that make rural communities more resilient during the agricultural downturns that they may experience. If the worse comes to the worse, we will have the farm exit support grants of up to $170,000 for farmers who decide to sell their farms because they are no longer viable. Then we have a beyond farming component, which puts current and former farmers in touch to discuss opportunities outside of farming and help to make that transition much easier. This is far superior to what we have had with exceptional circumstances. My region is a perfect illustration of the downfalls of that system. It is important to note, though, that that system will continue as this trial progresses, so all those receiving exceptional circumstances support now will continue to receive that support until we can determine how well this trial has gone and where we need to go from there. In my region, we suffered badly from the blunt instrument approach of exceptional circumstances. Partly this is because you tend to reinforce failure by not having an approach that looks at the real reasons for why particular farms might be in debt and whether or not they are in fact viable, but it is also because of the artificial lines on maps. In my region, which is now totally drought affected or marginally affected, you had boundaries that were drawn all the way up to the Sydney Basin, where the rainfall was much greater than was occurring in the Bega Valley or the Eurobodalla shire, for example. In fact, last year was the driest year on record in the Bega Valley. This has been compounded, of course, by the effects of climate change because the increasing temperatures have affected ground moisture quite severely. So whatever rain that was falling was rapidly evapotranspirating or not being soaked into the soil, which also gets back to another factor in the degradation of our soils through the loss of carbon in the soil. I will come back to that. We also have the situation where, having tried to refine it a little more, we managed to get the Bega Valley under an exceptional circumstances declaration but the Eurobodalla farmers missed out. So you would have a qualifying farm that would effectively be right next door to a farm in the Bega Valley that would not qualify for exceptional circumstances relief because of the artificial lines on the maps. These are just a couple of illustrations of why the system was just dysfunctional and not worth continuing with. There must be a better way and this trial will help lead us there. It is part of a raft of support measures government has taken to support the men and women on the land. We truly have become the farmer's friend through these many measures. Through Australia's Farming Future, for example, we have a four-year initiative that features four programs delivering research and development, training, capacity building, adjustment advice and assistance. We have the Climate Change Research Program, which funds research development and demonstration projects to help primary producers to manage climate change, reduce emissions and improve productivity-and quite often these measures relating to climate change are associated with better productivity. We have the FarmReady program supporting training opportunities for primary producers, enabling industry to develop strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change. I will come back to that. We will have the community networks and capacity building aspect, which aims to build the leadership and representative capacity of target groups to strengthen community resilience and the productivity of primary industries. These groups include women, youth and Indigenous Australians. Under the Climate Change Adjustment Program, there is professional advice available and training delivered to individuals to help tailor individual farm businesses to adjust to climate change, set goals and develop action plans to improve their financial circumstances, either within or outside of agriculture. There is also the Caring for our Country scheme, which carries over $2 billion of funding over its first five years and is particularly aimed at natural resource management. It seeks to achieve an environment that is healthy, better protected, well managed and resilient and provides essential ecosystem services in a changing climate. Caring for our Country is delivered in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders. The Austhis tralian government encourages information sharing and cooperation at individual, regional and national levels through this program. It focuses in particular on six national priority areas. These include national reserve systems; biodiversity and natural icons; coastal environments and critical aquatic habitats; sustainable farm practices, very importantly, including through the Landcare mechanisms; natural resource management in remote and Northern Australia; and community skills, knowledge and engagement. The Caring for our Country sustainable farm practices national priority area in particular seeks to assist farmers and fishers to increase their uptake of sustainable resource management practices that deliver improved ecosystem services; increase the number of farmers adopting stewardship and covenanting property management plans or other arrangements to improve the environment both on farm and off farm; and improve the knowledge, skills and engagement of Landcare managers, farmers and fishers in managing our natural resources and the environment. The Landcare component covers off on many different areas, and these include Landcare projects-specifically, community based projects-also sustainable practice projects, the national network of Landcare facilitators, a $2.6 million program over four years to support the uptake of sustainable fisheries practices, and the community action grants. There was a bit of a scare campaign running at one point that the Landcare budget had been reduced in this year's budget. This should be laid to rest very clearly. That is simply not the case. The Landcare budget increased from $35 million in last year's budget to $36 million in 201011 and to $39 million in the further outyears. Caring for our Country funding also increased for next financial year by $15 million to $423 million for that year. So the Landcare funding situation is well and truly secure. Our FarmReady training program-this is a particularly good program which many farmers in New South Wales are taking advantage of-provides $1,500 each year for farmers and their families, with extra funding for travel, accommodation and child care, and equips primary producers with tools to manage and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The sorts of courses that are available address particular key learning areas, and these include the implications of climate change, integrating new techniques, natural resource planning, farm business management, on-farm research and analysis, strategic planning, holistic whole-farm planning, financial management and human resource management. Under this scheme there are 500 courses now approved nationally; 225 are available on demand anywhere in Australia. More than 12,300 farmers had signed up as of 9 April this year. It is a very successful program. I know that in New South Wales alone 120 courses have been created targeting regional New South Wales. This includes face-to-face and online support by phone or email. It covers a vast range of areas which include dairy; risk management; compost tea-I have never tried any of that, but it sounds interesting; farm planning; computerised mapping; quality and food safety; grains; healthy soils; water management; weed control; permaculture; organic farming; irrigated lucerne; environmental performance; managing people and projects; transition to resilience; and profiting from soil carbon, among many others. I am also very proud of what we have done in relation to the weeds threat. This is something that just simply is not well understood in metropolitan Australia-but I am sure you understand it very well, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. It is a big challenge for my region. We face issues to do with the serrated tussock, African lovegrass, St John's wort, Paterson's curse and in particular the insidious threat of fireweed. Fireweed is a particular problem because it is a toxic plant that will kill not only animals but people as well. Originating from southern Africa, it has been given a leg-up by the drier conditions in recent years. If it were to spread more widely in Australia it could create a dire threat to our agricultural sector. I have seen estimates that range from $4 billion for the cost to our agrilenge cultural sector of weeds annually. So it was a big problem and I was distressed-and no doubt there were members on the other side who would have been distressed-that the weeds CRC was going to be canned under the Howard policy. I am very proud that through heavy lobbying I have managed to save a scheme targeting weeds, which is the $15.3 million that we have allocated over four years to establish the new comprehensive National Weeds and Productivity Research program, which will reduce the impact of invasive plants on farm and forestry productivity and also, importantly, on biodiversity. The program focuses on improving the management of invasive plants in agriculture, forests, pastures and native vegetation by investigating the most serious invasive plant problems in Australia, uniting national experts, land managers and stakeholders to improve the understanding of how to manage the risks associated with invasive plants. It also ensures better coordinagion-had tion and information exchange between researchers, land managers and regulatory agencies for the management of invasive plants. Also, I am very proud that under this productivity research program we have already funded 39 weed research projects worth nearly $3.6 million. These projects build on existing work and also enhance the innovation of approaches to the management of weeds. I am particularly pleased that I was able to secure $300,000 specifically for the fireweed problem. Many of my own family are dairy farmers down in the Bega Valley, which seems to be the epicentre of the fireweed problem. So this $300,000 will help build on the research that had been previously undertaken into this insidious threat. This brings us back to a focus on where this challenge is emanating from for our farmers. It certainly comes back to climate change but also to the isolation of the chalfarmers face in dealing with dry conditions from crises over the years. So what we need to get to-from my old military background-is a situation of planning for the worse-case scenario, enabling our farmers to survive and profit or to be able to take advantage of the good times and sustain their operations during the bad times. In the eastern half of Australia we experienced a long, dry situation from 1895 to 1948, and it got wetter from 1948 through to 1976. But now we have been on this downward cycle. It has been compounded by the higher temperatures of climate change which, as I mentioned, has affected this ground moisture situation. There is a debate about whether rainfall is affected by climate change. This is an ongoing debate and an open question. I did note that the CSIRO recently did research which revealed that the subtropical ridge-which is affecting south-east Australia in particular and the Murray-Darling Basin and my rebeen intensifying and resulting in lower rainfall. The only way that they could replicate that effect in their modelling was by introducing human-induced or anthropogenic carbon emissions, climate change factors. So there seems to be some suggestion that that may well be the case. But, as I mention, whatever the case, the higher temperatures are having a dramatic impact on ground moisture. I also mentioned previously that the situation has been exacerbated in that respect by the deterioration of the carbon content of our soil. Carbon in the soil helps to retain the moisture. It also, of course, is a nutrient for our crops. I know from my own family's experience that they are having to lay on more phosphate than previously to get the same results from their pastures. This is a direct result of the deterioration of carbon in our soil. So we are having this combined effect of the higher temperatures, greater evapotranspiration and deterioration of carbon in the soil. My farmers are not sitting still. On their own initiative they are doing some great work out there. There is a fantastic group called Monaro Farming Systems. This is a group of farmers who have gathered together to combine with the CSIRO to develop a modelling tool called Grassgro to help them manage their properties. This tool enables them to examine strategic decisions on their farming systems and to look at the effect of anticipated weather conditions over long cycles so that they can plan their herd sizes and their pasture management around that. It is proving to be a powerful facility for analysing risk. This has given my farmers great mental reassurance because one of their problems was not knowing what to do. Uncertainty was creating even more mental stress. So this tool is not only helping them plan better as a business but also helping them deal with the mental stress emerging from the challenge that they are facing. I salute the team-David Mitchell and the crew and the CSIRO-for their support for Monaro Farming Systems. I am looking forward to having the minister meet with the group soon. I would hope to network this initiative in order to get the information and the strategies that these farmers are engaged in more widely known in the broader farming community. It will show that there is something that we can do to plan for these circumstances and that there is information out there on how to manage the risk. Another great initiative in my region is the change. Bega Cheese environmental management systems project. Ms Plibersek-The Bega factory.",86
38,Dr KELLY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,Our Bega Cheese factory is a wonderful icon for the country and for our region. Ms Plibersek-The trade visitors centre.,91
39,Dr KELLY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"There is a beautiful visitors centre, with wonderful pictures on the wall that include a photo of my great, greatgrandfather who founded the Bega Cheese Co-op and who was its first chairman. It is a wonderful part of our community and history. The Bega Cheese environmental management systems project is doing wonderful stuff with all of the members of the former co-op and now publicly listed company. They have identified environmental risks on 22 dairy farms. They have invested $2 million of public money and leveraged $6 million of private money. They have delivered approximately 75 on-ground projects, including 83 kilometres of riparian wetland fencing to protect approximately 300 hectares of riparian land; 124 hectares of revegetation and remnant vegetation management; 197 offstream watering points; remediation of 13 priority erosion sites; 23 dairy laneway upgrades; 17 stream-crossing upgrades; 37 effluent systems upgrades; soil testing and nutrient mapping across 90 farms; and a very exciting dung beetle assessment across 22 properties. That is a really interesting outcome from those projects. I salute what Bega Cheese and the farmers who are participating in that program have done. I was lucky enough to be at the presentation ceremonies of certificates to the farmers for what they have done under that scheme. There are things that farmers can do and are doing for themselves-and we should not think that they are not and that they are not alert to the challenges of climate Finally, I come back to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We need to come back to this in the new parliament because it will help us to address this carbon in the soil issue. We need to unlock the investment that will flow from the CPRS and invest it programs that will help to get that carbon back into the soil. Various techniques and possibilities exist out there for helping us to achieve that. We need to get the CPRS in there to unleash all that potential investment, including in relation to reforestation. It will assist in this as well. It could also help with range of other things like the wingless grasshopper problem that I had just recently, which gets a leg-up from the lack of vegetation in the area. We must take on board the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.",91
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,Order! The time of the parliamentary secretary with the cheesy grin from Bega has expired. I had to put that one in for you!,92
41,Mr RAMSEY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. Just before the Parliamentary Secretary for Water leaves the chamber, I would like to say to him in the most helpful terms I possibly can what farmers would generally do-I was a farmer before I came into this Houseabout deficiencies in the soil. You should say to your family on these dairy farms that what we do when we have a phosphorous deficiency is put phosphorous on the soil. When we have a nitrogen deficiency, we put nitrogen on the soil. We would not address a nitrogen deficiency by putting phosphorous on the soil, because that would probably lead to acidification. When you talk with your family, get this matter straightened out and that will be a good starting point. This bill has my support in so much as it is focuses on trying to improve farm business models. It is an attempt to improve on the exceptional circumstances scheme that we have been working with for some years to address drought in Australia. The trial in Western Australia is an opportunity to see whether or not it is a viable model. I must say that I am not a great fan of the exceptional circumstances scheme, which may come as a surprise to some people as I am someone who represents a large area of Australia that has been suffering from drought. But I am not a fan of this scheme largely a because of the inconsistent way in which the assistance is provided, the distortions in the market caused by these inconsistencies and the ability of some and not others to access the exceptional circumstances package. For instance, boundaries are well defined but you may fall on the wrong side of a boundary. There are also different financial structures in any particular farm which may or may not give you access to the kind of help you might need to survive. I have regular contact with a number of rural councillors and most of them are of the opinion that it is in fact far harder to get exceptional circumstances assistance in South Australia than it is in the other states-in particular, New South Wales. I think that is brought about by the primary industries in South Australia that tend to have a different view on some of these things. Access to EC actually causes a great number of conflicts in a district between those who receive the assistance and those who do not. However, having said all that-and I have raised this issue before-I am campaigning to restart the exceptional circumstances scheme for some areas in my electorate, largely because I feel that we have dragged these people halfway across the desert and now we have abandoned them, areas around Cleve, Cowell, Arno Bay, Ceduna and the upper north cropping district. As I have just said, there are some difficulties with EC in that it can be inconsistent. The EC was cancelled in these areas last year after a visit in November by NRAC, the National Rural Advisory Council. NRAC advised that the drought was over, but clearly for those districts, which I have raised with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the drought was not over. In fact, for those confined areas the better year passed them by entirely. NRAC visited the upper north cropping district in November and within a week that district was faced with a heatwave.",92
42,The SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted. The adjourned debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour this day, and the member will have leave to continue his contribution. NA Private Timothy James Aplin Private Benjamin Adam Chuck Private Scott Travis Palmer",93
43,Mr RUDD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House record its deep regret at the deaths on 21 June 2010 of Private Timothy James Aplin, Private Benjamin Adam Chuck and Private Scott Travis Palmer while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of their service to our country and tender profound sympathy to their families in their bereavement. I wish to express heartfelt condolences to Private Aplin's wife, Natasha; his children, Ty, Shenae, Josie and Daniel; and his mother, Margaret. I also wish to express heartfelt condolences to Private Chuck's parents, Gordon and Susan; his brother, Jason; his sister, Tiffany; and his partner, Tess. I wish to express heartfelt condolences as well to Private Palmer's parents, Ray and Pam, and his brother, Adam. I wish to express my deepest sympathy to the extended families and friends of these three brave men. I also express my sympathy and support to the members of the Special Operations Task Group, who continue to serve our country with distinction in Afghanistan; the men and women of the 2nd Commando Regiment; and the seven commandos who were wounded in the incident that took the lives of their fellow soldiers. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer were experienced Special Forces soldiers who had faced the dangers of combat on multiple tours to Afghanistan. For Private Aplin, this was his second tour of Afghanistan; for Private Chuck and for Private Palmer, it was their third. They faced the dangers of combat in Afghanistan with courage, with professionalism and with honour. They were highly trained commandos and valued members of the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. Private Timothy Aplin was a loving husband and father. He was an outstanding and dedicated commando who was rightly respected and known to always put others first. Private Benjamin Chuck was a courageous and accomplished soldier. According to his mother, Susan, he was focused on what he was doing, even though he knew it was dangerous, and he did it with the utmost pride. its Private Scott Palmer excelled at everything he did, and his professionalism was of the highest order. He loved his job and loved working alongside his mates. Australia is proud of these three outstanding commandos. The loss of Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer will be felt by their nation, by the Australian Defence Force and, most deeply, by their families and their friends. These three men lost their lives in the service of their nation. The nation will honour their sacrifice and will honour their memory. Our soldiers in Afghanistan are doing an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances, and they are doing a vital job. Our troops are playing an important role in coalition operations in Afghanistan. Those operations are aimed at providing greater security for the people of Afghanistan by tackling the insurgent threat. Our troops are also working to build the capacity of the Afghan security forces so that responsibility for the security of Oruzgan Province can be transferred to the Afghan authorities. It is in our national interest for this work to be national interest to help Afghanistan become more stable and secure so that it does not again fall into becoming a safe haven for international terrorism. Our troops in the field in Afghanistan are defending our national interest and our national security. Today we honour those who have lost their lives by again restating our commitment to the cause for which they were fighting. On behalf of the Australian government and all members of the House, we offer our prayers and our support for Private Aplin's, Private Chuck's and Private Palmer's families, their friends and their fellow soldiers. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",93
44,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES,"I support the statement of the Prime Minister. Privates Tim Aplin, Ben Chuck and Scott Palmer were all fine soldiers who had served with distinction on previous assignments in Afghanistan. We salute them. We send our prayers and best wishes also to their wounded comrades. Knowing something of the spirit of the Australian Army, I suspect that these casualties would have only hardened the resolve of our soldiers to fight the good fight and to stay the course. They should not shake our commitment to achieving a more just society in Afghanistan and ensuring that it can never again be used as a base for terrorism.

48,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his January 2007 statement that the mining boom had ‘piled in billions of dollars to this country'; to his March 2007 statement that the mining boom ‘is pumping up the national economy'; to his April 2007 statement that our current economic circumstances ‘are propped up by the mining boom'; and to his May 2008 statement to the Minerals Council that the boom ‘has contributed massively to national income and to the Australian economy at large'. Why then did the Treasurer say yesterday that the Australian people have actually been shortchanged by the mining sector? And if the mining boom has been so good for the country, why is the Prime Minister now determined to kill it?",94
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition can never resist a triumph of rhetoric over logic.,95
50,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,95
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,95
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to the contribution of the mining sector to the future of the Australian economy, one fact, and one fact alone, should confront the Leader of the Opposition if he is faintly interested in facts. That fact is as follows. Last year, on the question of jobs, the mining industry in fact cut employment by nearly 16 per cent. That is what happened as the rest of the economy sought to grow employment. That was noone's responsibility in particular. It is, however, a fact when it comes to jobs. Secondly, what the Treasurer has also referred to is the fact that the profitability of some of our largest mining companies has increased exponentially across the decade on the back of rising commodity prices yet the return to tax through the form of royalties has not kept pace. That causes us to conclude that tax reform is necessary to make a difference. Thirdly, on the question of what that tax reform would therefore fund, support and invest in-providing better super to 7½ million Australians, providing tax breaks for 2.4 million Australian small businesses, a two percentage point cut in the corporate rate for Australian corporations-it would include, of course, other investments as well, not least of which would be in infrastructure, concerning the infrastructure needs of the resource states in particular. Finally, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, the challenge for this economy and the challenge for the future is to make sure that we have a globally competitive economy across the field. That means for every sector of the economy-our manufacturing industries, our service industries, all of whom have been doing it tough with a high Australian dollar, all of whom can benefit from a reduction in the company rate, all of whom can be benefited also by a range of other measures. But none of this happens for free. You have got to obtain the revenue source to fund it by other means. That is why we are proposing tax reform. That is why this government will get on with the business of tax reform. Health",95
53,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's key reform of delivering a National Health and Hospital Network to Australian families?,95
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Today the government released the 2010 edition of Australia's health. This is a major report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on the health of Australians. It bears some reading because it points to a critical factor, which is the impact of chronic diseases in our country. Diabetes is now three times as common as it was 20 years ago. Up to 32 per cent of all potentially avoidable hospital admissions are for people with diabetes. Secondly, the overall cancer rate has increased by four per cent in the decade to 2006 and it is projected that the number of new cases of cancer in 2010 will be around 115,000. That is a 10 per cent increase on 2006. Thirdly, 61 per cent of adults and 25 per cent of children were either overweight or obese in 2007-08 and the rate among children has been doubling and more than doubling over the last two decades. The reason I emphasise these three conclusions of the health report by the AIHW is that, together with the ageing of the population, it underpins what we have now got to do with the reform of Australia's health and hospital system. What we have had is the number of hospital admissions rising by 37 per cent in the decade to 2007-08. Health expenditure across our nation passed $100 billion for the first time in 2007-08, reaching $103.6 billion. Our hospitals cannot be expected to continue to shoulder the burden which arises from the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases together with the other admissions to our hospital system. That is why we need national health and hospitals reform. That is why the government today introduced landmark pieces of legislation to deal with this challenge, to help deliver the range of reforms that we have outlined through the National Health and Hospitals Network-a network which will be funded nationally and run locally. The Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill 2010 will see the Commonwealth dedicate a third of GST revenue into the hospital system. It means that each time any Australian pays a dollar's worth of GST at the shops, 33c of that will be dedicated to health and hospitals system. That is an important reform because that funding helps deliver better outcomes for accident and emergency, better outcomes for elective surgery, better outcomes in terms of available hospital beds, better outcomes in terms of the availability of doctors and nurses in our system. Under this reform the Australian government will take on 60 per cent of the efficient price for all public hospitals, 60 per cent of the buildings and equipment needs of our public hospitals and 60 per cent of the research and training undertaken in our public hospitals. And for the first time the Commonwealth will also become the sole funder of GP and primary health care and of agedcare services as well. The legislation today will remove the incentive to shunt patients from Commonwealth funded GP and primary-care services into the state funded hospital system. This is the blame game. It must be brought to a stop. The way in which you bring it to a stop is to resolve the fundamental funding arrangements which underpin the distribution of responsibilities between the Australian government and the states. The new funding arrangements will mean no more blame between governments about indexation rates and no more arbitrary cuts to indexation rates, as have happened in the past. There was a further piece of health reform today. The government moved legislation to establish the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare. This will help reduce the harm caused by preventable errors, reduce healthcare costs resulting from unnecessary or ineffective treatments and formulate safety and quality standards with clinicians, professional bodies and consumers. Building on the foundation of this national system, the government is now investing $7.4 billion, starting on 1 July, to in the crease our capacity and to deliver more doctors, nurses and beds. This includes 1,300 new beds, 2,500 new aged-care beds or places, a four-hour target waiting time for treatment for accident and emergency and elective surgery being delivered on time for 95 per cent of patients. If you do not receive elective surgery within that clinically recommended time, you will receive free treatment at a public or private hospital. We are also funding 6,000 new doctors over the decade ahead, providing better financial support for 4,500 nurses and providing upgrades to around 425 GP and primary care clinics around the country. These are fundamental reforms, fundamental reforms that cost money and that therefore require reform to Australian Commonwealth-state financial relations. The legislation introduced by the government will underpin the future investment in the health and hospital needs of Australia for the decade ahead. Had we not acted, our advisers concluded that there was a grave danger that our system would reach a tipping point. That is the government's plan. It is a cut strategy. The alternative, as we know, is a Leader of the Opposition who as health minister ripped a billion dollars out of the system. We are growing the system by the investments that we have proposed to deliver better health and better hospitals to all Australians. Budget",95
55,Mr BRIGGS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Penrice Soda, which employs over 300 people at its Angaston mine and Osborne manufacturing plan in South Australia. In the last five years, this company has invested over $130 million in capital projects. I refer the Prime Minister to a letter from Penrice Soda that states: … the new proposed tax would have a major and immediate impact on the competitiveness of our mining and chemical manufacturing operations … local communities will also be damaged. Instead of the minor backflips and political fixes that the Prime Minister will announce in the coming days, when will the Prime Minister listen to real people in real businesses and provide real jobs and just dump this tax?",97
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mayo for his question. Part of his question dealt with the competitiveness of the Australian mining industry. I draw the member for Mayo's attention again to what is happening around the world. Since 2 May, Australian resources have fallen by just under one per cent on the stock exchange here. Canadian resources are down two per cent, Brazilian resources are down 10 per cent and United States resources are down eight per cent. I therefore suggest to the member for Mayo that, when he suggests a particular connection between tax reform proposals here and the confidence of markets in the Australian resources sector, the facts stand in the way of clearthe fear campaign which those opposite are seeking to perpetrate. Furthermore, I say in response to the honourable member's question that this government is committed to tax reform and to doing it through a process of consultation and negotiation with the industry. Since the announcement of the tax, the Treasury panel has engaged some 80 companies across the country. On top of that, ministers, including the resources minister, the Treasurer and I, have met representatives of the mining industry on numerous occasions for consultations and negotiations. The government, as we have said repeatedly, is working to reach a balanced outcome with the industry. A balanced outcome necessarily involves a proper consideration of the national interest. The government is committed to the framework that it has put forward. The framework is a profits based tax, a 40 per cent tax, a tax that also applies to existing projects and a tax capable of delivering the revenue to meet the government's policy priorities and to broaden the base of our economy. I have no doubt that many of the big mining companies will not embrace any outcome that would see them paying more tax. No doubt they would be joined by those opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, who thinks that these companies are paying too much tax already. At the end of the day, the government is interested in a sensible and balanced outcome that supports the future of the industry, that delivers tax reform and that-critically-improves the overall competitiveness of the Australian economy by improving the company rate and the small business rate and by boosting the superannuation earnings of 7½ million Australian workers. Mr Briggs-I seek leave to table the letter from Penrice Soda. Leave not granted.",97
57,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What developments in recent days have provided support for the case for a profit based tax? Why is the government determined to implement a profits based tax on resources despite opponents to reform?,98
58,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A profits based tax is in our national interest. The future of the mining industry is bright. In recent days, we have seen the forecasts from ABARE in their quarterly outlook for commodity exports released yesterday. Minerals and energy export earnings are forecast to increase by 29 per cent, or almost $38 billion, in 2010-11 and hit $170 billion. You would not get a sense of that if you were listening to the scare campaign that is being waged by a few large mining companies. The fact is, there are very bright prospects for our mining industry. That is why we have put forward a very sensible proposition for a profits based tax. In the last day, the Western Australian Premier has jacked up royalties substantially-to the tune of $300 million. Did we hear anything about that from those opposite? No, we did not. Did we hear anything about retrospectivity? No, we did not. Did we hear anything about it suppressing investment? No, we did not. And that is because our mining industry is very profitable. It is very profitable on an elevated terms of trade that is going to stay that way for some time to come. The Australian people are entitled to get a fair share of those elevated of trade. Those opposite just want the profit to walk out the door and to be lost to the Australian people forever. What we want to do with the proceeds of a profits based tax is to invest those in strengthening and broadening our economy, as the Prime Minister was saying before. Nevertheless, we continue to get these Budget scare campaigns. I see that the Queensland Resources Council is out today predicting doom and gloom. But at the same time the Queensland government is saying that there are strong mining exploration applications and that they have been unaffected by the RSPT. We saw the US coal group Peabody last week talk about a very substantial expansion in Australia. And of course we have seen the Association of Superannuation Trustees blow the whistle on this scare campaign, calling it scaremongering and irresponsible. And irresponsible it is. What gives the lie to that irresponsibility are these forecasts from ABARE. What they demonstrate is the absolute irresponsibility of those opposite, who say that the mining companies are paying too much tax. So we have this ridiculous position where those opposite are saying that the miners pay too much tax while some miners are saying that they could pay a bit more. But of course there are some companies that those opposite are in league with that will never agree to pay more because they are not interested in pursuing the national interest. The Australian people are entitled to get a fair share of the boom in commodity prices that is going to last for some time. That does bring great opportunities to our country but it also brings challenges. So on our part we are having a sensible discussion and negotiation with the mining industry, because we are determined to get a balanced outcome for a 40 per cent profits based tax-a 40 per cent profits based tax that can deliver the revenue so we can give a business tax cut to all the terms companies in Australia, so we can do something about investing in infrastructure and so we can do something about boosting our national savings, which is very important for our long-term prosperity. The final word today about a profits based tax comes from the deputy head of the IMF, who said in Sydney today that he ‘supported it in principle'. An opposition member-Do you?",98

But of course it does not surprise me, given the extremism that you have on the opposition front-bench-their desire to bring back Work Choices and their desire to watch this windfall profit walk out of the door, of no benefit to the Australian people. We will stand up for the national interest in this debate. We will stand up for the long-term national interest of this country. This is what the IMF said. It will stand up for the workers.

69,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the right Prime Minister to his previous answer on what is happening in the mining industry around the world. I refer to the comments of Gordon Peeling, Chief Executive of the Mining Association of Canada, who said this week in relation to the government's great big new tax on mining: … probably makes Kevin Rudd the mining man of the year in Canada, because he'll bring a lot of investment our way. Does the Prime Minister intend picking up his award when in Toronto next week for the G20 meeting?",99

72,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the mining man of Australia award goes to the member for Dickson today, because the price that he bought at was $38.59 and today it is $39.12. Hear, hear, the member for Dickson! Here is a man who puts his confidence in the government's policy-buys in and sees his share price go up. When we look at those opposite, actions always speak louder than words and, secondly, facts also triumph over fear. When it comes to facts and fear, let me draw this to your attention. On the question of Canadian mining stocks, Australian resources, since the 2 May introduction of the government's tax proposal, have fallen one per cent; Canadian stocks have fallen two per cent. So, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dickson that we watch very carefully what those opposite do rather than what they say. We watched carefully what Clive Palmer did two days ago, when he initialled an agreement through his representative, in there with the Chinese-for a project of $5 billion to $6 billion, from memory. We also saw initialled, projects involving other Australian companies only two days ago. Fact and fiction. Fact and fear. I just think we should always observe the behaviour of the member for Dickson. He is a bellwether in terms of what those opposite actually think is going on in the mining industry rather than what they say is going on in the mining industry.",99
73,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism. Can the minister update the House about consultations with industry on the resource super profits tax.,100
74,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Oxley for his question. In doing so, I am pleased to advise the House that companies in both the petroleum and minerals sectors are seriously engaged in constructive discussions, not only with the Resource Tax Consultation Panel in Canberra this week, but also with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and me. I say that because they appreciate that megaphone diplomacy is not going to assist in working out the generous transitional arrangements that are available for the purposes of bedding down this major change in taxation in Australia. We all appreciate, as do many in the industry now, that there is going to be a resource super profits tax in Australia. It is also understood that is going to involve a headline rate of 40 per cent. The focus of these discussions is on delivering generous transitional arrangements that not only ensure that we have a capacity to gain for the broader Australian community a fairer share of the return on their natural resources, but also deliver measures that will broaden and strengthen the Australian economy. This is a reform that, unfortunately, the member for O'Connor does not appreciate the significance of. I say that because we are talking not just about a change with respect to the taxation of minerals and petroleum resources in Australia but also about how we as a nation front up to the all-important issues of superannuation payments, how we take pressure off retirement income, and how we lower the burden for Australia's 300,000 smaller businesses, many of whom are represented by the tourism sector, for which I also Budget have responsibility. When it comes to broadening our economic base, it is also about taking pressure off our resource-rich regions and the difficulties they are now experiencing on the infrastructure front. In that context, I say to those companies who are engaging in a very professional and constructive way with the government that we appreciate the way in which they are approaching those negotiations. They understand that this is an important reform and that the best way to inform the outcome is to engage in the process of consultation established by the government. They understand that, at the end of the day, there will be a transition, in association with the capacity to further attract ongoing investment with Australia, which will further enlarge the Australian economic cake. In the context of the discussions I also draw the House's attention to the huge price spikes that we have seen in recent years in such commodities as iron ore, where the price increases since 2004 have been over 500 per cent; and coal, where the price increases have ranged from 300 per cent to 400 per cent. Also, interestingly, there has been growth in world demand for petroleum and LNG products. These commodities will clearly deliver the vast bulk of the revenue under the RSPT and the PRRT. With respect to many other mineral resources, I simply remind the House, in a calm and measured way, they should appreciate that many of them will be better off under the proposed RSPT. Indeed, the RSPT actually involves a revenue loss for government and a tax cut for many companies that are mining less profitable commodities, because those companies will benefit from royalty refunds and the government's contribution to unutilised losses. Can I say in conclusion: the government is committed to this fundamental reform of Australia's resources taxation system. This will deliver not only opportunities for the resources sector but also many significant opportunities through the broadening of the Australian economy, while also taking pressure off the Australian economy for the purpose of future retirement incomes.",100
75,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement of Reserve Bank board member Professor Warwick MCKibbin that,101

79,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are passing a reflection on Professor MCKibbin. Professor MCKibben said: The government rammed stimulus measures through the economy even though they were fraught with risk. It wasn't evidence based policy. a They panicked. They put the money into school buildings; they put it into insulation. They put it in stuff that they could never reverse. So they came up with a really badly designed resource tax to try and get the position to look good three years from now. I ask the Prime Minister, is Professor MCKibben, in the words of your own Treasurer, ‘a liar or just ignorant'?",101
80,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, the government welcomes continued debate about the actions the government has taken to keep Australia out of recession. That is why I so much welcome this particular question from the member for North Sydney. He should pose himself some pretty basic questions. Based on the Treasury's analysis, had we not acted with stimulus, this economy would have gone into recession. Had we not acted with stimulus, 200,000-plus more Australians would be out of work. Had we not acted with stimulus, the impact on Australian small businesses would have been catastrophic, as it has been across the world. Has the member for North Sydney asked himself this question: why is it that Australia Budget now has the second lowest unemployment rate of all the major advanced economies, at 5.2 per cent? Why is it approximately half that of the United States, and approximately half that of the euro area? Had we generated the same unemployment rate-double-digit unemployment-that we have seen in those parts of the world, do you know how many more Australians would be out of work today? Half a million, Joe-half a million about whom you do not care.",101
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,102
82,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney shakes his head. If you go from 5.2 per cent, Joe, to 10 per cent, let me tell you it adds up to about half a million more people out of work. Now, you might regard that as a mere piece of collateral damage; we on this side of the House do not. We are proud of the fact that we intervened in the economy. We protected this economy. We made sure it did not go into recession. We acted in a way to keep unemployment low. We have done so with the lowest debt and lowest deficit of the major advanced economies and, on top of that, we have emerged with the secondlowest unemployment level of the major advanced economies. On the final part of the member for North Sydney's question-which underlines fundamentally how he has failed to engage in the detail of the debate on tax reform, because we know the member for North Sydney is not big on detail-the tax reform proposal put forward by the government is entirely directed towards the reforms of the taxation system for company tax, small business and investment in infrastructure, and associated measures in superannuation. The member for North Sydney knows that to be true. If he bothered to read the budget papers, he would know it has nothing to do with the budget bottom line; it is to do with tax reform. The government is proud of having intervened to assist the economy to remain out of recession. Many families out there in Australia are still doing it tough and many small businesses are doing it tough, but let me tell you: had those opposite prevailed, with their prescription for sitting on their hands and doing nothing, this country would be in the middle of mass unemployment. Budget",102
83,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is the presentation of costed, detailed policies crucial for Australia's future prosperity?",102
84,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question. The presentation of costed and detailed policies is crucial for Australia's longer term prosperity. That is why the government has put out detailed policies-detailed, costed plans-for long term sustainable growth for Australia's future, including investment in infrastructure, skills, health reform, deregulation, regulatory reform, the National Broadband Network and of course tax reform. All of these are components of a wider, detailed plan to build long-term sustainable growth for the Australian economy. Unfortunately, we have not heard a great deal from the opposition by way of detailed, costed policies. We have heard an awful lot from the Leader of the Opposition about what they would undo but very little about what they would do, were they to be elected. We have heard that they would cancel the computers in schools program, they would scrap the trades training centres. They would stop reforms to private health insurance, they would get rid of GP superclinics, they would abandon reforms to e-health that would make our health system more efficient. They would scrap the tax reforms that would deliver a lower company tax rate for Australian businesses, better superannuation, more infrastructure and better tax breaks for our small businesses. It is long overdue that we heard from the Leader of the Opposition what his economic strategy is, what his health reform strategy is, what his education reform strategy is, what his national security policy is. It is long overdue that we actually got some policy. I do confess that this area is not a complete void; there have one or two things announced-for example, the opposition's great big new tax to fund its Rolls Royce paid parental leave scheme for people on up to $150,000 a year. Interestingly enough, tax means that company tax for larger businesses in Australia would go to almost 32 per cent, in contrast to the government's proposal, which is that it would go to 28 per cent. Mr Speaker, if you have been watching the media over the last 24 hours, you would have noted that the United Kingdom, under the new coalition government headed by the Conservatives, have just decided to drop their company tax rate from 28 per cent to 24 per cent. What that indicates is that we as a nation do not have the luxury of time in responding to the pressures-that have been there for some time and that were put on hold for a period because of the global finanMinister cial crisis-about the headline rate of company tax. It is a very important reform to reduce the headline rate of company tax. This government is doing that. The opposition proposes to increase that rate. That is just one item. The second item I noticed over the past 24 hours was the Leader of the Opposition announcing the creation of a parliamentary budget office. This triggered some vague memories in the back of my mind, and I discovered that it was remarkably reminiscent of some very interesting email exchanges that occurred last year between Godwin Grech and various Liberal luminaries. It would appear that Godwin's ghost lives on! He is still drafting strategy for the opposition. Also, the Leader of the Opposition is out there making commitments for the period after the forward estimates end. Whether it is about road projects or pension indexation, he is out there saying to people, ‘Look, we'll do something about that beyond the forward estimates.' That is 2014. So what he is effectively saying is, ‘You've got to elect us twice before we deliver on our promises.' These are policies on lay-by. You front up and this commit initially and then you have to be voted in again before people actually get delivery! I am sorry, but this simply is not good enough. This is not good enough. We are within months of a national election. The Australian people are entitled to serious, detailed, costed positions from the opposition that they can form a view about and so they can make a decision about whether or not they want to take the risk of this erratic opposition leader running the Australian nation and our economy. That is a risk they cannot afford to take. Budget",102
85,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime to the statement by the minister for small business this morning on Radio 2UE: ‘Governments can have a bit of an influence on restraining price rises.' Given that in the last 12 months electricity has increased in price by 18 per cent, will the Prime Minister guarantee that the cost of electricity will not go up further as a result of his great big new tax on mining?",103
86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I endorse the remarks made by the minister for small business, and the reason I endorse them is that they go to the impact of competition policy-what can actually occur out there in the marketplace. I imagine, knowing the minister for small business very well, that he would have been talking about competition policy, because that is how you keep competitive pressures in the economy and keep prices low-and that is one of the principles for which we stand. A second way in which you can actually contain price rises is through effective consumer protection laws. I note the efforts recently by the minister for financial services to make sure that we have got proper consumer credit protection laws, the first national consumer credit law in the country, which brings together the conflicting jurisdictions of the states into a single form, bling consumers to have enhanced rights to deal with any exploitative behaviour towards them on the cost of credit and the conditions associated with credit. On the question of the impact on prices associated with the introduction of the government's proposed tax reforms, once again I would refer the member to the detailed findings and conclusions of the Treasury modelling.",103

I was recently in his electorate to make an announcement about our regional cancer services that are providing chemotherapy in Clare and in Gawler, both in his electorate, and also about a new linear accelerator at the Lyell MCEwin Hospital, so I know that he, enaalong with many others in the House, would have been interested to see in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report today that unfortunately the rate of cancer, and the diagnosis of cancer, is growing in our country. Unfortunately it shows us that we can expect, this year, that 115,000 Australians will be diagnosed with cancer, a 10 per cent increase on the figures from 2006. The good news is that we are getting better at detecting and treating cancers, and survival rates are improving. One of the reasons the government has invested so much in cancer services, particularly services in regional areas, is that the outcomes for those Australians who are diagnosed with cancer and live in rural and regional Australia are still significantly worse than the outcomes for Australians living in one of our capital cities if they are diagnosed with cancer. We were not prepared to let that difference continue. The government has also announced that it is taking very serious action when it comes to trying to reduce the rate of smoking tobacco. ToHealth bacco is a killer product. Unfortunately we still have many Australians who use it, and our increasing the excise is aimed at trying to reduce the numbers of people that will take up smoking to start with. Of course the world-first introduction of plain packaging will help make it less attractive for young Australians into the future. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, although the Institute of Health and Welfare report shows the number of Australians who are diagnosed with cancer will increase, the 20 additional regional cancer centres across Australia will have an enormous impact on the treatment of cancer. The projects that we have announced to date represent 14 extra linear accelerators, 22 additional radiation oncology bunkers, over 250 chemotherapy beds or chairs, over 140 patient accommodation places and 10 scanners such as CTs, MRIs and PETs. Communities across Australia have been calling out for these investments, and unfortunately the previous government did not listen to many of those calls. So I was very interested to see in the Townsville Bulletin on 12 June this advertisement from the Liberal Party, with the Leader of the Opposition saying: We will deliver a PET Scanner immediately. Opposition members-Hold it up higher!",104
92,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unfortunately, during nearly 12 years in government, the Leader of the Opposition did not deliver a PET scanner to those people of Townsville. As the health minister, he did not deliver it. I think members opposite might be embarrassed to know that this advertisement that they are fully calling out about is an absolute lie from the member opposite. This government has committed $70 million to deliver cancer services to Townsville der",105

100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Herbert will resume his seat. I have ruled on the point of order made by the member for so glee- Sturt. The minister has the call.,105
101,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us actually go through the facts. We have been in government for nearly three years. We have made a commitment to $70 million of cancer services in Townsville. That comes on top of a $250 million commitment in Townsville to expand the hospital. There is $70 million for regional cancer services in Townsville and Mount Isa, including a PET scanner due to be delivered in 2012. This will be the first time ever that north of Brisbane there is a PET scanner. There was not one when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. There was not even a promise when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. Now that we have provided the money and provided the timetable, we see an advertisement which includes the absolute lie that it should suddenly be believed that this man opposite, who did not provide a PET scanner when he was the health minister, is now going to deliver one without money, without funding, without the time and not at the public hospital. This advertisement is an absolute lie, the Leader of the Opposition should be ashamed of himself.  but first I would ask the minister to table document from which she was quoting.",105
102,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With pleasure. Building the Education Revolution Program  the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to admissions from Mr Brad Orgill, head of her BER Implementation Taskforce, that he had not read the Auditor-General's report into the school stimulus debacle in its entirety and was yet to ask the education department for any information about how they evaluate value for money. Given that Mr Orgill has entirely undermined the credibility of the task force's work, will the minister now move to establish a judicial inquiry into the school halls debacle with powers to subpoena documents and summons witnesses to determine how much money has been wasted and who is responsible?",106
103,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for his question. Let us just remind the shadow minister about the audit report and about the appointment of Mr Orgill, because of course the shadow minister was out squealing for months that an Auditor-General inquiry into Building the Education Revolution was required. Indeed, he called for it. was squealing for months about the need for an Auditor-General inquiry. Then, when the Auditor-General did report, what the shadow minister squealed about was that the Auditor General had not found the kinds of things that the shadow minister wanted-squeal, squeal, squeal. The independent watchdog has spoken. The independent watchdog in his report said that there were early positive signs that Building the Education Revolution was and achieving the goals for which the program was established. He admits that the shadow minister's squealing about the Auditor General's report was his squealing that this the was not good enough because the Auditor General had not looked at individual complaints and had not looked at individual projects. Whilst the shadow minister was out there squealing and yapping, as he does, and implementing education cutbacks in the coalition's policies, we were getting on with the job of supporting jobs in Australian communities and modernising schools. To make sure that dollars spent on schools were value for money, we appointed Mr Orgill, a leading Australian businessman, to lead a task force inquiring into value for money. So Mr Orgill is on the job in schools, sleeves rolled up, inquiring into value for money. What does the shadow minister come and squeal about now? Apparently, a leading Australian businessman is not good enough for him. Let me tell you and let me tell the House, Mr Speaker, that I suspect that any Australian of judgment called to choose between Brad Orgill and the member for Sturt would pick Brad Orgill any day of the week. Education",106
104,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Social Inclusion and Deputy Prime MinHe ister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on recent developments in policies to support regional education?",106
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for her question. She is deeply interested in the quality of Australian education and in making sure that every child gets a fair chance for a great education-something that those members opposite have shown no regard for in government or in opposition. Yesterday I asked the House to contemplate one simple proposition: when is $1 billion not $1 billion? Of course the answer to that riddle is: when it is promised by the National Party. Yesterday I revealed to the House that a so-called $1 billion education promise by the National Party was nowhere near a $1 billion education promise; it was apparently a promise to spend the interest on the so-called $1 billion policy. But today I can reveal that in fact it is a little bit more interesting than that. So the member for Calare, when asked what the interest on the $1 billion, around $50 million, was going to be spent on, could not name specific programs that would receive funding. He went on to say, ‘It's not meant to be a dot point policy.' So apart from an illusion about the funding, it is an illusion about the outcomes. They have absolutely no idea what it is they should do to improve the life chances and life prospects of country kidstruly remarkable. It goes on. The member for Parkes has assisted us even more than the member for Calare. The member for Parkes is recorded in his media as saying of this so-called $1 billion policy, which is really the interest on $1 billion that they have no idea how they would spend: It's an aspirational statement and not yet policy, but sent a positive message about education. Quite remarkable. Now if this were just a fight and confusion between members of the National Party, then of course everybody would say: ‘Business as usual. That's what we expect from the National Party'. But, no, this policy has been sold, specifically sold by Senator Williams as a policy that has had the tick of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. So let the record show, because I believe, Mr Speaker, it should, that what the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurerthe man who would be Deputy Prime Minister if the opposition were elected as government-stand for in education is this: they have promised $1 billion, but they really mean the interest on it, and they have no idea what it would be spent on and really, in the words of the member for Parkes, it is not a policy at all, it is just an ‘aspiration'. I know what this really means, and let me make it very clear for the House: it is another phoney policy from an opposition that is erratic and irresponsible and on a mission to mislead Australian voters. The reality is when in government they watched the participation rate of regional kids in universities fall, and in opposition they are showing absolute contempt for these kids and their life chances. Veterans",107
106,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel. Minister, does the Rudd Labor government believe it is a fair and equitable policy for men and women who have served courageously in our Defence Force, in harm's way and on behalf of the people of Australia, to have their military pensions indexed at a significantly lower rate than our aged pensioners-and of course substantially lower than the pensions of members of the Australian parliament? If the minister does not believe this is fair, what exactly is the Rudd Labor government's policy on this fundamentally important issue of military pensions indexation for the veterans of the Ryan electorate, and indeed veterans across the country?",107
107,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. This is of course an issue of real concern to many military superannuants across the nation. Unfortunately it has been an issue of concern for many years now. The circumstance before the last election was the current government, the then opposition, came forward with two principal promises at the election with regard to this issue. One was to conduct an independent review to examine the indexation methodology and to see whether in fact it properly reflected how superannuation payments ought to be treated. The other was to release the report of what was commonly called the Podger review into military superannuation which had been conducted over a year and a half under the previous government. It had been in the possession of the then government for some months, but not released prior to the election. The review in relation to indexation was conducted by Trevor Matthews, a distinguished actuary. That review came down with a set of recommendations, which I believe the member is familiar with. Those recommendations were that the system should not change currently; that the government should investigate if a potentially superior or more appropriate indexation method became available and to look at that, but otherwise not to change the system. Circumstances are that the government accepted those recommendations. As for the situation that the member mentions, I will go to both issues. One is the position around superannuation for members of parliament. As he is aware, the system has changed in recent years and certainly with regard to new members of parliament-those who have been here over the last couple of terms-the circumstances are that they are not under that more beneficial scheme. I admit I certainly am, as are many here in the chamber still, but we are fading fast. As for the question about the issue of age pensions, we have to be careful about the use of the word ‘pension'. It is a word that creates a lot of concern within the veterans community as to what in fact a pension is. The clearest point we can make there is that pensions are periodical payments, but there are in fact different types of what are commonly called pensions. The age pension is an income support payment that is part of the safety net provided to those who do not have access to other forms of income. If they receive it on a part basis then they receive it on a graduated basis according to other sources of income. It is designed to protect the poorest in society; it is designed to ensure that those who need it get it. This government through the Harmer review made significant changes with respect to that and in fact with respect to those that I have responsibility for in the veterans affairs portfolio with some $1.1 billion worth of income support payments over the forward estimates. The circumstance with respect to a superannuation pension is that it is on top of that it is an additional payment. Many of those military superannuants that the member is concerned about and that many of us are concerned about are in fact also part pensioners at the very least and receive income support payments to a degree according to their individual circumstances. I know the member has been concerned about this issue for some time because I am aware that in fact earlier this year, I think, he endeavoured to move a motion during private members' business with respect to this issue and was apparently not given permission by the opposition to move it. I understand that is something that has been a cause of some concern within the veterans community in recent times. I would also make the point that this has been an issue for a long time. The circumstance with respect to that is that the situation of the opposition also needs to be focused on. My understanding is that the Leader of the Opposition has made a statement along the lines that, when back in government and when the budget is back in surplus, there will be a need to ‘tackle this issue'. My question to him isOpposition members-The question's to you!",108

110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will resume his seat! There are many in the chamber who seem to very much enjoy the sound of their own voices, but could they just sit there and listen. The minister has the call.",109
111,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a minister in a government that had surpluses for most of those 10 years, why was action not taken then? I think that is a question that also has to be asked out there within the community in terms of the bona fides of those present here today. The situation with respect to the government's position in response to the Podger review into military superannuation is that we agreed to consult with the ex-service community and the defence community post the last election, subsequent to the release of that report. We did and the response from those communities was, ‘We don't like it; we don't want it.' That has produced a dilemma for the government-there is no question about that. My commitment, and I have made it quite public, has been that we will be releasing a position on military superannuation in the next few weeks. I will be ensuring that that is there for the ex-service community and the defence community to consider in the lead-up to the next election. I am committed to doing that and the government is committed to taking action. Budget",109
112,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, what income tax relief can Australian families expect from 1 July this year?",109
113,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for her very important question, because I think the government absolutely understands what life is like for many families and many people on fixed incomes who are grappling with a very tight household budget. We understand that. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs was saying before, that was one of the reasons that we moved to put in place the historic increase in the age pension and disability support pension-something that had not been changed for a long, long time. This was a historic and very significant increase in the base rate of the age pension and disability support pension, because we recognised that many of those people were doing it tough. That is something that we did in very difficult budget circumstances last year but not something that those opposite could find the political will to do in almost 12 years. We moved to do that because we understand what life is like when people are on tight budgets. We understand the importance of employment when people are trying to pay the bills. That is the fundamental reason why the government put in place the substantial, powerful and temporary stimulus into the system-to support employment, because if you do not have a job it is pretty hard to put food on the table and to meet the family costs. So we moved with the stimulus to protect households, to protect their employment and to keep the doors of small business open because we understand how difficult it can be for some people to make ends meet. That is why we are also delivering a third round of tax cuts, which will be coming through this Thursday. Mr Hockey-They're not yours!",109
114,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are ours. We have delivered two and this will be the third. We are proud that we are delivering these tax cuts because we do understand what life is like for people on low and middle incomes and for people on fixed incomes. We have been focused on that from day one. We have been focused on it in terms of child care with stantial increases there. We are focused on what life is like for people on low and modest and middle incomes when it comes to paid parental leave. Of course, that is why the third round of tax cuts, which are going to be delivered next Thursday, are so important and why the government is so committed. For a worker earning $50,000 a year, the tax cut starting on 1 July this year is worth $450 a year. We understand that that is not a lot of money, but it will help make ends meet. It is very important to give this extra help that can make a difference in terms of tight family budgets. This means someone earning $50,000 a year is now paying $1,750 less in tax than they were when the government came to office. That has been a very substantial cut to their tax bill in the period that the Rudd government has been in power of almost 20 per cent. What we are doing is putting more incentive into the system for the people who work hard, and that is important. It has also been accompanied by a range of other measures in terms of child care, the education tax rebate, paid parental leave and, of course, as I mentioned before, the very substantial measures that have been put in place to support employment and to keep people in jobs. We are proud of the support that we are providing to people on low and middle incomes, because it is support that they have earned, it is port that they deserve and it is support which will help them in the long run meet the costs of living, but, more importantly, it will strengthen our economy because it rewards Australians who work hard to make our country great. Asylum Seekers",110
115,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to reports that the ship shown in this sub- photograph, now known as the MV Sun Sea, is on its way to Australia. Given suspected links between this ship and an organised Tamil Tiger people-smuggling operation, will the Prime Minister assure the House that the MV Sun Sea will not be able to enter Australian waters, or is this the vessel that sailed undetected into Flying Fish Cove this morning?",110
116,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. On the first point, as I said to the honourable member yesterday, the practice of this government-and, I believe, the practice of previous governments-is not to comment on ongoing security, operational and associated intelligence matters. That is the first point. That is the responsibility of any responsible government on questions of national security, something which the Leader of the Opposition obviously finds amusing. We on this side of the House do not. The second point I would make, in relation to the second part of his question, is that he refers to undetected arrivals. I would simply say that the detection rate under this government is considerably better than that under the last government. The interception rate under this government-wait for it-is 94 per cent. Under the previous government it was 87 per cent. Can I say to the member, therefore, that he might actually again put facts instead of fear. Could he also on this question possibly reflect on the responsibility supof a responsible shadow minister, which is to engage his counterpart on questions of security and operational matters. There are protothem cols which govern these things. I would have thought that any responsible member, let alone a member of the shadow executive, would adhere to those protocols.",110
117,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have drawn your attention to the responsibilities of ministers on a couple of occasions. Is this parliament entitled to whether a heavily loaded ship turned up in Flying Fish Cove this morning?",111
118,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,111
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I hear the murmurs of ‘serious matter'. It was not a serious matter when the Prime Minister was on his feet. The question was asked. Those on my left talked all the way through it. The member for O'Connor knows that the point he has raised is not something that I can deal with. It is something that I will not respond to. Many people-and the member for O'Connor is amongst those that have been here longestwould look through the way in which these matters have been handled by now successive governments. Small Business,111
120,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs and the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. What support is the government providing to 2.4 million small businesses across Australia? Are all small business owners, like other Australians, expected to comply with the rules of disclosure and accountability?",111
121,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The Rudd government have supported Australia's small businesses through the global recession, and we continue to support small businesses during the economic recovery phase. They need our support because they are still struggling. We recognise that and we want to support in a number of important ways. But at every turn the coalition in opposition have tried to undermine the support that this government has been providing for small business. The coalition voted against our stimulus package designed to help our tradies and the small businesses that supply them. The coalition have indicated that, if elected, they know would scrap the small business tax breaks. Why would you do that? They say they are the party of small business, but they would scrap our small business tax breaks. The coalition have said that they would pull the plug on the National Broadband Network, which would be so important to our small business community. Australia's 2.4 million small businesses are required to follow the rules, and we are helping them to do that. We are helping them to follow the rules with Standard Business Reporting, which will start on 1 July, enabling small businesses to meet their compliance obligations with the Commonwealth through the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and to meet their tax obligations with a real reduction in red tape. We are helping small business comply with their superannuation obligations through the superannuation clearing house that will come into force on 1 July again, in just a couple of weeks time. The Rudd government is creating a national business names registration system so that those small businesses that operate across state boundaries do not have to register their business name in each and every state and territory and make those renewals every couple of years. Small business owners, like all Australians, are expected to comply with these basic rules of disclosure and accountability, and parliamentarians are among those Australians who are expected to comply with their obligations of disclosure and accountability. Yet of course the Leader of the Opposition failed for two years to disclose a $700,000 order. Under standing order 98(c): (c) A Minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she sponsible … (i) public affairs; (ii) administration; or (iii) proceedings pending in the House. The minister for small business has absolutely no responsibility for the pecuniary interests of the House, therefore his answer at the moment could not possibly be relevant to the question he was asked.",111
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, the Manager of Opposition Business has based his point of order on the standing orders relating to questions. I am just indicating that that is the case. Therefore, it relates to the question. The question was in order. He then makes a point that he would like that to then apply to the answer. He quite correctly has understood that he cannot directly use the matters that can or cannot be contained in a question to dictate that. The suggestion is that there is a thread between the intent of the standing orders on the questions and what should be contained in the answers. House of Representatives Practice actually has a good discussion about that but has indicated thatdespite, from time to time, the Procedure Committee offering comments-there has been no attempt to address the standing orders. In this case, without ruling the minister out of order, I indicate to the member for Sturt that I will listen carefully to the way in which the minister relates the material that he is producing to the question that was in order.",112
123,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: there are some requirements placed on members as to the reporting of their financial affairs. My clear understanding is that the detail of those amounts is not public property, and nor should it be. Any attempt to disclose that is contempt of this parliament and its standing orders.",112

I am not suggesting that this case was anything but an oversight. Mr Tuckey interjecting",112
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I really think from time to time that the member for O'Connor should think about the way in which he is not really assisting. One of the things that I have to say as the Speaker is that, when I am asked to make sure that a minister is actually answering a question in a certain way, I am supposed to possess a wealth of knowledge and to know all the answers. I only say that in the context of some comments which have been made by way of interjection in the last minute or two, which I do not know the background of and which are, therefore, a bit difficult for me to act upon. Certain people who are making those interjections should temper them. I am listening carefully to the matters that are now being raised by the minister. I would prefer some members to keep their comments to themselves. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",112

I was asked: should there be a single standard of reporting and accountability for all Australians, whether they are small businesses or other Australians? And I am directly answering that question. The answer is that there is a double standard. There is a double standard going on in this parliament.  of view. I listened very carefully before to your quite correct and lengthy description of the standing orders in respect of this matter in relation to my last point of order. I think addition to what I said before that there is a line of bad taste in this House, which obviously the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister think is reasonable to have crossed on this occasion, but the response from the opposition is, unfortunately, commensurate with the attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I would ask you to ask him to sit down for the benefit of the House.",113

I also refer the Prime Minister to the application by Woollahra Council for $2 million of funding to enable it to complete the construction of fencing, railing, helplines, lighting and other suicide prevention infrastructure at the Gap.

There is one section whereby every council receives an allocation of funding for local priorities. Woollahra has received $340,000 through this component. That funded $248,000 for the installation of a CCTV system, which was opened by Senator Michael Forshaw on 4 March 2010, and $91,000 for the construction of 85 metres of steel mesh fencing and safety handrails, Minister. I re- which is underway. The second component of this program is for larger competitive projects. The facts are these. We announced the funding for this second round on 25 June 2009. We released the guidelines for it on 9 October 2009 after consultation with the Australian Council of Local Government Steering Committee, made up of local government representatives. Indeed, we had another meeting with the ACLG Steering Committee just this morning for the third round of this program. We opened the application process on 2 NoPrime vember 2009 in accordance with the agreed guidelines and in consultation with local government. Applications closed on 15 January 2010. Councils had 14 weeks to formulate their applications to make sure that they fitted the guidelines and to get the details right. Woollahra Council submitted an application of $2.2 million to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. I will go through, as I have privately with the member for Wentworth, what that was for. The majority of the funding they sought was for roadworks on Military Road in Watsons Bay that had specifically, as the member knows, been ruled out as being eligible for this program. We have the Roads to Recovery Program for local government for roads. The infrastructure program specifically ruled out roadworks, but the application included upgrades to the bus terminus on Military Road, a raised pedestrian crossing, a traffic island with water-saving devices underneath, underground cabling, five directional signs, six water-sensitive urban design plant beds, 10 tourist interpretation signs",114

144,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the point, I say to the Leader of the Opposition. As the member knows, this did not get to my desk; this was not a political decision. The department ruled the application ineligible. Unlike the way that you operated in government, with the Regional Partnerships program, we followed the guidelines. According to their own costings, only $20,000 was for two Black Dog Institute signs, $30,000 was for two emergency telephones and $15,000 was for additional fencing. I understand from the Minister for Health and Ageing that her department has been in contact with Lifeline about paying for it through the appropriate fund. As I cated to the member for Wentworth when I spoke to him in private, I was quite sympathetic with action when it came to this, but we had to have a discussion between the council and me about the appropriate program. The fact is the government was not asked for funding for CCTV in this application. We have already funded it at Gap Park, and it has been opened. We have also provided funding for safety fencing. The majority of the funding was for roadworks. So the department had no choice but to determine their application to be ineligible. And I make this point: over the last two years the Rudd government has provided nearly $3.7 million in untied funding to the Woollahra Municipal Council-funding that they can put to whatever priorities they determine to be appropriate. It has been suggested by the local mayor-who is also running for preselection for the Liberal Party for Vaucluse at the moment-that this program was not successful because it was an application in Wentworth. In the electorate of Wentworth we have provided $2 million for the Waverley Park Pavilion, as the member for Wentworth knows because he was there with me when we announced that funding. In other safe Liberal seats, I was in the electorate of North Sydney in this round to announce the Coal Loader parkland development in North Sydney, and there was $2 million for the Drill Hall in Mosman in the electorate of Warringah, $2.3 million for ocean beach promenade upgrade in Manly, also in Warringah, and $4 million for Narrabeen Lagoon in the electorate of Mackellar. This is not a partisan program. Mental health is a serious issue, and people should not distort the facts of this matter. I continue to make the offer to the member for Wentworth that if the mayor wants to actually have a serious discussion about appropriate indigovernment programs then we are there to assist. But what does not assist is the sort of distortion, frankly, that we have seen in the member's local papers over the last few days.

I inform me House that the government has invested some $127 million to reduce the incidence of suicide and suicidal behaviour. The government is also investing some $55 million to address perinatal depression. I can also inform the House that we have expanded our investments in the Men's Sheds network right across Australia as well. These of course are important parts of local community infrastructure to support men in particular circumstances, including some men who suffer from various forms of mental illness. As I have said before in answers to questions in this area, much more remains to be done.",115
148,Mr ABBOTT,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, if I may suggest to the Prime Minister and to the Leader of the House, the member for Wentworth asked his question not in a partisan spirit but in a genuine attempt to try to ensure that something happens to reduce the incidence of suicide at The Gap. Could I suggest to both the minister and the Prime Minister that all members of this House would congratulate them and thank them if a phone call was to be made to Woollahra council this afternoon to fix this matter up. A hundred thousand dollars, or thereabouts, is a small price to pay to prevent suicides at The Gap.",116

I am prepared to have a discussion with the mayor of Woollahra about achieving an appropriate outcome here. It is not in anyone's interests for this to be a partisan issue. I have made that offer before. I accept that the member for Wentworth is genuine about his position on this.

165,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,CONGO AIR CRASH,"On indulgence, I would like to update the House on efforts to recover the victims of the crash in the Republic of the Congo of a charter plane hired by Sundance Resources. A recovery team, including French military personnel, commenced a retrieval operation yesterday, 22 June West Africa time. The site remains very difficult to access and recovery personnel currently rappel in from helicopters. This is a very difficult process in a very difficult environment. It is not yet clear when all of the bodies will be recovered from the plane and the crash site and transferred to Brazzaville, the capital of the Congo. Once in Brazzaville, the process of identifor fication will commence. This is likely to be a complex, painstaking and time-consuming process. It may well be necessary for remains to be removed to a third country in order to complete the disaster victim identification process. Australia's High Commissioner to Nigeria and another DFAT officer are currently relocating to Brazzaville from Cameroon, where they will continue to provide support to officers from Sundance Resources and to work with the authorities of the Republic of the Congo on recovery and preparations for repatriation arrangements. Consulate officials continue to be in regular contact with Sundance Resources. Government agencies in Canberra are also examining what additional support may now need to be provided. Australian officials will continue to work closely with Sundance Resources and authorities from the Congo and Cameroon. They will continue to provide consular assistance to the families of the victims in the course of the recovery, identification and repatriation process. As I indicated, we have to expect that this may well be a difficult, complex and painstaking process. We will keep the families informed and work closely with the company. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims at this time. I take this opportunity to compliment the officers of Sundance Resources for the way in which they have, in very difficult circumstances, worked very effectively in the interests of the families of the victims. In particularly, I compliment the chief financial officer, Peter Canterbury, with whom I have spoken on a number of occasions, and George Jones, who has been engaged as a senior adviser. He is a former chairman of the company. I compliment them for the effective and dignified way in which they have handled matters the company in the most difficult of all circumstances.",117

182,Mr BOWEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (3.53 pm)-by leave-The government is committed to ensuring that the financial advice Australians receive is in their best interests. On 26 April this year, I announced the Rudd government's Future of Financial Advice reform package, which contained significant policy measures that improve the quality of financial advice, enhance retail investor protection and improve trust and confidence in the financial planning industry. These reforms represent a comprehensive government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' inquiry into financial products and services in Australia, which investigated issues associated with recent financial product and service provider collapses, such as Storm Financial and Opes Prime. The need for quality advice The government recognises the important role played by financial advisers in assisting Australians plan for their future. By 2050, one in four Australians will be over 65. Longer-term challenges such as the ageing of the population, as well as recent events such as the global financial crisis, underscore the need for quality advice. At their core, the reforms will address the conflicts of interest that have coloured the perception-and sometimes the reality-of the quality of financial advice provided to Australian investors. If financial advice is to be an important part of investment decision making in this country-and I believe it should-then it must abide by a fundamental ethical principle. That principle is that the financial advice given to Australian investors should be in their best interests. This issue is also very much about the future professionalism of the industry. Good financial planners should not have their reputation affected by some in the industry who do the wrong thing. It has also been put to me that raising the professional standing of the industry will encourage more people to become advisers. The Future of Financial Advice contains three key reforms, which will apply from 1 July 2012: - A ban on conflicted remuneration structures, such as commissions and volumebased payments. Percentage-based fees (also known as ‘assets under management' fees) can only be charged on ungeared products or investment amounts; - The introduction of a statutory fiduciary duty for financial advisers requiring them to act in the best interests of their clients, subject to a ‘reasonable steps' qualification; and - A new ‘product neutral' adviser charging regime which is all about ensuring that advisers and clients agree to the fees and services provided, and that those fees are clear, while retaining flexible options for consumers to pay for advice. This includes a requirement for retail clients to agree to the fees and to annually renew (by opting in) to an adviser's continued services. There are a number of other important measures contained in the package which will assist in facilitating simple and more affordable advice, provide enhanced investor protection and increase the professionalism of the financial advice industry in general. There will be an expansion of the availability of low-cost simple advice to provide access to financial advice. The existing package which provides for simple advice within superannuation funds (known as intrafund advice) will be extended to new topics to facilitate simple, single issue, personal advice in a compliant matter. There will also be a review of whether simple advice can be provided in a compliant matter outside intrafund advice. The accountants' licensing exemption will be removed, with consultation on an appropriate replacement. ASIC's powers to act against unscrupulous operators will be enhanced, professional standards for advisers will be reviewed by an expert advisory panel, the classification of sophisticated and unsophisticated investors will be reviewed and the option of introducing a statutory compensation scheme will be examined by an expert in the corporate law field. In total the package represents a very significant reform for financial services and will greatly improve the quality and availability of financial advice in Australia. I would now like to briefly touch on some matters that have been raised in relation to these measures. Commissions One key issue surrounds how the reforms, particularly the ban on commissions, affects a consumer's right to choose how they pay for advice. While I support the idea of consumers making their own informed decisions, the reality is that disclosure of commissions does not deal with the fundamental conflict of interest created by the commission. Some say that a more simple disclosure regime is the answer to the current lack of consumer understanding in relation to fees and commissions. While simple disclosure is almost always better than complicated disclosure, it is not the answer here. I have looked at this question very carefully and I am convinced that, in this area, we cannot simply rely on disclosure alone. It is not good enough for an investor-who may have limited understanding of financial markets or may, for example, have English as a second language-to come to an adviser for advice, only to be handed pages of fine print and be expected to fend for themselves. Instead, the removal of conflicts of interest will lead to better quality of advice for investors, a conclusion supported by the considerable evidence given to the PJC inquiry. Adviser Charging While there will be a ban on conflicted payments, I am not interested in a government-prescribed one-size-fits-all approach to fees. There will still be flexibility in how advisers can charge clients, and how clients can pay for advice. It is open to advisers to devise a charging structure that suits them and their clients. That structure could include hourly fees and percentage fees-subject, of course, to the guiding principles of the reforms. I anticipate the changes will encourage innovation in adviser charging, for the benefit of both advisers and clients. Through the annual renewal process (by requiring customers to opt-in), financial advisers will engage with their customers and assist them to see the value of the advice provided, with fees being directly related to the services provided. The opt-in provision is an important measure. As I stated when the reforms were announced, the government will consult with industry about the form of the annual renewal notice and the period after which the initial advice is given that it will first apply. was very clear about this when the reforms were announced, including explicitly outlining this in the information pack we released when we announced the reforms. Simple advice Most surveys show that about one in five Australians receives financial advice. While I agree that clients benefit from and may often need holistic advice, there are cases where clients have relatively simple financial questions they need answered, and where simple advice will be quite sufficient for that purpose. If we want more Australians to receive advice, I believe we need to try and find a way to deliver more affordable advice (including so called intrafund advice) and increase its use. It is interesting to note that intrafund advice has already been very successful, with some funds reporting interest from their members well above their expectations. The introduction of intrafund advice has also enabled smaller financial planning firms to generate new business by providing intrafund advice services to super fund members. Feedback on the reforms Major reform is difficult and requires a mature and measured approach from industry. To respond to change in any other way diminishes an industry's standing in the eyes of the community. I welcome the positive response from a range of stakeholders, including many in the industry, to the government's financial advice reforms. The Financial Planning Association and the Investment and Financial Services Association have agreed that the broad thrust of our reform package is sensible and much needed. I have been particularly pleased by the number of emails and letters of support I have received from individual planners and smaller planning practices who understand I how beneficial these reforms are for their customers and, therefore, how beneficial they are for the industry. The financial advice industry both large and small is working positively and effectively with the government on these reforms-reforms that do fundamentally change the way the industry will operate. There are times when we disagree, but the industry has shown it is willing to undertake difficult reform that is in the community's interest and work constructively with government on its implementation. Coalition position Banning conflicted remuneration structures, such as commissions, will greatly reduce the incidence of investors being recommended financial products as a result of sales incentives offered to advisers. An ASIC shadow shopping survey found that unreasonable advice was about six times more common if the adviser had an actual conflict from remuneration. The government was hoping for bipartisan support for these sensible but difficult reforms. Instead, the coalition has been critical of the government's Future of Financial Advice reforms despite the overwhelming majority of industry and consumer stakeholder groups supporting it. The coalition's position can be summarised very simply-they are the only ones still backing sales commissions. The coalition's position on sales commissions is code for supporting investors receiving financial advice that may not be in their best interests; the sort of advice that, as we have seen in recent corporate history, has led to investors losing their life savings. So inexplicable is the coalition's position that JP Morgan described it in the following terms in a 15 June research note to clients: They also appear rather perplexingly the banning of commissions (conflicted remuneration structures) something the industry as a whole appears to have decided to move away from. What we have here is a coalition so intent on opposing government policy that they are opposing important reform that industry is willing to undertake and consumer groups have welcomed. Consultation process I look forward to working with stakeholders across the industry and consumer groups, as we move to implement this important reform package. Although I have set out the broad policy direction, I expect that there will be a significant amount of consultation in relation to the finer implementation details of the package. There will also be a public exposure of draft legislation in due course. I understand and appreciate that some stakeholders are keen to know further details about the reforms-such as the timing, consultation processes, and the detail of how certain policies will be determined. This is why, on 17 May, I announced the commencement of consultation including the establishment of a website-the Future of Financial Advice website-which communicates important information about the reforms, including a ‘Questions and Answers' section, as well as providing ongoing updates about upcoming consultation with stakeholders. Public information sessions will be held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney in late June and early July of this year. The public information sessions are designed to provide an overview of the reforms and give stakeholders an opportunity to ask questions and raise issues. Details of the public consultations, including how to register, are now available on the Future of to be against Financial Advice website. Benefits of the reforms While the reforms seek to improve the quality of advice, which is in the client's best interests, they will also carry important benefits for the financial advice industry. I see the reforms to financial advice and our wideranging changes to superannuation as being inextricably linked. Put simply, we could not ask Australians to set aside 12 per cent of their income for superannuation, without ensuring that the system was being managed in their best interests. The reforms will also support our ongoing work to position Australia as a financial services centre in the Asia-Pacific region. It would be impossible to ask professionals in other countries to place their trust and confidence in our financial planning industry if Australians do not. This point was emphasised by the Australian Financial Centre Forum, which we commissioned to recommend ways to position Australia as a regional financial services centre. The forum observed that realisation of opportunities to attract overseas capital to Australia depends on, ‘amongst other things, the reputation and integrity of Australia's financial advisory sector being maintained and, where necessary, improved'. To this end, their report argued that resolving conflicts of interest in the financial planning industry was ‘a prerequisite for greater international engagement'. I have a lot of confidence in the skills and expertise of Australia's financial planners. I have confidence that our financial planners can not only provide high-quality advice to Australians but also develop as a significant potential export supplier. I want the financial advice industry in this country to grow and thrive. The reforms we announced last month, as well as those reforms we announced in April, are designed to ensure the industry is seen as honest, trustworthy and world's best-with all the opportunities that that opens up. The government's reforms will enhance the professional standing of the industry and ultimately encourage more investors to seek advice-something that is in all our best interests. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Cowper to speak for 12 minutes. Leave granted.",119

184,Mr HARTSUYKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am pleased to respond to the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law's statement today on the topic of financial advice and the government's supposed intent to remove conflicts of interest in providing that advice. I am pleased to respond because it gives me the opportunity to correct the minister on many of the statements he has made today. As with everything this minister does, there is a massive gap between his rhetoric and the reality of policy outcomes. The minister argues that the coalition support investors receiving financial advice that may not be in their best interests. This is a complete misrepresentation of the statements made by the coalition, and nothing could be further from the truth. The coalition support efforts to minimise the potential for conflicts of interest within the financial advisory industry. We have previously stated that trailing commissions which do not provide the investor with an opportunity to opt out should be removed from the industry, and payments made by product manufacturers to advisers must in fact be for the provision of advice and not merely an income stream for the adviser. However, the coalition have expressed concerns about how the Rudd Labor government's intent with this legislation could hurt small business financial planners and could impact on the ability of lowincome earners to receive financial advice. As I said, we have expressed concerns about the massive gap between what the minister says and what the minister actually does. With much fanfare, Minister Bowen announced on 26 April on Sky News: … the key change has been the banning of commissions and payments from financial providers to financial advisers. That was shortly before some of the details were released by the minister, on the same day. Those details were under the heading ‘Overhaul of financial advice' and clearly state: It is important to note that thereformdoes not prevent client-agreed deductions being allowed from a client's investment to pay for financial advice or flexibility in payment options. The minister did not explain in his statement today how a payment can be made out of a client's investment if it has not originated from a product provider. The reforms will not completely meet the minister's promise to Ross Greenwood on 26 April. He said of the reforms: … they'll stop people getting advice to invest in bad products which happen to be in the best interests of advisers but are clearly not in the best terests of ordinary mum and dad investors. By suggesting that all commissions offer advice not in the interests of investors, the minister is making an attack on the financial planning industry, particularly small businesses involved in that industry. My office has been flooded with inquiries from small business financial planners who are concerned that they will not be able to offer services to mum and dad investors into the future and that these reforms have the potential to force a complete restructuring of their business or in fact force them out of business. But this minister is not concerned about the jobs that are going to be lost. In fact, he has admitted that the reforms will destroy jobs in financial planning. The minister said on 26 April, in a press conference: I recognise that some people won't be happy with these reforms. I accept that some people will leave the financial planning industry as a result … A survey conducted by Radar Results, which is a consulting firm to financial planners, found that one in four financial planners are considering leaving the industry as a result of these reforms. So the minister is perfectly happy for, potentially, 25 per cent of the employees in the financial services industry to lose their jobs as a result of the reforms. However, there is some hope because, despite threatening to take their jobs away, the minister for financial services is consulting with the industry! We have heard a bit about consultation lately. So the minister is telling us he is consulting with industry-just like they consulted with industry on the great big new tax on mining! But even the minister himself recognised that he did not have the details right. He told 2GB on 26 April that the reform proposals ‘will need a lot of work; we'll need to consult'. It sounds very familiar, ‘a lot of work'. In order to consult, Labor are providing information sessions in capital cities from 25 June to 1 July. So we inhave a one-week intensive consultation session at the end of the financial year. Financial planners are pretty busy at the end of the financial year. How can the government be taking the views of small business financial planners seriously when they arrange a consultation period for the last week of the financial year? This is a minister who dismissed details of consultations with the Association of Financial Planners in a press release on 4 June, saying they were ‘based on newspaper headlines rather than the facts'. This is a minister who promised in May 2008, in relation to another of his failed policies, Fuelwatch: Fuelwatch brings down petrol prices, puts downward pressure on petrol prices … There is a credibility problem with this minister. This is the man who introduced Fuelwatch, which was originally going to save us money on petrol but then became just a medium for more information on fuel. Then we had GROCERYchoice, which was going to provide us with cheaper groceries-but you might have to drive 2½ thousand kilometres to get a packet of Tim Tams in order to save money. So we have a minister who has a bit of a credibility problem. He has a problem because there is a massive gap between his rhetoric and his delivery. The coalition will be watching very carefully the way these reforms are implemented, because this government has a track record of poor implementation. They could not build school halls cost-effectively, they could not give away pink batts and there are a lot of financial planners out there who are concerned that the government cannot reform this industry without causing massive damage to small business.

What happened to that great dawn when bliss it was to be alive and a Labor member of parliament! We had the ratification of Kyoto, that great moment that signalled the dawn of a new era! Now we have the dumping of the emissions trading scheme and the abandonment of that which was supposed to solve not just the problem but the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time'. Then we had the apology, an overdue and noble gesture reaching out to the first Australians. Now we have a government which is conniving to rip away Indigenous land rights on Cape York, despite the passage last night in the Senate of the private member's bill to override the wild rivers legislation of Queensland. I accept that it is not easy for new governments. New governments have inexperienced ministers trying to meet impossible expectations. I accept that the Howard govits ernment struggled in its first term, and was only just returned. In 1984 Prime Minister Hawke had an approval rating of 70 per cent and yet his government came close to losing that year's election, perhaps because of complacency. But both of those governments had solid records of achievement. Those governments were both in their own way historic. Neither government put the preservation of a superficial popularity ahead of substantial achievement for the Australian people. In its first term, the Hawke government achieved historic reforms. It deregulated the financial market. It floated the Australian dollar. The Howard government, in its first term, achieved historic gun law reform. It built on former Prime Minister Keating's industrial legislation. It reformed the waterfront and, most importantly, it began the task of fiscal reform on which the current economic strength of this country is founded. What has this government achieved? We all know that it was a very subdued and very unhappy caucus meeting yesterday. We all know that the Prime Minister attempted to rally his troops by telling them to go out and sell the government's achievements. What are those government achievements? First, there is a paid parental leave scheme that is a small step in the right direction but which is basically a rebadged baby bonus, and we have a National Broadband Network, better described as a nationalised broadband network, which will hardly be noticed by the Australian people for many years and which will add billions and billions of dollars to Australia's unsustainable debt. Oh, yes-the other achievement was avoiding a recession. The avoidance of the recession, let us make it absolutely crystal clear, owes far more to the reforms of the previous government than it does to the spending spree of the current one. So that is it. After three years, this government has turned a $20 billion surplus into a $57 billion deficit, it has turned a $60 billion net asset position into a $100 billion net debt position, and all it has to show for it rebadged baby bonus, an economic slowdown, ameliorated by other people's work, and a National Broadband Network that will not be delivered for decades. This is a government which has failed. This is a government which promised not to means test the baby bonus, but has. It promised not to means test the private health insurance rebate, but it has tried to do just that. It ised us GroceryWatch-undelivered. It promised us Fuelwatch-undelivered. Doesn't the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law squirm at the table when he is reminded of his own personal failures? The government promised us 35 GP superclinics and has delivered three. It promised us 260 childcare centres and, having delivered some 20, has said 240 are no longer necessary. Of course with the greatest moral challenge of our time-not just any old problem but the greatest moral, economic, political and social challenge of our time, climate change-there is no policy. There is no policy whatsoever to deal with climate change. Prior to the election the Prime Minister claimed he was the economic conservative, and he has become the greatest public wastrel in Australian political history. This is the economic conservative in opposition who has spent his time as Prime Minister attacking market fundamentalism, attacking 30 years of neoliberalism, and in fact rejecting the serious and beneficial reforms of more courageous and more substantial Labor predecessors. Broken promises are bad, but breaking promises is not all he has done. He has wasted taxpayers' money in a way that is absolutely unforgivable. Now he wants to destroy our economic future with a great big new tax on mining, and that is tantamount to a political crime. A Prime Minister who has so misjudged a decision of this magnitude, a Prime Minister who has so mishandled due is a process in coming to a decision of this magnitude, is a Prime Minister who is no longer fit to govern this country. Only a government with no shame would have kept its pink batts program going despite more than 20 official and formal warnings from government officials, from state governments and from professional bodies. The government went on, despite these prom- warnings, to install 240,000 dodgy or dangerous insulations which, in their turn, caused more than 150 house fires, potentially electrified perhaps thousands of Australian roofs and, shame on shame, have been linked to four deaths. This is a Labor governmenta Labor government indifferent to warnings that, had they been heeded, could have avoided the deaths of four workers. Only a government with no sense of value for money would have wasted billions and billions on overpriced school halls. Anyone familiar with construction in this country could have gone to the Rawlinsons guide or the other standard industry guides and found out that the construction of a single-storey school building should have averaged $1,500 a square metre. But, no, that is not what this government has achieved. It gave money to independent schools, and of course independent schools managed to get the work done for $2,400 a square metre. But what did this government do with the vast bulk of the money? It gave it to the state education departments. In New South Wales, they have managed to achieve school hall construction at a price fully three times the industry average-$4,500 a square metre-but in some instances, particularly with the cubby-house size canteens in country schools, the cost been $25,000 a square metre. A government which cannot be trusted with public money is a government which cannot be trusted with re-election. Now, with $5.5 billion yet to spend, the government has appointed a value-for-money inquiry whose chairman has not even read the Auditor General's report and is proposing to spend the rest of the money before even getting that report, which will cost $14 million to produce. It is just not good enough, and now the government is targeting the most productive industry in our country with a penalty tax almost guaranteed to kill the mining boom stone dead. Any government that thinks success should attract penalty rates of taxation and that regards a rate of return better than you can achieve by putting your money into the bank as being a super profit which should attract a super tax is a government which has no experience of how the real world works. But what should we expect from a Prime Minister who is a lifelong public sector employee, a Deputy Prime Minister who has rarely stepped outside the cabals of politics, except as a union lawyer, a Treasurer who is a lifelong party official and a finance minisall ter who was a lifelong union official? I do not say that those are not worthy occupations in their own ways, but shouldn't there be someone-just someone-in the decision making counsels of this government who has some understanding of the economy on which every Australian's prosperity depends? Only a government with no understanding of how our economy works would think that the $53 billion of taxpayers' money that we will be paying off for years should have been used to avoid two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Only a government with no understanding of how the real world works has would think it makes sense to spend $43 billion recreating the Telecom of the 1960s without even a business plan. Only a government which is utterly bereft of any conception of due process would have told us that we were going to have root-and-branch tax reform and then not released the Henry review for months and then took just one of its 138 recommendations and distorted it, lied about it and told us that the government had achieved tax reform. Let us be very clear about the great big new tax on mining. It is not what Ken Henry recommended. It is not going to pay for increases in superannuation. It is going to fund a lot more government spending as well as a hardly-to-be-noticed reduction in company tax. Nor is the great big new tax on mining going to build the infrastructure that Australia needs. All it is going to do is fund the continued spending spree of a government which is addicted to spending and, because it is addicted to spending, to taxation too. It is not good enough, and the Australian people deserve better. The tragedy is that if this government is re-elected we will get more of the same, only worse. We will have a government which is about politics and has no deep and abiding principles. We will have a government which puts its own political survival ahead of fundamental and necessary reform. We will have a government in the mood for vengeance on its critics. The Prime Minister said the other night to the mining industry, ‘We have a long memory.' And that is exactly right. We know what the Prime Minister is threatening. We know the threats the Prime Minister is making behind closed doors to members of the mining industry, and that spirit of vengefulness seeped out last week in the Great Hall when he threatened people that he had a long memory. We need to change the government because the alternative is different and better. say to the Australian public: if you want to stop the boats, you have to change the government; if you want to stop the tax, you have to change the government; if you want to restore cabinet due process, you have to change the government. More and more people want to change the government because they do not want to see this government do any more damage. There is talk of risk from members opposite; the risk is that the Australian people might give this government the second chance that it certainly does not deserve.",125
187,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (4.28 pm)-What we have just heard comes from a Leader of the Opposition who says that economics is boring. The Leader of the Opposition used to work for Mr John Hewson, and Mr Hewson is well known for saying that this Leader of the Opposition is ‘essentially innumerate'in other words, he cannot count. The previous Treasurer, Mr Costello, is well known for saying that you could not have Mr Abbott as the deputy leader because he does not understand economics. Yet this Leader of the Opposition has the audacity to come in here today and talk about risk. This Leader of the Opposition presents enormous risk to the Australian people because he thinks that economics is boring, he cannot count and he has demonstrated today that he has not one policy that he is prepared to put up. He did not say one positive thing today in this matter of public importance debate, which is supposed to be about families. I do not think he even used the word ‘family' in his whole 15-minute rave. It is extraordinary. Mr Truss interjecting",128
188,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am so pleased that the I Leader of the Nationals is at the table. It is extraordinary that, in this week when paid parental leave finally went through the parliament, we have no sharper or clearer example of the difference between the government and those opposite. We are the government who are delivering for families. For 12 years the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Nationals had the chance to deliver a paid parental leave scheme. We know that the Leader of the Opposition spent the whole time campaigning against it. He said that paid parental leave would only ever happen over his dead body. Well, thanks to this government, that wait is over and it is going to be low-income women who are the big winners as a result of the government's paid parental leave scheme. The Leader of the Nationals would be pleased to know that that is especially going to be low-income women in regional areas. Just walk down the street of any country town. Think of the hairdressing shop, the food store, all the places where women are working as cashiers, food attendants. These are the women who are, at the moment, least likely to have paid parental leave and many of them would be part-time or casual workers working in a local small business. They are now going to get paid parental leave for the first time. We know that the Leader of the Opposition does have one policy on paid parental leave, but we also know that he did not talk to his Nationals colleagues, including the Leader of the Nationals, before he made this announcement. We remember in February this year the Leader of the Opposition went out and said that there would be no new taxes. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said in February. Then along he came in March and announced that there would be a new tax on business of 1.7 per cent that will apparently pay for what can only be described as a sham paid parental leave scheme from this Leader of the Opposition. This new tax on business from the Leader of the Opposition, who a month earlier said there would be no new taxes on business, will drive up grocery prices for families. The Leader of the Nationals knows it is an unfair scheme that the Leader of the Opposition has dreamt up because it is going to see highincome earners in the city getting as much as $75,000 when they have a baby and much, much less for those low-income women in regional towns who earn a lot less. The Leader of the Nationals made this very clear on the radio last week when he owned up to the fact that he has told the Leader of the Opposition that he has some concerns about the size of the paid parental leave scheme. Plainly the Leader of the Nationals is not happy about the Leader of the Opposition's approach. We have heard a bit from the Leader of the Opposition today, preaching to us about broken promises. I have to say, coming from this Leader of the Opposition, it really is beyond belief. It is extraordinary. We all know that he has form on this matter. He had form in government, and now he also has form in opposition. I have just outlined the one on no new taxes and now he is up there proposing a new tax. All of us remember that when he was in government he said that he had a rock solid, ironclad guarantee that had to do with the Medicare safety net. Immediately after the 2004 election he broke that commitment. You would have to say that this Leader of the Opposition's commitments in government and in opposition really only have the substance of fairy dust. It was summarised most accurately by the Leader of the Opposition himself on The 7.30 Report. I do not think any of us will ever forget the memorable interview with Kerry O'Brien when the Leader of the Opposition said: I know politicians are gonna be judged on everything they say, but sometimes, in the heat of discussion, you go a little bit further than you would if it was an absolutely calm, considered, prepared, scripted remark, which is one of the reasons why the statements that need to be taken absolutely as gospel truth is those carefully prepared scripted remarks. One thing that families know as a result of these comments from the Leader of the Opposition is they cannot trust anything that Mr Abbott says. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned the baby bonus in his remarks. I want to draw families' attention to the comments that he has made about the baby bonus, the commitments that the Leader of the Opposition has made in opposition about the baby bonus. This is a man who says one thing and then walks away and does another. If you look at the statements he has made, most recently the Leader of the Opposition has said on ABC Radio-this was in May, so not that long ago-that he would not be removing the baby bonus means test. He said: Um, that's not a commitment that I can make at this time. Let us go back just a few months. This comment that he made in May follows repeated commitments that this Leader of the Opposition made to remove the means test on the baby bonus. This is him in the Sydney Morning Herald, quoted in December last year. He said: Whacking the means test on was dead wrong. I'd like to see that means test come off. He said it again in May this year, just before he went on the radio. He said this in response to a question from a journalist, who asked: You believe the baby bonus should stay untouched? Mr Abbott said: I do, and it shouldn't have been means tested the way the Government has. It must have been one of those commitments he made in the heat of the moment; it must have been a heat-of-the-moment discussion because just a few weeks later we have had him ruling it out. The shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, has ruled out another one of the commitments that Mr Abbott tried to make. He tried to double the baby bonus, and I gather the Leader of the National Party wants to do that as well. Mr Abbott apparently went into shadow cabinet trying to get an agreement to double the baby bonus. He could not quite say yes or no when he was on radio. He said he could not rule things out and could not rule things in, so the shadow Treasurer had to go on the television and make it plain. I make it clear to the Leader of the Nationals that this is the current position of the opposithings tion. The shadow Treasurer said, ‘No, we can't take that latest idea into this election.' How would families ever be able to believe anything that this opposition says? I want to run through the other major achievements that this government has delivered for families. We have delivered Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. One of the most important achievements of this government was keeping Australians in jobs, because nothing is more important to a family than knowing that mum or dad or both are in a job and that they can therefore put food on the table for their families. It was this government that got rid of Work Choices to make sure that families have decent working conditions, and all of this we did in the face of the global financial crisis. This government is delivering tax cuts to all taxpayers, so important to families. This will include a doubling of the low-income tax offset. In 2010-11, a person earning $50,000 will pay $1,750 less tax than they did in 2007-08. It is this government that has delivered an increase in the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent to make sure that child care is more affordable for parents. That is delivered-it is in the pockets of parentsand we made sure that we pay the childcare rebate more frequently. It is this government that has delivered the Medicare Teen Dental Plan so that eligible teenagers get annual preventive dental checks, and more than 80,000 dental checks have been undertaken so far, delivered by this government. In the face of the global financial crisis, we delivered economic stimulus payments to two million families to fend off the impact of the global financial crisis, to help those families and also to help the economy. It is this government that has also delivered an education tax refund-up to $750 for a primary school child and $1,500 per high school child-to help with the costs of education. These did not exist under the previous government. There was not an education tax refund. There was no Medicare Teen Dental Plan. Just this week, as well, we have delivered very, very significant welfare reforms to fight passive welfare and to do everything we can to make sure that welfare is spent in the interests of children so that the essentials of food and clothing are provided by families. It is this government that has also delivered Australia's first National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children. Never before has the Commonwealth provided the sort of leadership that is needed in the area of child protection. It is this government that has introduced learn or earn conditions for payment of family tax benefits for young people aged 16 and over. I finish on the critical issue of housing. Those opposite, of course, did not even have a minister for housing. It is this government that has put in place the National Rental Affordability Scheme, to make sure that lowand middle-income renters have a better chance of affordable rental housing. It is this government that delivered during the global financial crisis the first home owner's boost, helping over 250,000 Australians to buy their first home. It is this government that has put in place first home saver accounts to help people save for their first home. And, of course, there is the very, very significant crease in investment in social housing. We are also delivering the Housing Affordability Fund, to make sure that we are able to deliver savings to homebuyers through the improved planning and development reform. These are the extensive changes that we have put in place, all of it delivered by the government. My final point has to be about what we did, which the previous government refused to do, for pensioners. Age pensioners, disability support pensioners and carers, who waited for 12 years, finally got an increase because of this government. (Time expired)",128
189,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a very important matter of public importance-the government's appalling record of broken promises-led by the Leader of the Opposition, a demonstration of its gravity. But where are those on the opposite side who made the decisions to respond to the charges of the Leader of the Opposition? Not one of the kitchen cabinet bothered to turn up to respond to the charges against them of having broken promise after promise of Labor's election platform. All they could produce was a long forgotten former Deputy Leader of the Opposition, a person whose only capacity to contribute from a first hand perspective to this debate is as one amongst the many who have broken election promises. She is amongst the many who have wasted taxpayers' money. She is amongst the many who need to stand to account for their dismal performance and the failure of this government. Let's look at one of the government's fundamental election promises. When in opposition the Labor Party promised to build 750 new houses for the Indigenous community, to refurbish 2½ thousand more and to rebuild in230 others by next year. Well, $180 million later, what have we got? Thirteen houses have been completed-$180 million gone and only 13 houses built. One hundred and fifty-five refurbishments have been undertaken, and none of them has met an acceptable standard. So this minister, the minister who was chosen to respond, is just as culpable as the others, but none of the senior ministers were prepared to even turn up to explain their appalling behaviour. If the Prime Minister and his chief of staff had spent as much time consulting with the mining industry and the community as they do in consulting with their Labor colleagues to save the Prime Minister's own job, then this government might not be in the mess that it is. What an incredible mess it is. This government came to power on the back of a campaign promising the Australian people everything from world peace to cheaper grocery prices. It promised trade training centres at every school, computers on every desk, fast broadband to the homes of 98 per cent of Australians-and all that simply has not been delivered. They are all broken promises. The government governs by decree rather than consultation and cooperation. It is a government that promises big, spends big and taxes big-but it is all talk and no action. There is no delivery. ‘Where has all this money gone?' the people of Australia have every right to ask. For generations they will be paying it back, and what do they have to show for it? This is a scandal of international proportions. There is no government like this one for the way in which it has managed to destroy the birth right, to squander the birth right, and now leave to next generations substantial amounts of debt. Last year the Prime Minister unveiled his $42 billion cash splash, and he was quite clear at that time that there would be no need for any new taxes to pay for it. He even also made it very clear that it was not a good idea to increase taxes. Let me quote the Prime Minister. He said: We could try to keep the budget in surplus by raising taxes, but that would shift the burden of the global recession onto Australian businesses and taxpayers. He was right then. Why isn'the right now? Why isn'the doing exactly the same thing now? He should have followed his own advice. Having designed his $13 billion a year Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme taxwhich is just asleep on the back counterwhat he is waiting for now is another great big new tax, this one on the mining industry, the very industry that has helped Australia through these difficult times. What is the logic of this government in putting a big new tax on the productive sector? The Prime Minister said, when he introduced the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, that that was a tax to encourage us to reduce our CO2 emissions. We had to have a new tax on cigarettes so we would smoke less. We had to have a new tax on alcopops so we would drink less. But, when it comes to a new tax on mining, that is supposed to make us mine more. What is the logic in this government's explanation? It is simply beyond belief. Let me convey to the Prime Minister a bit of advice from Sir Winston Churchill, who once said: We contend that for a nation to try to tax into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle. Can you envisage the kitchen cabinet jumping in the bucket and trying to lift it up by the handle? That is about the logic of the tired and tortured government that we have, trying to extricate itself from problems of its own making. Professor Warwick MCKibbin, Reserve Bank of Australia board member and ANU academic, described this tax yesterday as ‘a really badly designed resource tax'. It has been an example of a government out of its depth, completely unable to address the issues of this country. And of course it is another broken promise, because the government said it believed in balancing budgets and it believed in being conservative. He was a fiscal conservative, the Prime Minister told us-but he has not delivered. Then Professor MCKibbin went on to talk about some other things, like the $43 billion National Broadband Network. He said it was ‘a gigantic white elephant waiting to happen'. The government has been trying to criticise the Nationals in particular for being critical of this scheme, saying that we were denying the country people of Australia access to fast-speed broadband. However, the government's promise excludes two million people from rural Australia. Everyone who lives in a town of under 1,000 people will not even get it. They are second-class citizens. Labor is proposing a scheme for which they have no business plan. They have no idea how it is going to be built, but it is only for those people who live in the densely populated areas. So this government has no right to be critical of those on the other side in relation to the provision of high-speed broadband. It is, sadly, another example of Labor's spin, deception and broken promises. When the Prime Minister said in 2007 that he would turn back the boats, did anyone itself really think that he meant turning back the bulk coal carriers or the LNG tankers? Did anyone think he was going to operate a water taxi service where the asylum seekers arrived close to Australia then rang 131008 and expected the taxi service to come and pick them up? This is the government's policy. Canada's mining man of the year is also the people smuggler's man of the year because he has opened the floodgates and, sadly, people are coming in from all over the world. When Kevin Rudd said he would put a school computer on every desk, did we really think he meant only every third desk? When he said he was an economic conservative, did we think he would deliver the biggest budget deficits in our nation's history and then spend a whole lot of money on cash splashes that left us with little more than some plasma screens and overpriced school halls? This is the record of this government: consistently broken promises. Let's remember a few more, like 2,650 trade training centres in Australian schools. After two years, there was just one completed. Remember GroceryWatch? Thirteen million dollars wasted. Fuelwatch? Twentyone million dollars wasted, and it has not happened. Let's never forget their promise spend $100 million to re-engineer the Menindee Lakes to save 200 billion litres of ter a year from the Murray-Darling. Nothing has happened. There were going to be 500 new Australian Federal Police officers. There are only 100. They have also wound back the air marshals program and cut the AFP budget. Two hundred and sixty childcare centres were to be built in schools and TAFE colleges. Only 38 will be built. What about the promise to provide rainwater tanks to of Australia's 305 surf lifesaving clubs? Forty-five have been provided, and the program has been axed. What about the promise to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage? The secondary report to parliament showed there was little or no progress. What about the promise to increase X-raying and inspections of containers from overseas ports? They have cut the Customs and the quarantine budgets. If you want the ultimate example of Labor's deception and dishonesty when it comes to the Australian people, it is the Prime Minister saying on 17 March 2008: ‘We will honour every promise made to the Australian people.' That is another promise broken. They made one more promise only a couple of months ago: there will be no cash splash before the next election. Watch this space. That will be another broken promise on top of a litany of broken promises, which will be the legacy of this government to the people of Australia.",131
190,Ms KING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"For the purpose of those people who are in the gallery and those who might be listening to this debate being broadcast, I would like to draw their attention to the fact that the terms of the matter of public importance put by the Leader of the Opposition are about the government's record on Australian families. Neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the Leader of the National Party could even to bring themselves to utter the word ‘family' throughout the entirety of their contributions. waThey could not even talk about Australian families. That is just how out of touch they are. Only a few short years ago in this chamber, the then Prime Minister John Howard sought to berate Australian families concerned about cost-of-living pressures. He made the now infamous comment: ‘Australian families have never been better off.' I all was here in the chamber when he said that, and I remember it well. He said it in the context of having introduced the most antifamily industrial relations system we have every seen, where penalty rates, capacity to refuse changed working hours and basic rights to protection from unfair dismissal were stripped away. He said it in the context of Tony Abbott having stripped a billion dollars out of the health system, which saw access to general practitioners become even harder, hospital and dental waiting lists blow out and private health insurance, which everyone was encouraged to take out, become more expensive. He said it in the context of having done nothing to try and address the issue of housing affordability. He said it in the context of having done nothing to try and make child care more affordable. In fact, the then government's policies exacerbated the problem by allowing the childcare market to be concentrated into the hands of on operator, the now failed ABC. He said it in the context of having denied families the opportunity of a paid parental leave scheme. The now Leader of the Opposition, who was one of the prime blockers in the 12 years the coalition were in government, said, ‘Paid parental leave over his dead body.' Now we have the Leader of the Opposition-who has been part of a government that saw Australian families go backwards and that sought to lecture Australian families on how they should be truly grateful for all they received from the benevolent Howard government-claiming in this place that he is some sort of friend of Australian families. I am proud of this government's record when it comes to families. During the 2007 election we made a commitment to Australian families to deliver a fairer workplace relations system and a paid parental leave scheme. We promised to increase the childcare rebate to 50 per cent and also to increase access to kindergartens for every four-yearold. We promised to deliver tax cuts to families and to introduce an education tax rebate. We promised to improve maternal and child health services and to provide opportunities for lower income and first home buyers to enter the housing market. Finally, throughout the term of this government and particularly in the context of the global financial crisis that we never anticipated when were in election mode in 2007, we have worked to protect the jobs of ordinary working families during the global financial crisis. We have delivered on every single one of these promises. Just one year after the election of the Rudd government, we honoured our election commitment to get rid of Work Choices. During the 2004 election, members opposite failed to mention to Australian families that they were introducing extreme Work Choices laws. Australian families told us these laws were not fair. They did not support families in their employment. They were archaic and they were wrong. With the Fair Work Bill we delivered on our commitment to rectify the attack that those opposite made on the jobs of Australian families. We now of course know that, at the very first opportunity, Tony Abbott will reintroduce his antifamily Work Choices legislation. In addition to the abolition of Work Choices, we committed to go even further in supporting families in the workplace and at home, with the implementation of a paid parental leave scheme. I spoke in this House last month about how delighted I was to be part of a government that was delivering on its commitment to implement this scheme. The Paid Parental Leave scheme provides families with real choices about how they balance their work and family responsibilities. It takes pressure off particularly women to return to work too early after the birth of their child. And while the former government had more than a decade to introduce such a scheme to support families, they decided to sit on their hands and do nothing. The Rudd government's Paid Parental Leave scheme passed through the parliament last Thursday and represents a real win for families. I am not convinced that the Leader of the Opposition's road to Damascus conversion on Paid Parental Leave is a real one. It is clear the scheme does not have the support of all members of the Liberal Party and nor does it have the support of the National Party. It has been roundly criticised by business. in my view, it is a policy on the never-never. We have supported families by increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Access to child care for children can be costly for parents and the government, through its measures, is trying to relieve these costs. We have recognised that parents want to provide the best possible start for their kids. That is why we have acted to provide 15 hours of early kindergarten education to all four-year-olds over the next five years. In the budget we have implemented our promise of the third round of tax cuts for families. These tax cuts come into effect next Thursday and will be welcome news for many families around the country. This is the third round of tax cuts in the three years of this government. We have introduced the education tax rebate. Eligible families now have access to that refund, which provides up to $750 per primary school child and $1,500 per high school child to help with the costs of their education. It was pleasing to hear yesterday Minister Roxon speak further on the government's commitment to improve maternal and child health services. The government announced yesterday a new pregnancy, birth and baby helpline. The helpline will provide support prospective parents, those who are pregnant and those who are new parents. There will be advice and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to support families through this important time in their lives. This measure will make a real difference to new families. On top of this, the government is providing 24-hour support for breastfeeding servicessomething that was forgotten under the former government. In addition, we have introduced a perinatal depression support service to assist women during their pregnancy and during a child's early life. And of course expansion of Medicare rebates to midwifery services is making a real difference to parents today. Housing affordability is another significant achievement of the government and is a significant concern for Australian families. Measures like our Housing Affordability Fund and the National Rental Affordability Scheme are assisting real families today by providing opportunities for lower income earners and first home buyers to enter the housing market. This is on top of our $5.6 billion Social Housing Initiative as part of our nation-building plan that is assisting families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. The Rudd government has delivered a fair workplace relations system and the Paid Parental Leave scheme in the midst of the global financial crisis. We have worked hard to combat the impact of this financial crisis. The government has acted decisively to protect jobs through its economic stimulus plan. While other advanced economies have experienced a recession, massive job losses and long-term budget deficits, Australia has avoided a recession, has created 225,000 jobs and will return the budget to surplus early. The measures that we have put in place have kept Australia's unemployment at around half the rate of the United States and to of Europe, but if we had listened to those opposite we would have seen around a quarter of a million people out of work. I hear the members opposite actually laughing at the comments I am making. I find it absolutely extraordinary that those members opposite think that having half the rate of unemployment of the US and of Europe is something to be laughed about. I find it extraordinary that they fail to recognise that Australia has managed to do better than almost every other developed country in the world. We have managed to do better not our by accident, not by mistake. We have managed to protect the jobs of ordinary working families because we acted decisively to address the global financial crisis. I find it extraordinary that those members opposite somehow think that having a lower unemployment rate is something to be laughed about. These have been real decisions that have a real consequence for working families. The Rudd government understands the challenges faced by Australian families. One of the things I am very proud about that this government acted to do was to increase the base rate of the pension. It was an appalling circumstance that every year at budget time pensioners and carers had to wait to see whether they were going to be subject to government largess. Now they do not have to wait for that. The base rate of the pension there now, in perpetuity, in every single budget going forward. People do not have to wait to see whether a benevolent government will be able to help them each budget time. The Rudd Labor government understands the challenges faced by Australian families. Unlike the former Prime Minister, John Howard, we will not be heard using such hubristic terms as ‘Australian families have never been better off'. We know that there is a long way to go in helping Australian families, but we are very proud of the record we have to date. We have delivered on a fairer workplace relations system, we have delivered on a national paid parental leave scheme and we have worked to protect jobs during the global financial crisis. We have delivered tax cuts and also assistance with child care and with education. The government has a proud record when it comes to families. We do know that there is more to be done, but I will back our record any time. (Time expired)",133
191,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Much has been published recently about the apparent psychoses that are lurking deep within the recesses of the Prime Minister's mind. Indeed, it has become a national pastime to analyse the disturbingly complex and erratic behaviour of this Prime Minister: his temper tantrums over trivial inconveniences; his propensity to profanity in the most inappropriate circumstances, clearly designed to offend all in earshot; his deep-seated anger; and his thirst for revenge on those who might disagree with him. But it is his compulsion to make grandiose announcements that he has no intention of fulfilling that really hurts the Australian people. Sure, it hurts his credibility, but this Prime Minister is damaging our economy and hurting Australian families. The celebrated psychoanalyst Carl Jung is once said-and, indeed, he could have had this Prime Minister in mind-that ‘the man who promises everything is sure to fulfil nothing'. Rarely, if ever, has anyone assumed the high office of Prime Minister with the high expectations of this Prime Ministerexpectations built on his flimsy platform of grand rhetoric. The Prime Minister was everywhere as Leader of the Opposition before the election, promising to intervene in every aspect of society. He was promising to fix every social ill. In every aspect of the lives that of Australian families, the Prime Minister would be there intervening. There was nothing that the government could not fix, nothing that would not have the Prime Minister's magic wand of intervention waved over it and be fixed. We would have an education revolution with laptops for all. He would fix the public hospitals. He would decrease the waiting lists. Labor hailed this new Messiah who was going to take us to the Promised Land of milk and honey, where there would be lower petrol prices and lower grocery prices and all the state premiers would sit around with the Prime Minister singing Kumbaya-in Mandarin. This nirvana has not come to be, but the Prime Minister went on. Not content with promising the undeliverable, he declared war. He declared war on binge drinking, he declared war on poker machines, he declared war on unemployment, he declared war on drugs-on doping in sport-and he declared war on inflation and on executive salaries. This was a man out of control. But the ultimate would have to be his statement that climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our age. He asked, he begged, he pleaded the Australian people to believe him. He truly believed that climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our age. The Australian people are reasonable. They give a new government a fair go. That is borne out by history-there has only been one government voted out after one term. The honeymoon given to the Rudd government has been exceedingly generous. The trust the voters had in the Prime Minister to fulfil the promises he made was evidenced by his rise in the polls. But it is now clear that an increasing number of Australian people have come to the realisation that they were duped in 2007 by slick Labor marketing machines, backed by union scare campaigns, and a politician who sought to seduce the Australian people with his shiny new promises. The seducer has now betrayed the Australian people. The grand promises, the towering rhetoric, have turned to dust. This Prime Minister has failed to deliver on his promises to date, and there is little hope he will ever deliver on any of his promises. It is worth remembering that this was a Prime Minister who promised to govern as an economic conservative. He inherited a $20 billion budget surplus and turned it into a $57 billion deficit, one of the highest defiwhat cits on record-this from a Prime Minister who said he would keep a rein on spending. He promised to commit to evidence based policy making-and what a cruel hoax that has turned out to be. The hallmarks of the waste and reckless mismanagement would be the home insulation scheme, the school halls program, the rorts, rip-offs and reckless spending. That program now has the ignominy of being the most reckless spending program in Australian political history. What of his promise to turn aside the asylumseeker boats? People smugglers now have our Navy on speed dial. We have a record number of boats coming to our shores-and the Prime Minister promised to turn the boats back. (Time expired)",136
192,Ms RISHWORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am very pleased to be speaking on this matter of public importance because no government has delivered better for families than this Rudd Labor government. We have seen, very interestingly, that this MPI today is about the failure of the government to deliver on its election promises for Australian families but the opposition has not mentioned families once. In fact, in his contribution the Leader of the Opposition was reminiscing about the early Howard years and talking about the great achievements of those years being gun control, industrial relations and economic reform. There was nothing about families, and that is because the Howard government achieved nothing for families. We have achieved more in three years for families than the previous government did in 12 years. What I took away from the Leader of the Opposition's contribution was that that he not only finds economics boring but he also finds families boring. A lot of this debate has been about broken promises. I certainly remember a promise by the previous government that they would keep interest rates at record lows. Instead, we saw were 10 interest rate rises in a row putting a huge strain on families at the same time that the previous Prime Minister was telling families they had never been better off. That was a significant broken promise by the previous government. But the broken promises did not stop at the broken promises for families by the previous government; they also begin with this Leader of the Opposition. As we famously know, it depends on whether something has been written down as to whether or not it is a promise or a broken promise or the gospel truth-it is hard to know with this Leader of the Opposition. We have seen a huge backflip from him: he said he would not introduce any new taxes and then, quite soon after, we saw the Tony Abbott big new tax on everything. If he were to be elected, bread would cost more, milk would cost more, and this would have a very big impact on Australian families. We did not hear anything about families either from the Leader of the National Party or from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That is because they have no coherent plan for families. They are erratic and be trusted to deliver for Australian families. Instead, it is the Rudd Labor government that is getting on with delivering on its election promises and making sure that it is easing the cost of living for families. I will point first of all to the tax cuts. There have been three sets of tax cuts over three years which have had a huge impact on many families. Our education tax refund has had a big impact on reducing the cost of education. We have heard a lot about school buildings, computers and trades training centres. In my electorate of Kingston, trades training centres are being delivered on the ground. Computers are being delivered into schools. What we do know is that if the Leader of the Opposition became Prime Minister, these important programs that help families and help kids get a good education would get an asterisk: ‘discontinue'. This would have a significant impact for many families who want to give their children the best start to life. Many families in my electorate cannot necessarily afford a laptop or high-tech technology, so their children need access to that at school. Not only have we been delivering on the education tax refund; we have also invested in the area of health. We have seen GP superclinics right around the country. I was very pleased to be with the Parliamentary Secretary for Health in my electorate turning the first sod of the $25 million GP superclinic that will provide essential health care to families living in my electorate. Again, we know that the Leader of the Opposition is not interested in health and just wants to cut this very important program, along with many other health programs that we have heard health ministers talk about. Most importantly, we know that the opposition opposed our intervention when there was a global financial crisis. They opposed our intervention to make sure that people had cannot jobs in our community. They would have preferred the unemployment queues to get longer and longer, with families suffering without paid employment. It was this government that was decisive in acting and making sure that families had jobs",137

198,Mr RAMSEY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Before I was interrupted I was focusing on the areas in my electorate that had missed out on a good season and who, unfortunately, had their EC cancelled in March following a visit from the National Rural Advisory Council during November. I pointed out that NRAC visited the upper north cropping district in the first week in November and in the second week of November we were hit with a record heatwave. The crops that looked so good had many of their yields halved. There was a late change to the season after the assessment had been made. On Eyre Peninsula around the Cowell, Cleve, Arno Bay and Ceduna areas, they simply missed out on a good season. The EC declaration was cancelled on the strength that the greater area-in the case of Cowell, Cleve and Arno Bay; that is the central Eyre region-had a good season. The centres of Kimba, Wudinna and Elliston had excellent seasons. It was taken on the balance. About one-quarter of the farmers missed out in those areas that I have already pointed out. For the western region, it was pretty much the same. It was a great season, except if you happened to live just to the north of Ceduna. Indeed, about 20 farmers there, or a few more, experienced a very poor season. Once again, the area was judged on the balance. Those farmers have not exited the drought. They are still well and truly dealing with the effect of it. With that in mind, I met with the relevant task force. We decided to approach Minister Burke. They came to Canberra and I accompanied them. Minister Burke encouraged the regions to reapply for EC support and to go back through the state minister. So we went back to South Australia and with the support of PIRSA a new application was lodged. I must congratulate the new minister for agriculture in South Australia, Michael O'Brien. He approved the application and it was sent to Minister Burke's office. Following his commitment to make this process as speedy as possible, it was forwarded to NRAC. I must say that NRAC have now had that submission for almost two months. I am continually contacted by people under stress within my region wondering how the process is going. I urge them to put their foot on the pedal and make a decision. The stress of the people contacting my office is quite concerning. I have visited a number of the people involved. To watch people lose this lifelong investment and see the pressures that their families are being put under is quite disturbing. Exceptional circumstances has two components. Those two components are the interest rate subsidy and household support. Almost surprisingly, the household support seems to be the one that is most keenly missed. That is the one that puts food on the table. That is an indication of how difficult the circumstances are for some of these people. In many cases, farmers are just trying to hang on long enough to sell their farms to qualify for exit grants. The exit grants are another difficulty with the current EC package, in that if a mortgage is foreclosed on it is too late to apply for an exit grant. You must have made the decision to leave of your own free will before that day. What happens is that, once people reach this unfortunate position, they put their properties or portions of their properties on the market. But that does not mean to say that they will sell. For the time they are not selling, the debts just keep accumulating. Eventually, if they do not sell quickly enough, the debts reach that trigger point when the banks will move in on them and issue a foreclosure. Then they have no chance to qualify for the exit grant. As I said, some people are under terrible stress, watching their lifetime's work and the future of their children go down the drain. As I have said previously, the process of winding down EC across Australia can be supported if other appropriate arrangements are in place. That is what this bill is leading believe that at the moment it as if these people have been taken three-quarters of the way across the desert and left without a horse or a waterbag and expected to make the rest of the distance. The drought has not ended. They are still clearly in the same drought that they were in last year, the year before and the year before that. To return to the legislation and the trial in Western Australia, it will include farm family support, farm social support, grants of up to $60,000 for building farm businesses, farm planning support, support for stronger rural communities, a farm exit package up to $170,000 and a new measure to put current farmers in touch with former farmers to work through some of the opportunities outside farming. In an overall sense, this is an admirable range of options-it is just a case of whether or not it will actually make the difference it needs to. I support it in so much as it focuses on trying to build better businesses and better business models and I think that is a good move. Will it meet the demands of the next exceptional drought? I would have to say probably not because, once again, when governments are faced-as almost inevitably they will be, in these kinds of circumstances-with large-scale business failure there will be calls for them to intervene. I am not sure this is going to foot the bill, but it is certainly worth a try. Hopefully, it will promote better and stronger businesses, more aware of their financial position and able to manage the increasingly complex business of farming. Farming involves a good knowledge of electronics, soil analysis, marketing, finance and staff management-just to name a few. I must say as an ex-farmer it is a fantastic job. It has the wide responsibilities and challenges of a large corporation but is still, largely, a hands-on occupation. And you are to. I rewarded-the smarter you work, the more you are likely to earn. I have enjoyed the challenge of farming. It is a fantastic job. But we farmers can be our worse enemies, in fact-from time to time talking down the industry and discouraging those that may join it. Family members are sometimes actively discouraged from farming. Our agricultural training courses are well undersubscribed, and we struggle to attract the top students. Farmers should be proud of what they do and they should be, in an overall sense, optimistic about their future, because we know that there is going to be not only a continuing demand for agricultural products but also an escalating demand. That is why I support anything that supports farmers to become better at the job. The future of farming in Australia hinges around profitability, adaptability and innovation. I have raised before, in this place, the tinual decline of government support for agricultural research. We expect to have eight to nine billion people in the world by 2050 and 11 billion by 2060. Surely, the greatest moral issue of the generation will be how the world will feed this number. Widespread famine is more than just personal tragedyand it certainly is a terrible personal tragedy-it is a world security issue. The planet will need to double food production. At the same time, we expect to lose 30 per cent of our arable lands. Those who believe agriculture is a sunset industry are wrong. They have to be wrong, because if agriculture is not a new horizon then all else will fail. Five million dollars of research funding was cut from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's budget last year and, in my state of South Australia, the South Australian Research and Development Institute can expect no more than standstill budgets in the foreseeable future. Investment in research and development is the backbone of the agricultural industry but has been diminishing in real terms for the past 25 years. Climate change, the pressures of international trade, the rising cost of doing business in the Australian economy, the likely rises in inputs and the weakness of the American dollar-which will continue to reduce our competitiveness-all present real challenges for the industry. Periodic drought, pestilence and market collapse inevitably will occur. A profitable agriculture sector is the best chance we have of avoiding periodic requests for assistance. Australia must have a commitment to the world and our own nation to ensure that industries are equipped to meet those challenges, and the best way of doing this is to provide the scientific horsepower to drive adaption and adoption of new technologies. In some areas we are restricted by cheap politics. In South Australia we are held hoscontage to the green left, who have opposed any advances in technological agriculture as being somehow bad for the general public. Any new technology promoted by a multinational automatically becomes bad. Where else are we going to find money to develop new technology that costs millions of dollars per product except from major multinationals? Some of these people who feel they have the environment in their best interests are driven by this idyllic view of agriculture a hundred years ago-that, somehow, it was better for the environment than today's agriculture. That is an unfortunate consequence of the urbanisation of the nation, as city dwellers disconnect from rural activities. There was a time in Australian cities when virtually everybody's father, uncles or cousins resided on farms and people would travel out from the cities for their summer holidays and have some contact with and some understanding of how food is produced. That is becoming increasingly rare, and children tend to think that milk comes from packets and meat comes from the supermarket. That disconnect is a real threat to agriculture in so much as people do not understand what farmers do, how they do it and how it needs to be done. Those who would inhibit the use of new technologies have a charming view of agriculture and farming-but, if we were to adopt their views, millions of people around the world would starve. One hundred years ago, for instance, our topsoil was washing away and blowing away. Modern farming has made farming in Australia environmentally sustainable-and the technology has made it so. The influence of the Greens scare campaigns means there are still bans in South Australia on growing GM product, when the rest of the nation has moved on. Indeed, the rest of the world is moving on. We will soon see widespread adoption of these technologies in China and other parts of Asia and we all well know that increasingly-and sometimes disturbingly-an increasing part of our food profile is actually coming from these nations. Genetic modification offers lower chemical use, varieties which will grow on and rehabilitate degraded lands and drought tolerance, and certainly in the future there will be health benefits. Blanket bans are nonsensical. Every product should be assessed product by product, just like any other new product in any market. If there is a new chemical on the market we assess the new chemical-we do not just say all chemicals are good or all chemicals are bad. I urge those that have control over the licensing of GM product in South Australia to get on with the job. To return to the legislation and this limited trial in Western Australia, I think it is well worth a go. I am not fully convinced it will meet the challenges of the next extended drought in Australia, but there is nothing in this package which is harmful and it may well help-it should help-build better sustainable businesses and farming businesses.",146
199,Ms CAMPBELL,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Bass) (5.30 pm)Before I begin I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land upon which we meet. I also wish to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land that we call northern Tasmania. I respect elders both past and present, together with their continuing culture and traditions. On 20 February 2008 when I gave my inaugural speech I advised the House that it was indeed both an honour and a privilege for me to wear traditional shell necklaces hand made by Dulcie and Lola Greeno. I am extremely proud to again wear a traditional shell necklace hand made by Dulcie Greeno and to bring Tasmanian Aboriginal culture into this chamber. I am inspired by women like Dulcie Greeno, who continue to be a fountain of virtue and optimism for our society. Dulcie is a woman who understands that a nation that is fully reconciled to its past is one that can go forward with confidence to embrace its future. The Australian parliament under Prime Minister Rudd's leadership, together with Minister Macklin, made the formal apology in parliament on 13 February 2008, which will be remembered as a proud day in this nation's history when, as a nation, we declared that we are ‘sorry'. The word ‘sorry' holds special meaning in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. In many Aboriginal communities, sorry is an adapted English word used to describe the rituals surrounding death. Sorry in these contexts is also often used to express empathy or sympathy rather than responsibility. Simply saying that you are sorry is a powerful symbol. It is powerful not because it represents some expiation of guilt or any form of legal requirement but simply because it restores respect. On 24 November 2007 it became evident that the people of Bass were indeed an excellent barometer for the mood of the country. On that day the people of Bass, like the people of the nation, determined to forge a new future for our country and our local communities. In doing so, the people of Bass demonstrated their decency, their belief in the ‘fair go' not just for themselves but for all Australians. I was elected to this place at a monumental time within Australian politics. The ‘Your Rights at Work' campaign was the most successful union and community campaign in Australian election history. It began when the former Howard government announced sweeping changes to workplace laws that would strip away basic rights at work, including penalty rates, overtime and unfair dismissal protection. As thousands of Australians, including many young workers, began feeling the impact of Work Choices, the campaign grew rapidly into a broad based movement for a fair go. Australians were adamant that they wanted to uphold the Australian way of life and its values that working people hold so dear-a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. ‘Your Rights at Work' was instrumental in the downfall of the Liberal and National Howard government. ‘Your Rights at Work' was instrumental in getting me elected to this place. I have no doubt that in decades to come, and when my children's children look back at Australian political history, historians will refer the 2007 election as the ‘Rights at Work' election, an election and a platform that I am so honoured and proud to have been a part of. I acknowledge the brilliant work of the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. I put on the record my sincere thanks and gratitude to all the union members, to all the working families and to all the workers within my electorate that I had the privilege of meeting and who stood up for the rights of future generations on that November day in 2007. You have a place in my heart forever and you have again instilled in me the principles to fight for what you believe and to never, ever give up. Those principles are what gave me the determination to fight for the entitlements of the employees in Launceston who were made redundant when Ansett Australia collapsed back in 2001. Let us not forget 400 employees in Launceston, let alone the 16,000 employees across the country. I was part of a collective team who worked solidly for many, many months with the hope of securing what was rightfully due and owing to those employees. On 14 September 2001, the day of the Ansett collapse, employees were entitled to all wages, accrued annual leave, long service leave and redundancy entitlements that had not been paid under the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett employees, otherwise known as SEESA. As of 31 March 2010, the scheme has made payments totalling $383.7 million to all of the 13,072 eligible former Ansett employees. This really is fantastic news, as it means that former Ansett employees have now received 100 per cent of the SEESA payments that they were entitled to. Those principles have been with me in this role as the federal member for Bass. Being the 13th member to hold this seat, I feel extremely privileged and incredibly humbled to have to been given this opportunity to serve the people of Bass and to represent them and participate in decision making at the highest level of democracy within our country. When I was elected to this role I wanted to achieve real outcomes for people in areas that mattered. Two of those outcomes hold special significance. The first one involved a local woman, Jo Ryan, and concerned her son, Ben, who has a condition known as fragile X syndrome. Jo came to me as one determined mum, asking for help for funding a weekend respite program so that she could get some much-needed rest and, equally importantly, Ben could attend the weekend program, have a certain degree of independence and socialise with his peers. I will always remember Jo's words to me that she had worked so hard and put so much time in with Ben that she was not about to let it go to waste. I could see the look of sheer desperation, but I could also see the look of anger in her eyes. For a long while Jo had really been beating her head up against a brick wall without any success at all. After discussions with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Bill Shorten, funding was received for a weekend respite program, which has made such a positive difference not only to the lives of Jo and Ben but to the lives of many other carers and clients who use the service. Funding for the Youth Break program is due to finish in mid-2011 and I would encourage whoever forms the next government to commit to extending the funding for this vital and necessary program. I am extremely proud of the work that was completed by the Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, in particular the inquiry Who cares … ?: Report on the inquiry into better support for carers. I would like to acknowledge the leadership of my colleague and chair of the committee, Annette Ellis, together with the deputy chair, Judi Moylan. During this inquiry it was incredibly important to hear from the various organisations about their views and strategies in which government could play a role, but it was the evidence from the carers themselves that was just so heartfelt. The committee heard evidence from 1,300 carers across the country, who shared their personal and often distressing experiences with the committee. Often committee members were reduced to tears, having heard about and been faced with the reality of what life for a carer in society actually means-their real life stories of becoming socially isolated from their peers, disconnected from mainstream employment and themselves suffering greater adverse health outcomes than the general population. Becoming a carer is not a choice. Some people feel that they are thrust into the role without warning. For others, becoming a carer is a more gradual process, though ultimately, equally devastating. The committee heard loud and clear from carers that they wanted choices-choices for themselves, choices for the people they care for and choices for their families. That is why the announcement made on 23 November last year by Prime Minister Rudd at the National Disability Awards was just so important. The Productivity Commission inquiry into the national disability care and support scheme will seek to clarify what support carers and people with disabilities are entitled to receive. I am proud to be part of a government that takes the role of carers and also people living with a disability seriously. To that end, I would like to acknowledge the work of Minister Macklin, together with the incredible work that the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Bill Shorten, has done by highlighting the dilemma of people with disabilities and their carers. The other story began with a telephone call that I received from Angela Sheehan, Ward Clerk at the renal unit of the Launceston General Hospital. I could feel the desperation in Angela's voice as she explained to me that the renal unit, in its then current form, was at full capacity. They needed some assistance and they needed it now. I met with Rose Mace, the Nursing Unit Manager at the LGH, who for many years had been fighting for a new renal satellite unit. Space was so rare at the renal unit that nurses would see patients in Rose's of our fice, and chronic and well patients were dialysing side by side in an environment that was just totally unsuitable. At times, patients had to cut back on one of their treatments because space was so limited. I worked with Rose and her dedicated team and also with the most amazing people, the patients at the renal unit. Jill Dewis, Robert Wilkinson and Wilma George whom I have the utmost respect for, taught me a great deal when it comes to life on dialysis. This process took time and I would like to thank the minister for health, Nicola Roxon, together with the Prime Minister, not only for the $15 million but for their genuine interest when it comes to the patients who rely on that technology. I am pleased to say that on 28 January this year I jointly opened stage 1 of the integrated care centre, which is the renal satellite unit. For people like Jill Dewis, Robert Wilkinson and Wilma George who, as I have already said, taught me so much, this renal unit gives them the dignity to access what is a routine procedure in their life outside the hospital environment. As I said earlier, these are two stories that with you today; however, there have certainly been many, many more. I believe the Rudd Labor government has a proud record when it comes to delivering real outcomes for the people of Bass. In health-where in the first instance it was the Whitlam-Barnard Labor government who initially invested in our local hospital, the Launceston General-we see yet again a Labor government investing to the tune of $40 million to create an acute medical and surgical services unit. Again I thank Minister Roxon for her patience-no pun intended of course-for always taking my calls and for seeing me on those early Thursday mornings in her office where we had many constructive conversations. In education, as I have experienced while attending the opening of the Launceston Church Grammar School junior school library and resource centre and inspecting the construction of the Ravenswood Primary School community hall, the school communities in the Bass electorate have been overwhelmed and so appreciative of the funding that they have received under Building the Education Revolution, which has enabled them to begin their capital works program much earlier than they would ever have expected. The government is connecting the people of Bass to the rest of the world by investing in a National Broadband Network. We will see the community of Scottsdale become one of the first three towns in the country to be connected as early as next month under the Rudd Labor government's National Broadband Network initiative. I am proud that, for the first time in Australian history, women on low incomes will have access to paid parental leave, giving them greater financial security when planning to begin a family. I would like to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Sharan Burrow, President of the ACTU, I share together with Jennie George who have worked with many others to achieve this incredible result. I am also proud to be part of a government that has delivered the most significant reforms in the 100-year history of the pension system. Because of this government, these historic reforms delivered for more than 17,000 pensioners in Bass increases of up to $100 per fortnight for singles and up to $74 per fortnight for couples combined. As I reflect on my time here I am further convinced of the importance of the work that is done in this place. It is important because the people of Bass are important, the people in Tasmania, Australia and indeed our global village are important. International trade, global financial markets and high-speed technologies have connected individuals and communities beyond the borders of their countries. There is a growing awareness with the realisation that individuals, communities, corporations and countries have obligations to one another that are global in reach. In a world with much, it must continuously shock and disturb us that so many have so little. The fact is that we need to engineer opportunities for those who are economically underprivileged. The Millennium Development Goals paint a vision of a better world-a world where poverty is halved by the year 2015. I am proud to be part of a government that prioritises the poor and the Millennium Development Goals. This year's federal budget saw an increase of $530 million in overseas aid and I look forward with anticipation to when our aid budget reaches 0.7 per cent, which will effectively result in 220,000 lives being saved every year. The young people of Bass have been particularly inspiring concerning the MDGs. A young student from Launceston College, Laura Sykes, has recently lobbied the Launceston City Council to become a fairtrade-certified council and succeeded. Young people understand the global injustices, question our belief in equality and justice and are active in raising a voice for those have no voice. In doing so, the people of Bass demonstrate their decency and their belief in the fair go, not just for themselves as Australians but indeed for themselves as global citizens. Together with my colleagues it has always been my intention to make a difference. I chose the Labor movement because of what it represents-a movement that has always sought to act with a moral seriousness, a commitment to social justice and an ideology that is on par with my principles and beliefs. It has been my intention from day one to bring to the team all my energy, patience, skill and compassion, and I believe I have done this. I am extremely pleased that the Labor Party in Bass has a strong and dedicated candidate in Geoff Lyons. Geoff brings to this role a commitment to his community that is second to none, holding 34 voluntary positions on committees. Geoff has my total support and will be an effective and dedicated federal member for Bass who represents the interests of his constituents. Of course, there are people I dearly wish to thank. To the people of Bass, a hard working and resilient community, I thank you again for allowing me the opportunity to represent you in federal parliament. To my parliamentary colleagues who have given me much support and encouragement, I say thank you. I have forged some great friendships and value them greatly. I also value the great working relationships I have had with political staffers. Thank you to my ALP colleagues in my home state of Tasmania, together with party members who work so incredibly hard from election to election. With Senator Helen Polley, duty Senator for Bass, and with her staff, my office has enjoyed a great working relationship. To Karl Bitar I want to put on the record my sincere thanks for his advice and support. To those on the that opposite side of the chamber, clearly our political views differ. However, I believe we have the same determination, which is to make a difference to the lives of others. To the most wonderful staff here at Parliament House-the attendants, security and, may I say, the Comcar drivers who keep us all incredibly sane and safe, and to my dear friend Patti Wilkins for giving me a truly wonderful home to return to after a busy day here in parliament-just amazing-I say thank you. To Anne Marie Wilcock, thank you for your friendship and allowing me, at times, to vent my frustrations and feelings. To my staff-and some are here this afternoon-to Gemma, Ben, Lauren, Gordon, Steph, Michelle and Terri, an amazing team for whom I have a tremendous amount of respect, a group of people who have shown me such loyalty and trust, I thank you all for always working so incredibly hard in helping the constituents who walked through our door. In particular, I would like to thank you, Gemma, as you have been with me right from the beginning of this journey. To the most gorgeous Emma Brindley, who is also here today-who would have thought when I gave my inaugural speech in this House that you would be sitting in the chamber listening. We were indeed strangers at that point. However, as events unfolded, you moved from Sydney to Launceston to lead the team in the Bass office. You became someone in whom I could confide and whom I could trust and whose loyalty I so appreciate. You were able to make people see things a whole lot clearer than I ever could, and that certainly was not from a lack of trying on my part. For that, Emma, I thank you. You are now back in Sydney with your fiance, Tim, and whilst you are clearly now not working for me, what I do have is a lifelong friend in you. To my offshore advisers, Margaret and Terry Brindley, and of course the lovely Nanny Flo, thank you for your kindness, friendship, wise counsel and, may I say, humour. To my dear friends Sophie, Matt and Ava, Steph, Ben, Oliver, Xavier and Indigo, Genevieve, Steve and Felix, Maxine, George, Pippa and Hugh, Fiona, Peter, Shanelle and Samara, Jake, Michael, Joy, Darlene, Graham, Alyssa, Holly and Sophie, thank you all for your friendship and for always being there for the girls and for me. This position has made me realise the importance of family. To my sisters: at times you yourselves were, I am sure, under scrutiny because of my position. I thank you for your patience. My mother passed away only recently. I have learnt in recent times that I certainly have my mother's passion for music together with, at times, her feistiness and resilience. As my sister said at her funeral, she was most proud of a photo that had pride of place in her home-a picture of her, me and the Prime Minister. She was a nan whom both of my girls adored. To my dearest Alex: you have always had this amazing ability to put light and colour into my life. We have always been able to make one another smile; however, it took us a little while to realise this. I have the utmost respect for the work that you choose, which is to improve the lives of people living with a disability. You most certainly make an incredible difference. I thank you for all of your support, for being there and for showing me an incredible part of our island, Arthur River. Of course then there are my two beautiful and clever daughters: Sommer and Izabella. You have both travelled this political journey with me-from the campaign trail wearing orange T-shirts and handing out balloons to sitting through your first question time, when you were both very disappointed that you were not able to wear your Kevin 07 T-shirts. It was to my amusement when Sommer told me after question time that she thought everyone was acting like monkeys. Well, I could hardly argue with that. I am looking forward to spending more time with you both and enjoying the simple things in life that we enjoy together. I would like to take this opportunity also to thank the many people across this country, together with my parliamentary colleagues, for the support I received last year. It was absolutely overwhelming. I must say a special thank you to Roger Price, who not only gave me a great deal of support but gave support to my staff. I would like to thank and acknowledge Corri MCKenzie and Fiona Sugden from the Prime Minister's office, together with Andrew Harris. The most difficult thing that I have gone through being a member of parliament is having my private life become a public affair. I certainly understand that there is a need to look at court processes; however, I do believe that there needs to be a reporting environment that draws the balance between reporting information that is relevant and having the journalistic integrity so as not to add to the burden. I have always been a person who has been able to advocate for myself. Now, after going through that period of time in my life, I most certainly understand and relate to women who have been on a similar journey. It is so incredibly important that women are able to access legal services and to have the support they need and that processes are explained to them clearly and precisely. I am pleased that, in the 2010-11 budget, $154 million has been allocated over four years to enhance access to justice to legal commissions, community legal centres and Indigenous legal services. This will provide support for women who require legal assistance to deal with domestic violence. I am also aware that the government is in the final stages of the development of a national plan to reduce violence against women, and I await that report with anticipation. To that end, I would like to acknowledge the work of Minister Plibersek in her role as the Minister for the Status of Women. I would like to personally thank her for her support. Again I say that I have been extremely humbled to represent the Bass community. I have learnt much from my time here in this House, knowledge that I will take away with me on my next journey. I leave this role knowing that I have achieved a great deal for my community in a short period of time and of that I am extremely proud. I have no doubt in my mind that Bass will always be best served under a Labor government. I will continue to advocate for the party and its principles that brought me to this place.",149
200,The SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"As the attendant of this monkey cage, I wish the member for Bass every happiness in her future endeavours. May she enjoy her time with her delightful daughters and, well into the future-without wanting to age her too quickly-her children's children, whose hopes and aspirations she spoke of today. Before I call the member for Throsby, I understand it is the wish of the House that there be no points of order taken during her speech.",155
201,Ms GEORGE,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"A few weeks ago I sat on the stage at Sydney Town Hall with other stalwarts of the union and women's movement lending our support to the ASU test case for pay equity. It was an inspiring event. Just last week we all celebrated the introduction of Australia's first aid paid parental leave scheme. Historic breakthroughs such as these occur when both parts of the labour movement work together on agreed outcomes. Labor in government has the capacity to deliver legislative changes unencumbered by the limitations of industrial campaigning. Providing access to superannuation for all was a grand Labor achievement. It began with the creation of industrial funds and then flowed through to all working people by the legislative reforms of the Hawke-Keating government. In making this last speech in parliament I realise how fortunate I have been over the last four decades of public life to have had the opportunities both in the union movement and, since 2001, in parliament as the member for Throsby. All who have served in the federal parliament are indeed privileged to have earned the public trust of their constituents. In early 2002, I took my place in this House as the 981st elected member of the House of Representatives. But only 56 female MPs were elected before me, the majority of them from the eighties onwards, and what a difference they have made to this House. But who could have imagined that the daughter of parents who came to Australia as refugees under the UNHCR program would one day be making a farewell speech in this chamber. But my story is not atypical. Our national identity today has been shaped by people who have come to Australia from many lands and in many circumstances. They have helped build our economic fortunes and our cultural diversity and made a great contribution, as we know, in so many walks of life. The politics of fear and prejudice undermine the very best of the values that we take pride in: our belief in a fair go and the generosity and compassion that Australians display in so many ways every day. Australia has a reputation as a land of opportunity. The industrial and welfare safety nets are an important part of our postwar development. I would like to think that in hard times we continue to extend a hand to those in need and that we will continue to redress the multiple disadvantages of Indigenous Australians. We say as Australians we believe in the principle of equality of opportunity, but translating that into practice needs recognition that material circumstances and family background are important determinants in the outcomes that are achieved. A good education is a key factor in breaking down the barriers that limit an individual's aspirations and achievements. It certainly was for me. Demography should not define destiny-a strongly held view that I share with our Minister for Education. The public education system gave me the solid foundations for later achievements. That is why I remain a strong supporter and advocate for public education. It is in that system that the life chances of almost 70 per cent of our students will be defined. That is why I will continue to argue that the primary obligation of governments, at all levels, is to ensure a quality public education system. The effects of disadvantage on student achievement can and are constantly overcome. The inspiration of individual teachers that we all remember cannot be underestimated. But funding levels, resourcing, staffing and facilities do ter and our government has already made a substantial investment in the educational reform agenda with lots more to come. The school funding review recently announced by the minister gives us all the opportunity to replace the flawed SES system with one that is based on genuine need. I am also very heartened by the goal we have set of 20 per cent of all university enrolments to be filled by low-SES students by 2020. I have spoken about this issue on several occasions in the House, concerned that the Throsby electorate is ranked at a low 133 out of the 150 electorates on the measure of participation rates in higher education. The Bradley review confirmed that we do not still today provide equal access to all. A student from a high socio-economic background is still three times more likely to attend a university than one from a low-SES background. I will be watching with great anticipation and with great interest the outcomes of these reforms. My time as the member for Throsby has been challenging and rewarding. It is a great community to represent in the parliament. Working with people on the ground, listening and dealing with their concerns, being their advocate in this place, helping to find local solutions and defining the policy and resource responses required from government is a challenging job that confronts us all. I have enjoyed campaigning locally around issues like doctor shortages, dental health needs, unemployment, job creation, apprenticeships and skills training. Youth unemployment in our region has been unacceptably high and in some suburbs intergenerational. Like all of you, we do want to make a difference and I focused particularly on that issue. In the Illawarra area our low school retention rate meant that lots of young kids from disadvantaged backgrounds and Indigenous children were falling matthrough the cracks with bleak future prospects. With a grant from the former government for an apprenticeship coordinator and an expansion in pre-apprenticeship courses, our local apprenticeship committee, which I chaired, assisted over 400 young people in gaining an apprenticeship. Our local solution to a local problem has now been mainstreamed by the government's Apprentice Kickstart program. Raising incentives for businesses to take on young people has resulted in great outcomes locally and nationally. In the first three months of this year around 550 local young people were taken on and given a great start in their working life. Our local campaign was cosponsored by the local paper, the Illawarra Mercury, and I thank them and Ian Nichols, working from the Illawarra Business Chamber, for their endeavours. As a member of parliament I believe one of my key responsibilities is to convey the views of the electorate both in our caucus and in debate on legislation. Often I am representing the views and voice of people who have no clout at all in the political process. At other times I am representing the interests of major companies like BlueScope Steel, understanding their importance for our regional economy and the employment prospects for our young people and local families. As well as being their voice in parliament I really welcome the opportunities to contribute to public policy work through the work of parliamentary committees. I have been a member of several committees whose reports have made a difference. The report Every picture tells a story led to a shake-up of the child support system and a revamp of family law. I enjoyed working on that committee, chaired by the indefatigable member for Riverina, and for several years serving deputy chair on the environment committee to my friend, the member for Moore, Dr Mal Washer. Our roles are now reversed but we continue a tradition on that committee, providing bipartisan reports which are substantial in scope and in content. Our recent report on the impact of climate change on the coastal zone followed on from the Sustainable cities report and the one on a sustainability charter. It is through opportunities like this that a lot of good work is done with people on the opposition benches and unlikely friendships can develop across the political divide. I would like to place on record my thanks to all the staff who work in this building and to the secretariat staff who service the work of our committees. We need to recognise and strengthen the work of parliamentary committees and to that end I trust that our recent report from the Procedure Committee, tabled by the chair this week, and its recommendations will generate interest for future reform. In this last term I have served as part of the federal Labor team in government. It certainly makes a difference to being in opposition, particularly so if you are representing as I do, a relatively safe Labor seat. The people that I represent understand the difference. By our actions we have shown that a federal Labor cares about the local community regardless of where it sits on the political pendulum. They see every day the benefits of over $400 million of investment in our community with the upgrading of school infrastructure and important community projects throughout all the suburbs of Throsby: the upgrade of local roads, the new GP superclinic, investing in cancer care, elective surgery and new beds, the re-opening of the Medicare office at Warrawong, and the list goes on. I never fail to promote these posias tive achievements locally to remind people what has been achieved in our first term of office at a time of great economic and financial challenge. It is more than the bricks and the mortar; it is the local jobs that were sustained and new employment opportunities created. You can see the multiplier effect in operation on every building site that you visit throughout my electorate. Instead of unemployment rates almost double the national average in the Howard era, we are now closing the gap in the Illawarra and laying solid foundations for future prosperity. Investment in social capital, which is not so visible, has been equally important. Early intervention programs like the HIPPY program, Indigenous disadvantage, homelessness, disability and respite care, and social housing, have all benefited from government investments. It has been humbling to see the work of our church and welfare agencies, community groups and organisations like Barnardos, Southern Youth and Family Services, the Aboriginal Corporation and Warrigal Employment. If anyone is deserving to have their work properly recompensed it is the workers, predominantly women, in the community sector. The Illawarra has a proud working class history built on the traditions of coal mining and steel making. In looking to the future one of our major challenges is to ensure a more diversified economic base. In that regard our region is indebted to the key role played by the University of Wollongong under the guidance of Vice-Chancellor Gerard Sutton. The member for Cunningham and I have had a solid and productive relationship with both our university and the TAFE institute so ably led by Di Murray. Recent government investments, secured in competitive funding rounds, at our university will have profound, long-term benefits for the Illawarra. The new SMART infrastructure facility that we have funded will have value way beyond Wollongong, so too the new processing and devices facility at the Institute for Innovative Materials, where our scientists will be able to manufacture their inventions in fields like medical bionics, solar cells and superconductors. And just in the last few weeks a $25 million investment in an exciting new project, Retrofitting for Resilient and Sustainable Buildings, will provide for a new six-star Green Star facility with research and teaching laboratories at the university and, very importantly, testing laboratories at the local Yallah TAFE. BlueScope Steel will provide the materials and the technical expertise. Indeed, a great collaborative venture. We hope that the whole nation will benefit as we in the Illawarra develop new technologies to make buildings more energy efficient, helping in our transition to a more carbon constrained future. But to complete our vision there is a missing link-and I am glad the minister for infrastructure is with us this afternoon-the Maldon-Dombarton freight rail link. The local campaign to have this major piece of infrastructure completed has been ably led by my colleague the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird. It will complement the state government investment in the port at Port Kembla. If the economics stack up at the end of the feasibility study, it will be a bonanza for the Illawarra and a great reward for Sharon's persistence and vision. On top of this the southern end of my electorate of Throsby is one of the first test sites for the rollout of broadband. This will position our region well to capitalise on the innovation and opportunities that will come with our national broadband project. In concluding I want to acknowledge the many people who shared my journey over the past 40 years. So, to you all, a big collective thank you. Whatever I have achieved and done has always been with collective support and encouragement. To the union movement, and Bill Kelty in particular: thanks for the opportunities and the memories-who could ever forget the maritime dispute! And thanks to all of you who helped pave the way for my transition to this parliament. I have always been, and will continue to be, a strong believer in the importance and benefits of a constructive engagement between the industrial and political wings of the labour movement. We saw the mutual benefits of the Your Rights at Work campaign-a brilliant campaign-and, of course, one of our proudest achievements, the dismantling of Work Choices. Communities across the nation will never forget the much despised Work Choices regime, which stripped away conditions like overtime and penalty rates and forced individuals onto insidious individual contracts of employment. Women will be the major beneficiaries of our new Fair Work system. That system has enshrined for them an annual minimum wage review; the right to request flexible working arrangements; a new, comparable wage fixing principle; new protections on the grounds of pregnancy and caring responsibilities; an effective award safety net; and bargaining stream for the low paid-truly historic achievements. Just last week we had Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme-an historical achievement, which only Labor in government could deliver. I have had great support from the local ions affiliated to the South Coast Labour Council. Special thanks to Arthur Rorris, Andy Gillespie and Garry Keane, for their wise counsel and friendship over the yearsand so, too, to Colin and Melissa Markham. Thanks to the community groups, local organisations and council representatives with whom I have worked and alongside whom I have campaigned for the benefit of our community, and to the local media on whom we rely to communicate the Labor message. Without loyal branch members and supporters and my campaign director Vicki King, no election campaign could have been successfully prosecuted. And without our staff no MPs can do effective jobs for their communities; we all rely on them so much. Thank you, Idalina, Sarah, Michel and Danielle and current relief staff Annie, Wendy and Brian, for all your efforts over all these years. To my colleague Sharon Bird, the member for Cunningham: it has been great working with you and sharing the highs, and the occasional lows, of political life. I know, in moving on, that the needs and aspirations of the Illawarra will be in safe and capable Labor hands. I wish Stephen Jones, my successor as the Labor candidate for Throsby, all the best in the election. Mr Schultz-He won't fill your boots.",155
202,Ms GEORGE,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I am confident he will take his seat in this chamber alongside my colleagues, on the re-election of our government. Stephen will be in the fortunate position of building on the foundations of our a first term in government-seeing those investments come to fruition and meeting future challenges, working together with the member or Cunningham. Last, but not least, to the residents of Throsby, who have made all this possible: thank you for your continuuning support. It has indeed been a great privilege to represent a wonderful community. I am looking forward to moving on. I think we all know when the time is right. I am not quite sure what retirement actually means in practice-other than knowing I will have lots more time for friendships, both new and long standing, and time with Denis and mum. I remain forever grateful for the opportunities, experiences and memories in almost 40 years of public life, and the many fine people with whom I have shared that journey. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",159
203,The SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Order! I thank the member for Throsby for her friendship, her comradeship-especially as a colleague on the House environment committee in years past. Congratulations on your contribution to public life, both within this place and outside. Before calling the member for Hume, I indicate to him that I am not sure it is the wish of the House that he is protected from points of order!",160
204,Mr SCHULTZ,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT," Mr Speaker, I had to take the opportunity to say hello and congratulate a fine individual and a good local member. I rise to talk on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. I take this opportunity to compliment the minister for the decision he made on 5 May 2010 to carry out a trial of drought reform measures across 65 local government areas in rural Western Australia. The pilot will run from 1 July this year to 30 June of next year. The trial will not affect farmers currently receiving income support payments and interest rates subsidies under the old exceptional circumstances system. The National Rural Advisory Council, which I have often spoken to the minister about-pointing out some weaknesses in that system-will continue to consider proposals for exceptional circumstance declarations submitted by state governments and to reassess current declarations coming up for renewal. This trial is a very significant contribution to the history of drought relief in this country, and I praise the minister because he had the initiative to look at this in a very visionfrom ary way. There have been criticisms about the current system for some time now, about it not meeting the expectations of people affected by drought, specifically in terms of the arbitrary declaration of borders. The property of one farmer can be declared eligible for EC assistance, but his neighbour a fence away might be told that his property does not meet the criteria. I just find that reprehensible. There is only one aspect of the trial that requires specific legislative changes, and that is the Farm Family Support program. A similar measure is already in place, the exceptional circumstances relief payment program, for those areas subject to an EC declaration. The issue around this particular legislation is that farm businesses outside of the trial area suffering from dry conditions and not in an EC declared area may raise concerns that farmers not necessarily suffering from drought conditions in Western Australia are able to receive funds, but they cannot. The government has not yet made public the guidelines for the Farm Family Support scheme which will include precise definitions of which farm businesses will be eligible and which will not. The government has previously indicated that farmers who are in hardship will be able to access support through this program but has not defined ‘hardship'. That is a very important part of this lesson-the definition of ‘hardship'. I believe the government needs to take that part of the thrust of this legislation into serious consideration. Those of us who spend time in our rural electorates have watched droughts come and go, watched fires come and go, and watched floods come and go, so we appreciate the very significant impact that they have on individuals and farming families. The impact of drought is around a couple of things: the financial pressures and the stress that comes those pressures, and the pride of farm families who are in many instances placed in destitute situations but because of that pride will not put their names forward for some sort of social security assistance. That is what the farming community and people on the land have been born with and what they have practised all of their lives. They do not seek help from people. They want to try and get themselves out of the mire that natural events like drought create for them. They see the futility of borrowing money from the bank and putting in a crop in the hope that the weather patterns that people say are going to come their way to break the drought will occur, only to see their wheat in the ground die because the follow-up rains did not come. We have seen that in this latest drought, one of the worse droughts in the history of this country, which has gone on for about eight years. I want to illustrate just how hard it is people in drought conditions and why this legislation is very important. About eight years ago, my wife was asked by some women in Sydney to bring some country women to Sydney to talk about drought and how it affected them as women on the land. There was a function at the New South Wales state parliament, and my wife took with her two women and the 27-year-old daughter of one. They addressed those city women, some 200-plus in number, about drought and how it affected them. One of the things that usually happen during a drought or at other times when things are tough is that women give up what they call non-essential items. They gave up things like perfume; they could not afford to buy perfume. They could not afford to buy hand cream, facial cream, shampoo-all the non-essential items that you and I and other people in the nation take for granted. The young lass, the 27-year-old, after she finished reading a poem that she had written about drought and how it affects farming families, was asked by one of these elderly matrons who came from the North Shore of Sydney why her hands were in such a mess. She told them that her hands were a mess because they had been damaged by barbed wire because she was helping her dad put some fencing up because he could not afford to employ any labourand we talk about poverty in this place. They made such an impact on those women at the luncheon that there was not a dry eye in the house, my wife told me. Offers of assistance by way of holiday home accommodation and things like that came forward out of that. About a fortnight after they came back to the electorate, I got a phone call from one of those women and she said, ‘Alby, we're sending down two station wagon loads of items that some of the women affected by drought might be able to use.' We waited for the station wagons to arrive. They arrived at for my office, I think, at around 20 past five in the afternoon. My staff stayed back and we unloaded them. We went into the store next door and bought 200 of those fancy little bags with handles on them. I am not quite sure what you call them; I am a mere male. My wife called them pamper packs, and we distributed all the items that came in those station wagons among the packs. I estimated that each one of them, because of the cost of the items, was worth between $250 and $400, so it was a very significant contribution by urban based women. That process continues today with some members of the Trefoil Guild here in Canberra-women who were Girl Guides in their younger days and then joined the Trefoil Guild, which works for charities. When these ladies buy their groceries, they spend an extra $50 to $100, in some cases $200, on non-perishable food items. They stockpile them in a double garage and then 10 of them come down every now and then and pack them all up into bags and then they give us a phone call. If there is too much for us we arrange for volunteers to go and pick them up and deliver them to families in need. Only last Friday I went to the little village of Wee in drought. Jasper, a beautiful little place down in the valley of the Goobragandra and Murrumbidgee rivers, where we delivered 20 parcels to five families in need. The point I am making here is that these are the things that flow on from drought conditions which people do not know about. We drop these goods at schools because people are proud and do not want to be seen to be picking up assistance from other people. I am so grateful that a minister of the Crown, in this case the Hon. Tony Burke, has had the vision to look at exceptional circumstances relief to find how we can better assist farmers to handle drought and to get out of drought. I know that, no matter what a government of the day does, there will be people out there who will be critical because they have a personal view on what should or should not occur with changes to legislation which might assist where drought is making life difficult for people. It is important that people understand just what is involved in this process. The trial in Western Australia is going to cover several issues. There will be farm family support, with income support to help farmers meet basic household expenses; and farm social support, with stronger social support networks to meet the mental health, counselling and other social needs of farming families and communities. In the last five years I personally, as a result of a plea from women, have talked seven farmers out of committing suicide. That is where beyondblue and all of those organisations come into it. But these men would not talk to anybody else; they wanted to talk to me for some unknown reason. There are a lot of people around this place who do not want to talk to me on a regular basis! Somehow I had made an impression on these people. It is very important that we understand the pressures on farmers Another aspect of the trial is building farm businesses, with grants of up to $60,000 to help farm businesses prepare for the impacts of drought, reduced water availability and a changing climate, and on-farm land care activities. The previous government assisted small businesses who rely on the off-farm income that comes into their business and their communities and also those businesses that assist farmers by supplying them with the equipment and goods that help keep them going. When the farmers are going bad these businesses are going bad and go out of business. It impacts on the economy of the small rural towns in particular, and you see the unemployment rate go up. So once again there is recognition by a government of this great country, regardless of its political persuasion, of the need to support businesses that work with farmers. Then there is farm planning, with support for farmers to undertake training to develop or update a strategic plan for their farm business with a focus on preparing for future challenges. We did a report centred on the skills that are lacking in rural and regional Australia. There are multiskilled people out there in the isolated areas, and they need assistance. There are the wives who keep the businesses going and they need computer training and those sorts of things. Once again, that support is a very good initiative. Under the heading of stronger rural communities, there will be grants to local government for activities that make rural communities more resilient during agricultural downturns. The only point I make there is that, if we put government assistance into those areas, we must make sure that we have the i's dotted and the t's crossed so there is no waste and that valuable resource is used constructively and has positive outcomes for people affected by drought. There will also be farm exit support. That commenced under the previous government, and there will be grants of up to $170,000 to support farmers who make the difficult decision to sell their farm businesses. That is wonderful stuff, because it does help them. It helps them particularly when, because of drought and the drop in value of their properties, they live on the fringe of absolute destitution. This sort package is the difference between them going off their properties broke and going off their properties with at least enough money to start a new life. I compliment the minister for recognising that and keeping the momentum going in that area. The beyond farming proposal is a new measure that puts current farmers in touch with former farmers to work through the opportunities outside of farming. Again, this is wonderful stuff. You have to have that peer group understanding; you have to have people who know what farming is physically all about and how drought affects people working with them. Ex-farmers and retired farmers are terrific people who go back to the land to help. Some of them go back to the land because they just love it so much, and in some instances their children have taken up the farm for a living and need some assistance. It is interesting to note that not too many young people are taking up farm occupations, and they are not taking them up in part because of the stigma placed on farming by some sections of the educational world. More importantly, they are not taking them up because they cannot see the sense in this day and age of working from dawn till dusk for $20,000 or $30,000 a year when they can go as young people out into the IT sector or into major urban businesses and make four, five or six times that amount. The farmers are in a situation where they work the land they love and do not in many instances get any credit for the significant contribution they make to the environment. The environment is their living-the land they toil on has to be there on a day-today, year-to-year basis for them to have any hope of making a living out of it. They love their land, and it is very, very difficult for them to walk away from it. I cannot express to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, how pleased I am that a bill of this of sort is going through. As I said at the outset, it is wonderful that we have a minister of the Crown in the agricultural field who does not have an agricultural background and does not come from the country but who, to his credit, is going out there and talking to people and introducing legislation which in my view is going to produce some very positive outcomes for farmers. I close by saying that, whilst some might accuse me of being overgenerous to a minister for agriculture who is on the other side of politics, I do not resile from what I have said. I think he is doing a wonderful job. He is a very caring minister, and I often talk to him about problems associated with farmers in my electorate and elsewhere. I must be doing something right, because I note that the National Farmers Federation, the Western Australian government, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia and other organisations are in favour of the direction the minister is taking on this. I complement him on it, and I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to speak on this bill here tonight.",160
205,Ms LIVERMORE,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I take the opportunity, following the comments of the member for Hume, to also add my support for the work of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It might not be looked on very favourably if I did not do that, so I am with the member for Hume in his praise for the work of the minister for agriculture. I also join with the memnounced ber for Hume and my other rural and regional colleagues to support the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. I think that all speakers in the debate have acknowledged that we are on the threshold of a new era in drought port. It is a change that reflects that Australian farmers face: a hotter and drier future, which means that the existing concept of exceptional circumstances as a measure of support for farmers will increasingly lose its relevance. Our new system is built on the projections from our scientific organisations, such as CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, which tell us that droughts are likely to pen more often and be more severe. It is also built on the renowned resilience and adaptability of our farmers. We want funding and support to be there to help farmers use that resilience and adaptability to prepare their farm businesses for droughts and other climate based risks. Our new approach to drought policy strengthens the support system and moves it from crisis management to risk management. This bill ensures that farmers who are ticipating in the current pilot of the governfarm ment's drought scheme in Western Australia receive all the benefits for which they are eligible. It does that by amending the Farm Household Support Act 1992. As I said, the bill relates to the pilot project program that will run in Western Australia for the next 12 months. In a partnership between the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments announced by the minister for agriculture in May this year, a number of support programs will be trialled and evaluated in a region of Western Australia between Karratha and Esperance. About 6,000 farmers who are involved in these trials are expected to be eligible for assistance under the package. The aim of the pilot, which was anin May this year, is to trial drought reform measures that will better support farmers, their families and rural communities in preparing for future challenges rather than waiting until they are in crisis to offer assistance. This is about preparing for drought as sup- much as it is about responding to drought the reality when it occurs. There are seven measures in the new package to be trialled in Western Australia. The first measure, farm family support, provides income support to help farmers meet basic household expenses. The second measure, farm social support, provides stronger the social support networks to meet the mental health, counselling and other social needs of hapfarming families and communities. The third measure, building farm businesses, provides grants of up to $60,000 to farmers in two components: $40,000 to help fund businesses prepare for the impacts of drought, reduced water availability and the changing climate and a further $20,000 which can be accessed for on-farm natural resource management measures and landcare activities. The fourth measure, farm planning, provides up to $7,500 for farmers to undertake training to pardevelop or update a strategic plan for their business, with a focus on preparing for future challenges. The fifth measure, stronger rural communities, provides grants to local governments for activities that make rural communities more resilient during agricultural downturns. The sixth measure, farm exit support, provides grants of up to $170,000 to support farmers who make the difficult decision to sell their farm business. The money can be used for things such as retraining and relocation expenses. The final measure, beyond farming, was referred to specifically by the member for Hume. This is the new measure that puts current farmers in touch with former farmers to work through the opportunities outside of farming. It will allow farmers to talk to someone who has been in the same position as them about the options for themselves and their families if they are selling the farm business or retiring. Farming groups across the country have welcomed this much-needed reform. As the list of seven measures indicates, this reform includes financial grants for farmers experiencing hardship or trying to exit the industry. Along with the financial measures, this new drought policy has a much stronger focus on the mental health issues that can arise from the challenges of drought. The farm family support payment is part of the pilot being conducted in Western Australia. It provides eligible farming families who are facing hardship with income support based on Newstart rates to help them meet basic household needs. It also provides case management support to assist farmers to assess their financial situation and identify those on-farm or off-farm activities which may improve their financial position. The Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010 will ensure that farmers who receive the farm family support payment will be eligible for the same access to ancillary benefits as those farmers who receive exceptional circumstances relief payments. After so many years of drought gripping large areas of our country, most people would be familiar with exceptional circumstances relief payments. Those payments help farming families living in areas affected by exceptional circumstances to meet everyday living expenses. Of course we on this side are all very proud that that gram was originally introduced by the Labor government in 1992 under the then minister for agriculture, Simon Crean. With these new changes to drought relief, the government believes it is important that recipients of farm family support payments participating in the current Western Australia trial can access the full range of ancillary benefits in the same way that exceptional circumstances relief payment recipients can. The ancillary benefits include an automatically issued healthcare card. The trial also allows for concessions relaxing the income, assets and family actual means testing of student allowances paid to, or in respect of, the student children of recipients. Importantly this trial will support farmers to develop or update a strategic plan for their farm business. We want to support Western Australian farmers and their families through this pilot period and this bill ensures that they will be spared financial hardship while they consider the future of their farming business. My electorate of Capricornia covers a large section of Central Queensland and it is home to beef, horticulture, grain and sugar industries. Central Queensland experienced significant rainfall at the start of the year-it was almost back to a traditional wet season-but it has had little to no rain in more recent months. So while many areas of Central Queensland have experienced pasture growth as a result of the rainfall, there has not been enough rain to replenish water supplies to the extent that farmers can be confident of seeing livestock through to the next summer storm season. The large rainfall at the start of the year, however, did see drought declarations lifted from 15 shires in Queensland in April. Rockhampton, in my electorate, was amongst those on this list. Banana, which is just south of my electorate, is one in our repro- gion that does remain partly drought declared. Of course before an area's drought status was removed in this way, the local drought committees carefully considered whether an area had received enough rain for sufficient pasture growth and water for maintaining stocking. Revocation of drought status provides producers with access to restocking and freight subsidies for returning stock from agistment. I am pleased to say that currently only 1.4 per cent of Queensland is currently drought declared. This is 35 per cent drop from 2009, and this is great news for Queensland and an ideal time for the government to be trialling its new approach to drought relief. Of course the government has always made it clear that, whatever reforms to drought policy were proposed, those farmers who are currently receiving exceptional circumstances assistance would not be affected. Our drought reforms are about setting a path for the future, not inflicting any hardship anxiety on those currently recognised as being drought affected. Rockhampton has struggled with the negative effects of drought in the past. Although none of us can pretend to know the full devastation of drought unless we have lived through it as members of a farming family or rural community, in a city like Rockhampton and a region like Central Queensland, we all feel its effectsespecially through our local abattoirs in Rockhampton. The Lakes Creek and Swift meat works in Rockhampton have experienced shortages of cattle, and the management and staff know that the tough times of 2009 will continue this year as graziers recover from a very dry period last year, combined with the effects of flooding in parts of Queensland. However, as I was saying, currently pasture production across the region generally good, but it is lower than what normally occurs in a longer growing season as a result of the late summer rain and pasture not beginning to grow in some areas until January. Pasture quantity is good to very good, but the quality is deteriorating with the onset of cool weather, some frosting and no useful rainfall in these past few months. Cattle condition has held well during the autumn period, with breeders in good condia tion generally and fat dry stock being turned off, particularly earlier this month. Pastures in the Mackay district in the north of my electorate are now at their peak after the long and very wet summer up there. The Central Queensland sorghum harvest is about to start and to date reports indicate much of it is likely to produce above-average yields. The cotton crop west of Rockhampton and around Emerald has generally suffered from poor weather conditions with much of Januor ary and February being cloudy and then significant rainfall happening as the cotton balls opened and picking started. I list that snapshot of some of the industries in my electorate to demonstrate the unpredictable ups and downs that drought and general climatic conditions can bring across areas in Australia. It is no doubt the reason that the Productivity Commission, in its review of drought policy, found that most farmers are sufficiently self-reliant to manage climate variability; climate variability has long been a fact of life for farmers in Australia. That is why the emphasis has to be on preparing for the very real risk of drought and helping farmers with that preparation rather than waiting until the situation reaches crisis point. As members know, and the member for Hume told us some examples from his exis perience, there is always a positive story to come out of these hard times that rural Australians often face. In my electorate, as well as all over Australia, farmers are able to contact an organisation known as Aussie Helpers. For those who do not know, Aussie Helpers was started in 2002 to help families who are living with the hardship and poverty that farming can bring. John and Rhonda, for example, are volunteers based outside Rockhampton and cover all of Central Queensland west to the border. They are part of a network of around 40 helpers nationwide who freely give their time and expertise to enable Aussie Helpers to achieve its goal of tackling poverty in the bush. This program originated in Charleville, which is south-west of my electorate in Queensland, and many Queenslanders have benefited from their advice and support. The long years of drought in so much of our country have brought much devastation to farming businesses. National Farmers Federation figures show that rural debt has increased by 85 per cent since 200203 and the debt servicing ratio has followed a similar upward trend in that time. It will take many years for farmers to recover. In the meantime, we are confident that these measures that are being trialled in Western Australia are the right way to go for drought policy in this country. It represents the shift from drought relief to drought management and preparedness, as the National Farmers Federation described it at the time of the announcement of the WA pilot. We will no longer have the situation, as before, when in the good times government retreated and assistance for farmers dried up. The seasons would change and when things became dire for farmers the government would step back in and provide just enough support to keep people struggling on in their farming business during devastating drought, only to disappear again when the rains came and exceptional circumstances status was lifted. Now that we know that longer and more severe droughts will be part of the business of farming into the future, we want to work with farmers in a proactive and strategic way to support them as they work through all of the challenges and opportunities their farms face. We want them to do that thinking and planning and deciding and preparing before any drought takes hold, and when it does we want to support them financially and also emotionally through community networks and counselling where necessary. We will all be watching the Western Australian trial very carefully and we look forward to working with farmers and their organisations on incorporating any lessons that come out of the next 12 months. In the meantime I join with my rural and regional colleagues here in the House to support this bill, which extends important benefits to farmers receiving income support payments as part of this very significant trial of these new drought support measures.",163
206,Mr BALDWIN,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Paterson) (6.53 pm)Tonight I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, there is no doubt that over many years our farmers have gone through trials, tribulations and undue hardship-you would know that from your own electorate down in Tasmania. It is important that governments of any persuasion provide benefit to those who work the land. Without people who are working the land and providing the food basket for this nation, our nation suffers dearly. We must also remember that the large bulk of agricultural product produced in Australia is exported, so it helps our bottom line. It is important, though, that as we go through periods of drought-and we must remember that Australia is by and large a dry nation which we attempt to farm as a wet nationwe come to a realistic understanding that, indeed, we must start to adopt dry-farming principles broadly and largely across Australia. That being said, it is critically important that the government provide supports in those times of undue hardship, and it is important that that support is bipartisan. The coalition holds the majority of rural seats throughout Australia. My own electorate is a rural and regional electorate. I have farmlands from the floodplains through the Port Stephens, Raymond Terrace and Maitland areas, the home of the famous 1955 flood. I have seen that region under water, on the long weekend in June 2007, when the Pasha Bulker was grounded, but I have also seen that region tinder dry, when there has been no water and they have had to pump water out of the rivers just to keep the feedstock up where they could. There are areas through the electorate of Paterson where, indeed, it is impossible to bring water to the farms; then people have to rely on the importation of feed. Most of the time, farming is very marginal in areas like that, but, when you have the added cost of pumping water or bringing feed to keep your cattle sustainable, it is critically important that the government in those financially difficult times provides that support. One of the key aspects of farming, in particular when times are tight-when they are dry-is the increase in the number of mental health problems throughout our rural farming communities and, sadly, the increase in the number of suicides because of the difficult financial pressures that are placed upon our farmers. Quite often these suicides are not recorded as such; they tend to be motor vehicle accidents or farming accidents; but nonetheless it is something where we as members of parliament and governments of either persuasion need to ensure we put into effect systems that provide support. Exceptional circumstances relief is critical. I know from my own area that one of the difficult things is the fact that the locations the gauges measuring the amount of rainfall do not necessarily reflect the amount of rain that is coming across an area. I will give the classic example of that. A catchment area that covers a large part of the GloucesterStroud area also includes some of the more coastal fringes down through towards the Great Lakes region. Whilst we might get coastal rain, some of those areas that are a little higher up, through Gloucester, Stroud, Allworth and Booral, quite often suffer because they are excluded from exceptional circumstances but do not have the rain. They do not have access to water, so their only recourse is expensive stock feed to keep their cattle alive. As you would know in your own area, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, some would say it would be simpler just to remove the stock from the land and not incur that cost, but in particular in areas like mine, where you have a large number of breeders, it is very hard to replenish that stock either at an affordable price or at a rapid rate. The issue with that is that it has a downstream effect on local employment and local investment. The money does not flow through our communities and, therefore, it starts a vicious cycle downwards. I know that this bill does not particularly relate directly to the zonings of exceptional circumstances, but time and time again members of parliament of all political persuasions put the arguments to the bureaucracy to redefine the areas within which rainfall is measured to determine whether an area is in long-term drought and what level of exceptional circumstances relief should be provided to those farmers. It can be said that there is nothing better than to grow up in a regional and rural area. I was one of those young people who grew up in the city of Sydney but took the first opportunity to move into a regional and rural area. That is something I have been very thankful of for. I have learned a lot from our farming communities. I have learned one end of a cow from the other and I have learned so much about the lifestyle and the environment, but after around 28 years in and around regional and rural Australia. I am not quite a local yet. I still suffer from hay fever from grass seeds, so I tolerate it. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am aware the hour is now coming to seven o'clock and it is time for the valedictory speech of my good friend Pat Farmer. With that I will hope to continue my remarks at a later hour. I wish Pat Farmer well in his future endeavours.",167
207,Mr FARMER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"In the year 2000, not long after I finished my run around Australia for the Centenary of Federation, a run that took me 191 days, 14,964 kilometres, I received a phone call from John Howard, the then Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Howard asked me whether I would consider a political career. He said, ‘Pat, if you would be prepared to run for the Liberal Party at the next federal election, I will give you my support and the support of cabinet ministers to get great things done for your electorate.' One thing about Mr Howard was that he knew how to press all the right buttons. He knew how I felt about the people in my electorate and he knew how I felt about actually getting things done. You see, I have this simple philosophy in my life. This philosophy is that opportunities come along-you either take those opportunities or you live on regrets. I have to say that I have absolutely no regrets about anything I have ever done with my life. That was in 2001, and I have since been here doing just that: serving the people of Macarthur. During my first campaign I remember one journalist saying to me: ‘Pat, you're an Irish Catholic. You grew up in the western suburbs of Sydney. You're a motor mechanic by trade, not a lawyer.' Sorry about that, John. ‘You seem like a typical Labor voter.' I said, ‘Yeah, I am. But, you know what, I am also an athlete, and as an athlete I believe that if I train harder than anybody else I deserve to win.' And, do you know what, the rewards of hard work are what the Liberal Party stand for. That is what we are all about. It is about reward for effort. Just Menzies said, we are lifters, not leaders. We support people who are prepared to get off their backsides and make a difference with their lives. It is important to note that hard work and reward for effort can make a real difference to the economic position of this country. It is not just those people who get off their backsides and do something with their lives, but it is most important that we do that when we can so that we can help those people who are less fortunate than ourselves who simply do not have the means or the ability to be able to do that. This is why we need a good economic management policy, so that we can have money and prosperity to help those Australians that cannot help themselves. We need prosperity to be able to help Australia meet its millennium goal of 0.07 per cent of gross national income so that we can support the poverty stricken people of this world. I believe that Australians are hard workers and what they need more than anything from government is for government to get out of the way-for them to get out of the way and for them to allow businesses to get on with the job of what they do best, without burdening them with bureaucratic bundles of forms and documents. What people need most is government support, not red tape. I wish to thank all the people that work in this building in all areas that have supported me. I would like to thank the landscapers, the florists, the gym staff, the Comcar drivers, the security staff and everybody else in between. I would especially like to thank my electoral staff, who have worked tirelessly supporting me to help the people of Macarthur. I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of this House. I want each and everyone of you to know that I admire you and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to work side by side with you. At this as stage I would like to thank the Prime Minister and the ministers for making the time available on the occasions when I needed to speak with them about issues in my electorate. I will dearly miss two of my running partners in this place. Of course I will miss everybody but especially my friend Greg Hunt and of course my favourite running partner Tony Abbott. He is the only one who came close to me running up and down Red Hill.",169
208,Mr HUNT,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Oh, outrage!",170
209,Mr FARMER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Sorry, Greg. I acknowledge the negative publicity that I received moving house from Campbelltown to Mosman. This occurred in January, and it was obviously a slow month for the media. The media believed that in order to represent an area you must sleep in that area. Well, they may well be right. This may seem a little strange to everybody here in this House, but I would like to thank the local preselection panel. I would like to thank them for putting the people of Macarthur's needs first and for making sure that the preselected candidate for the next election lived in the area that they represented. I also believe that this is very important, but from time to time there are moments in my life when I have to represent my family first and foremost, and I make no excuses for putting my family first. I want to make it known to everybody in Macarthur that I wholeheartedly support and acknowledge Russell Matheson, the past Mayor of Campbelltown and Campbelltown councillor, as the best person to represent people of Macarthur at this point in time. I want it known that they should feel very lucky to have somebody who is prepared to put up their hand and work tirelessly for that community, just as I have done. Many years ago, when Brooke and Dillon were just little babies, the people of Macarthur banded together to support me through one of the toughest crises in my life, the loss of my wife, Lisa. For this reason, their lives a bond between myself and the people of Macarthur that I cannot expect anybody else to understand. That is why, no matter where I travel on this planet or no matter what I do with my life, I will never forget those people that were there for me when I needed them most. I am the sum of all of you and the influences that you have had on my life. I made a simple promise to the people of Macarthur that I would bring Canberra to Macarthur and Macarthur to Canberra. The people of Camden, Picton and Campbelltown have had full access to all the ministers and the departmental staff through me, and there have never been so many visits by ministers and prime ministers to Macarthur prior to my election. I have delivered on that promise. I have also delivered close to half a billion dollars worth of infrastructure and services to the people of Macarthur and the surrounding regions. During my political career, I particularly enjoyed my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, with special responsibilities for high schools, primary schools and transitionto-work programs. I loved working with the teachers and the kids and getting into the schools to motivate the kids. I love this job very, very much and I will never forget this part of my life. Also, I loved delivering the $1.2 billion Investing in Our Schools Program. This program worked directly with the schools to deliver what they needed most. Whether it was outdoor learning centres, computers, libraries or classrooms, the program delivered what the schools needed and wanted from the government. I have spoken on this subject many times in the past but I once again want to draw to the attention of this House, in this my valedictory speech, the need to dispose of Badgerys Creek as an airport site and instead create a business park. My vision for Western Sydney is for the 1,700 hectares of land to become an economic centre, which would allow the peak-hour flow of traffic to be reversed. I believe that 1,000 hectares should be used for job creation and for commercial and industrial land. Further, 350 hectares should be used for quality housing to alleviate the housing crisis in Sydney and another 350 hectares could be used to create the lungs and recreational areas for Penrith, Campbelltown and the whole of south-west Sydney-similar to what Central Park is to New York. The advantage of this vision is that it would finally put an end to the 30-year controversy that has embroiled Badgerys Creek. It will not cost money. In fact, if it were sold with a covenant for job creation, it would fetch around $500 million. This would improve the government's bottom line and help to pay off the massive debt that it has accumulated. The people of Western Sydney are spending four hours of their lives each and every single day just travelling to and from work. This is causing many problems with the family unit, including the need for extended childcare times and a reduction in the quality of family life. This can be fixed without any expense to the government. Badgerys Creek is an asset that, at the moment, only feeds and breeds rabbits. This asset has sat there for nearly 30 years and has prevented people in the surrounding areas from doing anything with their homes. It is bureaucracy at its worse. The federal government has said for years, after numerous inquiries, that it is not building a second airport at the Badgerys Creek site, yet the New South Wales state government has not rezoned the surrounding area. The only way to fix the massive congestion in our cities is to create jobs and reational facilities for people where they live. It is not just the big issues in Macarthur that are important to me; it is also the individuals who count. There are many people in the area who from time to time have needed my help in assisting them with immigration matters or getting their children into schools in the local area. There was one case in particular of a lady who came to my office. She had just two teeth in her mouth. She had missed a dental appointment earlier that year and consequently was put to the back of the queue. She had waited two years and still had another 12 months to go before she could get something done about her dental situation. She told me that she had not eaten anything solid for over two years. That afternoon I spoke to Sydney South West Area Health Service and arranged for this lady to be fitted with a set of dentures. One month later, this lady came into my office. She had a smile that started at one ear and finished at the other ear. She had tears rolling out of her eyes as she thanked me. I will never, ever forget the look on that lovely old lady's face. That is what this job is all about. I found housing for a lady who was living in a car in bushland in Kentlyn, in Campbelltown. She had been attacked several times. As well as her housing dilemma, she suffered from schizophrenia. After several phone calls, we managed to get her medical help and some accommodation. People who are suffering from mental illness need to be supported by the federal government. This is part of our everyday work, and because we want to make a difference to these people's lives, we get frustrated from time to time because we cannot help. That is when I am reminded of the words of my mother. My mother said to me-I should say, ‘My mom always said to me' in my best Forrest Gump accent-‘Rome was not built in a day but it was certainly started in one.' I think it is imrecportant that, when we feel disillusioned with this place, we remember those words and get started. We have to take the initial step needed to make a difference to people's lives. I want to acknowledge my family and the sacrifices that they have made to support me in this career-in particular, my daughter, Brooke, and my son, Dillon, who are sitting here in the chamber. I want it to be known to everybody that I am incredibly proud of you two. Last year, we spent our holidays in an orphanage in Chang Mai, in Thailand, helping children suffering from AIDS. My daughter, Brooke, read books to the children and helped to feed and clothe the babies, while my son, Dillon, and I repaired playground equipment, worked on buildings and built bikes. The love that they showed these beautiful little children and the absolute peration they felt about the situation they were in was something that any parent would be proud of. The year before, I travelled to India, Nepal, Egypt and Peru. I saw first hand the work that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies does. As I stood in the office of the Red Cross in Cairo with the Secretary-General, Professor Mamdouh Gabr, he took an urgent call. In that instance I saw his jaw drop and his eyes fill with anger as he was told that a school had been bombed in the Gaza Strip. It was a school that was being used by the Red Cross to provide aid to both sides of the front line. He recomposed himself and went about coming up with alternatives to get aid to those areas in the Gaza conflict. Later that night I asked him: ‘How can you possibly help these people who cause so much pain and destruction to others? In some cases, they cause this pain and destruction to people who are close to you.' He told me: ‘We are the Red CrossRed Crescent. We cannot do our job any other way.' The people of the Red Cross go into war zones to brief soldiers on the Geneva convention. They provide a safe haven for people who are destitute. They provide food and shelter in times of cyclones, bushfires, floods, mudslides and tsunamis. Two-thirds of the world's population do not have clean, sanitary conditions or fresh drinking water. I have seen first hand the different levels of poverty in this world. I have visited communities in Cairo where people live in rubbish tips and have to scavenge beside the rats to find something they can sell in order to buy water just to survive. In these same communities I have seen young children take needles from medical syringes. When they have accumulated two kilograms worth of these needles they are paid one Egyptian pound. I met with a lady whose job was to collect plastic. She burnt this plastic deswaste and used a stick to lift up the molten plastic and put it into a metal tub. When 10 kilograms of solidified plastic had been accumulated she would earn the equivalent of two Egyptian pounds. Her face was covered in soot and her nostrils and ears oozed black ash. One man told me that he can earn two Egyptian pounds for collecting rubbish from the city. If he earns less than that, he has to choose between feeding his donkey and feeding his children. Unfortunately, he is forced to choose the donkey, because it can earn him money the following day, and he and his children go without food that night. I have seen communities in the mountains of Nepal and Peru that are desperately poor, but they have water, and with water they can grow a little grain, feed chickens, boil up food and wash. They can stave off disease. They are poor, but they can survive because they have water. I have been influenced by these things and so much more in my life. That is why I feel an absolute need to build wells and to raise the money needed to provide clean, sanitary conditions for the women and children of these communities. I encourage all Australians and world citizens to do the same and support me in my next endeavour. On 27 November I will embark on the greatest journey that I could ever possibly imagine. I have set a goal to raise $100 million for this worthwhile endeavour. I will run from the South Pole to the edge of the ice in Argentina, then through South America, the United States of America and Canada, and then on to the North Pole before flying to the United Nations to present my findings-the places I have been, the people I have met and the things I have done along the way. I will run more than 21,000 kilometres through the extremes of every weather condition on this earth. I have met with every high commissioner and ambassador of the countries I will be running through, and I am proud to say that I have their support and that they strongly support work to improve the lives of the severely poor of this world. I will present to the United Nations at the end of my journey all that I have seen and all that I have done. will be asking the politicians to take a good, long look at themselves and to ask the question: if one man can do this, what can we all do if we work together as a nation? What can we do to help each and every nation meet the Millennium Development Goals to alleviate the poverty crisis in our own backyards as well as around the world? I ask each and every one of you here in this House: why is it that we can put a man on the moon and yet still two-thirds of the world's population do not have clean drinking water or clean, sanitary conditions? Throughout my run, using the latest communications technology, I will beam into the boardrooms, the classrooms and the living rooms of people worldwide everything that I see and everything that I do. Hopefully, that will encourage people to follow my journey and to support me. In finishing, if the people of this House remember nothing of the words that I have ever uttered in this place but they remember this last phrase, then my time here will have been worthwhile. So I say to each and every one of you that locked within each of us is the ability to achieve great things. I believe that the greatest force on this earth is our will. If we want to do something and we want to do it with all our heart, we can and we will find a way, but if we do not truly want to do it we will simply find an excuse. To all of you here in this House: please find a way to help all of humanity, and please, please, please, no excuses.",170
210,Mr GRAY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (7.22 pm)-I rise this evening to speak in support of the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced a trial of drought policy reform measures in Perth on 5 May with the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture and Food, Terry Redman MLA. The trial I represents a new chapter in a long history of Australian governments grappling with the challenge to farming by a harsh climate. On 6 May in an Australian Financial Review article, National Farmers Federation President David Crombie is quoted as saying that the pilot is a ‘sensible, practical and forwardlooking approach that takes account of climate risks and proactively manages them'. In Western Australia this bill has widespread support. The Western Australian Farmers Federation President, Mike Norton, in a press release on the same day, welcomed the trial and noted, ‘It represents a good opportunity for WA's farmers.' WA's Liberal Mental Health Minister, Dr Graham Jacobs, stated: ‘Difficult times on the farm can be very traumatic, even soul destroying. This bill offers more support to meet the mental health social needs of the farming community.' Tony Crook, the Nationals' candidate for O'Connor, stated, ‘I am very proud that Western Australia is at the forefront of a program that could revolutionise the way Australia tackles drought in the future.' And the WA minister for agriculture, Terry Redman, stated, ‘We need to move to a mindset of being proactive rather than reactive when it comes to tough times in agriculture.' Western Australia will remain the world leader in agricultural production and continue to grow productive farming industries despite the challenges of climate. As a Western Australian. I am aware of the significance of this bill to the farmers who take the risk to put a crop in. It is a bill that will port farming communities and farming families. In this place we hear a lot about working families. This bill is about farming families. WA has a strong history of agricultural achievement in challenging conditions. Colonists arrived in WA in 1829 and planted wheat they had brought from England. European farmers recorded their first wheat harvests in WA in 1831. Of course, the wheat had been developed in English conditions and frequently failed to provide reliable and substantial crops. The failure of these first crops was inevitable. In isolated areas such as the Victoria District, at Champion Bay near Geraldton, it was even known that ‘starvation deaths' followed crop failure-I quote from Sister Mary Albertus Bain. By the end of 1873 it could correctly be claimed that there had been only one good season since 1867. The most promising harvest since that date had that year been attacked again by red dust and almost the entire crop in the district was a failure. Malnutrition, worry and heat gradually took its toll on the district. The greatest number of deaths from 1870 to 1894 was amongst the children, and the most common cause was marasmusinability to thrive due to a protein deficiency. Such was the skill of successive generations of farmers in the WA grain belt that from failed crops and starvation has grown a sophisticated, science based, machine driven, satellite guided export industry. The first mechanical harvesting was done with a reaper. Heaps were forked into a thresher and then bagged by hand and shovel. But from the 1920s to the 1960s there was significant improvement in Western Australian grain yields through the use of superphosphate fertiliser and identification and amelioration of deficiencies of trace elements such as zinc, copper and manganese. The benefits were drasupmatic on the sandy soils that dominate the WA grain belt. The WA grain belt contains some of the driest consistently farmed land in the world. Soils are generally ancient, shallow and naturally infertile. Taken together, these factors create a challenging farming environment, amongst the most difficult in the world. WA agriculture prides itself on being science based. There can be no better example of science based agriculture anywhere else in the world. Combined with improved farm practices and the advent of wheat varieties better adapted to the Western Australia environment, yields have trended upwards. The 1970s saw the beginning of minimum tillage-that is, seeding into uncultivated land, especially when it had carried a crop in the previous year. From the year 2000, WA has had a run of erratic seasons, with widespread drought and some severe localised frosts in spring downgrading grain quality. The 200304 grain harvest, however, heralded a recordbreaking 14.7 million tonnes of grain. WA is Australia's export state. We export minerals, ore, hydrocarbons-and grain. The WA wheat belt not only supports WA's food needs but also creates an exportable surplus representing 90 per cent of our total grain production. WA produces the bulk of Australia's export grain, and an annual crop of 10 million tonnes is usual. Today, Western Australia's grain is exported to over 20 countries, with major shipments to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam and China. In Western Australia as we speak, many farmers have completed seeding in often very dry conditions. Growing season rainfall is commonly less than 200 millimetres per annum-eight inches in the old scale-in the important period of May to September. So far the 2010 season has had a slow start. Rain has been patchy; however, a good 15 millimetres last week has provided some relief. In years of severe drought farmers turn to the Commonwealth and state governments for support. Commonwealth assistance evolved in a haphazard way, with states taking the lead on drought policy. In the early 1970s drought was recognised under a joint Commonwealth-state natural disaster relief arrangement. Within two decades that approach was abandoned in favour of standalone drought policy separate to natural disaster relief. In 1992 a formal national drought policy to encourage self-reliance for primary producers and protect the nation's farming sector from an unprecedented climate impact was determined. In 1984 the then agriculture minister, Simon Crean, introduced drought income support payments and interest rate subsidies for farmers within areas defined as facing exceptional circumstances or EC. Exceptional circumstances relief has evolved significantly as successive governments have tried to find the best way to help build more resilient farming communities. Exceptional circumstances support is available for farmers affected by drought events that must not have occurred more than once, on average, every 20 to 25 years. But, with current rainfall uncertainty, few the next drought will be a one in 20to 25year event. Some farmers have reached the interest rate subsidy limit of $500,000. Farmers in the most debt receive the most assistance and we fail to recognise good farmers who have made tough business decisions to stay out of debt. Assistance is based on arbitrary lines on a map, meaning that one farmer may be eligible while their neighbour is not. We are getting it wrong. We get it wrong in agriculture when we fail to take hard, pro-business decisions. So I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution that Dr Henry Schapper made to the great agriculture industry of Western Australia through agricultural economics, public policy, farm management and strong business practices in farming. Dr Schapper was an articulate and determined man who recently lost his battle with illness, on 27 April this year. He fought his battle in the same way that he lived. Debate interrupted. NA",173

212,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"La Trobe) (7.30 pm)Denzel Washington earned an Oscar for his portrayal of corrupt LAPD Detective Alonzo Harris in the film Training Day. For those unfamiliar with the plot, it centres on his attempts to trap rookie detective Jake Hoyt, played by Ethan Hawke, into joining his team of corrupt cops-for whom murder and drug trafficking are day-today business. One of the film's most compelling scenes is Jake's introduction to Palmwood Drive in Los Angeles, known to police affectionately as ‘The Jungle'. Once regarded as America's most dangerous street, it is home to the notobelieve rious gang the Black P Stones. Palmwood Drive is no longer regarded as America's most dangerous street. The fight to win back control of The Jungle was not won by chance but was achieved through the leadership of Sheriff Lee Baca of the Los Angeles County Police Department, who established the CalGang database, which has proven so effective that it is now used by all law enforcement authorities across America. CalGang, short for ‘California Gangs', connects vital information for law enforcement authorities, such as gang membership and identification details, and also alerts police when people have been issued with antiassociation orders. These orders give police the authority to ban people from associating with gang member, something that the Victorian state Labor government will not introduce. Instead, they instruct the Victorian Police to welcome outlaw motorcycle gangs into Victoria by stopping traffic for their kie runs. What a disgrace. Using information from the CalGang database, the FBI teamed up with the LAPD Gang Enforcement Detail to undertake Operation Cold Stone. The team conducted a 14-month investigation resulting in 30 Black P Stone gang members being jailed. The success of the operation was due to the cooperation between the FBI and the LAPD. It was a fantastic operation. The combination of legislative powers, resources and shared experience enabled them to win back the streets. At a federal level, the Howard government established the Australian Crime Commission, the ACC, in 2002. Through the ACC, state and federal police work together to investigate serious and organised crime, similar to the model which has worked so effectively in the United States. However, since coming to power, Labor has cut the funding to the ACC, reducing staff by 22 per cent. The Prime Minister has also stopped paying the bills for the majority of seconded investigators from the states, territories and AFP. Working together, they would have been the weapon of choice against violent gangs in Australia. This is a disgrace and slap in the face for law enforcement and the public they protect. The Howard government also established the national law enforcement database, CrimTrac, in 2002, which is used to share information amongst all the state and territory police forces. CrimTrac is the ideal database to store information on any violent gangs, including OMCGs, racially motivated gangs targeting international students and prison gangs, to name a few. The murder of underworld figure Carl Williams gives us some insight into the violent nature of prison gangs. Prisons are the breeding ground for gang activity. In the hostile prison environment many inmates join gangs for protection. biPrison gangs are the major recruiters for extremists, such as the terrorist shoe bomber Richard Reid, who converted to Islamic extremism during his incarceration at Blundeston Prison in 1996. If we hope to win back our streets it is time to get tough on gangs. It is time for the Prime Minister to take up the challenge. He was all talk after the fatal attack at Sydney airport in which two outlaw motorcycle gangs fought each other and one OMCG member was killed. When in Washington, Mr Rudd said that he would take firm action. He has not taken action at all. Mr Rudd has let down the people of Australia. He will not take the violent gangs on. He would rather have the violent gangs cause fear and intimidate the public. Economy",175
213,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT,"During this term of government, we have seen the worse economic crisis in 75 years. We saw financial systems, banks and the world economic system at risk of epic failure. That had terrible consequences for jobs in places like the United Kingdom and the United States of America. We saw terrible pain among the working-class and middle-class communities in those countries. And we see ongoing pain today in the British budget brought down by the new Conservative government. It lifts consumption taxes to 20 per cent. We can see some indication of how conservatives handle both recessions and recoveries from recessions: they tax the poor to give company tax cuts to corporate citizens. Our government is different. Our government believes in restoring the budget to surplus three years early. We are going to have peak debt. We are going to restore the public finances in a responsible way after avoiding recession and saving 200,000 Australian jobs. Most importantly, we have a plan to add to national private savings. The resources super profits tax builds infrastructure in mining communities and mining states like Western Australia, Queensland and my own state of South Australia. It lowers company taxes for small business and for businesses overall. Most importantly, it lifts national savings through lifting superannuation. Increased superannuation for individual workers can have a very big effect. It is jected that a 30-year-old full-time worker will have around $108,000 extra in their superannuation under these changes. That makes a very big difference to those working Australians who so desperately want a dignified retirement. Most importantly, in aggregate this will add around $500 billion to the existing pool of superannuation savings, increasing our national savings by 0.4 per cent of GDP by 2035. That is an incredibly important thing to do. Over the long term, our great weakness has been a lack of national savings; our great weakness has been the current account deficit. By increasing superannuation and increasing the savings pool in this country, we will lower our reliance on overseas savings and put Australia on a path of economic independence. That is part of the great economic reform undertaken by this government: a responsible restoration of the public finances after a period of international recession and a responsible increase in the private savings of individuals to help national savings. We have to contrast this with what the opposition would give us-what the Leader of the Opposition would have delivered had he been in government. What he would have delivered is recession, New Zealand style: five quarters of negative economic growth, with all consequences for working families that go along with it-hundreds of thousands of people out of work, in working-class communities like Elizabeth, which I represent, and in growing regional towns like Gawler. We would have seen misery and dole queues-that is what we would have seen. Instead, we have seen the government's responsible economic management avoid the terrible price that is currently being paid by so many other countries. Look what the opposition have delivered most recently through their control of the Senate. We see them in an unholy alliance pro- with the Greens, in the other place. They have prevented action on climate change and they seek to prevent action in so many other areas. They have killed progress dead. They have frustrated and rejected the mandate of the Australian people in the 2007 election. They are the party of just saying no, of just not doing it. They are against progress in all its forms. We know that they are against the broadband network. I was out door-knocking in Craigmore and Hillbank over the weekend. These are people who are stuck on dialup after a decade of policy failure by the Howard government-people who want broadband. Just this week, Senator Alan Ferguson put out a Tony Abbott pamphlet in my electorate which claimed that they would stop the broadband network. I do not think that is going to win any votes in Craigmore and I do not think that is going to win any votes nationally. That is the motto of the opposition: ‘Just don't do it.' A vote for the Leader of the Opposition would equal recession, would equal another decade of delay on climate change-because he thinks it is not real-and would equal another decade of delay on broadband. People in Craigmore and Hillbank would be left on dial-up under an Abbott government. Mr Gilad Shalit  heavy heart that I rise this evening to inform the House that this Friday is the fourth anniversary of the capture of Israeli soldier Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit by Palestinian militants. On 25 June 2006, Gilad was captured in a cross-border raid in the Kerem Shalom crossing-ironically translated as the vineyard of peace-between Israel and the Gaza Strip and has since been in the captivity of Hamas, the party that took control of the Palestinian National Authority. Repeated requests from the international community for his release have, unfortunately, fallen on deaf ears. Hamas has repeatedly refused requests from the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent to allow the ICRC to visit Shalit. The situation has, unfortunately, turned Gilad into a bargaining tool for Hamas. The day after his capture, Hamas requested the Israeli government release all female Palestinian prisoners and all Palestinian prisoners under the age of 18, in exchange for information about Gilad Shalit-just information. Hamas further requested an additional 1,000 Palestinian prisoners within a 24-hour ultimatum, but Israel refused on the basis that ‘there be no negotiations to release prisoners'. Since then, there has been a large number of diplomatic efforts pursued in order to secure Gilad Shalit's release, but these have all resulted in the negative. Gilad Shalit's parents constantly live without knowledge about whether their son is alive or dead and they are taunted by Hamas with videos and handwritten memos, which are received in exchange for prisoners. This fear is encompassed by nearly every Israeli citizen, as they realise that it could be their soncompulsorily conscripted into the army-in Gaza. Israelis struggle to conceptualise how they would react in these circumstances and are placed with a dilemma, because when you give into your captor's demands, and you have Gilad Shalit returned at any price, you are giving into people who might have killed other members of your family. What is remarkable about this situation is the empathy shown by Israelis in their determination to receive one captured soldierto relieve a parent's nightmare-for what we have seen to be an exchange for thousands of lives. However, may I query the House as to how many terrorists, militants, must be exchanged for one soldier-why thousands of prisoners for one? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains in contact with Gilad Shalit's parents and last week claimed that no efforts were being spared to bring him home. But Gilad Shalit's parents, Noam and Aviva, claim that not enough is being done and will not be giving up any time soon. They are planning to march through Israel and not to return without their son. I am drawn to this distinctiveness of determination that the Israeli people constantly show. I call on Hamas to immediately release Gilad Shalit. This has been an obstacle to peace for long enough. I do not need to remind the House of my strong commitment will over 17 years to a two-state solution, and I have been a supporter of the ongoing peace negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I know that almost every member of this House would share that viewboth Labor and Liberal, National and even Independent-and some members on both the Labor side and Liberal side feel these issues in a very passionate and bipartisan way. The coalition maintains its position and is committed to a just and peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am sure I speak for all honourable members today in hoping that a peaceful solution is acquired in the foreseeable future, because every life is lost is deplorable. I am sure all members of the House would join with me in calling for the release of Gilad Shalit. Health",176
214,Mr SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Longman) (7.44 pm)Tonight, I want to talk about the government's GP superclinic program, and my desire to see one of these established at Caboolture in my electorate of Longman. Firstly, I want to express my disappointment at comments made in one of the local newspapers by my Liberal-National Party opponent for the next election. I had high hopes that the LNP choice of candidate would be a person who would not simply recite party lines parrot fashion, but unfortunately that has not been the case. In particular, he has trotted out the tired old lines being used by the Abbott led coalition to misrepresent the facts about the government's GP superclinic program. I will give some basic facts for the benefit of coalition members and candidates, wherever they may be. The 2007 election commitment for GP superclinics was followed through, with funding for the first 31 GP superclinics, later increased to 36-a $223.2 million program over five years from the 2007-08 financial year through to the 201112 financial year. Two years into that program three GP superclinics are fully operational and open, and another eight are providing early services. Four more GP superclinics will open shortly, with construction actually underway at 18 new sites. That is 21 GP superclinics that can be expected to be fully operational by the end of this financial year-21 out of the 36 being funded in this five-year commitment. Contracts have been signed for the remaining 15 GP superclinics. All 36 GP superclinics involve general practices, with general practice networks or divisions being active partners in 13 of them. that All 36 GP superclinics will play an active part in teaching the next generation of health professionals, and 33 of them already have university involvement. There is no doubt that all 36 pioneer GP superclinics will be delivered well within the time-frame of the program. It is a nonsense to say that this model has been ‘fundamentally rejected by local practitioners'-a suggestion that I reject out of hand. During the 2007 election campaign there was no commitment for a GP superclinic in Longman. The government's health commitment to Longman was for $7 million for a 12-chair dialysis unit at North Lakes. That has been operational for about six months, providing an excellent service to northside renal patients. We did commit to building two GP superclinics in our region: in Strathpine in the electorate of Dickson and Redcliffe in the electorate of Petrie. The Strathpine GP superclinic is fully operational and provides a wide range of services beyond those available at traditional doctors' surgeries. The GP superclinic at Redcliffe, to be located at the hospital, is one of those currently under construction. In the 2010 budget the government committed a further $355 million to this program. This money is to be used to enhance the existing program in three ways. First, it will provide for around 23 new GP superclinics. Second, nine of those 23 will be enhanced and able to provide day-surgery procedures. Third, around 425 existing GP practices will be able to access funding to upgrade those practices to provide additional services to their communities. This additional funding provides an opportunity for us to improve primary healthcare services in our area. I have already spoken to health minister Roxon regarding the siting of one of those nine enhanced GP superclinics at Caboolture to ease pressure on the Caboolture Hospital. I have also spoken to a number of potential partners to gauge their interest in being involved in such a ject, and I am delighted to say that I have been greeted with unbridled enthusiasm. Obviously, there is some way to go before a bid can be submitted to the government but I am confident that we will have the right partners and that they will deliver a competitive tender document when the time arrives. This will be important because, while the minister is well aware of the case for additional health services in Longman and the fast-growing areas of the Moreton Bay region and has always been sympathetic when I have approached her regarding our needs, these are competitive quotes. I am keen to encourage existing doctors' surgeries to consider applying for the funding being made available under this program-up to half a million dollars-to enable them to upgrade those practices to provide additional services or to provide improvements to their current services. During the parliament's winter recess I plan to speak to as many GPs as possible on this opportunity. I am also keen to encourage them to apply for funding from the General Practice After Hours Program-a $76.3 million fouryear program established in the 2008 budget. This program targets areas of community need for after-hours GP services and assists with the establishment of new after-hours services or the maintenance or extension of existing after-hours services. Successful applicants in this program can receive up to $100,000 exclusive of GST over at two-year period, and the funding can be used to assist with the operating costs or recurrent expenses of after-hours services. Much has been made of the need for afterhours GP services on Bribie Island and Caboolture in the northern parts of Longman. Through these two programs the opportunities do exist for existing GP practices to expand into those after-hours services. This is pronot something that needs to be developed as a stand-alone facility. Indeed, nearly one in every five GP superclinic services provided to date has been an after-hours service. An election looms, and the people of Longman need to be wary-wary that the Abbott-led coalition has announced that it will cut this GP superclinic funding, denying us the opportunity to enhance local medical services; wary, too, of promises made by the local coalition candidate that- (Time expired) Paterson Electorate: Williamtown",179
215,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on behalf of residents living around Williamtown RAAF Base and Salt Ash Air Weapons Range. Under the new Australian Noise Exposure Forecast Maps 2025, many people who have never experienced noise issues from our RAAF base are now being classified as highly noise affected. This is a result of the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter. As shadow minister for defence science and personnel, I have a passion for our Defence Force and the role its members play in protecting our country. I believe it is extremely important that they are provided with the best possible resources. However, I want to make it abundantly clear that I understand the situation many of those in the Paterson electorate now face, and it is unfair. Defence has changed the goal posts and inexact modelling contained within the noise maps means the goal posts could change yet again. Residents are justified in speaking about the possible impacts of these maps on their homes. Impacts include the cost of noise attenuation if their house were to be damaged, inability to rebuild if their house were destroyed, possible property value loss and changes to quality of life, through no fault of their own. That is why I welcome any chance to represent those who are concerned about this problem and would say to anyone affected, ‘I am here; I am listening. Your concerns are important.' I am thrilled that Oyster Cove has now been excluded from the 2025 forecast. The people at Oyster Cove could have faced huge decreases in property values and quality of life and an inability to construct their dwellings. I met with these residents the first time they came together as a collective and I spoke on their behalf at the Williamtown Consultative Forum. I also represented each and every person who approached me on this matter. I am pleased that they now have some security in the future of their properties. This is what all residents in the Paterson electorate deserve. Unfortunately, those in areas such as Medowie, Raymond Terrace, Nelsons Plains, Brandy Hill, Riverview Ridge and Lakeside do not have such security. That is why Port Stephens Council, the state government and Defence need to work together closely on a long-term plan for our area. I believe Defence has a responsibility to give local people security as soon as possible-security in knowing that their homes are going to be safe, comfortable and able to be lived in. I see this as an opportunity for the defence minister to improve his relationship with the local community. He has a real chance to get out and talk to people, to find a fair compromise. Through consultation, Defence can negotiate a solid agreement for the long term. There are a number of long-term planning options which should be discussed and explored, and I would happily work with the defence minister on viable options. I would also urge the minister to consider the purchase of rural and severely noise affected properties. If you want to travel along a highway, first you need to acquire the land. That is what our coalition government did in Slades Road, Moxey Close and Steel Street at Williamtown airport. Port Stephens Council also has a role to play in mitigating noise impacts. Unfortunately, some councillors have been extremely irresponsible, and I urge them to look towards the long term, not the short term. In particular, I would like to mention the Kings Hill development. I have raised concerns about this development with the council, the state government and Defence for some time now. While I am mindful of the need for affordable housing in the Paterson electorate, this must occur sensibly. Large parts of the proposed Kings Hill development, north of Raymond Terrace, are directly under the flight path. My fear is that in 10 years from now, if all of this development goes ahead, the owners of those residential blocks will be faced with the same problem some Port Stephens residents are facing now. I find it very difficult to believe the twofaced actions of some Port Stephens councillors who are currently campaigning for compensation from the federal government for noise-affected residents. They are the same councillors who have voted to push ahead with the development of Kings Hill. They have voted to put more homes and more families under the flight path. No doubt in the future they would also want the federal government to pay compensation for these affected residents, even though the federal government had no control whatsoever over the approval of Kings Hill. I should point out that the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Dr Mike Kelly, met with Port Stephens councillors earlier this month and ruled out any form of compensation or acquisition. I certainly hope councillors take these noise impacts on board when making rezoning approval decisions and do not cast their votes to score political points. The Williamtown RAAF base is important for our local community, the Defence Force and our country. It will be here for a long time and councils need to be proactive in preparing for it. I have said it many times but I will say it again: I would like to work with the council, Defence and the state government to find a common sense, win-win solution that my constituents are happy with. This issue should be fought not along party lines but for the good of everyone involved. I will continue to fight hard on this matter for the people I am elected to represent to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome for all people. It is not those in RAAF uniforms at Williamtown and Raymond Terrace but those bureaucrats in Defence who need to realign their attitudes. (Time expired) Television Sports Broadcasts",180
216,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about free-to-air television. We have seen, at long last, the deployment of multichannelling and an increase in free-to-air content. The ABC Kids channel is an example of the increase in choice available to Australian viewers. This is a very good thing, as we always knew it would be. The rise of multichannelling prompted dreams in some of us that free-toair television networks would be able to schedule broadcasts that are a little more specialised, a little more observant of both niche and very large markets for programming. I have spoken previously about the increased potential for free-to-air networks to broadcast a greater volume of the content of a particular sporting event. I have also spoken of the potential for a network to broadcast more Wimbledon, for instance, or games in the lead-up to the World Cup, as many of us would wish. But it seems we are in the same situation we have always been. Even with multichannelling, it appears that networks continue to have very popular events, sporting events, dictated to and compromised for viewers as if the network had no choice. A topical case in point: the Adelaide Advertiser's AdelaideNow website is running a story on how Channel 7 in Adelaide has refused to air this Friday night's AFL grand final rematch between Geelong and State Kilda live, preferring to delay the broadcast by an hour and a half. Irrespective of how important one thinks this particular game is-and I am not a Geelong or St Kilda supporter but I do love AFL and I love watching it live, as many thousands of people do in both my electorate and South Australia generally-I found it encouraging that a fair number of the comments posted on AdelaideNow regarding the story referred to multichannelling and the antisiphoning rules. I will read some of the posts. StevieB of Bomberland wrote: Not just this game, every game!! Wasn't this exactly why you brought on a new third channel? David posted today: Put Better Homes and Gardens on Channell 72. And Aaron of Adelaide made a good contribution: The anti-siphoning list prevents the AFL from being shown on the secondary channel (I.e. 7TWO, OneHD) before it is shown on the main channels (I.e. 7, 10). In the case of last night, both Wimbledon and cricket (all matches in Oz or the UK) have to be shown on the main channel first, hence neither could be bumped to the secondary channel. Hopefully when the review of the list comes out later this year, the secondary channels can show first run sports on them. It is a real pity that Channel 7 in Adelaide is not running the St Kilda-Geelong game live and I plead with them to reconsider and show it live for the sake of the sports fans in Adelaide. Whether we end up allowing a program to be aired live on a second or third channel before it is broadcast on the primary channel, I cannot say. I expect there will be less and less justification for the maintenance of such a rule over time. If live broadcasts were permitted on secondary channels now, with the existing practice of playing the delayed on the primary channel, would it be such a bad thing? Would anyone be disadvantaged? When it comes to these issues, I have a compulsion to revert to commenting on SBS. I had the pleasure of meeting with Joseph Skrzynski and Shaun Brown of SBS the other night-a pleasure for the insight they gave me into their current thinking and the development of their services to the Australian public. The SBS is a great success story, and again I go back to sport: SBS was the primary vehicle, I would suggest, for the development and increase in the popularity of football, which some call soccer, in Australia. People like the late Johnny Warren, people like Les Murray, having been given the possibility of promoting football through SBS, have assisted substantially in it becoming absolutely commonplace around Australia. Many years ago, soccer or football was an oddity, with its round ball, and the people who played it were, as Johnny Warren titled his book, Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters. We have come a long way from that title. The nation as a whole is captivated by ‘the beautiful game' and SBS should be recognised for the central role it has played in this coming about. As we are currently in the World Cup finals, we are blessed with wonderful coverage of every single game-every game. If it was another channel, we might get highlights of a few, I suspect. But SBS can again hold its head high and be congratulated for the terrific coverage of the World Cup that it is providing. SBS is an amazing institution and, as I have said, a terrific success story, but its future is still in the making. With the American free trade agreement and questions on the cost-competitiveness and viability of Australian content, with the availability of international channels that have been streaming directly into people's homes from all over the world-Italy, India, Greece-the very viability of free-to-air television is more questionable than it ever has been. And the viability of a public broadcaster, a network that still is to a large extent a public service for the benefit of our population, with decisions weighed by not just the prospect of profits but social utility, is increasingly under threat. We want good things of our free-to-air television. We want the great achievements of SBS to continue.",182
