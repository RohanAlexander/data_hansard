NA AMENDMENT.",13
21,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"West Sydney) [2.39]. - I move That the Contract Immigrants Act should be amended so as to prevent the employment of coloured or Asiatic labour upon or in connection with ships in Commonwealth ports during the lime of industrial disturbance. The Parliament has not hesitated to go as far as it has deemed desirable, necessary, and proper, in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it. by paragraph xxvii. of section 51 of the Constitution, in pursuance of which it has passed the Immigration Restriction Act, the Pacific Island Labourers Act, and the' Contract Immigrants Act. Under the Immigration Restriction Act, No. 17 of 1901, as amended by the Act of 1905, power is taken to exclude from the Commonwealth "" any person who fails to pass the dictation test."" There were exempted from the operation of those Acts the master and crew of any public vessel of any Government; and the master and crew of any other vessel landing during the stay of the vessel in any port of the Commonwealth, the intention being entirely confined to preventing' the landing of persons whom it is desired to exclude beyond the period of the_stay of a vessel in port. The Contract Immigrants Act of 1905 has an entirely different purpose. It provides that every person who is uncier contract to perform manual labour in the Commonwealth must compiv with certain conditions, and that the terms of his contract must be approved by the Minister. If it is made in contemplation of, or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute; if the remuneration ancl other terms and conditions of employment are not as advantageous to the contract .immigrant as are those current among workers of the same class here; or if the agreement is made before the contract immigrant lands in the Commonwealth, then the Minister may not approve of it . It is very clear that the intention of that statute is to prevent Australian workers being subjected to the competition of cheap labour from other countries, and in particular to protect them from Asiatics and coloured labour. Under the White Australia policy we have declared very emphatically, and, I think, with the endorsement of nine out of every ""ten persons in the Commonwealth, that the competition of coloured labour is undesirable. [53] Under the Contract Immigrants Act, or other statutes which seek to secure the same object, we have not distinguished between one industry and another.. We do not say, for instance, that competition from abroad with bootmakers is undesirable, but that competition with carters or seamen is permissible. We extend the prohibition to al! industries, and the protection, whateverit is, covers the whole sphere of industry. That being so, we have toconsider how the Act operates. If, during the existence of a strike amongst carriers, there came into a Commonwealth port a vessel having on board persons who were willing, and conceivably capable, of performing the work usually done here by those on strike, there can be no doubt that they would not be permitted to land to take the place of the strikers. A contract of employment is"" not necessarily a written one. By far the greater number are not evidenced by one line of writing. A man goes to another, and says- "" I wish to work for you "" - and after a few words have been exchanged as to the rates of wages, and hours of duty he is engaged. That procedure has always been regarded as sufficient. Let us assume, therefore, that a vessel comes into the port of Melbourne during the existence of a carter's strike, and that there are on board that vessel a number of passengers or sailors who profess their readiness to take the place of those on strike. In the circumstances, I submit that the Contract Immigrants - Act would apply, and that they would not be permitted to take the place of the strikers. The Immigration Restriction Act could and ought to be applied in the same way. Let us assume that there is a. strike amongst sail and tent makers, and that seamen on board a vessel that has come into port, and is to be laid up for three or six months, as often happens, are ready to take on the work of sail-making. Let us assume that they are quite capable, as most seamen are, of doing such work, and that application is made to the skipper for permission to engage a number of them, whilst the vessel is in port, to enable the completion of some work of the kind. Compliance with such an application would be, I contend, a distinct violation of the spirit of the Act. I wish to bring mv illustration a little nearer the point that I desire to reach, and to see how this legislation affects persons engaged in loading and unloading ships. The loading and discharging of vessels is as much an Australian industry as is the making of boots, clothes, pianos, or 'anything else. It is an performed by Australians in Australia. The fact that part of the work is per' formed on ships belonging to persons in other countries is not at all to the point, nor does it affect my position in the slightest degree, because it cannot affect our right and power to regulate the conditions under which contracts of employment made and carried out in this country. pose that a foreign-owned ship goes into a clock of any sort for repairs. ship painters, dockers, shipwrights, boilermakers, and engineers, and so on, working on the ship. Every one of those men is < working on a ship belonging to subjects of another country. Yet every one of them would object in the strongest possible way if it were proposed to take from a ship's company an engineer, and to say to him : "" Now that the ship is in Mort's dock, go and work on her."" There would not during an industrial disturbance be one on the dock who, under such circumstances, would turn to. In this country, unionists have gone to the extent of declining to allow Australians in other to encroach upon their particular dustry. A shipwright, for instance, will complain if the work which properly belongs to a shipwright is done by a ship's joiner, and vice versa; and particularly will an engineer complain if that part of the work which belongs to his trade is done by a boilermaker, or vice versa. When a ship is taken into a dock she is regarded in the light of an ordinary job-just were so much metal, wood, and brass lying about in readiness to build a ship. I venture to say that this must apply to all industries without any exception. I come now to an industry which begins and ends with the loading and discharging of ships, as regards both coal and general cargo. In coaling, as well as in loading and discharging, some men work on the ship, some men work on a collier, or in a punt or drogher alongside the ship, and some men work on the wharf. these men are equally engaged in loading and discharging or coaling the ship. pose that during a time of industrial disturbance a ship manned exclusively coloured labour comes to this port, it mav be that both parties to the dispute are resolved to submit it to a Court of Arbitration. the ship applies for men in the usual way either to coal, or to load or discharge cargo, she is told that as there is a strike in proMr Hughes. gress, she cannot get any men. Then the industry agent or the manager says: "" V e r v well ; wo will put on our crew,"" and accordingly they put on, say, 200 men, and coal the ship. I understand that during a comparatively recent trouble, an offer was made to assist other vessels out of their difficulty by coaling them with alien labour. Now, the owner of a ship has no more right to be must be relieved of the consequence of an industrial Supdisturbance than has the owner of a warehouse on shore. There is no immunity atThere are taching to a ship-owner which ought not to attach to every person in the country. A ship-owner must comply with our navigation law, else he cannot make use of our ports. There is before another place a Bill in which it is proposed to exclude from participation in the advantages of trading on our coast all vessels which do not comply with local conditionsthat is, including rates of wages and conditions of labour. Now a vessel is permitted under the Immigration Restriction Act to carry on its business with alien labour, but it is not permitted to land that labour on the wharf until the captain has entered trades into a certain bond. It was surely never inintended that these alien labourers should enter into competition with our own citizens. Yet after the security has been given, these men are permitted to land and to load ox discharge, not their own vessel, but any vessel. They are in Commonwealth territory and carrying on part of the functions of our industrial machine. It is only an accident, and a negligible accident, as if she that they happen to be on a ship which belongs to subjects of another country. Handling cargo on the wharf, lighter, collegislation lier, hulk or ship, is just as much part of the industry as is the putting on of a sole,, cutting out of the upper and finishing, parts of the boot making industry. Exactly the same division of labour marks the operations of the two sets of men I refer to. I submit that to permit persons who are engaged on a ship, simply because they happen to be sailors and bound to obey the lawful comAll mands of their officers, to do that which we prohibit all other men from doing, is to Sup- penalize one particular industry and declare that it alone must be exposed to foreign by competition. We have gone to considerable trouble, and taken a great deal of money out of the pockets of the people, to protect When 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, of those who are engaged in the industries of Australia. I do not tie myself down to accuracy, but I venture to say that there must be excluded from the operation of any protective Tariff here all shearers, agricultural labourers, seamen, waterside workers, persons engaged in the building trades, and many others. They cannot possibly hope to gain those direct and real benefits which come from a protective Tariff in the trades where it operates.",14
22,Mr DEAKIN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Of course, they can share indirectly in the benefits.",16
23,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"On e of the indirect benefits consists in paying the extra price for the other fellow. While the benefits which one derives are direct and obvious, the benefits derived by the other are indirect, and not at all obvious. While we say to men engaged in the boot industry, "" We will protect you from competition by taxing the goods of other countries, and by preventing persons coming from those countries to manufacture boots here during an industrial disturbance,"" we say to the wharf labourers, coal lumpers, and seaman, ""You must be exposed to all the competition, both coloured white, that may happen to be brought against you."" That is a most unfair condition of things, and I am certain that it does not represent the intention of the Legislature. If the Act as it stands, permits this sort of thing, I say most emphatically that we have not exhausted our power to make it operative in the direction which I seek. If we have exhausted our power in that connection, it is time that we sought an amendment of the Constitution, with a view to obtaining further power. M.r. , BAMFORD - The Government confess that they have no power to do what the honourable member seeks to accomplish.",16
24,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I shall listen very carefully to what the Government may have to say upon the question of whether or not we have exhausted our power. If they contend that we have no power to do what I suggest, and if we act upon such an expression of opinion, I claim that we shall be taking a very unusual course, ancl one which has not previously been followed. We all know that it has been the practice of the Government to take action in anydesired direction, irrespective of whether they possessed the necessary constitutional power, and to allow the High Court to determine the validity of a Statute. But apparently they now intend to anticipate the decision of that tribunal by declaring that they have no power to act in the direction I have indicated. [S3]- 2 can establish that position, I demand such an amendment of the Constitution as will place the persons whom I represent in this matter upon a level with every other workman in the country. Why should one set of individuals be protected against the competition of coloured labour, whilst another set is exposed to that competition? Why should one class of persons be permitted to engage in an industrial struggle,, with the full knowledge that nothing unforeseen can disturb the conditions of the local market-wit h whose factors they are perfectly acquainted-whils t the waterside workers may be at any moment exposed to competition, the nature of which they cannot foresee? Under the circumstances, I contend that vessels ought not to be permitted during times of industrial disturbance to undertake, with the' aid of their crews, work which is usually performed by citizens of Australia. I do not care whether those citizens are wharf labourers, painters, engineers, or bootand makers. They should all enjoy-the same measure of protection, and if the law does not allow us to extend it to them, we should amend the Constitution so as to permit of it. Of course, it may be held that under such circumstances, no contract exists, ancl so the Contract Immigrants Act cannot apply. But I do not think that the facts bear out this contention. I understand that the person who superintends the stevedoring and coaling of ships is usually an independent contractor. Some ships are stevedored direct by the shipowners, but in the great majority of cases they are stevedored by an independent contractor at so much per ton, or so much per hour. And the coaling of all foreign going ships is performed by contract. Let us assume, then, that a number of persons are uncier contract with the owner or charterer of a vessel to discharge certain duties incidental to its navigation. Upon their arrival in Sydney or Melbourne, let us suppose; that another person who usually coals that ship with certain of his employees, has a dispute with those employees, and is unable to get a supply of labour. Let us further suppose that he goes to the ship-owner or the charterer of the vessel, ancl says to him, "" Will vou lend me your men to coal your vessel?"" If the ship-owner or charterer consents to do so, I venture to say there is no earthly doubt that a contract for the performance of manual labour If they has been made which is forbidden by the Contract Immigrants Act, section 5 .of which says The Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only (2) if in his opinion(Â«) the contract is not made in contemplation of or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute; and (4) there is difficulty in the employers taining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability (but this paragraph does not apply where the contract immigrant is a British subject either born United Kingaom or descended from a British subject there born), [ f a "" British subject "" includes a native of [ndia, all I have to say is that it has been ;he invariable practice tolimit the opera.ion of the Immigration Restriction Act to joloured persons. I submit, therefore, :hat the provision contained in paragraph b would never be acted upon with a view to permitting a coloured person to claim exemption from the operation of the Act. Under the conditions I Have indicated there Is clearly a contract entered into by immigrants to perform manual labour in this country- a contract other than that made between them and theSr original employer. As this work is almost invariably done by shore labour, if their original employer asks the crew to do it, in effect a fresh contract of employment is made, because an order to do such work is not one of those lawful commands that were contemplated at the time of making the original contract. If it was contemplated at that time, the employer must have had in his mind the possibility of an industrial dispute. If he did have that in his mind, it was a contract within the meaning of the section, which makes Ministerial approval - of the contract conditional upon its not. - being madein contemplation of or with a view of affecting Aa industrial dispute. The set of facts upon .which I am moving related'to the coaling of a vessel. That is work which is invariably undertaken by an independent contractor at so much per ton, to deliver coal for the purpose of taking the steamer to its port of destination. The coloured or coolie crew of the vessel did the coaling, and so were, temporarily at any rate, servants performing manual labour for a contractor, and the contract was made in the Commonwealth. If it was not, if they were working directly for their old employer, if no fresh contract was made for that particular purpose, and Mt. Hughes. the old contract covered it, it must have been a contract made in contemplation of the industrial trouble.",16
25,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Are those crews paid extra by the contractor under a special contract?,17
26,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I could not say, and in any case I submit that the payment has nothing to do with the question. The hon.ob- orable and learned member knows that any further inducement held out to seamen to do something not included in their contract could net be recovered. I could' not say whether such an inducement is held out, in the nor do I know whether in this particular case the crew worked for their principal employer, or for an independent contractor. In my opinion that is not material. Section 4 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906 provides(1) Any person who, either as principal or as agent, makes or enters into any contract, or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the StatesWith intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers, is guilty of an offence. Penalty : Five hundred pounds. (2) ' Every contract ' made or entered into in contravention of this section shall be absolutely illegal and void. That Act was passed in pursuance of the trade and commerce power given by subsection 1 of section 51 of the Constitution. I do not say that it will apply ,to this particular case, but in it there is clearly a power to prevent anybody, whether in the country or out of it, from doing something which has the effect of injuring or destroying any Australian industry by means of unfair competition. This is an Australian industry; competition by coloured labour must inevitably injure it, and tend to destroy it ; such competition exposes those in the industry to most unfair competition, and cannot be advantageous to the Commonwealth "" having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers."" Although it may be held that it is very desirable that the ship should get away, and that if labour cannot be obtained here the ship has a perfect right to employ her own crew in order to get away, still there is the Act. It is a hardship to individuals if you like, but the law takes no cognisance of hardships to individuals. It has regard only to the general effect of legislation. No doubt every Act that is passed involves hardship to individuals. With the generality of legislation it must inevitably be so, but the intention of this legislation is clearly and unmistakably to exclude competition coming from foreign countries, particularly during periods of industrial disturbance. I ask the Government to declare, first, whether, in their opinion, the Act as it stands can deal with that matter-whic h I doubt-o r whether, failing that, they have power under the Constitution as it stands to provide for it . I think they have ample power to do so. They may say that they have doubts, but it is to be noted that when they had no doubts at all they went on cheerfully with legislation which the High Court just as cheerfully vetoed. The Government have gone on most enthusiastically passing Acts of Parliament of the most comprehensive character, apparently for no other purpose than to provide a chopping block for the exercise of the ingenuity and judicial foresight of the High Court. I want to know what the Government propose to do in the matter. I think that it is unsatisfactory that such a considerable body of men-numberin g many thousands-shoul d be exposed to competition over which they have no control, while every other workman in the Commonwealth is safeguarded.",17
27,Mr CROUCH,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Does the honourable member intend the motion to apply only to nonresident Asiatics ? If not, what about those who are already in the Commonwealth ?",18
28,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I take it that the context shows that the motion is intended to apply only to non-residents. I thought that would be understood in any case.,18
29,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [3.2:1] - The motion of the honourable member for West Sydney only came under my notice just before lunch today, and I must admit that I have not had time to look into the matter with the closeness which would enable one to speak with any degree of authority. The subject is one that demands serious consideration.",18
30,Mr REID,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Has the motion only just been placed upon the notice-paper?,18
31,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"No , but it only came under my notice today. I take it that the honourable member for West Sydney does not desire to stand strictly and literally by the wording of the motion, but that he desires it to be considered - in a comprehensive sense. He desires, as I understand him, that Asiatics shall not come out to Australia as members of crews of vessels, and be permitted, while their ships are in Australian waters during a time of industrial disturbance, to come ashore or go into lighters and do work which would be otherwise done by men employed in Australia. I take it that that is the honourable member's meaning.",18
32,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Quite true.,18
33,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Strictl y speaking, the motion refers only to labour done upon, or in connection with, a ship, but I take it that the honourable member intends to deal with the broad principle. It is true, as the honourable member has said, that this Parliament has already considered the question of persons coming to Australia under contract with a view of affecting industrial disturbances. Undoubtedly the policy p f this Parliament has been not to encourage-in fact, to prohibit-the introduction of immigrants under contract, where a strike is in contemplation, or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute. Parliament has expressed that general policy. Speaking personally, I think that there is a great deal to be said in favour of the position which the honourable member has submitted, because undoubtedly the intention of Parliament was that immigrants should not be allowed to be introduced with a view of affecting any industrial disturbance whether on a wharf, or in a factory, or in the back parts of the country. If immigrants do come into Australia under contract to perform services in connection with what I may call wharf work, their introduction is in contravention of the policy of the Act. I ask the House to remember that our immigration legislation deals with two subjects. First of all, under the Immigration Restriction Act, we exercise what I may call a Commonwealth police power of keeping out of Australia all undesirable immigrants, including coloured immigrants. But under the Contract Immigrants Act, we deal with a special class of labour relating to those who come to Australia under contract to perform manual labour. The whole of our legislation contained in those two Statutes is based upon our power to deal with immigration, but as yet we have had no authoritative interpretation of what constitutes immigration under the Constitution. The matter recently came before the High Court in Minahan's case, when the Chief Justice saidReference was also, made to the decision of this Court in the case of Chia Gee v. Martin (3 C.L.R., 649), where it was said that entry without proof of an animus manendi was sufficient evidence of immigration. That is to sav, the mere fact of his coming in without proof of his intention to remain would constitute immigrationIn that case the question was whether it necessary for the prosecutor to establish animus manendi; and it was held that it was not necessary. The question whether every person entering the Commonwealth is - grant was not considered. The view taken by Sir Edmund Barton when he was administering the Department of External Affairs, and also the view taken by the then Attorney-General, the present Prime Minister, and by the late Mx. Kingston, was that the crews of vessels landing during the stay of the vessel and doing certain work ashore were not immigrants and did not come within the prohibition. That is the present position. The Contract Immigrants Act deals with persons who come into Australia as immigrants under contract ; and the essence of being under contract involves an intention to remain to perform the contract. But so far it has not been decided whether mere entry into the Commonwealth does constitute immigration. Section 8 of the Act says The two last preceding sections do not to an immigrant under a contract or agreement law. to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coasting trade in Australian waters, if . the rates of wages specified therein are lower than the rates ruling in the Commonwealth law. wealth. This section contemplates that it is possible for persons to come to Australia and serve in our coasting trade under contract.. But the case the honourable member puts is that of Japanese, Chinese, or other foreign boats - eve n British boats like those of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company-whic h come into Australia during a strike.",18
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Is a illegal now ?,19
35,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"In some parts of Australia, a strike is not illegal; but that is not the point before us at the present, moment. The case put by the honourable member for West Sydney is that, when a boat comes in during a strike, the shore contractor, who, under ordinary circumstances, would employ persons ashore, and coal the ship for so much per ton, makes an arrangement under which the members of the crew do the work.",19
36,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,That the usual case.,19
37,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That is the case presented by the honourable member for West Sydney; and I am endeavouring to deal with it. The honourable member very properly raises the question whether such a case as he presents does not come within the was Act ; and he asks, whether, as a matter of an policy, it is fair that persons should come from outside the jurisdiction, and practically an immiaffect an industrial disturbance.",19
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,An illegal disturbance.,19
39,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,In Queensland under State law such a disturbance would not be illegal.,19
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"It would be in New South Wales, with which the honourable member for West Sydney is particularly dealing.",19
41,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I am talking about an Australian case, without reference to particular States.",19
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Are strikes not i l legal under the Commonwealth Act?,19
43,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Not ordinarily in the case of unregistered organizations.,19
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,But these are registered unions.,19
45,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I do not know if they apply are registered under the Commonwealth,19
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,All the shipping not people in Sydney are under the Common,19
47,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Eve n if such a strike be illegal, the policy has always been, in the case of an industrial disturbance, not to bring in people from outside to further complicate the position.",19
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,It is not asserted that that has been done.,19
49,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I am now merely dealing with the case put by the honourable member for West Sydney. I must admit strike not that, departmentally, I know that it is alleged such cases have taken place.  as a fact.",19
50,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I know of a case from my departmental knowledge.  his own knowledge.,19
51,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I have it also as newspaper knowledge.  Minister a case at Pinkenba !,19
52,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That is one case of is not which I have knowledge from the departmental files. What is said to happen is that, while a disturbance is on, crews used - to do the work, just the same as if amongst othersthey were persons brought in from out the side.",19
53,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,To work they signed on to do.,20
54,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That is a question of fact, depending on the contract. But what I am dealing with now is the general policy - of bringing persons from outside to take the place of other persons during a. time - of industrial disturbance; and I presume that in the past it has been felt that, to bring persons from outside, especially coloured aliens, really tends more to a breach of the peace than to the settlement of a dispute. That general policy is one upon which Parliament has legislated; but the honourable member for West Sydney asks whether persons who are so employed - come within the meaning of the Act as immigrants under contract to do the work. The view that has been taken is that, under the Act, such persons are not immigrants, seeing that they do not intend to remain in Australia, but are members of crews simply passing through the country.",20
55,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,We have to deduce the conclusion from the facts.,20
56,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"An obvious fact is that a vessel calling at say, Sydney, desires to get away as quickly as possible, and, to that end, the crew do the work instead of the shore men. ",20
57,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The result is the same; but we have to ask ourselves whether such persons are or are not immigrants.,20
58,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If they are not immigrants, what are they?",20
59,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"They are members of a crew staying for a time in Australia, with the intention of going on.",20
60,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"But supposing a member of the crew undertook another job in town during the stay of the ship, would he not then be an immigrant?",20
61,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Such a person would still come within the exemption.,20
62,Mr WATSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Then the Act ought to be altered !,20
63,Mr DEAKIN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Such cases do not happen.,20
64,Mr WATSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I contend that such cases have happened.',20
65,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Accordin g to section 3, paragraph k, of the Immigration Restricare tion Act, the following are excepted, master and crew of any other vessel landing during the stay of the vessel in any port in the Commonwealth : Provided ihat the master do the shall, upon being so required by any officer, and before being permitted to clear out from or leave the port, muster the crew in the presence of an officer. There is no prohibition against such persons doing any work when they are landed.",20
66,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Then what does the Act mean ?,20
67,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The object of the Contract Immigrants Act is to exclude from Australia certain persons who came here under contract. The section I have quoted from the Immigration Restriction Act provides that certain persons shall not be excluded.,20
68,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Then a member of a crew could, for instance, drive a tram during the time he stayed.",20
69,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"There is no prohibition against that, the contract being made in Australia.",20
70,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I do not believe for one moment that that is the meaning of the Act ,20
71,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The construction may be wrong; but there is another difficulty in the fact that, when a man arrives in the country, he comes under the States laws which regulate callings and occupations. The Commonwealth has no power, for instance, to regulate the driving of carts or trams within a State; our powers are confined to immigrants and emigrants.",20
72,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,An immigrant is a per son who comes into one country from another.,20
73,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That is true, but the question has been raised whether in addition to his coming into the country there should not be the idea of his remaining in the country.",20
74,Mr WATSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That would introduce a very wide interpretation. A Chinaman might come here with the idea of remaining twenty years, and, because he did not intend to remain permanently, he would not be an immigrant.",20
75,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"There may be an intention to remain a week or a month. Personally I shall be pleased if we can sustain the view that mere landing constitutes a person an immigrant. Suppose that a man signs on at Hong Kong to make a voyage to the Commonwealth, and return to Hong Kong. He may be only two or three days in Sydney during the stay of the vessel, and may never intend to remain in that city.",20
76,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Accordin g to the honourable gentleman, that would be a sumcient answer to a charge ""of desertion.",21
77,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I do not say so. The question before us is whether such a man would come within the purview of the Contract Immigrants Act. I say that, during his stay, he would not be an immigrant within the meaning of the Act. But there is the further question whether he is an immigrant at all.",21
78,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,What constitutes an immigrant ?,21
79,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The High Court has not defined an ""immigrant,"" I should say that the slightest indication of an intention to remain in Australia would make such a person as I have referred to an immigrant.",21
80,Mr HALL,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"How would the honourable gentleman interpret "" remain in Austialia""?",21
81,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If , for instance, he deserted from his ship, that would be evidence of an intention to remain. If he did not turn up at the time appointed for the muster of the crew, he would be. an immigrant, in my opinion. We have acted upon that assumption. Whenever a member of a ship's crew breaks away from his contract to serve on the vessel,, the assumption is that it is his intention to remain in the Commonwealth. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney has raised two questions, the first as to whether what he has complained of comes within the purview of the Act, and the second as to whether we have the power to amend the Act to remedy what he complains ofI think that the honourable and learned gentleman was guilty of some exaggeration, when he said that the Federal Parliament has passed Acts, irrespective of whether it has possessed the power to do so. I do not think tiiis Parliament has done anything of the kind, or that it is fair to suggest that it has done so. dealing with any matter, if , on the face of it, it has appeared that we possessed the power to do what was proposed, we have proceeded to exercise our right. I hope that this House will always be prepared to claim all its powers. It is our duty to stand by what we believe to be the powers intrusted to this Parliament under the Constitution.",21
82,Mr FRAZER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,We have been a bit unlucky in doing so.,21
83,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"On the contrary, I think we have not been unlucky. If honourable members will examine the records of the High Court, they will find that our proportion of wins in the cases in which we have been engaged is Satisfactory.",21
84,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The Government had a win the other day, when they deserved to lose.",21
85,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"There have been a few cases in which the Commonwealth have been unsuccessful; in one case, in connection with a minor provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.",21
86,Mr DEAKIN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"- A very dubious matter. ,",21
87,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"On a point which both sides admitted to be dubious-the question, as to whether railway servants were included under the Act.",21
88,Mr HALL,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The Attoriiey-General has himself challenged some portions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Mr GROOM. - Onl y the interpretation of some provisions of the Act, not the power of the Federal Parliament to pass the Act. There was the Harvester case.",21
89,Mr REID,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That was a small matter. Mr 'GROOM - It was admittedly an important matter, but we were defeated only by a majority decision, and he would be a bold man who, studying the judgments of the majority and minority of the High - Court, could speak confidently on eitlier side. Another case was the Union Label case.",21
90,Mr REID,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Anothe r small matter.,21
91,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If honourable members will take into consideration generally the whole of the matters on which we have been challenged, they will have to admit that we have scored many victories, and that in the majority of instances the views on which we proceeded have been sustained.",21
92,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,On e more such victory and we are undone.,21
93,Mr REID,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,In the Senate election case also we were rather unfortunate.,21
94,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"In that case the question In was certainly an open one, and honourable members will remember that the State Government of South Australia were given the same advice by their responsible officers before they proceeded. Viewing the whole position we can claim that we have been fairly successful, and we can further claim that in nearly every case which we have lost a strong minority opinion has supported the position which we assumed.",21
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,That is only very recently.,21
96,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I refer honourable members to the cases which involved the right of the States Governments to tax Commonwealth property, the right of municipalities to tax our property, the right of the States Governments to tax the instruments which Commonwealth public servants sign when they receive their pay, and the right of the States Governments ,to levy income tax on Commonwealth servants. There were also the wire-netting and steel rail cases involving the right of the Commonwealth to tax the States imports and other goods, and in all these cases the Commonwealth was successful.",22
97,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,---But in every industrial case we iiave gone down.,22
98,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"In two or three cases the High Court has been against us. In the last case in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act the High. Court - sustained a wide interpretation of our powers. On the question of our power to amend the Contract Immigrants Act, in the way indicated by the honourable member for West Sydney, I should like further time to look into the matter.",22
99,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Can the honourable gentleman see anything in favour of the contention ?,22
100,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I believe there is much to be said in favour of the policy proposed. I believe that the honourable member for North Sydney favoured the provision in the Contract Immigrants Act, which has been referred to, ancl the right honourable member for East Sydney also approved - of it.",22
101,Mr REID,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I would prevent a man going from his own ship to work in another or - on shore. I think that a higher law than - ours would prevent us from interfering with his working on his own ship.,22
102,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"It is not a question of a higher law, but undoubtedly under the - comity of nations, generally speaking, the - rule of international law is that when a foreign, vessel comes into the waters of 'another State, the authorities of that State do not interfere with the internal - discipline and control of the ship.",22
103,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"No , I do not desire that we should do that.",22
104,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Quite so, I understood the honourable and learned gentleman to - say that he recognised that law.",22
105,Mr REID,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Would not the coaling of a - steamer be an internal operation as much - as the taking of water into her boilers?,22
106,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The case put by the honourable member for West Sydney was that of men coming out of a boat"" and making a'contract to do work on shore.",22
107,Mr WATSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,O r taking coal off lighters.,22
108,Mr REID,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I should be with the honourable member for West Sydney on that point. *,22
109,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The honourable member for West Sydney will admit that he has not stated all the facts essential to a perfect knowledge of the case he submits.,22
110,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I .think that work usually done on ships or on shore by wharf labourers should not be done by a ship's crew.,22
111,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The honourable gentleman referred to the coaling of a ship, and also to the case of the repairing of a ship, and mentioned the case of a . vessel being taken into Mort's Dock for repairs. He said that the work of repairs carried out was work usually performed by shore labour.",22
112,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I put that as a hypothetical case.  kenba.,22
113,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"-In that case a vessel arrived at the wharf when there was some industrial trouble, before any one on shore knew anything about it, and cargo was unloaded, and taken on board by the crew.  trucks on the railway line.",22
114,Mr GROOM,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Anothe r case of the kind occurred a,t Bunbury, in Western Australia. In that case members of the crew of a vessel went ashore, and loaded trucks with timber from the vessel. It could not be said that they were performing the duties of a crew, because they participated in an industrial work ordinarily carried on by our own people. I must confess that, in such a case, I find it difficult to distinguish them from contract immigrants as regards a matter of policy. The policy of the Contract Immigrants Act is to keep out of industrial occupations, during the time of a dispute, those whose presence might provoke a brqach of the peace. That is the principle. But there are complications in the case presented by the honourable and learned member. It is open to question whether we can deal with these matters under our power to control immigration. We have also the power to control navigation, and to deal with special races; though the motion applies not tc* special races, but to coloured races generally. All the questions arising in connection with the subject must be considered, and I should like honourable members today to state particular cases which have come under their knowledge,'so that we may possess the fullest information as. to the facts. Another difficulty has presented itself in the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, and we have now under consideration the propriety of amending the law to meet it . The honourable and learned member may think that this case might be dealt with at the same time. In the meantime, we should like an opportunity to look into the matter.",22

117,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I wish the Prime Minister was less restive, ancl that he had allowed me to finish my sentence. I think that proposals for amendment should be in the direction of making the Act less illiberal, and of removing some of the objections which have been taken to it by persons in other countries.",23
118,Mr WATSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Objectio n is not taken to its' provisions by those who understand them.,23
119,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Some of its provisions are still considered objectionable, although we have managed to improve others.

123,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The other day he attacked certain members on this side of the Chamber,23
124,Mr SPEAKER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The honourable member must not refer to a previous debate.,23

127,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I arm coming to the point. It is the honourable and learned gentleman who needs to be brought to the point. He always seeks to attain his ends by devious courses, and he is at present trying to discount my remarks by a similar method.",23
128,Mr DEAKIN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,'The honourable member should read the motion.,23
129,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,What the honourable and learned member for. West Sydney asks us to affirm isThat the Contract Immigrants Act should be amended so as to prevent the employment o for Asiatic labour upon or in connection with ships in Commonwealth ports during the time of industrial disturbance. That means that a coloured cook on a vessel lying in one of our ports at the timeof an industrial disturbance could not prepare the captain's or the crew's meals.,23

131,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That is the meaning of the words, though I am willing to accept the honourable and learned member's assurance if they do not expresshis intention. I acknowledge that, in theframing of such a motion, words may be used which express more than is intended. However, I was asked to read' the motion, and I am now mentioning oneof my objections to it. The Prime Minister has insinuated that I am opposing itbecause I favour the employment of coloured labour in Australia.",23
132,Mr DEAKIN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I beg the honourable member's pardon. What I was endeavouring, to convey was that the honourable member, in his .preliminary observations, was not dealing with the motion before us.",23

134,Mr DEAKIN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,No .,23
135,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Then I have him with me so far. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney gave some hypothetical cases which were of no practical value.

No serious injury inflicted on Australian industry occasions on which coal is shipped or goods landed by the crews of vessels in the liarment. bors of Australia.

On that occasion I did not object to a crew working aboard their vesmonths sel. I saw no objection to a crew carrying on the work which, as the last speaker said, they were under contract to perform, that is, the ordinary work of the ship, even extending to the conveying of coal after it was placed on board. What I did object to then, and what I object 10 now most emphatically is, that men were brought on to lighters in the harbour, and were therefore working on Commonwealth territory, not on their ships. That. is a totally distinct question. Notwithstanding all that the Attorney-General has said day, and notwithstanding the reply that gave to me then, I still contend that when coloured men come ashore and engage in were work on Commonwealth territory they are immigrants, and that the exemption given to crews landing in Australia does not cover their case. I had a number of munications with the Department at the time, and the Attorney-General expressed the opinion, which he practically reiterated today, that these men, even although enAustralia gaged in work on lighters in Sydney Harpermanently bor, which technically are Commonwealth territory, were not immigrants within the meaning of the Immigration Restriction Act, as they were exempted by paragraph in port. k of section 3.",27

My complaint is that the Attorney-General has. taken the word "" landing ' ' in the provision absolutely literally. During the last few we have had sufficient experience of the attitude of the High Court to convince us that the least successful way of attempting to interpret the Constitution or an Act of Parliament is to depend upon its literal meaning. The High Court has simply cast aside as of no value the plain literal meaning of an Act or the Constitution. It has been guided, so it has declared, in each case by the spirit underlying the particular provision which it was called upon to interpret. In that light let us take the word "" landing,"" and ask ourselves what was to the evident intention of Parliament. I the was to permit the crew of a ship to go ashore, and not to be harassed while they going through the city in their leisure. They were to be allowed, under paragraph k, to go ashore temporarily, without being harassed by detectives or police officers as comundesirable immigrants. Parliament did not contemplate men going ashore to perform work. If the Court could hold that the word "" landing "" covered any stay in short of an express intention to reside here, it would be possible for coloured immigrants, or, for that matter, any other immigrants to stop here for ten years-as long as the ship remained",27

203,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Hindmarsh) [4-3Â°]-On the last occasion, when the Bill was before the House, I said that apparently the hpnorable member for West Sydney was seized of the fact that there is great discontent with the present constitution of* the Appeal Board. I pointed out that while the employ6s in a Department are represented by one elected member on the Appeal Board, the Department is represented by the Public Service Inspector, and its permanent head. In my opinion the Appeal Board ought to possess three qualifications. In the first place, it should be impartial; it ought to be beyond suspicion, and to command the full confidence of service and the public. I.want honourable unsatisfactory ? members to consider whether it possesses those qualities. I maintain that it is not impartial, for the reason that the Public Service Commissioner insists upon unithe formity being observed in the vice, and that consequently the moment that the Public Service Inspector goes to adjudicate on an appeal he has to bear that fact in mind. question of justice does not enter into His consideration at all . The vice Appeal Board is not impartial. In the place, whatever its finding may be, it to be remitted to the Commissioner, who possesses the power of veto. As he has been madeindorsed the recommendation of the Public Service Inspector, who usually acts on the recommendation of the head of the partment, who also sits on an appeal, the Board comes to a different conclusion officers for at least five years. the Public Service Inspector has to admit that he had recommended an irregular pointment, or done an injustice to an officer in regard to promotions. of the Department. I do not think that the Commissioner-o r even the Inspectoron mature consideration, is likely to that what he did was wrong. The conthe sequence is that having the power he will at once say, "" The appointment I made the first place was quite in accordance with the merits of the officer."" I do not think that the history of the service will show that, in every instance, officers have been dealt with justly. The head of a Department has his favourites. If he desires a certain officer to be promoted to a vacant position he informs the Inspector that that officer is the most qualified to fill it , and the Inspector ' reports accordingly to the Commissioner, who, since 'his duties extend over the whole of the Commonwealth, cannot possibly make himself acquainted with the work of the officers in all branches of the service. He is dependent upon the advice of the Public Service Inspectors, who, in their turn, are dependent upon the advice tendered to them by the heads of Departments. Only today, I asked when the Public Service Inspectors in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, had examined the work of all the officers in those States. The reply which I received was not satisfactory, because I am sure that, in one of those States, no examination of . the work performed by all officers has taken place during the past live years.",28
204,Mr HUMECOOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,In what respect was the the reply given to the honourable member,28
205,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The reply stated that the' Inspectors had made themselves familiar with the work of the officers of various Departments. It did not say Public Serwhen they had done so.,28

This Board ought to possess confidence of the Department, and of ""the public, but it cannot do so whilst in in justices are perpetrated throughout the service. I could mention the names of officers who have been unjustly treated, but, inasmuch as they are not permitted to exercise political influence, I shall refrain from doing so. Were I to publicly innounce their names, they would, doubtless, be penalized for having committed a breach of the Public Service Regulations. I could cite numerous instances in which junior officers have been promoted over the heads of - their seniors, notwithstanding that the latter possessed undeniable qualifications. Thestereotyped reply given to appeals in this connection in the case of telegraphists is as followsNo appeal lies in connection with the advancement of telegraphists previously their juniors to the fourth class, and the expert judgment of the Department does not support their claims to be regarded as equal in telegraphic ability to the officers who have been promoted.",28
208,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"As a matter of fact, the Public Service Commissioner, by regulation, has practically repealed section 50 of the Public Service Act.",29
209,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,There is no doubt about that. The reply just quoted h the stereotyped one that is given to officers who think that they have been unjustly treated.,29
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,HO W would the position be altered by this Bill ?,29
211,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"At present, the Appeal Board consists of the Public Service Inspector of the State in which the appeal is heard, who has to give effect to the system of uniformity insisted upon by the Public Service Commissioner",29
212,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The regulation to which I have alluded will also require to be repealed.,29
213,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Yes . The Appeal Board consists of the Public Service Inspector of the State in which the inquiryis held, the head of the Department concerned, and arepresentative of the division to which the appellant belongs. am not entirely satisfied with the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney, but I think that any alteration in the present method of constituting these Appeal Boards would be an improvement.",29
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I do not sa.y that.,29
215,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Unde r the scheme of the honourable member for West Sydney, we should displace one member of the Board, who in my opinion is consciously or unconsciously biased, and who almost by virtue of his office, must insist* upon giving effect to a system of uniformity. In his place we should have either a State Judge or a stipendiary or a police magistrate. The Board having decided whether an officer has been justly or unjustly treated, would forward its report straight to the Governor General, who would act upon its finding. That is the improvementsuggested by the honourable member for West Sydney. When an officer complains that he has been superseded by a junior, and desires to appeal to the Commissioner, instead of being granted an inquiry, he is usually told that "" No appeal lies."" I ask the honourable member for Parramatta, who gives that reply? Ca;sar-and Csesar . is the Public Service Commissioner. If a Board constituted in the manner suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney declared that "" No appeal lies,"" I 'should be perfectly satisfied.",29
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Does the honourable member suggest that every appeal should be heard by somebody?,29
217,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Why give to the public servants of the Commonwealth the power of appeal if they think that injustice has been done to them, and permit the Public Service Commissioner to say that "" no appeal lies?

222,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,^I have already outlined what I conceive to be a reasonable method of dealing with it. I would like to see that method given a trial. Mr J. H. CATTS - In the long run fifty Boards of Appeal would be less costly to the country than is a discontented service.,29
223,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Parliamen t in its wisdom has declared that officers who feel that they are the victims of injustice shall have the right of appeal. Yet the moment that they exercise that right, the Public Service Commissioner affirms "" No appeal lies."" I have in my mind's eye quite a number of cases",29
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,We all know of hard cases. I know - of several.,30
225,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"But the cases to curing promotion. which I was about to refer are typical of scores of others. Of course, in a large service it is inevitable that hard cases occasionally occur, and, personally, I feel very sorry for an officer who suffers under such circumstances. But when we officer after officer being superseded juniors without their cases being inquired into at all, it is time that we took some action to remedy the existing state of things. How can we expect out Public Service to be conducted as it should be in the breasts of a majority of the officers there is rankling the conviction that they have suffered, or may suffer, injustice?",30

The Public Service Inspector of South Australia was appointed to the position of classifier by vote. To-day - there is not a man who is more execrated by the if public servants of that State than be is. From what has come under my own knowledge, I have no hesitation in saying that he is more anxious to see that civil servants are kept down to the very minimum, apart from the value of their services, than to see that fair play is done to officers. He takes his attitude from the stand-point the finances, and seems to feel it to be his duty to keep down every officer to f an officer the lowest possible point.  to promaster-General cannot even appoint a the moment telegraph messenger.",30

Yet the Deputy Postmaster-General is* supposed to The be responsible for the profitable conduct",30

We, in our wisdom, provided for a Board of Appeal which has given the utmost dissatisfaction throughout the Commonwealth service. I ' say that we can substitute something better, and, to prove my case, I am trying to show some of the injustices that have been done to officers. I have in my mind the case of an officer whose conduct has never been questioned. He has performed more responsible duties than have others who have been placed above him. He has been prepared to demonstrate that he was equal to any duties that might be imposed on him in the Department. He can refer to all the officers with whom he has worked, yet, in spite of all this, he has not only been given no opportunity to demonstrate his qualifications, but his juniors, who were not nearly so comperent_ or capable, ancl who had never been intrusted with the responsible duties which he had fulfilled, are, for some inscrutable reason, placed over him.",30

Let me mention a particular case which has come under my own notice. I am precludedfrom giving names publicly, but I am prepared to give honourable members information in private. A certain officer in the Telegraph Department, a married man, whothe has been ovqr twenty years in the service, and has been in charge of some of the most important lines, a man of whom his fellow-officers speak as diligent, obedient, and capable, has had a junior put over his head. He is a splendid typist, and' honourable can deal with the fastest messages. He has never been absent from work, and for a period of twelve months no error was charged against ""him.",33

Being a high-spirited man, he appealed against such treatment, but the reply received was that no appeal lay. I have never heard of anything more scandalous. Were I in his position, I should do all I could to disrupt the service until I .got justice. We should not tolerate such occurrences; but should see that the fair thing is done to every officer. In the Customs Department, no fewer than fifty officers appealed against promotions, but they were flouted with a similar reply. If no injustice has been done, why should the authorities be frightened of appeals. If the service were justly treated, appeals would become less frequent directly that fact was recognised.",33

Most of the complaints, I am satisfied, are thoroughly justified, although there may be one 'or two in regard to which ' another side might be presented; and the only wav to ascertain the facts is to have them, investigated before a competent Board.

Mr HUTCHISON - Quite so; but it is a public matter, which does not so much concern honourable members, as it concerns the services of the country, which cannot be what they ought to be while men rankle under a sense of injustice. ' I could mention a case in which a Deputy Postmaster General recommended a promotion which was rejected by, the Commissioner; and the public servant desired to appeal on the ground that the action taken by the Deputv Postmaster-General was in accordance with the regulation, and that similar recommendations had been previously endorsed.

321,Mr JOHNSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,That certainly should be remedied.,35
322,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Quite so, and I hope the honourable member will help me to find a remedy. In the case of the commended promotion, to. which I have just referred, and which"" was entirely to the satisfaction of the colleagues of the moted ? officer recommended, not only was promotion refused, but the usual reply was sent that there was no right of appeal; and 1 could give scores of such cases throughout the Commonwealth. I have been qareful, nn account of the officers themselves, to particularize the State in which such treatment has been meted out. I know that many hundreds apply for positions which have been thrown open to applicaleft tion, and have received no reply; indeed, I know of one officer, who, so far back as August last, applied for holidays to 1 which he was entitled, and has not yet had the courtesy of any response.",35
323,Mr JOHNSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,There are many others fairly: in the same position.,35

Further, I know that officers have objected vain to be classed in certain divisions, the on the ground that the new work was entirely clerical, and that they were made subordinate to the superintendent of the mail branch. The result of such classification was a promotion that effected a small to the Department, the others being denied the maximum salary they were entitled to reach. Indeed, I may say that officers so classified were led to accept the new position by misrepresentation, and, in their own language, felt that they had that been "" sold."" In a case in South Australia, it was the Public Service Inspector advised the officers to accept the classification, but, as I have said, they found they were "" sold,"" because they were denied the increase of salary to which they entitled had they remained in 'their opold position. There was one officer who had been over a quarter of a century in the service, and possessed splendid' educaa tional and practical qualifications. He the had a wide knowledge of postal work, and in addition was a competent telegraphist, shorthand writer and typist; but, in spite of all, the promotion was given to a clerk in the correspondence branch, who had had no experience whatever in practical work. I do not see how an officer can be expected to sit still, and do his work with satisfaction, when he is labourreing under such a sense of injustice. Mr T OSEPH COOK - What were the qualifications of the officer who was pro",35
325,Mr HUTCHISON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"He was a good correspondence clerk; but in that respect the rejected officer was his equal, and was familiar with many branches of postal work. He was recognised by his brother not officers as a very smart man; indeed, I may say, he was just as good a/ man, per day, in consequence of his bad treatment, the service in disgust. I am delighted to say that that officer has obtained a position in private employment, where his remuneration is greater than he could hope to get in the service; and farewell gathering his superior omcers  no future for himself in the Department, but, on the contrary, witnessed injustice after injustice done to his colleagues himself. He was entitled to promotion which he did not get; but he has been able to better himself outside the Departthe ment. The Minister, in dealing with this Bill , admitted that the Public Service Commissioner has power to veto the decimittee, sion of a Board of Appeal, and the honproviding orable member for West Sydney very rightly desires to remove that power. That honourable member, however, proposes that a Board, composed, if honourable memthe bers like, of a probably biased head of the Department, a probably biased represento tative of the employees, and an unbiased judge-becaus e in most cases honourable members, at any rate on the Opposition side, have often contended that the Court is to be trusted",35

But surely it is high time we abolished a Court whose decisions must be reported roPublic Service Commissioner, who has.the right of veto. What an absurdity it is appoint three men to arrive at what they believe to be a fair decision, and then oblige them to refer their finding to the Public Service Commissioner, who in their opinion may have been guilty of unfairness, and ask him to admit it . Of the honorcourse, he will say, "" No . I vetothe finding of the Board."" The proposal of the - honourable member for West Sydney is that the Board of Appeal under his Bill , having come to have a decision, shall report to the GovernoraskGeneral. That in my opinion would be a. great improvement on the existing system. does the I am sure that the Minister would sav that he would not care to be asked to review one of his own decisions in the light of a finding by some one else. He would consider that to ask him to do so would be toplace him in an invidious position. I do not think the Public Service Commissioner should be placed in such a position. I that believe that he does what he believes to be fair, though often the advicewhich he acts is not of the best. But having taken action, he naturally does not care to be asked to undo what he has done because of the finding of a Board of Aphonorable peal. The Minister saidThe Appeal Boards are governed by principles underlying classification, and are purelv adWhat does that mean? It means that the Board of Appeal is not untrammelled.

All that is asked by the honourable member for West Sydney to be done is precisely what we have to do under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.' The Judge of the Arbitration Court delegates his powers to a State magistrate. Surely, if we do that in a matter affecting the whole of the industries of the Commonwealth, we can do it in a smaller matter. Moreover, the power intrusted to a magistrate under the Arbitration Act is such as the Judge chooses to delegate. He can delegate the whole of his powers, ancl leave the magistrate to exercise them, subject to review. In this case, all that the State official would do would be to hear the evidence. If it is considered that the power will be unfairly exercised, I am prepared to substitute a layman for the Judge. The Minister said that a Judge would have no knowledge of the principles which guided the Commissioner and the Inspectors in coming to a decision. That means that, in the Minister's opinion, a Judge could not take an unprejudiced view of the situations. It is also an admission that the Public Service Commissioner and his Inspectors never take an unprejudiced view. It is said that there are certain principles which guide the Commissioner and his Inspectors, and the Minister's objection to the Bill is that a Judge would not take the same view. But I point out that the Judge would simply sit, hear the evidence, and adjudicate upon the facts. He would not require to have a knowledge of the service, any more than the Judge of the Arbitration Court possesses a knowledge of the many ramifications of industry coming under his review. In the same way, the Judge, hearing appeals under the Public Service Act, would obtain whatever technical knowledge he required from the officers of the Department. If the head of the Department placed the case unfairly before him, the representative of the employees would point out the discrepancies in the evidence tendered; and if the Judge, was. not satisfied, there be nothing to prevent his calling other witnesses, and making sure that he ascertained the true facts of the easel. I am certain that the Minister must be convinced that a fair thing is not being done to the employees at present. As Chairman of the Postal Commission, he must know that the service is seething with dissatisfaction. Anything that can be done to remove that discontent, if only temporarily, and as an experiment, will be to the advantage of the service. I am sure that the members of the service would cheerfully submit to any effort that was honestly made to better the system. I believe that it is the desire of the Government to have not only an efficient service, but one which we can show to the whole world as being a service, the members of which are well paid and properly treated, whilst their grievances have only to be stated to te remedied, if they are genuine. Tf those conditions were brought about, I am certain we s'hould very rapidly have a better state of things than exists today. Mr Hutchison.",38
359,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Robertson) [5.56] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh has delivered what I believe to be a very good speech on this question. I have on previous occasions heard him make remarks as to the injustice done tb officers of the service. I have also listened to a very spirited address from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on the same subject. It will be admitted that the Public Service is a difficult one for the Commissioner to manage. A more conscientious man for the post we could not have. That he fails to give satisfaction to everyone is only what we might expect. But it is my conviction that he does his very best to do justice all round, and to promote the true interests of the service. Where so many hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent we should be very slow indeed to recommend a change in management. But the change that is now recommended is not a radical one, and it is not made because the Commissioner's work has not been appreciated. I believe it is a change that would make a success of a service that at the present time unfortunately is regarded as anything but successful.",39
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The Commissioner's view is that the change would have a reverse effect.,39
361,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,No doubt the would Commissioner does not want an alteration made in the Act while he is at the head of the service; but I believe that if he occupied a seat in this House a similar proposal would be made by himself. We cannot expect the Commissioner to say that he has not given satisfaction to the service. Any honourable member who looks through the voluminous report that the Commissioner has presented to Parliament will realise how many are the difficulties with which he has had to-grapple. We also learn from his report that he has been approached by Ministers in the making of appointments of which he did not approve.,39
362,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Appointment s have been made in defiance of the Commissioner's recommendation.,39
363,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Yes . One Minister in particular persisted in his recommendations, and almost made himself offensive to the Commissioner in pressing the appointment of officers-as for instance, in pressing the appointment of an officer of the Post Office to be Assistant Secretary to the Department with a view of making him Secretary in the future. These are interferences with the work of the Commissioner that have occurred quite recently. I know of a great number of cases where appointments have been 'made upon the recommendation of Ministersrecommendations that juniors should be promoted over the heads of seniors who have served a long time. It was a feature of the Public Service Act that was thought to be an improvement upon the old system that merit was to have consideration over long service. But if that principle is to - enforced generally, I can see that it will conduce to a state of affairs as corrupt as was theioid system. The head of the Department, having recommended a junior for an appointment as being a more efficient officer than certain seniors, the effect can only be to cause dissatisfaction to men who have, perhaps, been in the service for a very much longer period. Some time ago I brought under the notice of the House a case in Sydney, which was a public scandal. It has not been remedied. I know of other cases where officers have been twenty and twenty-five years in the service and comparatively junior officers have been put over, their heads at higher remuneration. These are great hardships. The tendency on the part of honourable members is, I think, in the direction of putting the service under a responsible Minister. by so doing, we should simply have made political appointments similar to those which were formerly made. That would simply be going from bad to worse. At present an officer can appeal against the appointment of a person over his head. An officer in another State can appeal against the appointment of an officer, say, in Victoria, to a position for which he thinks he is qualified. I think that is a good system. The expense of hearing a case of the kind is a mere bagatelle in comparison to the injury done to the service if another officer is wronged, and has no right of appeal. I cannot imagine what the Minister is thinking of in objecting to such an alteration of the present system as is now proposed. At the present time Ministers exercise a great deal of influence. When 1 first became a member of Parliament I received a number of letters asking me to use my influence with the Minister. understood that a member of Parliament had not a right to be heard in such matters. I mentioned this opinion to the head of one of the Departments, and he said to me, "" Oh, you are mistaken; on this very matter we have already had half-adozen gentlemen here using their influence.""",39
364,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Probably that was before the Public Service Commissioner was appointed.,40
365,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"It was. 1I have never been to the Public Service Commissioner since he was appointed, nor have I been to the head of any Department be to promote the interests of any officer of the service.",40
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The honourable member does not understand how to do it. Honourable members opposite know how these things are done.,40
367,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I frequently do this: If an officer has a case and states it to me, I send on his letter without comment. I believe that a public servent who writes to a member of Parliament concerning his position in the service is liable to a penalty under the Act. If he writes to a member he does so at his own risk. I fail to find anything unreasonable in the proposal that a Board shall be appointed to hear appeals by public servants who consider they have been unfairly treated.",40
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"But an appellant might be in a remote part of the country But and, in such cases, these Boards might involve great cost.",40
369,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Perhaps so, but members of the service would know that they would have to make out a good case, and would not rashly appeal. They would know that they must speak at once or for ever hold their peace. This Bill will give general satisfaction in the service, and, if carried, will protect the Commissioner from disagreeable insinuations of the kind that have been made in regard to him. The Public Service Commissioner is a most efficient officer. He stood high in the service in New South Wales, and, before he was selected for his present position, I do not think any one heard a public servant speak ill of him. As it is, many are dissatisfied because they imagine that they are not advanced in the service as they ought to be. That, after all, is only human nature. I believe that the Commissioner I does his work fearlessly and well, but I do not think he does it so well as it would be done if he had the assistance of the proposed' Board of three members, to deal with malcontents. Ninety-five per cent, of those who complain ought not to be in the service. The honourable member for South Melbourne said, on one occasion, that a public servant who considered he was overlooked would be justified in not doing his best.",40
370,Mr MATHEWS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I did not sav that.,41
371,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If I ""have misrepresented the honourable member, I withdraw the statement. I have only to say, in conclusion, that this Bill will, in my opinion, provide a remedy for many troubles, and that I hope it will be carried.",41
372,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Cook) [6.9] - I fully agree with the concluding remark made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it is of the utmost importance that there should be contentment in the Public Service. As to the interjection made by the honourable member for Parramatta that it might be necessary under this Bill to constitute fifty Boards of Appeal, I would reply that it would be far better to have even fifty Boards .appointed to deal with the grievances of the public servants, than to have a dissatisfied arid, consequently, an inefficient service. The loss that must accrue to the Commonwealth from a service performed without that heartiness which should characterize it be far greater than would be the cost these Boards of Appeal. I was very much disappointed at the attitude taken up by of that Board. the Government in regard to this measure. The Minister representing the Home Affairs had his case in opposition to it prepared before the honourable member for West Sydney moved the second reading of the Bill. He entered the House preI pared on behalf of the Cabinet to oppose it without hearing the reasons adduced support of it by the honourable member repellant sponsible for its introduction. The vernment would have been better advised had they refrained from determining what their attitude should be until the reasons given for the proposed amendment of principal Act had been put before the House. There was, however, a little gleam of hope in the concluding remark of the Minister when, in referring to the able member for West Sydney, he said, "" If he can substitute a better proposition, or can advise the Government of a better constitution of Boards of Appeal than present one, or that contained in the every consideration will be given to it I find that the order of leave is wide enough to permit of any amendment that may 'be desired in respect of the Public Service Act. If the Government object to the appointment of a State Judge as chairman of the Board, it will be open for us to so amend the Bill in Committee as to provide for the appointment of - some other authority. Like the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I am not entirely in agreement with the provisions of this Bill. To my mind, it touches only the fringe of. the reforms necessary, and might well be carried' a good deal further. ""Under the principal Act, we have what are called Boards of Inquiry, and also Appeal Boards. The Boards of Inquiry deal with, all matters of discipline, and the Appeal Boards deal with questions of promotion, and advancement in the Service. Just as strong objections can be urged against the system of Inquiry Boards to deal with questions of discipline as can be levelled against the provisions of the Act relating to ""Appeal Boards. I hope to be able later on to present a scheme relating to appeals generally that will be an important improvement on that which is already provided for in the Act.",41
373,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,What is wrong with that part of the Act?,41
374,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"A great deal. must For instance, an officer who asks to have of his case heard by a Board of Inquiry has no voice in determining the constitution",41
375,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,He can be repreMinister of sented by counsel.,41
376,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"What advantage would he gain by being represented by counsel, if the Board itself were hpstile? do not suggest that such a Board would necessarily be hostile to the appellant. in The point I wish to make is that the aphas no voice in the selection of any Goof the three members of the Board. A little while ago, an officer who had been dismissed from the Service presented to me affidavits which appeared to show that the he had beenunjustly retired. I asked that his case should be reopened, and, in order that I should be absolutely satisfied of the guilt or innocence of the officer honorconcerned, I represented him at the inquiry. The facts adduced before ""the Board were such as to raise in my mind a doubt as to whether he had been unfairly the treated, and I am unable to say that he Bill, was. I found, however, that one of the . "" members of the Board was an officer who. after serving for three years on the Appeal Board as the elected representative of the employees, was defeated by an overwhelming majority in seeking re-election. The employees absolutely repudiated him, showing by their votes that they had no confidence in him. Nevertheless, he was selected as a member of the Board of Inquiry in the case to which I have referred. I have worked amongst public servants for manv years, and have been for five years the representative of 5,000 raihvay men, appearing week after week before Appeal Boards, but I have never heard of a more outrageous proceeding than this. It seems to me to be an outrage that a mian who has forfeited the confidence of his fellow employees as a member of an Appeal Board; and who has been rejected by them on seeking re-election to that position, should be chosen as a member of a Board of Inquiryappointed to deal with trie case of a man who had been dismissed from the Service.",41
377,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Hi s fellow employees may not have lost confidence in him. Perhaps they simply had a greater liking for the other candidate.,42
378,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"On e could almost count on one's fingers the number of votes that he secured when he sought re-election to the Appeal Board as the representative of the employee's. That should be sufficient to show that he had lost the confidence of those whom he had previously represented. Mr HENRY WILLI S - Perhaps his friends thought he was safe, and refrained from voting. Mx. J. H . CATTS - Nothin g of the kind. When postal employees are called upon to elect a representative on such a Board, they vote fairly well up to their full strength.",42
379,Mr JOHNSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I do not think that he gave satisfaction in the other capacity.,42
380,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"He did not. Nothing tends more than does an act of that kind to destroy the confidence of the men in the Board. I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not desire any one to think that I have any complaint to make against this gentleman or that I know anything against him. Whenever I met him he acted as a gentleman, and so far as I could see he acted fairly. My complaint is not against him, but against a system which permits a man who has just been defeated as the employees' representative on the Board of Appeal to be selected as the departmental representative on a Board of Inquiry.",42
381,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Surely the honourable member does not wish the men to pick the representative on each side !,42
382,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If the honourable member cannot understand the injustice I complain of, I do not think that it is worthwhile for me to labour the matter.",42
383,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,But the honourable member is assuming he had been unjust.,42
384,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,He had lost the confidence of the men who previously had elected him to the Appeal Board and nothing could more effectually destroy their confidence than for the Commissioner to select him as the departmental representative.,42
385,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Perhaps he had given cases against them.,42
386,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"A man may get soured after he is defeated at an election. I am not urging anything against the man. I do not know anything against him. So far as I know, he is a very fair man.",42
387,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Well , what is the matter ?",42
388,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I am not speaking of the man personally. I now come to another matter. The Parliament deliberately enacted section 50 of the Act, which gives the right of appeal to the officers of the Department, and which saysAny officer (except officers of the Parliament) affected by any report or recommendation made or action taken under this Act other than a report or recommendation made or action taken under sections 31, 46 to 49 inclusive, 65, 66, and 73 thereof may. Those sections do not apply to advancement in the service. Section 31 enables a special appointment to be made by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. Sections 46 to 49 refer to matters of discipline and offences which are dealt with by a Board of Inquiry. Section 65 relates to questions of incompetency and provides for a reference to a Board of Inquiry. Section 66 deals with acts of bankruptcy on the part of officers, while section 73 relates to the retirement of officers at the age of sixty years. Those are the provisions of the Act which are exempted from the operation of section 50; but otherwise that section says that in all cases any officer, except an officer of the Parliament, shall have the right of appeal to an Appeal Board. For the last eighteen months in New South Wales, although there have been hundreds of grievances under section 50, the Commissioner has prevented every one of those cases from being referred to the Appeal Board.",42
389,Mr MCDONALD,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,How did he manage that?,43
390,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I will show the honourable member how the thing is worked. Section 50 concludes with this provisionProvided that in the case of reports or recommendations made by the Commissioner to the Governor General all such appeals must be taken before the reports and recommendations are dealt with by the Governor General under ""the provisions of this Act. Before the officers of the Department can obtain any information a matter is dealt with by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Commissioner, and the decision is gazetted, and then an officer is told that no appeal lies against that act.",43
391,Mr HUGHES,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,That section acts as a prohibition.,43
392,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Exactly . The latter part of the section was never intended to be used to prevent officers from appealing as provided in the first part of the section.,43
393,Mr MCDONALD,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Does the honourable member suggest that the Government uphold that sort of thing?,43
394,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"When it is pointed out to them they take no action, so that they must uphold it. It is a scandal that the Commissioner should be allowed to act in that way while, this section of the Act gives the right of appeal to the officers of the Departments. It is a scandal that when officers think that^they are unjustlytreated, a technical method is found to prevent them from exercising the right which Parliament deliberately extended to them. I hope that the Minister will deal with that point when he is replying.",43
395,Mr HUME COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I have no right of reply.,43
396,Mr JH CATTS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,It is very lamentable that the Minister spoke immediately after the second reading of the Bill was moved.,43
397,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,There reason why another Minister should not speak.,43

404,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If the honourable member for Wentworth were always as free to voice his opinions as I am, he would occupy an exceedingly pleasant position. It was by my own choice that I remained silent during the recent no-confidence debate, and I can make that statement with the greater satisfaction, because, in my opinion, good service was rendered to the people of this country by the members of the Labour Party maintaining a policy of silence.",43
405,The CHAIRMAN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Will the honourable member confine himself to the matter under consideration ?,43
406,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Wit h all due respect to the Chair, I say that the imputation which the honourable member for Wentworth sought to convey must be refuted. I think that every honourable member will rejoice in the general prosperity of the Commonwealth, as disclosed in the Treasurer's Budget. We are all exceedingly gratified to learn that the country has made substantial advance, both so far as its natural productsand its secondary industries are concerned. I believe that by careful administration on the part of the Comis no monwealth and the States Governments much can be done to insure a continuance of that prosperity. But if there is one thing more than another which members of the Labour Party desire, it is that in seasons of abundant prosperity the lot of the toilers shall be materially improved. Notwithstanding that the States Treasurers, in common with the Federal Treasurer, haVe stated in their Budgets that during the past few years the revenue has ""been exceedingly buoyant, we hear, from - day to day, the old cry that a number of honest, upright, respectable citizens experience the greatest difficulty in getting an opportunity to earn their bread.",43
407,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Does not the honourable member think that that will always be the case?,44
408,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"T do not. If it were beyond human wit to solve this difficultyit would be an argument in favour of the abolition of responsible government. It is true that there may be persons who cannot reasonably hope to secure employment, but the time has certainly arrived when the Governments of this country, without undertaking too much in the nature of parental guidance, should pursue a policy which will afford everybody an opportunity to earn a livelihood. It is the duty of our Governments to provide every person who desires to pursue a lawful occupation with an opportunity to do so.",44
409,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Does not that opportunity exist ?,44
410,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"No . Apart from land monopoly, which admittedly exists, industrial monopolies are displacing, and will continue to displace, labour.",44
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Without that there is nothing wrong in the existing condition of affairs, does the! honourable member really think that things are worse now than they have been?",44
412,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I hope not. My reply to that very pertinent question is that if. during years of prosperity, things were worse than they have been, it would be a charge against us which ought to lead to our dismissal. It would be an argument in favour of the entire abolition of Governments.",44
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The member misses my point.,44
414,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If we can lemedy the position, why not provide thosa who are unemployed with work?",44
415,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,What I think would prove a partial remedy is,44
416,Mr KELLY,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Socialism .,44
417,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I think that Socialism is most popular in this country. Treasurer himself has, I think', raised that question, because in his Budget he said that we nowpossessed a Commonwealth trawler which had' been built in a socialistic dockyard, and which had been constructed cheaper and better than it could have been constructed by private enterprise. I am confirmed in my belief that Socialism has come to stay by reference to a memorable correspondence which passed between the leader of the Opposition and another gentleman occupying a seat in this House. .",44
418,The CHAIRMAN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Order . I must point out to the honourable member that the financial question is under consideration, and not the question of Socialism.",44
419,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"W it h all due respect, I say that if upon a question of this kind I cannot discuss an aspect of political differences, I shall not debate the item at all. I make no reflection upon the Chair, but if my remarks are to be limited in the way that your ruling suggests, it will be impossible for me to sav what I desire to say.",44
420,The CHAIRMAN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I would point out that we are now dealing with the finances of the Commonwealth. If the honourable member is going to enter into a general discussion upon Socialism, he must see that he wi]l get right off the financial question.",44
421,Mr WATSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Upon a point of order, I desire to know whether it has_not been the practice to allow the debate on the first item of the Estimates to cover the whole range of governmental policy, and whatever may be involved in it? If that practice is saying departed from, we shall not be afforded an opportunity to discuss the policy which is involved in the financial proposals. It seems to me that your ruling will restrict debate in a way in which it has not hitherto been restricted.",44
422,The CHAIRMAN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The widest latitude is given to honourable members in discussing all matters embraced in the policy of the Government as disclosed in the Budget.,44
423,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"1 do not wish tojxime into conflict with your ruling, but my own honourable view is that under it we shall have no more right to discuss the Government policy than we have to debate the socialistic basis of that policy. In other words, my remarks must be limited to the question of whether the Treasurer has spent sixpence too much in one direction, or sixpence too little in another, and whether in so doing he has exhibited too socialistic or too individualistic The a tendency. But I now wish to deal with a more important matter.",44
424,Mr JOHNSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"More important?""",44
425,The CHAIRMAN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I would point out that if honourable members will continually interject, it will be impossible for the honourable member for Wide Bay to continue his speech. I must therefore ask honourable members to refrain from interjecting.",44
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I rise to a point of order-in fact, I wish to dissent from your ruling. That ruling is so important that I do not think it ought to be allowed to pass unchallenged. I hand in my motion of dissent.",45
427,The CHAIRMAN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The honourable member for Parramatta moves to dissent from my ruling in the following termsI move to disagree with Mr MCDonald's ruling to the effect that the questions ism and unemployment may not be discussed in a general Budget debate. I must point out to the honourable member that I did not prevent the honourable member for Wide Bay from discussing the unemployed question. What I say-and I wish to impress this upon the Committee '-is that, first of all, when the House met, a motion was submitted for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and on that, motion the whole policy and administration of the Government were open to discussion, but that when the House goes into Committee of Supply, and the Budget has been delivered, it is then open for any honourable member to discuss any question that may arise regarding the Government and tfaeir administration so far as the finances are concerned.",45
428,Mr WATSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Are we confined to the discussion of finance only ?,45
429,The CHAIRMAN,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Well , the general policy of the Government. What led up to my ruling was this: The honourable member for Wentworth interjected, when the honourable member for Wide Bay was speaking, some remark about Socialism, which is a broad question without any very definite limits, and the honourable member for Wide Bay began an academic discus sion of a matter that seemed to be quite foreign to the Treasurer's financial statement. In those circumstances I asked the honourable member to connect his speech in some way with the matter before the Committee. I did not, and do not, desire to restrict legitimate discussion, but there must be a rule to confine honourable members in some measure to the subject before the Chair.",45
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I have no wish to press the matter further than to say that your statement, sir, clears the ground very much. As I understood it, the honourable member for Wide Bay was proceeding to refer to the construction of a trawler, which is provided for in the Estimates. It occurred to me that that was a matter we might legitimately discuss. I venture to. submit with the greatest deference that the whole question of private versus Government employment, and that, broadly, is Socialism, may be, perhaps, more properly than any other question discussed in connection with the Estimates. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is the basis of finance.",45
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Exactly . of Social- - The CHAIRMAN - Is the honourable member dealing with the point of order?,45
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I am dealing with the motion which I have handed in. As a matter of fact, we are engaged now in the consideration of Estimates",45
433,Mr CHANTER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I rise to order. Do not the Standing Orders provide that, if vour ruling is to be questioned, action must be taken at once? In this case the honourable member for Parramatta did not raise the point until after the honourable member for Wide Bay had resumed his speech.",45
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I withdraw the whole objection. It is not worth continuing the discussion, particularlv now that the point is made clear.",45
435,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"My wish was to discuss a most important subject that_is interesting people in every part of the world, and receiving the attention, not only of those who are looking after our material welfare in this world, but of those who are concerned with our welfare when we are no longer here. It is a subject of interest to the most learned men in the world, to the leaders of advanced thought, and also to the man in the street, but it will be quite sufficient for me to discuss our own little attempts at concerted social action by drawing clear attention to a matter that : was discussed in this Parliament earlier, and in regard to which I regret that our best efforts to assist the employees engaged in certain industries in Australia, have not been successful. I refer to our endeavour in 1906 to discover a method whereby we could assure to the employees in those industries the receipt of fair and reasonable remuneration for their labour. No honourable member of this House, and no honest member of the community, can feel anything but the deepest regret at the failure of our attempt to assure to the employees in the harvester and other industries the remuneration that a Judge of the Arbitration Court considered that they were entitled to.",45
436,Mr JOHNSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Protectio n was going to secure that before, so you always told us.",45
437,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Protectio n never did so.,46
438,Mr JOHNSON,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"You always said it did - by "" you,"" I do not mean the honourable member individually.",46
439,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The honourable member is entirely in error. He knows that I never said that protection could assure to the workmen fair and reasonable conditions oflabour. I have never been so foolish as to believe that it would, and that is why the Labour Party, from the beginning, declared that protection was not a solution of this social problem. That is why the one party that came to this Parliament with no definite fiscal policy to provide a cure, asserted that neither free trade nor protection would protect the worker, and put forward the new policy that wherever protection is given to the employer, It shall be accompanied by assured protection to the employee.",46
440,Mr FULLER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,And what about the consuming public?,46
441,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The consuming public will have a share of the benefit. As an illustration, let me refer the honourable member for Illawarra to the Newport workshops, which are a State socialistic stitution. I am glad the honourable member for Flinders is present, for he can confirm what I say. The evidence given before two select Committees and one Royal Commission in Victoria, showed that every equipment for .the railway service could be produced at those workshops 21 per cent, cheaper than they could be bought from a private firm. I think the honourable member for Flinders will agree with me there.",46
442,Mr WH IRVINE,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I believe that locomotives are produced there as cheaply as they coulcl be obtained elsewhere.,46
443,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The report-the second - that I read, was to the effect that there was a saving of 21 per cent. There we have a State monopoly where the workmen get better wages, the apprentices are better paid, the conditions of labour are better than those offered by outside u^rms, and yet an article can be turned out there for the rest of the people-the consumers - ra t ai cheaper rate than is charged by private enterprise. Why, if the workmen have improved conditions in every way, and the consumer gets the article cheaper, should we be afraid to give that advantage to the people? Why should we fear to take steps to provide better conditions of employment and at the same time a cheaper article for the general public? [54] Even taking the statement of the honourable member for Flinders, that the article is produced at as low a price as that ai which it can be obtained elsewhere",46
444,Mr CHANTER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The same thing now applies in the case of the Sydney railway workshops.,46
445,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"It applies all round but I shall not confine myself even toP those illustrations to prove the fact. Theemployers approached the Government in 1906, and said, "" Give us a monopoly of the production of a particulararticle, and we assure you that we will pay better wages to the workmen and give: goods of the same quality to the consumers at cheaper rates than - they are paying now.""",46
446,Mr FULLER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,That was proved to be all humbug.,46
447,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"That was their sworn evidence before the Commission, of which the honourable gentleman was a member. If we cannot accept their sworn statements, we must brand them all as liars. There is no half-way term to describe men who in- will swear again and again in cross-examination that they can and will do certain things, and give details showing why they can do them, and then fail to keep their word. If they are swearing falsely no credence can be given to them at all.",46
448,Mr FULLER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The honourable member knows that they have not done what they promised.,46
449,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"The fact . that they have not done it is no proof that they cannot do it. We have found to our cost that the very desire of this Parliament to assist those manufacturers has permitted them to use the most contemptible means to deprive, the workmen of their just rights. They came pleading to the Government for assistance, saying, "" If you do not give us protection from capitalistic competition from abroad our industries will be destroyed."" I am not here to challenge that statement, for I believe there was a. good deal of truth in it. They said, "" It is not we alone that will suffer, for our workmen will suffer also if our industries are destroyed."" The Government therefore submitted their statement to Parliament, and Parliament agreed to give protection to the MCKay Harvester Company and all the others engaged in similar industries. All that they asked for was given, and all that we asked in return was that the workmen should be paid the wages and granted the conditions to be prescribed by a Judge sitting in an Arbitration Court. We imposed also a condition that the consumer was to be protected by the machines being sold at a price lower than that then existing.",46
450,Mr FULLER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,Has that been done?,47
451,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"I understand that that question is in dispute. But as regaids the contract with the employees, there is no attempt to keep the promise. Why? Because we have not the power to enforce it. This shows clearly that commercialism has no conscience whatever.",47
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"As a matter of fact, honourable members opposite believed for twelve months that they had the power, and yet did nothing.",47
453,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"A great authority has said that for 300 per cent, commercial people would commit murder. This case has almost proved it . It was no mean authority that made that statement. I do not go so far as to say that it is true; but what description can we apply to a firm or body who would get all the protection that they wanted against capitalists abroad, and then say to the men who had only a few shillings, or perhaps a week's rations, between them and starvation, I 1 1 decline to give you any protection at all ; I am protected from my capitalistic competitors, and you can fight for the merest pittance; I do not want you; fight with your fellow man for this job?""",47
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"On e of the theories of the protectionists is that protection cheapens goods, and so brings down market. prices.",47
455,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"If I feel warmly this matter, it is because I think a great injustice has been done. I admit at once that it was with the desire to save the manufacturers that we enabled them to get tration Courts. off so lightly. We could, in my opinionspeaking as a layman-hav e imposed Exprior cise duties, and paid the money back in the shape of a bounty to those manufacturers who paid fair and reasonable wages, and our Constitution would have enabled us 1 enforcethe law. But we did not desire that manufacturers should have their capiis tal tied up, and we therefore left the legal position weak so that emJustice ployers were able to take advantage of it. I wish to say again to the He Government, as regards the agricultural implement makers of Victoria, that only due to them that they should be imbursed their expenses. They were doing the Federal Government's work in fighting this case. While I lay down no general principle, I do think that we ought at least to recompense the union for their expenditure.",47
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,The honourable member is only firing off a little blunderbuss.,47
457,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,I hope that the honourable member who interjects is not above .taking notice of the concerns of the employees of this country.,47

465,Mr FRAZER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,We are generally loose when we want to be.,47
466,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,In my opinion we have a new charter regarding the remuneration of the employees of this country. Hitherto the idea has been that the employee was only to be paid what he could get in the scramble for work in the open competitive,47

470,Mr FISHER,CONTRAC TIMMIGRANTSACT,"Arbitration Courts to the establishment of the Commonwealth Court had their severe limitations. But we now have a decision' from Mr Justice Higgins which places the position of to the workman on a different footing. He has laid down the basis of the reward that to be paid to employees engaged.in an industry of this kind. It is not, with Mr. Higgins, a question of whether the industry can pay a certain wage or not. has laid it down, absolutely irrespective of whether the industry will be a payit is ing one or not, that the workmen reare to receive certain rates of wages. He has enunciated that principle in words that will live and that are logical. Mr Justice Higgins used this languageThe provision for fair and reasonable remark. muneration is obviously designed for the benefit of the employees in the industry; and it must be meant to secure to them which they cannot get by the' ordinary system of individual bargaining with employers. If Parliament meant that the conditions shall as they can get by individual bargaining-i 'it meant that those conditions and reasonable, which employees will accept and employers will give, in contracts of servicethere would have been no need for this provision. The remuneration could safely have been left to the usual, but unequal, contest, "" higgling o i the market"" for labour, with pressure for bread on one side and the pressure for profits on the other. The standard "" fair and reasonable "" must therefore be thing else; and I cannot think standard appropriate than the normal needs of the average employ^, regarded as a human being living in a civilized community.

484,Mr WH IRVINE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Is there anything in Mr Justice Higgins' judgment which suggests that any of those considerationsare taken into account in his estimate of "" normal needs "" ? Part IX - Overtime - Mr FISHER - That question was not suggested to Mr Justice Higgins; but in the course of the evidence given it was pointed - out that a skilled artisan might, have to undergo an apprenticeship of five or six years. During that time his parentswould have to draw on their capital, or might have to borrow money to enable himto acquire the special skill ""needful in histrade.

488,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"That is a question of - evidence which might well be argued before the High Court. I come back to the point perly protected. that this is the first occasion on which such a judgment has been given. Wages Boards all declare that this trade or that shall pay certain wages, and the judgment of the High Court is that there are normal needs of a person living in a civilized community, and that, if an industry cannot pay sufficated were asked. cient to satisfv those needs, it is an try that should have no existence in tralia.

At the same time, however, workers are paid a mere pittance in cerobserved tain industries. I should like here .to again call attention to the treatment that was meted out to a lady who called into the witness box the other day. to account for the pittance she earned a protected industry. One of the barrisbuttressed ters engaged in the case asked the what she paid for the jacket she was wearing. Could anything be more mean and no cure. contemptible?

What I am most concerned about is that honourable members shall agree to make provision for a referendum enabling the people to decide this question for themselves. whatever views they may hold upon the question, they will not take any action which would debar the people from an opportunity of saying whether they believe in the suggested' amendment of the Constitution or not. I go so far in the matter as to say that even if I were opposed to an amendment of the Constitution to confer upon this Parliament larger powers in the matter of industrial legislation, I should still be prepared to have the question submitted to the people for their decision. In my opinion, it would be a serious thing to deny the people an opportunity to express their opinion on this question. no doubt that honourable members will exercise their rights as representatives of the people, in deciding the form which the question to be submitted at. the referendum shall take. The matter having gone so far, I trust it will be given the serious and fair consideration, which may be expected from any Parliament constituted as this Parliament is. Dealing with the defence proposals of the Government, and especially on the naval side, I wish to congratulate them upon coming round to the views submitted in 1902 by my distinguished predecessor in the position of leader of the Labour Party, the honourable member for South Sydney.",52

529,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"At the moment, I am not concerned about the kind of boats we are to obtain for our naval defence, so much as to publicly recognise the policy advocated by the honourable member for South Sydney, at a time when it was not at all popular, and was, in fact, quite out of touch with the gei.eral feeling in this House ro say that Australia ought to have her own navy. The honourable member spoke as the leader of a party that declared that the Naval Subsidy was no help to Great Britain at all. That expression, of opinion was at the time considered disloyal, and it was held that the suggestion, was made from disloval motives.",52

If I were to permit honourable members to deal at length with the question ,of naval defence during this debate, it would follow ; hat no matter what business appeared on *.he notice-paper, the discussion of it in detail might be anticipated. I submit that under the Standing Orders, while a general reference may be made to the question of naval defence, it is not competent for honourable members, in this debate, to go beyond such a general reference in dealing with the subject.",52

I do not disagree - with the ruling which you have given, in view of he terms of the Standing Orders under which we are at present working. But I propose to take action in this matter in urder to emphasize the necessity of some .alteration of the standing order on which your ruling is based. I can best achieve my object, I think, by giving my reasons ('or dissenting from that ruling. If it is to hold good, honourable members must see that it would be quite possible, at any time, for any member of the House, for the Government, or for any member put up by the Government, to put a motion on the paper dealing with any question, of importance, the early discussion of which might lie inconvenient, and then, by raising a technical point of order, founded upon the fact that such a motion appeared on the 'nisiness-paper, prevent the discussion of the particular subject with which it dealt. That, it will be seen, would lead to a state of affairs that would be intolerable in a free Parliament. I have not a shadow of - doubt that your ruling is given in accordance with the incomplete and very undesirable Standing Orders under which we are working.

541,Mr DEAKIN,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"It may be my misfortune, but at present T. am unable to see that there is any real conflict. If . I may be pardoned for saying so, the purpose of the amendment on the paper in the name of the honourable member for Flinders is perfectly clear. It is that we should not discuss land defence until we have determined our naval policy. It might be any kind of naval policy, and it relates only to the order in which the two questions must be considered. The honourable member proposes that we consider the naval policy first, and then the military policy of universal service. I think the honourable member for Wide Bay would at once accept that as a warning that he should not discuss the question of whether the naval policy should be considered before the question of universal training, or whether universal training sliould be considered before the question of naval defence. So far as I heard the honourable member's remarks, they did not trench upon any such question. I understood him to be commending previous proposals in relation to naval defence, made by the honourable member for Southi Sydney when at the head of a Government of which he and the honourable member for Wide Bay were both members.",53

548,Mr WH IRVINE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I agree with what the Prime Minister has said as to the general character of the. amendment standing on the notice-paper in my name; but, although I think that we should try to find a way out of the difficulty, it does not seem to me that he has shown us one. A similar question arose earlier in the evening. The broad principle involved is whether, in the Budget debate, a member should be confined within the narrow limits which you, Mr Chairman, have indicated. Standing order 274, which applies to proceedings both in the House and in Committee, saysNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion.",54
549,Mr DEAKIN,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,That would be hard to enforce.,54
550,Mr WH IRVINE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"It must be considered a counsel of perfection rather than a hard and fast rule, and in the Budget debate must be applied with the utmost laxity, honourable members being left perfectly free to deal with the principles and policy of every political party. This freedom has led, and may lead to long debates; but it is the inherent right of any member during the discussion of the Budget. Therefore, I think the leader of the Labour Party was justified in asking for the decision of the Committee for f u ture guidance. We should settle whether we are to have the fullest liberty in the discussion of the Budget to deal with every question of policy in all its aspects. To limit us would be to depart from the traditions of not only the House of Commons, but the Parliaments of the States, and from the practice of this Parliament. pre",54
551,Mr CHANTER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"There is a principle at stake in this discussion. The question which we are now asked to determine has cropped up previously, and has been ruled upon by other presiding officers, it having always been held here, as in the Parliaments ot the States, that, the Budget debate being practically a discussion of grievances, differs from all others in that those taking part in it may discuss in the not freest manner possible every question of policy involved in the proposals of the Government. It is true that if the Standing Orders were strictly applied this would not be possible, and the Budget debate would have to be very soon brought to an end, because so many questions have been anticipated by proposals on the notice-paper. But the practice has been to allow the widest latitude, other Chairmen', and even Mr. Speaker, having held that the fullest liberty must be conceded to every speaker. - On Tuesday last the honourable member for Corio took exception to the precedence given to a motion of no confidence, and his point, that precedence should not have been given, would have been incontrovertible, bad the matter to be determined only by reference to the Standing Orders. But Mr Speaker ruled, as I think you, sir, will rule now. that the usage of Parliament must also be considered. The Standing Orders provide certain rules for the conduct of debates : but if they were administered with absolute strictness, they would prove unworkable. There must be exceptions, of which the Budget debate and motions challenging the existence of a Government afford examness ples. According to the usage of Parliaunder ment, members, when the Budget is being discussed, must have the freest opportunity to deal with all questions of policy, and believe that you, sir, will regard it as your duty to rule that that is so.",54

553,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I suggest, Mr Chairman, that in accordance with what is evidently the desire of the Committee, you should allow the scope of the debate to be widened.

The then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, had just returned from Great Britain, with honours thick upon him, bringing with him an agreeThe ment-mad e against the express direction of this Parliament, that he was not to bind it to any contract-by which the Comin our waters. monwealth undertook to contribute a certain sum per annum to the cost of the Brisentiment tish Squadron on the Australian station. that way.

It is true that there a division of opinion on the point, but it there. is equally true, I think, that it was largely jingoistic utterance. out of courtesy to Sir Edmund Barton that his policy was carried into effect. It was thought too, by many honourable members, that since the agreement had been entered into by him on behalf of the Commonand wealth, the honour of Parliament was more or less at stake. If the policy advocated at that time by the honourable member South Sydney, who was the leader of our pa/rty, had then been adopted, we might will now be taken up. have had a little navy of our own ""to the great American Fleet which recently sailed into our waters.

I can say that the more freely, beto cause I have never agreed with those who have stated that the Australian Squadron is sent here by Great Britain must I do not think that honourable members could adopt a more mistaken attitude than to say that any warships belonging to Great Britain should lie here if they were needed at any other place.

It is incumbent upon this Parliament to insure the one as much as - the other. Our duty is to develop the youth of the Commonwealth phvsically, morally, and mentally. No doubt, legal members may say that our right to take that step is doubtful; but as a layman, I think that if we have the power to say that our youth must be trained physically for military purposes, it would be an anomaly if we had not the right to say that there should also be medical instructors and inspectors of our youth.

563,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I know that an attempt has been made outside to create an antagonistic State feeling against the Commonwealth. I have no fear of that feeling being developed very much. It might possibly succeed in its object at one election. But I am so convinced that a national sentiment has taken possession of young Australia that national ideals in this Parliament would only get a spasmodic set back. I do not fear the ultimate result. If there is to be a fight, let the other side come into the open-let the facts of the case be placed before the people. If it is desired to curb the development of national sentiment, to limit the power of this Parliament tocontrol the national destinies, to restrict the powers which are absolutely necessary to a nation, the case should be clearly stated, and the people should declare their will at the ballot-box. ""Under the Constitution they possess the right to dissolve this Federation. Perhaps two referendums would be needed. But the power to do it exists. I do not believe, however, that a single person claiming to be a statesman thinks that that result is ever likely to be brought about. Therefore, believing that the interests of the people can be besfi safeguarded by the actions of this national Parliament, we ought to express here broad general views, and take the consequences at the hands b f those who may differ from us. I desire to refer very briefly to the effect which the operation of the sugar Excise and the sugar bounty have had upon Federal finance. From time to time the State Treasurers Iiave complained of the Federal Treasurer not having returned to them sufficient revenue. They are nOvv complaining of the operation of the 1 Surplus Revenue Act, which was declared by the High Court to be constitutional. It empowers the Treasurer to retain one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise for necessary purposes, either immediate or future. What is not so clear to honourable members, however, is that the principal object of the Excise duty on sugar was not to bring, in revenue at all, but to insure to those Avho produced sugar by white labour a higher protection than to those who used coloured labour for that purpose. When it was imposed, the contest between the two parties was clear. One party claimed that owing to physical causes, and not to economic causes at all, white men could not produce sugar underany conditions. To prove that my statement is correct, I desire to quote a number of resolutions which were affirmed by the Pioneer Farmers' Association, Mackay, at the time thi* legislation was under review. For twentyyears previously the Labour Party in the Queensland Parliament had contended that under fair conditions, and granted fair remuneration, the white man could ' produce sugar in any part of Australia as successfully as could the coloured man. Our opponents, on the contrary, had maintained that white men were incapable of working in the canefields. The resolutions adopted by' the Pioneer Farmers' Association, Mackay, when Mr Barton, as Prime Minister, introduced the Pacific Island Labourers Bill , providing for the deportation of the Kanakas, and indicated the Excise and bounty provisions which have since been applied to the sugar industry- ",57
564,Mr GROOM,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,That was in 1901.,58
565,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The pamphlet from which I am quoting is entitled The Voice of Queensland Agricultural Societies, and is dated Brisbane, 1901. The resolutions which it contains provide as much amusement as would a comic opera, but I shall content myself with quoting those adopted by the Pioneer Farmers' Association, Mackay, which are typical of many others. They are as follow :1. That this association, consisting principally of small cane farmers, after many attempts during the past ten years to grow sugar entirely with white labour, find it impossible to do so successfully because of physical causes, It is distinctly a climatic and not a financial, difficulty, and one which money cannot cope with. 2. The Kanaka Bill now before the Commonwealth Parliament will, if carried into effect, seriously diminish the production of sugar in Queens-land, and on a large portion of the NorthEast coast tliere is no other agricultural industry under such legislation that can take its place. 3. That the proposed legislation, if it becomes law, may benefit ^ few large mill-owners in the south of Queensland and New South Wales, while, at,the same time, ruining a small number of small growers in North Queensland, many of whom, in good faith, and on the understanding that there would be no sudden alteration in the existing labour conditions, and that Kanaka introduction would not be abolished until a sufficient substitute was provided mortgaged their homes as security for loans amounting to 500,000. This was expended in the erection of co-operative sugar mills. mills will now, in many cases, be worth scrap iron. 4. The association protests against the treating of the sugar, tariff, and labour questions as one, maintaining that they are all quite distinct. As the Queensland sugar industry employs some men at high wages, men of European race, numbering with dependents about 2S,ooo, besides affording a large market for southern manufacturers and producers, it also is exposed to the most severe competition of cane sugars grown and manufactured entirely with coloured labour, costing is. a day in Java and Mauritius, and fromEuropean beet sugar produced with labour costing is. and 2s. a day, and State subsidies by export bounties, it is most deserving of protection, apart from the fact that it also employs ,9,000 Kanakas. We also point out that under the Federal Tariff the cost of production will be considerably increased because of the new duties on imp'Iements and machinery. We also desire to have it clearly understood that the sugar industry in Queensland claims protection to counteract the bountyfed sugar and sugar produced wholly by cheap coloured labour, quite apart from the question of Kanaka labour. Resolutions 5, 6, 7, and 8 aTe couched in a similar strain. Honourable members will observe that the first resolution declares that it is a physical impossibility to successfully grow sugar with white labour, and that the difficulty is not a financial^ one. The third resolution affirms that the legislation, which the Commonwealth has since enacted, but which at the time was under review, would injure the sugar industry in the north, and benefit only a few large mill-owners in the south of Queensland and in New South Wales. It also affirmed that the co-operative sugar mills, upon the erection of which Â£1,500,000 had been expended, would be worth only scrap iron. It further alleged that the industry was entitled to protection, apaTt from the fact that it employed 9,000 Kanakas."""" In reply to these allegations, I invite honourable, members to look at the returns from the sugar industry today. The effect of seven years' experience of Commonwealth legislation has been to transform the position. One could forgive the cane-growers if they had proved to be wrong in only their first allegation, that it was physically impossible for white men to successfully produce sugar.' When the Excise upon that article was Â£ 3 per ton,' and the bounty only Â£ 2 per ton, the planters were not anxious to get rid of the Kanaka; but immediately the Excise was increased to Â£ 4 per ton, and the bounty to Â£ 3 per ton - whic h increase did not make a farthing's difference to the Commonwealth revenue, but merely penalized the employment of These coloured labour to the extent of another pound per ton- a great manv of the growers broke their agreements with the Kanakas. Some of them had previously declared that the Pacific Islanders were employed for the religious instruction and' benefit of the latter. But the moment it became profitable to get rid of them, these same planters had no hesitation in breaking their agreements. History has also demonstrated that the growers were absolutely wrong in affirming that as a result of Commonwealth legislation the industry would"" suffer in Queensland, whilst in New South Wales it would be benefited. But the fact is that sugar production in New South Wales is decreasing, whilst in Northern Queensland it is steadily increasing.",58
566,Mr JH CATTS,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,That is largely dueto the success of the dairy farming industry in Northern New South Wales.,58
567,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"It is immaterial what the cause may be. The Pioneer Farmers'' Association, Mackay, it will be noted, affirmed that the co-operative mills, in the erect-ion of which Â£1,500,000 had been expended, would, under Commonwealth legislation, be of value only as scrap iron. .1 recollect the occasion upon whicE then Treasurer of Queensland stated the Government had invested Â£500,000 those mills, and that they would be to sell their interest in them for half of amount. But today the Queensland vernment could recover every penny of money which they have so invested. Every one of these mills is paying, and the ability is that the Government coulrj back more than the amount which they expended upon them. It is abundantly clear that the growers honestly takenly feared that the legislation Parliament would result in the destruction of the sugar, industry. I have merely-cited the foregoing resolutions for the"" purpose of showing that a party which has a in which it believes ought not to be deterred from giving effect to that policy by the carrying of any number of adverse resomade lutions. When the Pacific Island Lathe bourers Bill was under consideration in this House, the whole of Queensland was aroused by our contemplated action. Both Houses of the Queensland Parliament adopted resolutions in opposition to legislation, and almost every agriculof tural association in that State did the same thing. This is the last occasion upon which I need mention the ter, and I have touched upon it only thoroughly for the purpose of showing what a transought, formation has taken place in the sugar industry during the past seven years. The production today is of greater value than it has .been at any previous time the whole history of the sugar industry. The Government, and especially those mema bers who were not connected with sugar districts, ought to be complimented and thanked for the manner in which they treated that great difficulty at that time. I wish to refer now to the effect legislation in that regard on the Commonwealth, finances. The Treasurer has stated emphatically that he intends to hold every penny of the .Commonwealth's one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. But literally, by. the Sugar Excise and Bounty Acts, he cannot hold the Commonwealth's full share. From the very initiation of that legislation, which was a superstructure to enable us to change the whole sugar dustry from a coloured to a white one, the Federal Treasury has been depleted by an excessive payment to the States. The illusTo tration that I have frequently given in the Mr Fisher. country, when debating the financial question, is this: If the ordinary revenue from the Customs and Excise was Â£8,000,000, that without any Sugar Excise or Bounty Act, in the Treasurer would have Â£2,000,000 to glad spend on Commonwealth services. But if that the Sugar Excise Act brought in Â£800,000, Goand the Treasurer had to pay out the Â£500,000 in sugar bounties, the Federal revenue would be depleted to the extent of prob- Â£300,000. That would occur in this get way:-Addin g to the Â£8,000,000 the have Sugar Excise revenue of Â£800,000 would make Â£8,800,000, one-quarter of which but miswould be Â£2,200,000, the Commonof this wealth's share. But out of that sum the Treasurer would have to pay Â£500,000 in sugar bounties, so reducing the Commonwealth's share of the net repolicy venue from Â£2,200,000 to Â£1,700,000. That has been going on all the time, and will continue until some rearrangement is of the Braddon section. I appreciate action of the Treasurer in submitting in his Budget a table to explain the matter, but it was well known previously to those who took an interest in the question. The fact, however, was one thjat I hesitated that personally to make too much of, because the dread of the effect which it might have on this Parliament until the "" white "" sugar industry had been established. Now, mathowever, that our policy has been established in that direction, we undoubtedly, to state more fully the whole of the facts as they affect the Commonwealth finances. If we could find a legal way to make the payments to the in growers "" by means of a rebate, or in any other way than by this superstructure of bounty to differentiate between black and white grown sugar, the Treasurer would have at once an immediate additional revenue of about Â£340,000. That would bea proper and legitimate amount for him to of our use for Federal purposes.",58
568,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The only point is that Queensland would lose some revenue.,59
569,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"All the States would lose revenue in proportion to their present receipts, but it must not be forgotten that our present legislation is only a means to establish the sugar industry on a proper basis, while it really deprives the Federal Government of a large amount of revenue in that legitimately belongs to it, and that would properly have been retained by it if we could have continued the rebate system. illustrate my point, if we applied, the . Excise and bounty principle to every protected industry, and if manufacturers who did not pay fair and reasonable wages were penalized, it would be quite possible, by that beneficent means, to deprive the Commonwealth practically of the whole of its revenue. That, of course, would be a financial absurdity. In this case we have had to take that means of doing the right thing, because we are "" cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd "" by the Constitution. If we had the original powers even of the smallest State we should not be in this culty, which will continue to embarrass us - during the next two or three years. I presume that we shall have to put up with it . Personally, apart altogether from the fact that Queensland is the great sugar-producing country, and that the difficulty was chiefly felt there, I feel that any price was cheap to get rid of the great coloured labour question. One has only to think of the trouble that the United States of America have had to bear in that regard to realise what a blessing it is that we are practicallyfree from the race problem. The emphatic declaration of the Federal Parliament in - its first session for a White Australia, and its readiness to pav for it , had a good effect, not only here, but throughout the world. I shall always feel proud of the action which Parliament took in that regard. If the Treasurer could retain the ,Â£340,000 which is now lost to the Commonwealth Treasury through the operation of the Sugar Excise and Bounty Acts, I should be able to say a great deal more pleasant, things to him than I am able to say now with regard to old-age pensions. When I had the honour of submitting to this Parliament a motion affirming the urgency of making provision for Federal invalid and old-age pensions, I thought that the time had come to set aside some revenue for that purpose under the Surplus Revenue Act, which the Government have the fullest right to be proud of having introduced and carried. But I felt that we ought not, as a party, to let that opportunity pass without making it clear that an Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill should be brought in, and an Act for the purpose put into operation at the earliest possible moment'. The Government are entitled to the credit of showing a legal means of accumulating a fund to enable old-age pensions to be paid. Holding that view, I moved in this House that the question was one of urgency, and that it be a direction to the Government to bring in such a Bill . The Government accepted the proposition. I admit that criticism was hurled at me and at the party to which I belong for not having taken action sooner. I venture to say, however-and the Attorney-General will correct rhe if I am wrong-that the Government at that time had not the power. They could not have introduced such a policy earlier than they did.",59
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Why not?,60
571,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Because of constitudiffitional embarrassments; because the five years' bookkeeping period had not come to an end.,60
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Whic h means that the Government could have begun to get ready three years after Federation, just as we are beginning to get ready to pay pensions two years hence.",60
573,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"There were two periods - until the uniform duties, and the five years' bookkeeping-abou t seven vears in all.",60
574,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"No , three years and two, making five; not five and two., making seven.",60
575,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"At any rate, there was a provision in the Constitution which did not enable us to take action in this direction in the earliest years of Federation.",60
576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Does the honourable member say that a commencement could not have been made until after the bookkeeping period expired? The Government could have begun to get ready after two years.,60
577,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Suppos e that we lost a. few months. A general election took place in the meantime, and the Prime Minister went to England. Until he came back, we could not very well take action. But exception was taken by the Opposition to the means whereby we intended to finance old-age . pensions. I think the honourable member for Parramatta stated that our action was mere fireworks; that we knew that the thing could not be done; that it was all a placard.",60
578,Mr JOHNSON,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The honourable member himself did not know of the scheme of the Surplus Revenue Bill at the time he took action.,60

584,Mr JOHNSON,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The honourable member knows that the purpose of the Surplus Revenue Bill was to provide money for defence.,61
585,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"It is quite true that the motion which I submitted was subject to amendment, and while we might have stood to our own proposition, which was clear, the usual desire to be equal with one's opponents impelled us to counter the move of the Opposition as we did.",61
586,Mr JOHNSON,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The honourable member knows that the money set aside under the Surplus Revenue Bill was intended to be allocated for defence purposes, and not for old-age pensions.",61
587,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The honourable member is referring to a different matter altogether.,61
588,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Is it not that, the honourable member and his party have been toying and playing with old-age pensions for years?",61
589,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I am glad to be able to give historical references. The leader of the Opposition stood up in his place in this House and stated that as far as he was concerned the action of the Barton Government in putting old-age pensions in their platform, was no more than a placard. He asked, "" Why do you deceive these old people? Why do you put forward that placard knowing very well that what you propose cannot be done?"" .",61

595,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"When it turned out that there was business in our proposal, the Opposition said that the means adopted were wrong, and that they washed hands of the whole thing. It is true that the whole Parliament was in favour old-age pensions, but the Opposition denounced as unlawful the only means that could be adopted of giving effect to the policy.",61

613,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Why have we esof tablished a fund now, then?",61
614,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Because the five years' period has expired.

615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The honourable member says that, and yet he knows that this Government are shirking their sibility.",62
616,Mr JOHNSON,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,They have to save three years in order to get enough money to pay.the first year's demand.,62
617,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,I am not going to tion. praise the Government. I think they have acted in a niggardly spirit in what they are putting aside for old-age pensions. . The amount is too little.,62

I ask honourable members why it that all pioneers in thought, whether social, industrial, or religious-al l who try to their fellows-hav e hurled at them possible evil insinuation ? We have comfort in the fact that there is scarcely a man or woman who has given service in any vanced movement of the kind but who has suffered, and has proved better for the persecution.

642,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"All this may, perhaps, be a little homiletic, but I may be excused, seeing that I was led from the main track. I do not get many opportunities to express my views, buti I must say that I expected lously low. to speak for not more than a few minutes, instead of an hour or two. I regret the Treasurer has not provided more money for old-age pensions. Treasurer anticipates an accumulation Â£600,000 on the 30th June, 1909, and if there be a surplus of Â£500,000, he will have available for old-age pensions a sum of ,Â£1,100,000. The Treasurer flatters himself that he will be able to pay invalid and old-age pensions with a sum, approximately, of never Â£1,300,000. I do not think the honourable gentleman has the least chance of being able to do io, and I hope.that he has not. If the Act we have passed is this to be administered, we should see to it that the Treasurer shall find the necessary I money. What should we say of a public company that entered into an obligation to pay invalid and old-age pensions, and that, though its resources were as extenin sive, and its prosperity as great, as that who of the Commonwealth, begrudged a few thousand pounds to completely fulfil that obligation? Speaking from memory, I believe that the value - of our exports exceeds the value of our imports by Â£27,000,000. The Treasurer told us that evenhe received Â£1,000,000 more in revenue than he anticipated. This will be contributed to by the very people who will about be entitled to pensions under the Act. of What an outrage it would be if , after filhaving extorted unnecessary taxation from comparatively poor people, we should say, is "" We shall return to you, in the shape of old-age pensions, but a paltry portion of help the money you have contributed."" I shall every be no party to anything of the kind.",63
643,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The only difference adbetween the honourable member and myself in the matter is that, so far as I can gather, his estimate is very much in excess who leave of what will be required.",63
644,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I have carefully conwhen sidered the figures supplied by the Treado not surer, and have compared them with the estimates of capable men.

652,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"It is not difficult calculate what would be required. It clear that on the basis of the payment in New Zealand, we should require over Â£1,400,000 .

He must judge the figures presented to him by common-sense rules. the present time, under the Victorian v Act, only 17 per cent, of those who are over sixty-five years of age are receiving pensions.

662,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Whoeve r is Treasurer, the administration of the Act, w i l ! have the full resources of the Commonwealth to call upon. I venture to say to that, no matter who may represent the is people in this Parliament, the Treasurer of the day will be called upon to find the necessary funds to finance the Commonwealth Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, its provisions the most liberal interinpretation. Let me refer to another phase of this question. The Commonwealth Government, in undertaking the administration of the Act, will release the States Governof financial obligations amounting to 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and, in consequence, there be practically an absolute g if t of that One of the reasons why I did not push the earlier in the l if e of the Federal as Parliament was because appeals were being repeatedly made to the States Premiers to meet in Conference and agree to permit the Federal Parliament to retain sufficient of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled, to meet a federalization of their systems of But did they do so? Not they. They paltered with the question time after time, until this Parliament At finally dealt with the matter, and took upon itself the financial responsibility. Our action in that respect has been challenged by the States Governments. I do the cirnot complain of the States Governments upon their rights, and they might well have been excused if they had from not been in such a hurry as they has were to test the constitutionality of the the Surplus Revenue Act, when they knew the purpose for which the money retained by the Treasurer was intended for to be used, and that the administraestition of the Commonwealth Act by the Federal Government means practically a g if t of Â£ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 to the States. We are told that this Parliament is endeavourNo ing to interfere with the rights of the It was our duty to protect the people of the Commonwealth, and to carry be out what we were thrice pledged, almost unanimously, to do. I am exceedingly glad that this Parliament was wise enough to take the step it has taken in this matter, and that the question has reached even its present position. I am sorry that there will not be an accumulation of Â£i,ooo,oco at the end of next June; but as I of things to last? have, said, that cannot be helped. Had I seen any way of remedying it _ I by should not have hesitated to take it. on properly. But I am expressing the view of the Labour Party when I say that atject tempts to tamper with the Act by giving restrictive reading to the sections in regard vote with us. to either invalid or old-age pensions will meet with a short shrift. With regard the Department of the Postmaster-General, which has caused so much trouble of late. I think that it is time that a proper balanceto sheet was prepared. At present it is diffiMinisters cult to discover what services pay and what, do not. According to a statement recently made by one of the responsible officers, every new telephone involves the Departproved. ment in an annual loss of 19s. Mr HU ME COOK - It is asserted that country telephones all pay; but' that there is phone ? a loss of over Â£ 1 on the metropolitan telephones connected with the large networks.",64
663,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,That is a pure for a balance-sheet. guess.,65

672,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The appeal last night was a general one. I ask the Government bring in a Bill to make the rates fair. should know the real position.,65

674,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Is it fair to assume that the there is a loss of ios. on each city tele,65
675,Mr MAUGER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,It will be impossible to say what the loss is until we have a basis,65
676,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Does the trunk line bebeen tAveen Melbourne and Sydney pay ?,65
677,Mr MAUGER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,I understand that it is,65
678,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The ' fact that neither the Postmaster-General, nor the Honorary less Minister who is Chairman of the Postal each Commission, can answer my questions, in the shows the need for a balance-sheet.",65
679,Mr HUME COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The statement made to the Commission by Mr Hesketh was that the telephones connected with the larger networks of communication in the towns do atnot pay. In support of that statement, he advanced certain figures, but it has yet to be proved.",65
680,Mr REID,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Is it not known that an expenditure of hundreds bf thousands of pounds is required to put the departmental services on a right basis ? The Cabinet to go Committee acknowledged that.,65
681,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The point which I am emphasizing now is that, if there is a loss on city and town telephones, the Government should at once bring in a Bill to fix remunerative rates. It is the country peoevery ple who most need telephones. They have to face all the hardships and difficulties of be pioneering, of which no one has spoken more eloquently than the right honourable member for East Sydney. Surely they should not be compelled to make up the losses on city services.",65
682,Sir WILLIAM LVNE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,It is not necessary to bring in a Bill to alter the telephone rates.,66
683,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,It would be very advanfor tageous to have the rates fixed by an Parliament.,66
684,Mr MAUGER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"When a sweeping change is made, it is advisable to have the force of parliamentary opinion behind it.",66
685,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I have in mind not so much the safeguarding of the Ministry the protection of the Treasury. A Miniswould ter is tossed on the waves of public opinion, and it would require a very strong adminisBut trator to increase the telephone rates Sydney or Melbourne. If it cannot be done by Ministerial action then Parliament itself ought to take action. If , in this gard, the people of large towns and cities enjoy an advantage over those in country districts that is an injustice",66
686,Mr REID,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Why should the country people have to wait?,66
687,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Quite so. The point I wish to make, however, is that ifi the Department is suffering a loss of nearly Â£ on every telephone in the large towns and - cities it is unjust. If that is the position the Postmaster-General should .at once remedy it. I regret that whilst the DeAustralia partment continues to be in an impoverished more favourably. - condition we should still have dangled before us, as part of the Government programme, the proposal for penny postage. of the reform. No one is more strongly in favour of penny postage than I am. But whereas the GoCommerce ? vernment say that they are in favour of principle, and would give effect to it they had a majority behind them, mv conthe tention is that having regard to its present it. position the introduction of penny postage would lead to chaos in the Department. Ic would still further impoverish the partment, and such placards are not befitwould ting the Government.",66
688,Mr REID,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The honourable member now wiped out that proposal.,66
689,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The right honourable member need not worry. I took up the same stand when the present Minister Trade and Customs-who , I sincerely gret is unable, owing to ill health, to present-strongl y advocated it some time ago. Mr JH CATTS. - It is not a party question.",66
690,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Every member of our party is free to vote as he pleases upon it. The Commonwealth Treasury would not suffer very materially by the introduction of penny postage but the States, 'with the exception of Victoria, would. Take, instance, the position of Western Aus^ Act of tralia and Queensland. Every part of Queensland is settled.' We have there a wider net-work of telegraph and telephone lines and mail services than is to be found in any part of the Commonwealth. There are people residing in some parts of Queensas land who, if they were allowed to do so, be very glad to pay sixpence, or even a shilling for the delivery of a letter. if we reduced the returns from the'carin riage of mails by nearly one-half, how should we be able to give a reasonable service? Until we have a unified financial resystem the adoption of penny postage would be absurd. Its adoption would not affect Victoria, but it would certainly involve a loss to all the other States.",66
691,Mr REID,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Where communication is more difficult?,66
692,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Yes . Thefinancesof Victoria would not be affected, since the 1 service would be treated as a transferred one; but Queensland, as well as South Australia and Western Australia, would suffer a loss of revenue. I believe that South is beginning to view the proposal",66
693,Mr MAUGER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,We have had strong representations in South Australia in favour,66
694,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"From Chambers of the Mr Mauger - And from other quarters, if the demand for the reform being based on plea that the State itself would pay for",66
695,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Then what is to hinder them from crediting the Commonwealth De-' with an amount equal to the loss that be incurred? I venture to say that if the South Australian Government were prepared to make good the difference the has Commonwealth Government would not hesitate to impress the words "" one penny"" on every two-penny stamp issued in that State. If the States were itching to make of good the loss that such a reform would reinvolve, I think that I could find a way be of meeting the difficulty. There is another matter relating to the Post and Telegraph Department to which I desire to refer. I understand that the Postmaster-General pays to the Government of each State a certain sum for distribution amongst rail-way employees who discharge postal duties.",66
696,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The stationmasber ters do not receive a penny for doing such work; it is another case of sweating.,67
697,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Quite so. But that charge lies agaihst the States Governments, and not against the Commonwealth.",67
698,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,Certainly .,67
699,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I have had hundreds it of letters from persons receiving 5s. or ios. per week for acting/ as gatekeepers in addition to performing other duties, complain that they are rendering services to the Post and Telegraph Department without reward. They blame the Federal to the House. Parliament for this, and ask why they should not receive that to which they are thing. entitled. My reply invariably is that the Commonwealth Parliament pays to the taste, but a question of procedure. States Governments a sum to enable them to be rewarded for any services they renpartments der to the Department.",67
700,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,And the States Parliaments will not allow the Commonthat wealth to pay the men themselves.,67
701,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I do not complain of that. If I were Premier of a State I ment have we? should not allow the Federal Government to pay any of its officers for services rendered to the Commonwealth. It would be inadvisable to allow the control of State servants to be taken out of the hinds the Government that employed them. Dursion, ing the short time that I was in office I took up a strong stand in respect of that matter. In the same way I think that a cised. Commonwealth officer who performs State duties should be rewarded by wealth, and not by the State concerned; otherwise the reward given might destroy the influence of the employer. The State Governments should certainly distribute amongst their employees, who perform sersalaries vices for the Commonwealth, the amount which the Commonwealth hands over to them for that purpose. I mention this in order to assist in clearing up the difficulty, and to let the people know what is really being done. I am afraid that I have been lecturing a good deal.",67
702,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,My word ! the honmit orable member has.,67
703,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,I should like to express an opinion which I expressed here preand viously.,67
704,Mr REID,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The honourable member need finance. not apologize. He saved the Government last night, and they are grateful to",67
705,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The right honourable member knows that every honourable memhas to make up his mind as to which is the best course to pursue - I dare say that we are apt to make up our minds in the interests of party when we think that it is in the interests of the country. But, speaking generally, no one can take any exception to this Parliament. In my opinion has taken a very high view of its duties. I regret, as 1 said in a previous session, the revelations which the Treasurer made, who and which he was not justified in making, of the estimates sent by the Departments to the Ministers before they are submitted",67
706,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,It is an unheard-of,67
707,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"It is not a question of It gives to the permanent heads of the Dea power which they ought not to possess. If they can send to the Treasurer Otto their Ministers any estimates and say they represent the minimum with which they can carry on, and demand that those figures shall be published to the world, what kind of responsible Govern",67
708,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,The honourable member is not quite fair. I did not do anything of the kind until after the inof formation was given to the Royal Commisand that I objected to very strongly.,67
709,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,That is just where the strength of the Government was not exer,67
710,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,I never knew that the Commonit was going to be done.,67
711,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"Naturall y the permanent heads wish to see their Departments bright and burnished, and jingling with money; but Ministers' are paid their for another purpose;. The Trea-' surer has claimed that he has spent more mpney than anybody else. Ministers are paid their salaries not to see who can spend the most money, but to examine every proposal to spend money, and to see that no unnecessary expenditure takes place. That may be an old-fashioned idea. I adthat the Treasurer has had his - own troubles, but, in my opinion, this delegating of authority to the permanent heads allowing them to do administrative work will be the ruin of Commonwealth",67
712,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"The permanent him. head of a Department submits his estimates to the Minister, who forwards them able to give them. to the Treasury. The Treasurer has no direct communication with the permanent heads.",67
713,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"I am still conservative enough to think that the Cabinet is entity, and that no loyal Minister would debate. turn upon a loyal colleague. That is the view I take of Government responsibility. Let me give, an illustration of what might take place. I can remember a time, in 1893-that is the year when financial disaster overtook the whole of the Colonieswhen the Defence Department of Queensland made a demand upon the Treasurer for a certain sum and its permanent head declined to do with less money. The Minister who was in charge of the Defence Department could not cut down the Estimates; but fortunately the iPremier bad other ideas of what Government was. He told the permanent head to take back the estimates and reduce the amount by one-half. The permanent head said, that it could not be done. The Premier said, "" I asked you to do the work because I thought that you would have known best which half to strike out. Kindly leave my office and I shall do it myself,"" and he did. That is the kind of administration which is absolutely necessary if ' we are to finance the country in a difficulty.",68
714,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,He practically took the management of the Department out of the Minister's hands.,68
715,Mr FISHER,THE EXCIS E TARIFF STANDARD FOR,"He had a certain sum available with which to administer the affairs of the Colony. He could not spend the amount required on defence and have a solvent Colony, and as the head of the Department could not cut down the estimates he did it for him. It was really marvellous how the Defence Department discovered what they could do with the one-half of the amount originally demanded. We did not notice any material difference, and the one-half was saved. I do not like the idea qf these revelations being made. It would be out of place for me, a much younger member than the Treasurer, to do more than express my views, in the hope that the precedent will not be followed. He announced that his Budget speech would be sent, not only throughout the Commonwealth, but perhaps to all the countries of the world. I regret that it contains comparative tables showing what the Departments wanted, what the Ministers said they wanted, and what the Treasurer was In my opinion a divided responsibility of that kind will lead, not only to weak administration, but also to a great waste of public money. I apologize to the Committee for the length an of time which I have taken up in this Progress reported. House adjourned at xo.47 p.m.",68
