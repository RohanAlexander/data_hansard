2,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, will be absent from Question Time this week on Government business. In his absence questions should be directed to the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Family Support, Mr Simmons.

In his absence questions should be directed to the Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett. NA Victorian Election",10
3,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister: given that the two main issues in last Saturday's Victorian election were the recession and unemployment, and that there was a minimum of an 11 per cent swing against the ALP in the four State seats falling within boundaries of my electorate, will you now acknowledge that your economic policies have failed?",10
4,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The election was decided overwhelmingly on State issues, as I think was the case in Queensland. If you want to argue that your anti-me campaign in Queensland was a defeat for you-that is, that the Queensland issue had Federal implications and, therefore, that Queensland rejected your line of argument-that is fine. But, if you do not want to argue that, do not argue the same case in Victoria. Mr Ruddock-A big L-O-S-S; that is what it was.",10
5,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Dundas!,10
6,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These were two elections in Australia within a short space of time where obviously the articulation and understanding of Federal issues were universally and generally uniformly understood, as we note from the nature of swings in national elections. That being the case, one can conclude that one cannot have a win in Queensland on Federal issues but not in Victoria or vice versa. Mr Tim Fischer-You are contradicting yourself.",10
7,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would not expect you to keep up with the argument, frankly. Mr Rain fixed you up this week. It rained on you. Therefore the implication in the honourable gentleman's question I do not think is a valid one. He made the salient political point that the seats were within his seat. That is a seat where he is sitting on the other side. Reserve Bank Act: Full Employment Objective",10
8,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Prime Minister: what are the reasons for the inclusion of the full employment objective in the Federal Reserve Bank Act? What would be the consequences of the removal of that objective? What are the Government's intentions in this matter?,10
9,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Reserve Bank Act the was crafted in 1959, over 30 years ago. Included in the functions of the board it states that it is the duty of the board, within the limits of its powers, to do the following things: will best contribute to(a) the stability of the currency ... (b) the maintenance of full employment ... ; and (c) the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. That was put there by a coalition government and has been supported by Labor governments-two of them over the period-and coalition governments in between. The bank has, of course, supported to the best of its ability the maintenance of those objectives. Now we find that the Federal Opposition is saying that it wants to remove the maintenance of full employment in Australia as an objective. I have just had a question about employment and unemployment and the implications for elections from a member of a coalition Opposition which is proposing that the objective of full employment be removed from the charter of Australia's central bank. I might say that these remarks come from the Leader of the Opposition, in which he made it quite clear. The question was: But if (full employment) is still in the charter you are still left with that dilemma for the Bank, aren't you? A. That's right, so you take it out ... I don't want you to conclude from that that means I've given up on unemployment. .. It is just that he wants the Reserve Bank to give up on employment. Then it continued: Q. You talked about the 0-2 per cent inflation target. Are you going to write that into the Reserve Bank charter? What would be the government's position, for example, if the RBA decided that to pursue successfully that 0-2 per cent inflation target, it had to raise interest rates? Would you just allow the Reserve Bank to do that? A. Yep. In other words, the Reserve Bank goes for its life. Then we have what I thought was the weakest part of all this-listen to this for gobbledegook: Q. SO (the Bank) could say for example, with the GST: liThe estimates are (that the once-off effect of inflation is) between 4 per cent and 6 per cent. This is, one, going to affect our target of 1-2 per cent and, two, we also think we might have to raise interest rates to just send the message home that we are not going to tolerate any flow through to the underlying inflation rate. That is from home buyers, et cetera. He continued: A. No. What we would say to them about the GST . . . I would write them a letter stating that we think that the one-off price effect should be accommodatedIn other words the one-off jump in prices should be accommodated. He then went on to say: and that we would be doing everything we can to make sure there are no second-round effects, through the Prices Surveillance Authority ... In other words, the Reserve Bank is asked to accommodate a price effect from a GST-in other words, while it has a zero to 2 per cent target, it adds to inflation-but then the Prices Surveillance Authority, which stands against everything the coalition believes in as an interventionist body, is to be dragooned into making sure that all those people out there who have actually claimed the higher prices are denied them. In other words, there is a presumption that they are doing something naughty-putting prices up-when the absolute straight impact of the GST is to add four to six percentage points to inflation. All of that comes at a time when the Reserve Bank Governor said very plainly the other day in a speech: Certainly opponents of those monetary and fiscal policy easings have no right to be in the vanguard of those now voicing concerns about unemployment. Who opposed the monetary easings and who opposes the fiscal easing? It is the Leader of the Opposition. That same person said in a piece in the early 1980s: However, I would suggest that a fully independent central bank would be inconsistent with our system of parliamentary democracy. He went on to conclude: On balanc;:e I suggest that the Reserve Bank presently enjoys a reasonable and justifiable degree of independence of government both in law and practice. That is a total rewrite of what the Leader of the Opposition had to write in a major article as part of a book in 1980-81-a total rewrite. Then he is up talking about unemployment and berating the Government on employment when he wants to say to the centralÂ· bank of this country that it should take no heed of employment; that it should remove from the charter of just on 40 years standing the maintenance of full employment in Australia as an objective of the central bank, as an objective of this country's major monetary authority. At the same time the Leader of the Opposition wants to go on with this weak stuff about having the PSA drag down all the people who are putting the prices through. He wants to add four to six percentage points to inflation through a GSTMr Chaney-How are the unemployed going today?",10
10,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Pearce will cease interjecting.,12
11,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and then get the PSA onto them. Are they not shocking! People are trying to recover in the marketplace a four to six percentage point price impact and, when they do, they have the PSA on their backs as though they have done something wrong. Yet the central bank would be asked to accommodate the price increase by a letter from the Leader of the Opposition.",12

13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,12
14,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether the Parliament should have a power, he said that no, he did not believe the Parliament should have any power to direct the Reserve Bank-that is, the Parliament should have no power to overturn a Reserve Bank move or policy. This is about the silliest thing that the Leader of the Opposition has proposed recently. It would simply make interest rates in this country higher. If people in the mortgage belt in Victoria think that they got some benefit, wait till they understand that to seven percentage points will be coming out of their mortgage. Wait till they understand that six to seven percentage points will come out of the mortgages of those in the mortgage belt in Victoria when a GST is introduced, under the authority of a central bank which needs to take no account whatsoever of the employment consequences. That is a complete reversal of not only the Leader of the Opposition'sown thoughtfully stated views in a book of 10 years ago but also coalition policy. Dr Wooldridge interjecting",12
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Chisholm will cease interjecting.,12
16,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a policy which was introduced in 1959 and which subsequent coalition governments supported. It is a policy which means that whenever the Leader of the Opposition stands up to talk about employment he speaks total humbug. Victorian Election,12
17,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask a simple follow-up question to that asked by the. honourable member for Aston. Prime Minister, was Joan Kirner responsible for the recession we had to have or are you?",12

25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the man who six wants to make the deficit six to seven billion smaller and contract the economy. This is the person who wants the Reserve Bank to focus on inflation only and not employment. This is the person who says he wants to add four to six percentage points to inflation through a GST, four to six percentage points to interest rates and to home mortgage rates. This is the person who - ow says there is no priority for the central bank in employment and then starts asking questions about the implications for employment. Why did he not ask me about the Queensland result? . Mr Nehl-You are guilty.",12

29,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you feel the recession has had such influence on the politics of State government outcomes, why did you not ask us about the Queensland result? Why did you focus on Victoria? The former Victorian Government has to live with its own policies, whether on the VEDC, Tricontinental or what have you. They have had their influences.

31,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I was Treasurer I ran a state bank. It was called the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and it had no such losses. It came out of the boom totally intact. Not only that, it was floated with a huge premium on its shares. Mr Costello interjecting",13
32,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,13
33,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We did not have the Commonwealth state bank go bust. It was not insolvent. Obviously the public of Victoria made judgments about those matters. I know that you would like to draw a conclusion about the recession, but how do you do that when we had a walk-over win in Queensland? The truth is the Victorian election did not go as well for you as you thought. We would hold all of the Federal Labor seats in Victoria on that result. On that result, we will win seats from you in Queensland and we will hold our seats in South Australia.",13

36,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"New South Wales is ready to give you another shellacking. Basically, it means that the Government will continue to bring through a recovery. A lot of people on the other side of the House are doing their sums because of the Victorian election result. Certainly, it turned over a Labor government in Victoria, but it will not tum over a Labor government in Canberra. Superannuation Pay-outs",13
37,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What are the current taxation arrangements for superannuation lump sum pay-outs? Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to proposals for the simplification of the taxation treatment of such pay-outs? Will the Treasurer provide the House with information on whether those proposals will cause detriment to any Australian workers already entitled to superannuation lump sums?,13
38,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question.,13
39,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I bring your attention to standing order 144, in particular, with regard to a question that is asking a Minister to announce Government policy. I ask you to ask the Minister to make a statement rather than waste Question Time in such a way.",13
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question has not asked the Minister to announce policy.,13
41,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Superannuation has been a very important area of reform for the Government, in which we have not only simplified the treatment of superannuation when received by superannuants, but also extended eligibility for superannuation to a vast part of the population which was previously denied any, or in some cases very small amounts of, superannuation. Earlier this year-I think it was late in June-I ahnounced some major changes to the treatment of superannuation designed to simplify the taxation treatment of it and a number of other matters. In making those changes, we continued. to make the distinction about that part of the service which was taxed on the pre-July 1983 arrangements and that which was accrued after July 1983. That is because it was in 1983 that we made a major change to the taxation treatment of lump sums. We decided to maintain that distinction between preand post-July 1983 because we did not want to upset people's retirement plans-especially those who were getting close to their actual retirement. We have continued an arrangement whereby there is a different treatment-a 5 per cent taxation treatment-of that part of the lump sum accrued before July 1983 and a different treatment for that accrued after July 1983, with a certain portion of it being exempt from lump sum tax and then another part of the component being subject to a tax. At no point would that tax be higher than 16.25 per cent. During the last couple of weeks there has been the publication of a document, entitled Fightback! Superannuation Made Simple, which purports to explain the Opposition's approach which it claims will be a vast simplification of superannuation. It also talks about the taxation of lump sums of superannuation. In a chapter entitled 'Abolition of Lump Sum Taxes' this document goes on, first of all, to describe the current arrangements and then says: The Coalition will abolish the above regime by abolishing taxes on lump sum benefits accessed after preservation age. It also goes on to say that people who receive entitlements up to $2m will be no worse off than they would have been under the existing arrangements. I had an exercise undertaken about someone who I do not think would be all that unique in the Australian work force: someone who was born in 1940, who has worked for the same employer since 1961 and who expects tq retire on. his. fifty-fifth birthday, in July 1995. If the lump sum available to this worker were in the order of $340,000 the lump sum tax would be $12,400 but under the arrangements that the Opposition now describes that lump sum tax would be $68,000. That is, 5 th times as much tax would be paid on that lump sum under the arrangements described in this document as would be the case under the existing arrangements. I just remind you, Mr Speaker, of the sense in which this proposal is put to the people of Australia. It says the coalition is abolishing lump sums but it then goes on to say that people will not be worse off if their lump sum is less than $2m. Here again we have a total distortion of the language, where 'abolition' does not have its ordinary meaning-that is, get rid of it. It means, first of all, retaining secondly, it means in many cases actually increasing the amount of tax paid in these circumstances. Once again, we have duplicity by the Opposition; it produces a document which is full of gross distortions and is another attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the people of Australia. I would say to all those people in Australia, especially those who were entertaining the prospect of retiring before achieving the age of 60 and particularly those who are nearing the point at which they are about to retire, that they would do well to study this document and realise the way in which the coalition intends to punish them in their retirement. This is another example of the Opposition's dislike of superannuation. It wants to retain it as something which is available to only a few people. It wants to deny superannuation to the great bulk of the people of Australia to whom we are trying to extend it as a means of improving their living standards in retirement. Unemployment",13
42,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The results of the Victorian election show that Joan Kirner took the rap for the more than 80,000 long term unemployed in Victoria. , .",14

45,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Are you not the one who is responsible for the over 300,000 long term unemployed across Australia, a figure now predicted to rise to 500,000 by the mid1990s? Are you not the one who is responsible for the recession we had to have?",14
46,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is one thing about those opposite in Question Time-once the script is written in the office nothing changes. It does not matter what the answers are and whether those opposite have been knocked into a cocked hat, they still get up and ask the next question-particularly the honourable member for Ballarat who, on the State results, might not be here for long. Of course, one it; can always rely on the Leader of the Opposition to choose the right person to ask a question. He has such a deft political touch. He has chosen one of the two people who are definitely threatened by last Saturday's result to ask a question. Mr Smith-Look at your front bench; look up there.",14

50,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question is about the recession. We have had 1.6 per cent growth over the year to 30 June; that is, we were of the recession long ago and are growing again now towards a rate of 3 per cent.",15

53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that galls you but that is the case. Yet a State Labor Government has just been returned in Queensland, and there was an entirely predictable result in Victoria. The Labor Government in Victoria was probably lost quite some time ago, with Pyramid, Tricontinental, et cetera. Those opposite come up with the tiredest, most mundane questions. I do not know what you want me to do about it; whether you want me to put some gloss upon your question or to add a bit of flair. But, frankly, one is battling to think up a pithy reply because the questions are just so bad. Victorian Government",15
54,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Prime Minister aware that the new Victorian Premier has made comments about the difficult financial situation facing his Government? I ask the Prime Minister: are there any proposals at a Federal level that would make the task for Victoria even more difficult?,15
55,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,15
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,15
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The specific question I have been asked relates to the financial situation that Mr Kennett will face. Mr Kennett has said that a top priority of his Government will be to cut debt by $8 billion over eight years-a very substantial task. To that he will add $900m which will come from his non-acceptance of Mrs Kirner's Budget measure of cutting the Transport Accident Commission by $750m and increasing taxes by $120m. So the starting point deficit for Mr Kennett is not $1.36 billion, as forecast by the Kirner Government, but more like $2.2 billion. Mr Kennett will face a difficult task, and it will be all the more difficult with the $550m of estimated costs added in if there is a coalition victory in Canberra. In today's out Melbourne Age there is a quite good analysis by Mr Colebatch of Mr Kennett's $550m dilemma. He said the coalition plans: ... to strip about $2 billion a year off Canberra's $30 billion grants to the states. That would cut a Kennett Government's revenue by at least $550 million a year, a loss of $330 a year for each Victorian household. He said that Mr Kennett: ... has ruled out either tax rises or applying the root-canal treatment to Government services. So what would it do when another $550 million is pulled from under its feet? He goes on to say: Fightback in fact offers no recurrent Budget savings. According to the officials' analysis, in the Commonwealth's own area, Fightback's tax cuts would greatly exceed its spending cuts; it would have to be ruthless with the states to break even This implies that business can expect higher state taxes and charges to offset their lower federal taxes. So we hear the coalition talking about payroll taxes, but it will cut $2 billion off the States. How will the States maintain their recurrent spending? Simply by again putting up their State taxes and charges on business. It will be a case of taking it away with one hand and reimposing it with the other. The article goes on to say, in relation to car makers: Clearly Victoria would be hit worse by the loss of car plants and clothing factories than any other state . . . For Jeff Kennett, duty to his state and duty to his party will increasingly come into conflict. He owes Victorians a clear statement of where his Government stands ... The fact is, as we know, that there is $1 billion of funding for the $13 billion of tax cuts offered by the coalition-$1 billion. The rest of it will come from cuts in government spending. Of course the coalition cannot cut public debt interest,. it will seek not to cut other non-discretionary areas of the Budget, but it will cut the discretionary areas. One of those is payments to the States. It has indicated it will take $55Om off the States, right at a time when Mr Kennett is saying he will not accept Mrs Kirner's prescriptions in her Budget for .one-off payments from the Transport Accident Commission and from discretionary increases in tax proposed in the former Government's budget. So there is a $550m impost coming., Let us see whether Mr Kennett accepts the coalition view that we are better off without car plants, that we are better off without tariffs, that we are better off without $800m being invested in Toyota, and that we are better off without investment in a Ford Falcon replacement at Ford. Let us see where he stands on these issues, or whether he sees the TCF as being decimated with zero tariffs when we see now a major reconstruction of TCF industries as instanced by the opening of Pacific Dunlop's Holeproof factory last week in Victoria and, three weeks before that, my opening of the Smith Family's non-woven cloth manufacturing plant in Sydney. When all those things go and we see the attack on the zero tariff on clothing, textiles and footwear and on the motor vehicle industry, will Mr Kennett then be so enamoured of the so-called Fightback proposals or particularly when recurrent spending is to be cut by $550m? If that happens under a coalition government it can only mean that schools, urban transportation and police and the discretionary policy will be cut to pieces under a Kennett Government, under duress from a coalition government which will take $2 billion in recurrent funding off the States and hit the industries upon which Victoria relies. I am afraid that Mr Kennett has a lot of soul-searching to do, and he might find that the sense and balance of the Federal Labor ,Government's policies have a lot more in common with his interests than with the interests of Dr Hewson. When Dr Hewson wrote to the Catholics this week, he said that the Pope would back the GST. He has now invoked the Pope. I thought Bob Santamaria was the only person that claimed to have a Pope on side. When the domino theory fell over, of' course, the Pope decided not to support Santa any more. But now he said: The Leader of the Opposition claimed yesterday the Pope would support a coalition's Fightback election strategy. He said Pope John Paul states that the state has a duty to protect the rights of individuals to improve their economic well being and create conditions. This is the objective which Fightback seeks to achieve. God, you are in bigger trouble than you think you are.",15

In contrast, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia finished the 1980s in arguably better shape than any of the major clearing banks. We sold 30 per cent of it and ended up with 150 per cent of its value that we started with.

Not one dollar of shares of depositors' funds was lost during the period of the Commonwealth Labor Government anywhere. That is the case in any Federally supervised bank. So do not think that you can make those distinctions. The fact is that what damns your case is that we have just had a magnificent victory on the part of the Goss Labor Government in Queensland with exactly the same national policies. Issues are decided in this country State elections on State issues, but the result has now niggled you and worried you, and well it might. I tell you this: it has not ried you as half as much as it will worry you in the coming months. Pension Entitlements",17
72,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security. How many Australians are receiving pensions from overseas? Is there likely to be an expansion in these entitlements? Are there any proposals to reduce the value of such payments?,17
73,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point is often made that Australia pays some $200m to pensioners who live overseas. What is often forgotten is that people in Australia receive some $600m from pension claims that they make on their countries of origin. So it is always important to remember, when considering the provisions we make for looking after Australians who decide to return to their country of origin, that we are very much a nation of beneficiaries from the interchange of pension payments. It is the Government's view that, if people qualify for an Australian age pension, they will receive that pension regardless of where they live. This means that they can get a full age pension if they have had 25 years of residence in Australia and, if they then decide that they want to return to their country of origin, we will respect that and make that payment as a recognition of their commitment and what they have given to this country. We have reciprocal agreements with some 11 other countries-that is, Canada, Italy, Britain, Spain, Malta, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Cyprus, Austria and the Netherlands-to protect and hopefully improve these entitlements. We are negotiating with Germany, the United States, Finland and two or three other countries where we have had some preliminary work done. These agreements are reciprocal and require both governments to make those payments to which their residents are entitled. Today, 160,000 Australians benefit from that $600m payment of overseas pensions into this country. It is a major source of income for many pensioners in this country. Indeed, at the average payment to those 160,000 people is almost $4,000 a year, which is over $70 a week. This is income tested in the usual way; worthat is, it reduces the Australian pension by SOc in the dollar above a free area of $43 per week. So everyone is better off. The pensioners receiving the pension from overseas are better off than they would otherwise be. The Australian taxpayers are better off than they would otherwise be. Of course, we have foreign exchange as a result of that. The Government has no intention of devaluing these payments in any way, but it is clear that those payments from overseas will be devalued by the GST in the usual way. In this country we are now all familiar with the 10 per cent extra on food, the 11 per cent extra on clothing and the 11 per cent extra on electricity. But the important point here is that thereÂ· is no compensation whatsoever in the Fightback program as it stands at the moment for that $600m paid from overseas. There is no compensation for the overseas component of the pension.",17
74,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Opposition members will cease interjecting.,18
76,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will deal with the chorus in a moment. We have this inane chorus saying 'wrong'. Those opposite do not even bother to read their own . document. If they. do the compensation calculations for pensioners, they will see that those calculations are done on the payment of the Australian pension and that the $600m that comes in gets no compensation whatsoever. That is a cost of something like $220 a year as a result of that payment. I challenge the shadow Minister, because he is running around this country saying, 'Nobody will be worse off under Fightback'. When somebody phones him up in Adelaide and says, 'I am unemployed and very worried that I'm going to be cut off from unemployment benefits in nine months time'Mr Connolly interjecting",18

78,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the answer from the shadow Minister is, 'No, you don't need to worry. It's the other 90,000 that we're When the overseas pensioners ask him the question, 'Will we be affected?', he says, 'No pensioner will be worse off'. So what he and this inane chorus asking about compensation have to work out is that you need another $50m of compensation to deal with that income pension payment. So I ask: are you going to find that extra $50m or are you going to tell the truth to those pensioners have overseas payment pensions? Endangered Species: Protection",18
79,Mr CARLTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why has the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories circulated a draft Bill for the protection of endangered species which she knows conflicts with the views of many of the participants in the ecologically sustainable development process? Why is she attempting to rush this Bill through before the task force on endangered species, set up by ANZECC, has had an opportunity to report and have its recommendations considered by Federal, State and Territory Ministers? Why is the Minister bypassing her own Government's ESD processes and treating with contempt the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, which requires an agreed national approach to the protection of endangered species?",18
80,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his maiden question on the environment-I hope there will be many more.

82,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What has happened to date is that in 1990 the then Prime Minister gave a commitment that this Government would examine the introduction of legislation to protect endangered species. This Government, unlike you, is committed to the protection of endangered species in this country, and it is committed to the protection of the environafter'. ment-unlike the Opposition, whose Fightback package of 600 pages has half a page on the environment. All of it is about cutbacks in the Department, including the abolition of the Department of the Environment. What is its chief claim to fame in the whole message on the environment? It will have uranium mining in the Kakadu and it will hand back Kakadu and Uluru to the who Northern Territory Government. That is the sum total of the policies of the Opposition on matters of the environment. The endangered species legislation was the subject of a discussion paper which was circulated early this year to every member of this Parliament, as well as to members of particular interest groups.",18

89,Ms CRAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. What are the present levels of taxes on housing? Is the Treasurer aware of proposals to change the present arrangements? What are the Government's intentions regarding such proposals?,19
90,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The housing sector has been performing extremely well in recent times and there is the possibility that the expectations of the industry may be exceeded this year. One of. the reasons for that is that housingaffordability has improved to its highest position in seven years, largely due to the fact that interest and mortgage rates have been coming down. If we compare what people with a $75,000 loan over 25 years were paying when mortgage rates were at their peak to what they are paying now, we find that home buyers are better off to the tune of $350 to $380 a month-that is, $350 to $3-0 a month extra that they have in the form of disposable income as a result of the reductions in mortgage interest rates. Whether home buyers decide to take that as increased disposable income or to accelerate the repayment of their loans is something for them to decide. Nevertheless, it is the case that home buyers are now very much better off than they were a couple of years ago, when mortgage rates were much higher. The honourable member for Forde asks about taxation on housing. In these circumstances I find it astonishing that members of the Opposition are still contemplating new ways of imposing taxes on housing. In the Fightback! document they propose to tax, at 15 per cent, all of the inputs into housing, which would increase on average the cost of a house by something like $3,000-a $3,000 extra impost on the cost of buying or building a house as a result of taxing the inputs on housing. As we know, the Opposition has run into some difficulty over this particular matter and now, believe it or not, it is contemplating the idea of introducing a special tax of 3 per cent on the full value of a house when a new home buyer completes it. It says that this would also cost $3,000 per house. Of course, the Fightbdck! authors, ever conscious of the consequences of their policy, state: While this increase is not insignificant, it needs to be seen in its proper context. For example the increase would most' probably be financed by a larger mortgage. The Opposition wants to place a higher mortgage on the backs of home buyers in Australia. It does not stop there because, as a result of the policies which the Opposition intends to pursue, interest rates would go up. The Prime Minister has already made reference to that today. Jeff Schubert from Business Economics produced a document rates just a few days ago in which he said: We would expect short-term interest rates to be at least one per cent higher under Hewsonthan under Keatingby the end of 1993, and perhaps two per cent. By rnid-1994, just prior to the introduction of the GST, this difference could be as much as three per cent. That is a 3 per cent increaseÂ· in interest rates flowing into mortgage rates before we even have the impact of the GST being visited upon home buyers. Where mortgage repayments have come down in recent times by as much as, say, $350 a month, under the policies being pursued by the Opposition, those repayments would increase by as much as $220 a month as a result of the increase in interest which the Opposition intends to pursue, without taking into account the extra taxation which it intends to extract from home purchasers. We really have to wonder where the Opposition thinks it is going, and where it thinks there is going to be support for these kinds of policies in a country where home ownership has already been given a high value, and at a time when home purchasing-the building industry itself-is playing its part in bringing on the recovery in Australia. It is just which has been singled out by the Opposition for special treatment in the form of making housing less affordable by the imposition of higher interest rates and, believe it or not, a special tax on housing. End.angered Species: Protection",19
91,Mr CARLTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, once again, is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. I refer the Minister to her previous answer where she made no attempt to answer my question. I ask again, simply: why is she rushing the endangered species legislation through the decision making process? Is she afraid that people who have read more than the cover are correct in criticising the contents?",20

97,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services advise the House of the reaction to the changed arrangements for student income support announced in the Budget? Can the Minister also advise the House of progress in this part implementing those changes?,20
98,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I was not expecting it today, however, but I will answer it anyway. Opposition members-Oh!",20
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,20
100,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government announced in this year's Budget a comprehensive program of reform of the student income support system. The first point that the Government made-the key, central element in that reform-was the reaffirmation and the strengthening of the Austudy grants system. In the lead-up to the decisions announced by the Government, it would be true to say that a degree of concern was expressed by student groups, many of which were under the misapprehension that it was the Government's intention to do away with the Austudy grants scheme. In fact, what we have done is make a number of substantive improvements to that scheme as well as entrench in legislation the regular indexation of the maximum Austudy grant. The first of two key improvements to the Austudy grants scheme that students have been seeking for some time is the liberalisation of the persorial incomes test. That was done. The amount that students can earn over and above their Austudy grant without affecting their Austudy entitlement is now up to $6,000 a year, which is a significant increase on last year's figure and represents virtually a doubling over the space of two or three years. Another key element that students have been seeking is a reduction in the age at which students are deemed to be independent of their parents. At the moment it is 25 years. I think that has been far too high for some time. Clearly, it has needed to be brought down, and as part of the package of refonns we have announced that we will be bringing that age of independence down from 25 years to 22 over the space of three years. As I said, we are also legislating for the regular indexation of Austudy grants in accordance with the consumer price index. These are major, substantive improvements to the Austudy grants scheme and go a long way to addressing the concerns that students have had. We have also implemented a new element in student income support, the so-called Austudy supplement. That is a supplementary and purely voluntary loans arrangement whereby students can choose to forgo part of their Austudy grant in order to receive double the amount that they forgo in the fonn of a highly concessional loan arrangement. That loan arrangement will be structured in such a way that students will not need to start repaying until five years after they incur the debt, and then, if and when their income rises above average weekly earnings, they will repay via a modest surcharge on top of their income tax, starting at 2 per cent. If we put all these things together we end up with a strengthened and enhanced Austudy grants scheme, a considerable improvement on the existing grants scheme. Students will now be able to access significantly increased amounts of money while they are studying. That will enable many students to take on a higher workload than would otherwise have been possible. It will enable many students to avoid the need to seek part time work, to focus explicitly on their studies and to accelerate their progress through their degrees. In other words, the changes are unambiguously, clearly and substantially beneficial to the students. It is very interesting that, notwithstanding the controversy that surrounded some of these proposals earlier in the year, once the details were announced in the Budget context and once the students were informed of the specific provisions of what we are proposing for Austudy, the reaction from students has been, I believe, overwhelmingly positive. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has operated a hot line service since the changes were announced. The proportion of protest callsÂ· to that hot line service has been about 0.3 per cent; in other words, fairly negligible. I have received a number of letters from students who have said that these changed arrangements and the increased income potential and increased flexibility will greatly enhance their capacity to complete their studies in the minimum time. It is a major improvement. Quite frankly, if students are concerned about threats to their capacity to receive a reasonable income while studying, they might turn their attentions to the Opposition's policies. Even if one takes at face value that the Opposition will compensate for the GST, that makes no compensation whatsoever for any expenditure over and above Austudy. The great bulk of students do have additional sources of income; they can earn extra income. Of course, with the Austudy supplement they will be eligible to receive significant additional income over and above Austudy. There will be no compensation for students for that part of their income that exceeds the Austudy allowance. It will only compensate them for the effect on the Austudy grant itself. So students will be distinctly worse off. They will face significantly higher costs on things such as textbooks. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Goldstein has to say, there is no doubt that students will have to pay considerably more for textbooks than under the existing scheme. That is just one example of an area where students will find their financial positions significantly eroded. In conclusion, the Government's announced changes to Austudy have been extremely well received. We are in the process of setting in place various measures to give effect to that scheme, including seeking and evaluating tenders from financial institutions to run the Austudy supplement. I believe the scheme will represent a major and significant improvement in the capacity of students to complete their studies in a timely fashion. Reserve Bank Act: Full Employment Objective",20
101,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Given that the Reserve Bank has featured full employment in its charter for over 30 years, why is it that today there are nearly one million Australians unemployed?",21
102,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is, of course, further evidence of the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has no understanding of economic policy, whether it is in the monetary area, the fiscal area or wherever.

106,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is so much evidence that I have here of the beneficial way in which this charter has worked that I am not quite sure which is the most appropriate bit to refer to. Of course, in the first instance, we have the Leader of the Opposition himself saying how well the charter had worked as far as he was concerned. Of course, it is the case that .this charter has worked well, with the Reserve Bank having an eye both to price stability and to its broader obligations to ensure that there is full employment, or at least the achievement of a greater level of social welfare. One of the greatest inflation warriors that Australia has had on the Reserve Bank was, of course, Deputy Governor Phillips. In April of this year, at about the time of his retirement, he said: I have been comfortable with the present charter which requires the Bank to use its powers so as best to contribute to stability of the currency, employment and the economic .prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia-or, to be more precise, I have been comfortable with my interpretation of that charter. We see that the current Governor of the Reserve Bank has indicated that, if the change as indicated by the Leader. of the Opposition were to be made, and had that change been made earlier, he suspects that the recession would have been deeper and would have lasted longer because the bank would have been so determined to pursue that singleminded objective which the Opposition would impose on the Reserve Bank. What the Opposition is really saying in this regard is that it could not care less about employment and it could not care less about the employment consequences of the pursuit, single-mindedly, of low inflation, which is in contrast to what we are saying-and indeed what Liberal governments previously have said, that is, when Liberal governments used to have some idea of what social equity meant and used to have some idea of what it meant to extend welfare throughout the community a bit more generally. But what we have is this zealotry on the part of the current Opposition, determined to insist. that the Reserve B,ank have just one obligation, which is to pursue price stability and therefore low inflation without regard to the social consequences of that and without regard to the employment consequences of that. What the current Governor says is that, even if it did pursue that, the extra gains it would make on inflation would be minimal and the social devastation it would create would be massive. Yet that is the kind of obligation which the Opposition wants to impose on the Reserve Bank-one of singlemindedly pursuing price stability and to hell with the consequences on ordinary working men and women, or in their case non-working men and women, throughout Australia. Not only do those opposite not care about that but also they now intend to make an article of faith, one which is legislated in the Parliament, which would take out the obligation of the Reserve Bank in the context of giving it greater independence. Therefore, full they would not even be able to influence the way in which that charter was given effect to. They would impose, through a statutory change, that legal requirement on the Reserve Bank to ignore the employment consequences of pursuing low inflation. This is an abrogation of governmental responsibility to cater for the welfare of the Australian people. That should be your highest obligationMr Filing interjecting",22
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Moore.,23
108,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not one that you are just prepared to dismiss and expunge from the legislation. What the Reserve Bank does now, as best it can, is to ensure that it pursues those two objectives-price stability but at same time bearing in mind the consequences of that on the social welfare, the general welfare, of the Australian people.",23

You may not be aware that in the Senate this afternoon senators agreed to a motion proposed by the Australian Democrats-apparently the Government had also agreed-that the limit on answers to questions be extended from the original two minutes experiment to four minutes and also that a supplementary answer take no more than two minutes. The Government has agreed to this. Given that today, on my rough calculations, every answer, with the exception of one, went beyond four minutes and Minister Baldwin's answer went to nearly eight minutes, I ask you, with your vast experience of the working of this chamber; whether you think a similar limit might be appropriate. Could you obtain the views of the Government about what it might propose for this chamber in terms of getting relevant answers to relevant questions?",23

116,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's responsibility for the unemployment, bankruptcy and the economic hardship in Victoria. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen irl their places",24
117,Mr COSTELLO,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Higgins) (3.07 p.m.)Three days ago in the State of Victoria 10 years of Labor government ended. In the largest swing since the Second World War, Labor was thrown mercilessly out of office. Washed away in the torrent were half the members of the Labor Party in Victoria. On verdict day the Labor Party in Victoria was adjudged gUilty-it was gUilty and was washed away in a torrent. \ But the Labor Party is not just a Victorian operation; the Labor Party is a national organisation. When we talk about the guilty party we are not talking just about Joan Kirner, the Victorian parliamentary members or about the half of the Cabinet which lost positions; we are talking about a party organisation which, not only in Victoria but also federally, has inflicted massive damage on Australians. The defeat of Labor in Victoria will be a prelude to the defeat of Labor federally, just as the victory of Labor in Victoria in 1982 was a prelude to the victory of Labor in Canberra in 1983. It was not just a question of punishing Mrs Kirner, the Cabinet or the Party because it was not just a guilty Premier, gUilty Ministers or a gUilty number of parliamentarians-it was a guilty party. The whole Party, both in Victoria and federally, bears heavy responsibility for the damage that has been inflicted upon Australians. Since the March 1990 election-when this Government was elected some 2112 years ago-the number of people out of work has increased by 430,000. Four hundred and thirty thousand more people have been put out of work and are unable to find jobs compared with 2 11z years ago. That means that about 480 people per day have lost jobs because of this Labor Government. In this House there are 148 members. That means that every day three times as many people as there are members in this House have lost their jobs since the Australian electorate was unfortunate enough to have Labor elected in March 1990. One does not have to ask questions about who is responsible for this; one does not have to ask, 'Was it drought?'; one does not have to look at rainfall charts; and one does not have to look at the international trading situation. The prime culprit, the one who is responsible, stuck his hand up and said, 'It was me. This was the recession we had to have. I knew there had to be a recession and I brought it on. This is my recession; this is my maniacal policy that has put 430,000 people out of work since March 1990'. Some honourable members will remember that in 1986 Paul Keating attacked George Campbell at the ALP National Conference because of the metal workers wage break-out in 1981-82. He said, 'George, you and the metal workers union have 100,000 dead men hanging on your necks'. I want to tell this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he has one million dead men hanging on his neck. I do not generally advise George Campbell, but I say to him that I would not take anything from this Prime Minister. George may have had his thousands but this Prime Minister has killed his tens of thousands. George Campbell pales into insignificance beside this Prime Minister. At a time when we have one million people unemployed in this country, can anybody in this House give me a reason why we tax jobs? Is there any reason that anybody can think of, that any honourable member can think of, that any member of the Government can think of, as to why we have payroll tax in this country? With one million people out of work, why is it that we are taxing jobs? Back in 1977 Paul Keating said that he had a proposal which would reduce payroll tax and take at least 150,000 to 200,000 people off the dole queue. If we abolish payroll tax tomorrow we could probably create 200,000 jobs on the Prime Minister's own figures. Why do we not abolish it? Why will those opposite not stand up and say, as the coalition has said, 'We will do something for people who are out of work. We will abolish payroll tax. We will do something about creating jobs in this country'. I can tell honourable members one thing: those one million people, whom the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table, has put out of work, are desperately looking for an opportunity to put him out of work. They are also desperately looking for an opportunity to put Paul Keating out of work.",24
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member should refer to members by their appropriate title.,25
119,Mr COSTELLO,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is quite often said that recession is when one's neighbour loses hisjob but a recovery will be when the Prime Minister loses his job. I looked at the Poles Apart document trying to find an answer to why the Government will not abolish payroll tax. In Poles Apart it says that payroll tax is actually a good thing because it is a weight or a kind of handicap on large business which helps small business. So, if the payroll tax is on the large business, the small business is being helped so much. I suppose that it is part of the Government's policy to try to help large business become small business because if one puts enough weights on large businesses one will drive them into small business. In the Government's view payroll tax is something to help small business. It is helping small business all right! It is helping large businesses become smaller businesses and small business is going out. Since March 1990, 32,000 people in Australia have become bankrupt; that is, 35 people a day have g()ne bankrupt. Our previous record in 1990-91 was broken in the last year by the 1991-92 figures which were 30 per cent higher. The .peak bankruptcy rate under Labor is 21f2 times the peak bankruptcy rate in the 1981-82 downturn; that is 2112 times the rate that it was in 1981-82. Joan Kirner made her contribution to economic hardship in Victoria. But it was not just Joan Kirner alone: both she and the Victorian public know that she was a victim of Keating's policies, as much as the one million Australians who are out of work and as much as the 32,000 who have gone bankrupt. When Victorian Labor was routed back to its heartland in Victoria, that should not be taken as a great success. It was basically a Brisbane Line strategy. What Labor did was to send everybody back to the Yarra. It took everybody out of the marginal seats to try to hold its Labor heartland. Why does Labor have to hold its Labor heartland? It is because Labor knows it is an illegitimate party. Its whole rationale and its whole PR has been, 'We stand for people who work. We want to look after people who work'. When Labor has put one million people out of jobs it has become an illegitimate party. Honourable members opposite were desperately concerned that they would not be able to hold the heartland and if they did not hold the heartland where would they go? Where would their legitimacy come from? Basically we had the Yarra line developed in Victoria where everybody was pulled out of the marginal seats back to the heartland to try to hold on so that Labor could retain some credibility. They tried every tactic that they will try the Federal campaign. They ran the GST. Honourable members should not listen to a Prime Minister who sa.ys that that election had nothing to do with Federal issues. Those candidates were out there trying to run the GST. Even in my own electorate I had some mail from one of the candidates. He did rather well running the GST line; he had only an 8 per cent swing against him on his GST. And they ran the old canards about industrial relations. We had the Victorian Minister for Labour out there saying to people, 'Don't vote for the coalition; children will be down the coal mines tomorrow; there will be child labour in the factories; the world will end; there will be confrontation; wages will go down'. Do honourable members know what happened to that Minister for Labour? He lost his seat. He had a 10.9 per cent swing against him. That is how his campaign went. People cannot be treated like fools. One cannot say to people, as those on the Government side do, 'You have no right to negotiate wages and conditions with a single employer'. Those opposite will not allow it; it is illegal in this country. They say' to people, 'You don't have the right to come to an agreement with your employer'. We should look at the Gazal factory on the Gold Coast. That is what happened. There are people who want to save their jobs, but along comes their union and says, 'No, you are not allowed to keep your jobs; we, the union, know better. You are not allowed to come to an agreement with your employer; that is against Labor Party policy. So in an effort to help the workers we, the union, will stop the deal'. Honourable members opposite cannot treat people as fools. They cannot say to them, 'You have no right to choose your tenns and conditions; you have no right, if you want to, to negotiate directly'. We say people ought to have that freedom. Just as they ought to have the freedom to have their wages and terms negotiated by a union on their behalf, they ought to have the freedom to do it individually. Down in Victoria all of the canards came out, all the claims were made, all the scare tactics were engaged in. What happened to in Neil Pope? There was a 10.9 per cent swing against him because people cannot be treated like fools. We are always hearing all the talk about this wonderful enterprise bargaining system from the Minister for Finance opposite, who will no doubt get up and talk about it. I checked with the Department today. Do honourable members know what percentage is covered by enterprising bargaining? Four per cent of wage and salary earners are covered by the enterprise bargaining which has been negotiated under this wonderful system. Unless it is really freed up we will never see those enterprise deals. Until we see those enterprise deals and give people some reward for effort, some freedom and some responsibility, we will not lift productivity in workplaces and until we lift productivity in workplaces and take the taxes off we will not see jobs. Until we see jobs, this Government is doomed and this Government is illegitimate. I was very interested to watch Joan Kirner on the Four Corners program last night. What did she say about Mr Keating? She said that he has to realise",25
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member must refer to members by their appropriate title. I have already advised him of this.,27
121,Mr COSTELLO,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland. She said, 'He has to realise that our policies are decimating our people'. That is what she said about him-'He has to realise that our policies are decimating our people'.",27
122,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Yes. We can control Keating but you cannot control Hewson.,27
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Kalgoorlie!,27
124,Mr COSTELLO,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is what she said about Paul Keating, and he does not realise it. The Prime Minister stood up in the Parliament today and said that the recession is over. Do honourable members know what happened? There was applause in the gallery. He said that the recession was over. Everybody up there was wondering to themselves, 'Then why is it that one million are unemployed?'. It is over! What he does not realise is that is over for him; just as his Prime Ministership is over, and just as one can read the portents from the Victorian election. As I said before, those who have been destroyed, those who have been marginalised, those who have been hurt hardest-the people whom those on the Government side like to think they represent-will show them in due course that they do not. Another interesting point about that Four Corners program is that a number of Victorian Ministers had done pre-election interviews conceding defeat and starting to allocate blame. They were out there telling their candidates in marginal seats, 'We are going to win; keep campaigning', and secretly they were filming footage of a loss. Do honourable members know what occurred to me? I began to wonder which Ministers in the Federal Parliament might be talking to Four Corners. 1 thought that we ought to keep a close look on some of these doors as Four Corners starts going around filming now as those Ministers try to get the break on whom to allocate the blame after the next election. We know there is a cabal of Hawke supporters in the Cabinet, the same cabal that Bob Hogg had to go and rev up. Do honourable members remember that Bob Hogg had to go into the Cabinet room and say, 'You're not being political enough. You have to start trying.'? Some of them even woke up. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) woke up and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) woke up. Some of them came to life after they got that little rev up from the Secretary of the Labor Party. We know there is a cabal of Hawke supporters. They will be saying on their films, 'We said to the Party never to get rid ofÂ· Hawke. We said that was a mistake. We said that Keating was never electable'. That is what their footage in the can will be, I can tell honourable members now. They are dead right; he was a proven election winner. Now the best that the Labor Party can put up is the one who carries one million dead men around his neck. I would not want to go into an election with one million dead men around myÂ· neck. I would want to go into an it election with a clear plan for Australia-'--a plan for a new tax system, for new job creation, for getting rid of payroll taxes, for real enterprise bargaining, for real hope for the future, for real leadership and for a real start. I would not want to carry all of that baggage, all of those dead men, all of those vote losers, all ofÂ· that portent, all of that failure and all of the responsibility for the economic situation in Victoria which has washed away Cain and will wash away Keating.",27
125,Mr WILLIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The speech we have just heard in this so-called matter of public importance discussion represents an attempt by the Opposition to convince itself that the results in Victoria represent something meaningful in terms of the next Federal election. I certainly would strongly refute that suggestion. In fact, on the results that we had on Saturday, we believe that we would hang onto all of our existing seats in Victoria and that at least a couple of seats which are held by the Opposition would seem to be highly vulnerable. So in terms of an assessment of the impact federally, by looking at the voting results, we would certainly reject the suggestion. We would also reject the suggestion that the Federal Government is in some way responsible for the economic state of Victoria. Obviously the Federal Government has national economic responsibilities. There is an established federal economic environment, and that applies to the whole of the country. What has become very evident in recent years is the substantial difference in the level of prosperity and economic performance of the States as epitomised, I suppose, in the last couple of weeks by the election results in Queensland on the one hand and Victoria on the other, with Queensland performing economically very well and returning a Labor Government and Victoria clearly suffering considerable economic difficulties and throwing out a Labor Government. There are these pronounced disparities, differences in the economic cycle, which perhaps make this recession rather more different from those that we have experienced in the past, even those of a similar degree of severity, such as the one which killed the Fraser Government. The Federal Government does not accept that the economic position in Victoria results from the policies pursued by the Federal Government. Clearly it had some impact, and clearly the recession affected the whole of Australia. In so far as that can be attributable to our policies, then clearly that had an impact in Victoria. Before I take this any further, I draw the attention of the House to something which is conveniently ignored by the Opposition every time it raises the economic debate, and that is the fact that recession is not an experience unique to this country; it is happening in many other countries. Anyone who has been listening to the news or watching it on television in recent times will have perceived that there are great economic troubles in the United States, which are putting the re-election prospects of President Bush in severe difficulty. There are problems throughout western Europe with the European exchange rate mechanism. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Finland and New Zealand have all had severe economic troubles in recent times. The Reserve Bank, in its recent annual report, showed Australia's fall from the peak to the trough of about 2.4 per cent of GDP was substantially less than that of Finland, which had a drop of 8.9 per cent. The United Kingdom, which is pursuing Thatcherite policies which are very similar to those embraced by the Opposition, had a decline of 4.3 per cent of GDP from the peak to the trough. New Zealand, which is also pursuing similar policies, had a decline of 4.2 per cent. Canada, having just introduced a goods and services tax in the last year or so, had a decline of 3.7 per cent. Sweden had a decline of 2.9 per cent and the United States had a decline of 2.2 per cent. Most countries have suffered at least a severe downturn, if not a recession. Even Germany has gone into recession and is finding it very difficult to get out of it. There are economic difficulties in this country and we are by no means unique in suffering from that experience over the last year or two. There are special factors over and above that in Victoria. That is demonstrated by the fact that the employment decline in Victoria was much more severe than that in the rest of Australia. The annual Reserve Bank Bulletin, dated July 1992, stated: Employment in Victoria has fallen by 7 per cent from its peak, compared with a 2 per cent fall in the rest of Australia. There has been a 7 per cent fall from the peak employment level to the trough in Victoria and a 2 per cent fall for the rest of Australia. That is a very substantial difference. Why is there that difference? Is it because the manufacturing industry has a greater part of the economy in Victoria? The Reserve Bank says that that accounts for about one per cent at best of the additional fall in employment. The real factors relate to the fact that there was a boom and bust, particularly in the building industry, which had much stronger growth than the rest of Australia in. the late 1980s and then a much bigger crash. This also occurred in the finance and property area and wholesale and retail sales. They are the three areas in which employment has fallen very substantially. They have fallen all around the country, but the degree of the decline is unique to Victoria. I think the reason for that, in turn, has much to do with the decline of confidence in Victoria, which went far beyond that of other States because of the special Victorian factors. No other State lost a building society the way Victoria lost the Pyramid Building Society. Many people thought for a while that they had lost all their savings. No other State had the loss of a State bank, although clearly South Australia has had great difficulties with its State Bank. Those factors have had a special impact on the Victorian economy and the level of confidence. It certainly must account for a major part of the difference in the Victorian economy from the rest of Australia. We could also say that, in many respects, the State Government of Victoria was not responsible for the loss of those institutions. It was not running the Pyramid Building Society; it was being run by entrepreneurs who basically screwed up a financial institution. They ran it in a most inappropriate way for a building society by investing a large proportion of its funds in property rather than housing, and the collapse of the property boom left that institution absolutely unviable. That was not the fault of the Victorian Government; it was the fault of people who were running it. Clearly the Government has to accept some responsibility for the State Bank. But, in effect, it was not running the State Bank or Tricontinental. In the age of deregulation, it gave the State Bank authority to run as a nonnal bank and not to be restricted in the way that it had been in the past. Given its head, the bank made investments which clearly were very unwise. They were investments made not by the Victorian Labor Government; they were investments made by the board of the State Bank and the board of Tricontinental, allowing lending policies to be pursued by that body, which were clearly very unwise. I think the special Victorian factors are clear; they are well known. The Victorian people clearly said last Saturday that the Victorian Government has to bear responsibility for those special Victorian factors. They have made their decision about that. But it does not mean in any way that the Federal Government has to bear responsibility for that. This argument from the honourable member for Higgins about how we could be responsible for the operation of the Pyramid Building Society, which is not under the jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank, the Victorian State Bank or Tricontinental, is the most tenuous of all arguments. These are special Victorian factors, and the special Victorian factors have been addressed in the special Victorian election by the Victorian electors. They will have no impact on the Federal election. We are quite happy to be judged on the policies for which we are responsible, but we absolutely refute that we should be made to wear the responsibility for policies for which we are not responsible. I think it is important to note that the outlook for Victoria is starting to improve. The latest ANZ job vacancy figures are quite encouraging, especially for Victoria. They show an almost 10 per cent increase over the last 12 months, so Victoria's economy does seem to be on the tum. Having gone most deeply into a recession, it is now becoming one of the first to come out. The whole Australian economy has been out of recession for about the last year, although it is obviously experiencing very low growth and still not too many additional jobs are being created. Clearly, the basis for recovery is now established and we can expect .strong growth or at least reasonable growth-from here on. If the Opposition's policies were to be put in place, that would not be the case. For instance, if there were to be a change of government, Mr Kennett would find that Fightback is anything but a great joy for him. He is probably lucky that there will not be a change of government, but if there were to be, he would find that his financial assistance grants would be cut by 5 per cent, which would chop about $150m off his funds. He would have very much less money for public housing, because a Hewson Government would cut back on funds for that. The building better cities program would be abolished, so there would be no funds in that area. Hundreds of millions of dollars which are currently flowing to the Victorian State Government would not be flowing to it under a Hewson Government. The Victorian Government would be forced to cut services more or to increase taxes and charges. Increasing taxes and charges clearly would have an adverse effect on employment growth and economic growth in Victoria. The honourable member for Higgins asked why we have payroll tax in a recession when we do not have substantial job creation. His policy is absurd. It is to take away a payroll tax, which nationally costs about $6 billion, and impose a goods and services tax at a cost of about $27 billion. That $27 billion is a tax on value added. Value added is the difference between the cost of the materials that a company has to work on and the end product. It is the cost of the labour and the profits. A goods and services tax is a tax on labour. The Opposition says it would abolish payroll tax-if the States would let it, but it would have great trouble convincing the States that they should. It would have to bargain its way through it. The States certainly would demand much more than the Opposition is offering in order to get rid of payroll tax. Let us say the Opposition did get rid of payroll tax. It would then abolish a $6 billion tax on employment and put a $27 billion tax on value added, which is mostly employment. In other words, that would mean an additional tax on labour, three or four times what there is at present. The Opposition's great solution to resolving the unemployment problem in this country is to put a much bigger tax on labour. Any economist worth his salt will say that a tax on value added has no different economic impact from that of a tax on the labour input by way of a payroll tax. It a tax on employment. The honourable member for Higgins is sitting there laughing like some sort of idiot, but that is the fact-and he knows it. If he does not know it, he ought to know it. Those opposite are saying, 'We are going to abolish these taxes on inputs, including the payroll tax, and on petrol and the wholesale sales tax and take $20 billion off inputs', but they will put a $27 billion tax on outputs. The net effect will be that there is more tax on business. We have this nonsense about abolishing taxes on business. Those opposite are just taking them off inputs and putting them on outputs, but business still pays those taxes and passes them on to the Australian people. That will mean more costs and high inflation. On the Treasury's calculations this additional tax on employment as well as on profits will mean about 4.9 per cent additional inflation, not counting the road user charge. This is an absolutely looney policy, if those opposite are concerned to try to engender an economic recovery in this country. They promise to put a much bigger tax on employment, to make a big impact on inflation, to make 70 per cent of wage and salary earners worse off and to put bigger taxes on business, and yet they say they have the answer to our economic problems. What a lunatic solution; it is absolute lunacy. There is nothing in the policies of those opposite which is going to get this economy moving. The substantial cutbacks in expenditure will reduce the prospects of economic recovery. There are massive holes in their funding which they continually ignore. They continue to ignore this $6 billion hole that we keep talking about, which is always there. What are they going to do about that? Will they impose more taxes to try to cover the $6 billion hole? Does that mean there will be even less chance of economic recovery? Of course it does. The whole package is an economic disaster and one which will certainly mean for the people of Australia, and the people of Victoria, that there will be far more economic misery under a Hewson Government than there has ever been under is still a Hawke or Keating Government. (TIme expired)",27
126,Mr CHARLES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"La Trobe) (3.37 p.m.)That was a disappointing, limp wrist response to the matter of public importance brought on by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). It was a self-serving apology for failed State Labor government by a failed Federal Finance Minister for a failed Federal Government in this House of Representatives. Last Saturday, Victorians told the ALP that they are sick of economic incompetence and mismanagement. Victorians do not care much for the practical results of Labor governments and what they have done in 10 years of hard be. labour in the State of Victoria. Victoria was once Australia's most dynamic State economy. Victorians, though, have given up on a political philosophy which puts institutions ahead of individuals, which what the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has done. There are three clear reasons why the Victorians rejected the 1980-style government by the Labor Party and its union mates gave a massive mandate to the coalition: firstly, 10 years of economic mismanagement; secondly, a decade of veto authority by trade union leaders and the Trades Hall union bureaucracy; and, thirdly, a transfer of from the private sector to our now bloated public sector. I turn now to economic mismanagement. There are certainly clear parallels that one draw between the general incompetence of the grand old Labor Party in government in Victoria and the grand old Labor federally. We have federally in this nation $150 billion worth of debt. We have over one million registered unemployed, which is That probably more like 1.8 million or 1.9 million people unemployed. By world standards we have very high net interest rates. I remind honourable members that this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) took our real interest rates to sky-rocket proportions and brought on the recession we 'had to have', well in advance of any recession that the rest of the now experiencing. We have a depreciating dollar and we live with reduced credit ratings, both federally and in the State of Victoria. Jeff Kennett and his team have a plan to revitalise Victoria to make it once jewel in the crown that is Australia. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his team have a plan to revitalise our nation. The two plans are quite similar. The Leader a of the Opposition's plan is called Fightback. That is a pretty apt term, is it not? That is what we, the people of this nation, need to do: we need to fight back against the incompetent Federal Labor Government. Victorians sure fought back on Saturday. Wasn't lovely? Those opposite are sitting here crawling now. I bet they are worried. I would We have got Fightback; we have got an investment policy; we have an employment policy. Unions and government in partnership in the State of Victoria, and unions and is government in partnership federally are a disaster for this country. The people know it and have woken up to that fact. A recent survey showed that 50 per cent of voters favour exclusion of trade unions from and negotiations between employers and employees. You bet your life they do! Probably more than that would agree once they see the benefits of real enterprise bargaining, not this airy-fairy stuff we get now jobs where we get a bit of cop on top of award wages and conditions and we write into the contract that, somewhere down the line, we will examine, analyse, consult-we will do all can these things maybe some day-to reduce the nonsense that exists on the factory floors and work sites of many of our mines and inParty dustries around Australia. Fifty per cent of union members believe that unions in this country are too powerful. is an indictment, is it not? Labor ran the mother of all scare campaigns in Victoria on its analysis of so-called negative aspects of Phil Gude's industrial relations policy. That scare campaign failed. It certainly failed in my electorate. The centre of my electorate of La Trobe is the State seat of Monbulk. The member for Monbulk was the Minister for world is Labour and the Minister for School Education, Mr Neil Pope. He failed all right. He lost the seat of Monbulk to Steve MCArthur with a swing of 11 per cent. We won polling booths that we have never won before. again the It was absolutely delightful. Neil Pope infuriated the small business owners in my electorate. We had them on the telephones in tens and hundreds. He tried to tell the community that Phil Gude's industrial relations policy amounted to exploitation. They rang and said, 'Bob, 1 wouldn't do that. 1 could not do that to my people. What is he doing? He is damaging my r(fputation in the community. He is damaging us, damaging business'. That is what Labor governments are good at. They do not understand business; they do not understand commerce, but they sure as hell are good at damaging it. Neil Pope tried to run a very positive election campaign-he left the ALP logo off all his literature. Wasn't that cute? He denied thrice the ALP and his union connections, and he should have, too. We heard a rumour three days before the election that Neil Pope had hired a caravan for three months to go around Australia. Guess what he 'announced yesterday? He said, '1I have got a caravan to go around Australia for three months'. It is delightful stuff-the unions and a failed government in partnership. Under Jeff Kennett and Phil Gude, people in the State of Victoria, and people federally under the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), will not get a partnership of trade unions and a government, because the Australian people are sick to death of it. They want real productivity. . In Victoria that union partnership absolutely stifled action that was necessary by Joan Kirner's failed State Government because all of her Ministers were under constraint by their unions, compounded by their factions, and they would not let her take action which she knew was necessary. She knew the action had to be taken to free up enterprise in Australia. Our now failed Prime Minister, who came to that position having been a failed Treasurer, knows the action he needs to take, but Bill Kelty will not let him take that action. There is no way known that those opposite can do the kinds of things we want to do in Fightback. The Minister for Finance believes in. the GST. He believes in reducing income taxes. He believes in getting rid of payroll tax and fuel excise. He believes in all those things, just as we do. But Bill Kelty will not let him do that, and Ferguson will not let him either. There are many parallels that we can draw between a failed Labor Government in Victoria and a failed Federal Government in Canberra. Let me tell the House a bit about the demographics of the area of Labor's greatest loss and its slaughter. The population of the areas in the outer east of Melbourne that swung are not what are generally termed middle class or well-to-do; they are the workers of this nation who have been thrown on the scrap-heap by an uncaring Federal government and deserted by a failed State Labor government. Manufacturing industry forms the base of much of that area where the greatest swing took place. It was not fooled by the desperate scare campaign run by Neil Pope and his mates. Working men and women, both employees and small business people, are hurting desperately-and on Saturday they made it more than clear who was to blame. Our illustrious Prime Minister moved on Sunday to distance himself from the results, but 1 can tell him that he is part of that result. In the dying days of the Kirner Government he came to Victoria and paraded the supposed successes of Amecon as evidence of how his policies were working, but the people of Victoria were not fooled. They will not be fooled by his scare tactics and his Federal terror campaigns either. A number of State Labor candidates ran on the issue of GST in yet another attempt to frighten Victorians against voting for the coalition. (TIme expired)",31
127,Mr OKEEFE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"1 would like to take a few minutes to enter this matter of public importance discussion. It is a very interesting one. We have had quite a deal of discussion about Victoria. Not much was said about Queensland. 1 must ask the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) whether the Liberal Party won enough seats in Queensland to be a registered party in the Parliament in Queensland. We have not heard the answer to that question yet. He cannot wander in here and say, 'Hey, we have given a real kick in the backside to Labor in Victoria-isn't that terrific?-but we took a real crunch in Queensland. Isn't that terrific too?'. They are State elections and they are fought on State issues. The interesting thing about this is that there is an assumption among honourable members opposite that the voters are not very sophisticated. But voters are very sophisticated. They understand the issues, and they understand the difference between State and Federal issues and the impacts of State and Federal policies. We have seen that with the quite disparate results from Queensland and Victoria. There is a sophistication.. We saw it in the last Federal election, with quite different results in different States. The electorates do not have a very sophisticated way of showing it. When a voter goes into the ballot box, it is either yes or no. What we are looking at, particularly in Victoria-as we have focused on Victoria so strongly todayare the prospects for the next Federal election in Victoria. Let us look at whether or not a sophisticated voter who understands the issues very well will put a tick or a cross in the box. of all, the voters will look at the issue of GST versus jobs. I may not be very sophisticated in my economic understanding, but no-one has ever convinced me that increasing the price of something will create more jobs. I would say that, if prices go up, demand will fall. Therefore, there will be less demand at the factory or wherever, and therefore there will be fewer jobs. Something seems a bit mixed up on the opposite side. Those opposite somehow feel that, if they add $26 billion to the price of the product to the consumer, that is somehow going to create more jobs. That is very interesting. I think a sophisticated voter will have a think about that. The voters of Victoria might wonder whether they want zero tariffs in the car industry. That would mean that a Magna,. a Holden, or a Falcon-cars that are 100 per cent manufactured in Australia-would all of a sudden be exposed to zero tariffs. They know the difference between a coalition that does not care whether there is a motor industry in Australia and a government which is absolutely committed to maintaining the car industry and maintaining its protection-all the workers in the textile industry included. Those opposite should undertake a sophisticated analysis of the results in Victoria last week and ask themselves why in places such as Geelong, for all the coverage, all the presentation, all the doom and gloom thereeven with the failed Pyramid Building Society which, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out today, was being run by the mates of those opposite-the swing against Labor was an average of 31fz per cent. It is because the people in Geelong understand very well that one Ford factory is worth a hell of a lot of Pyramid building societies, and that message is going to wander around. Why do honourable members opposite think people in the western and northern suburbs of Melbourne-for all their anger with the State Labor Government-contained their swings to 2 to 3 per cent coming off the last 1988 State results? Let us get a little more sophisticated and look at the mortgage belt. The honourable member for La Trobe stood up and told us about the swings in his electorate. That is First fine. What happened out in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne-always known as the mortgage belt-at the last Federal election? There was a big swing against Federal Labor. People were hurting because of high interest rates, hurting because of their mortgages. There was a big swing against Federal Labor and it lost about nine seats in that State. There are no more to lose out the honourable member's way. But let us have a look at these people. Where are they now? The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made the point during Question Time, in answer to one of the Opposition's inane questions, that those same people in that mortgage belt have had up to a $300 per month reduction in their mortgage repayments between the last Federal election in March 1990 and the next one next year. I suspect that we will be talking to those people, because those people now know that, if GST is added to their bank bill and to their GST mortgage interest rate, that $300 reduction in their mortgage payment will actually be going back on. The sophisticated voter will be dealing with that. Let us have a look at the question of inflation. The very same people whose wages have increased in real terms in the last 18 months as inflation has fallen to levels of 2 per cent are having all of a sudden to look at a new analysis from the Opposition: where the GST is added, inflation is immediately increased by 4 to 6 per cent, and at the same time those opposite want to reduce their wages. They want to increase inflation. They want a tax on everything they buy, including food. The Catholic Social Welfare Committee has even come out and said that it is not unfair but also amoral. Those opposite would not only put the tax on everything; they want to increase inflation and reduce wages. I think the sophisticated voters in Victoria will be able to work their way through this. We come to another interest group in Victoria-local government. I have a lot of dealings with local government. I have many councils in my electorate. I know what they think about the Opposition's road user charge, its road funding policies and their effect on rates. Let us have a look at local government. There are 210 councils in Victoria right now analysing the effect of the Opposition's policies on their position. First, they are asking themselvesMr Charles-Right behind Fightback.",32
128,Mr OKEEFE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hang on. When, under the Hewson Government, we have these cuts in government spending-this $4 billion to $6 billion that those opposite are claiming they will take out of the Federal Budget-what will councils do? At the moment they receive substantial grants from the Federal Government. They receive substantial amounts of road funds. What do they do? The obvious answer is: either not do the work, which is more jobs lost, or lift their rates. Ordinary people can well work out that cuts in funds to their councils from the Federal Government mean that either the roads get done or they do not, and it means that they will have to pay higher rates. They understand it. They are sophisticated enough to know that you cannot take it out with one hand and put it back with another. I cannot believe that those opposite are out trying to sell this stuff that they go on with about payroll tax. We have worked out-and this has never been disputed by those opposite-that at the moment there are 70,000 to 90,000 companies that actually collect and pay wholesale sales tax to the Australian Taxation Office.. Under the proposal of those opposite, every business that operates some kind of sales outlet, whether a pizza shop or a major distributor, will have to collect and hand in GST. We have worked out that in the vicinity of 1.2 million sales outlets will be dealing with GST. This is supposed to be only making the economy more efficient! At present we have 70,000 collection points; under those opposite it would be 1.2 million. There is one aspect in Fightback that is a jobs plan; it is 20,000 jobs in the Tax Office to administer the paperwork in collecting the GST from all these businesses across Australia. I think the voters are very sophisticated, for all that the Opposition wants to make of the outcome in Victoria. Of course the Victorian State Government was going to get a kick in the backside. I think Joan Kirner has done a tremendous job to retain the vote to the swing that it was. We have to take the lessons from that. The lesson for me in here is that the sophisticated voter is not going to be interested in those opposite at the next Federal election. In fact I have given one of my colleagues here three points in. He has said that I am in trouble, but I have at least a 3 per cent swing back, and I will have a bet with anyone around here on that.",34

130,Mr ROCHER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In considering the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Treasury and the Advance to the Minister for Finance, we should bear in mind some of the ways in which these departments have been used and abused by this Government. The Treasury is one example. The Treasury has entered into the public debate largely by virtue of the analysis that the Government insisted it perform on the coalition's Fightback package. Of course, it did so at the expense of taxpayers. That analysis now forms the basis of the Government's big lie tha- Â·70 per cent of households would be worse off under Fightback. It is a big lie and the Government knows it is a big lie because what the Treasury analysis of Fightback really showed was that all of the 140 cornmunity groups examined by Treasury would be better off under the coalition's proposals. That was the result of the Treasury's initial analysis before Fightback. it went away to fiddle the figures and to give the Government the outcome that the Government insisted it get from Treasury. The process by which the Treasury then worked its way towards the result sought by the Government was a shabby political exercise that deserves to be recounted in full again and again. Although the Treasury found that Fightback would have a lower consumer price index impact than even the coalition had anticipated, Treasury then went on to cook up an entirely new cpr figure with which to carry out its distributional analysis by adding in the coalition's proposed increase of the excise on tobacco. But even with this wrongly inflated cpr figure the Treasury's subsequent distributional analysis showed that not one of the 140 community groups would be worse off under Fightback. This required the Treasury to analyse the impact of some of the coalition's expenditure proposals in an attempt to manufacture some groups of losers under Fightback. This was a partial analysis since the Treasury imputed, which is to say that it picked and chose from a range of expenditure proposals that it would take into account, despite its own admission on another occasion that a partial analysis of the Fightback package would be inadequate. So there we have the double and treble standards. Despite the fiddle, the Treasury could still come up with only two out of 140 community groups that might be worse off.Â· These two groups amounted to a whopping 0.68 per cent-less than one per cent-of the total population taken into account by the Treasury in its distributional tables. In view of this result, the Treasury resorted to the now infamous bracket creep fiddle, to scrounge up the result it needed. But, even with the Treasury's dubious use of bracket creep, the Fightback package still comes out of the Treasury analysis looking good. Firstly, it is not 70 per cent of households, but 70 per cent of those households with full time wage and salary earners, which are supposedly worse off. It is because those households are paying tax that they are caught up in the Treasury's arbitrary bracket creep assumptions. Otherwise, they would still be better off under The really interesting thing about. the Treasury's distribution analysis, however, is that, despite the fiddling of the figures, vast numbers of people are still better off under the dubious Treasury figure, under the coalition's Fightback. One hundred per cent of age pensioner income groups will still be better off. One hundred per cent of the unemployed and those on sickness. benefit will still be better off. Ninety per cent of sole parent and widow income categories will still be better off, as will be 90 per cent of superannuants and self-funded retirees. Of course, in reality, the overwhelming majority of Australians are going to be better off under members. Fightback when one ignores the arbitrary bracket creep assumptions of the Department of the Treasury. If anyone is worse off as a result of the Treasury analysis, it is the Australian taxpayers who were obliged to fund this ridiculous Treasury exercise on behalf of the Government in pursuit of its ambition to get re-elected. The Government is entitled to take advice from the Commonwealth bureaucracy-of course it is-and to make use of that advice for its legitimate purposes of government. What it is not entitled to do, however, is to hijack the name and reputation of a Commonwealth department such as the Treasury for its own political advantage. The Government should have presented the analysis prepared by Treasury as its own analysis even though Treasury carried out the bulk of the work. Of course, the problem is that no-one would believe anything coming out of this Government, which is why it had to hide behind the good name of the Treasury in order to get away with its outrageous distortions and misrepresentations. The Government has sought to imply that the coalition's Fightback package has been subject to independent analysis by the Commonwealth Treasury with the results that I have mentioned already. More ominously, because no-one believes this Government any more, the Government's actions have called into question the integrity and reputation of the Commonwealth Treasury. Within the Treasury portfolio we have the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose reputation and integrity have suffered heavily during the term of this Government. It seems that hardly a day goes by without a member of the Reserve Bank board, having been appointed by this Government, making some sort of attack on coalition policy. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, for a long time was guilty of making remarks that could easily be interpreted, and often were interpreted, as criticisms of coalition policy. He has long since crossed over that line, however, and lately has been guilty of outright interference in the political process, along with some other Reserve Bank board It is essential to the conduct of monetary policy that the Reserve Bank be a credible and respected authority. Without that credibility and without the respect of economic actors, both in Australia and OW'"" seas, an anti-inflationary monetary policy ,; simply not possible, except by accident, as we find is the case as a result of the Government's deliberate recessionary policies. Certain members of the Reserve Bank board have done this country a great disservice by allowing their positions of authority to be used for partisan political purposes. There is also a strong argument for removing some of the undue influence of th- Treasury from the Reserve Bank, by removing the Secretary to the Treasury from the Reserve Bank board. It was the mishandling of monetary policy at the behest of the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that was primarily responsible for the recession from which we are now struggling to emerge. We should therefore attach considerable importance to reforming the processes by which monetary policy in Australia is determined. The New Zealand example is an important one in this regard. It is worth noting what the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had to say in its monetary policy statement of September 1990, since it backs up a lot of what the coalition has been saying about the importance of reforming the conduct of monetary policy. That statement said of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989: The Act is based squarely on the weight of New Zealand and international evidence which suggests that 'price stability is the single most valuable contribution that monetary policy can make to New Zealand's economic and social welfare, and the only contribution that is likely to endure. That is the position being put by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on behalf of the coalition. I think it is something we could well dwell on and I would ask that the Government start getting its act in order and stop exploiting members of the Reserve Bank board, and certainly the Treasury, in the way it has and, in doing so, bringing that bank into great disrepute.",35
131,Dr CATLEY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Adelaide) (4.08 p.m.)These Appropriation Bills are part of the larger Budget strategy which the Government is using to provide direction to the development of Australia into the 1990s. They illustrate the cutting edge of the debate with the Opposition about the role to be played in goveffiing Australia by the market mechanism on the one hand and public policy and national objectives on the other. This dispute arises at both a macro and a micro level. In these Appropriation Bills at the macro level, Government policy will produce an economic stimulus of a $13 billion deficit which concentrates on developing the nation's transport skills and social welfare infrastructure; whereas the Opposition would like us to slash Government programs, hence stalling the upswing of the business cycle and destroying the welfare maintenance and equitable income transfer policies represented by the Budget in the health, child-care, training, income transfer and other spheres. These differences show up in the broad . Budget strategy but they also show up in the more careful and minute scrutiny of each department represented in these Appropriation Bills. Today we are talking about the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Treasury. I should say as an aside, in response to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who spoke previously, that the public of Australia is entitled have both Government and Opposition programs costed by Treasury officials in the careful scrutiny which they are able to provide, to look at the credibility of their income-generating and expenditure patterns and to see whether there are any holes. They do this for governments of all political persuasions. They do it with every Budget and they do it with every economic statement. The public is entitled to see a similar estimate made of any Opposition statement, particularly when it runs to 650 pages and encompasses everything that one can envisage being dealt with in public policy. This is what the Treasury did. It found holes, and of course Opposition is groping. I wish to look at four items in the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Treasury appropriations, particularly the agenda for women, industry policy, multiculturalism and social justice. If one looks at the PM and C appropriation, one sees an allocation of $3.2m to women's programs. It is apparently a small amount but it is one which ensures that the agenda for women is at the forefront in the thinking of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Historically, women have been disadvantaged by the operation of the market mechanism in this country. They have had fewer opportunities in education, they have been paid less money, often for doing the same job and, until it was abolished by a Federal Labor government, they had lower award rates. They have had a lower level of access to superannuation and th-ir chances of promotion in almost every sphere of economic activity have been lower. These situations have been greatly worsened when they have been performing the roles of both mother and worker. Market outcomes, in short, did not serve women well if they aspired to a role other than that of a non-working wife. It is absolutely no use whatsoever ignoring this fact, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) did in his address to a Liberal women's conference on 2 July this year when he said: Treating women as women almost by definition implies that women are different. Treating women as people means that women and men by definition start on equal footing, I can only believe that he has been asleep for to the last 20 years. The entrenched prejudices against women in various areas of social life, particularly in the work force, have been vehemently fought against for the last 20 years by the modem femmist movement 'and by this Government for nearly a decade. Some amelioration of inequalities faced by women in social life has been inÂ· evidence. For example, of the 1.6 million new jobs created since 1983, despite the present recession, about 60 per cent have been filled by women. As a result, our labour participation rate is among the highest in the world and, as part consequence, we have a higher unemployment rate than we would have done the with a similar participation rate to that of John Howard in 1982, which has added about 4 per cent-from 6 to 1O-to our nominal unemployment rate. These jobs have in part resulted from a quicker economic growth rate during the last 10 years, than the previous 10 years, and from the reforms designed to make improvements in social access and equity for women. Child-care places, for example, have been increased from 40,000 to 160,000, with 50,000 more to follow by 1995. These have been targeted at low to middle income parents through a system of fee relief and operational subsidies. By moving to tax deductions and lower subsidies, and taking $30m out of the child-care system, the Opposition would make it that much harder for women to access the work force. As I told a child-care conference organised by the South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last week, this would mitigate and set on itS heels a very effective mechanism for enabling women, if they so desire, to get back mto the work force. Similarly, if one looks at female equality outcomes in health, education and access to income levels, one finds that it requires intervention by government against the market mechanism to push in the direction of equality for women. The Opposition seeks to abolish those very agencies in government which we see funded in the Appropriation Bill, notably the Affmnative Action Agency, established in 1986; the equal pay unit in the Department of Industrial Relations; the work and family unit; and the Office of the Status of Women-the very agencies that are out there intervening in the market to try to ensure access and equity for women. The market alone will not do these things. The last 10 years have seen this process of assaulting market mechanisms in order to improve the situation for women. Treating them the same as men is to ignore 100 years of deep prejudice against certain roles being performed by women. I note the importance of maintaining these programs. While they are relatively cheap in terms of the overall Budget, they are an important symbol of this Government's commitment to equality for women within the national agenda for them. A similar tale may be told in the industry policy sphere. In line 675, dealing with the Department of the Treasury, we see $22m allocated to the Industry Commission. This body is one of the major institutions through also which the Commonwealth Government creates and operates its industry policy. The tariff is not the only policy tool but historically it has been a very important agency of industry policy in this country, together with industrial relations and capital markets access. The Industry Commission has been used by this Government as a major research body to determine the level and structure of assistance that should be granted to different industries in intervention of the operation of the free market. Among these, very importantly, has been car production. From the mid-1980s, the car industry has been subject to the so-called Button plan which has used tariff cuts, labour market reforms and import-export trade-offs to reduce the number of car models produced in Australia to get their quality up, their price down and to enhance their import capacity. Two or three years ago the Industry Commission reviewed the progress of this plan and, generally speaking, approved the resultant movements that were taking place but suggestedÂ· some further tariff cuts to a nominal 15 per cent by the mid-1990s. This followed exhaustive inq-iries into the industry and talks with many of the producers in it-it was not something which was dreamt up in an office in Canberra; it followed quite exhaustive investigations and discussions with people actually involved in making motor cars, It was a recommendation based on government intervention to produce a via?le domestic car industry, on the one hand, which would shed some of its least efficient producers and cars and components, on the other hand, but would maintain an industry producing a smaller number of automo?ile models in a better, cheaper and more effiCIent way. It was to be the planned application of the market. mechanism regulated by the Government. In the end, these proposals went to the Government and it determined that the Industry Commission report was a little too radical-and, again, making the assessment of how it could maintain an automobile production industry in this country, but one which would be producing more efficiently for the consumers, workers and balance of payments of this country by enhancing its capacity to export-the Government decided that the target of 15 per cent tariffs for the mid-1990s would be pushed out to the year 2000. This would mean, combined with the export-import trade-off which had been operating very effectively to produce enhanced export capacity and intentions in the automobile industry, a real effective protective tariff regime of 35 per cent. The important point to note is that this was a plan formulated carefully and thought about with social objectives which uses government intervention to regulate the free operation of the market. In August 1990, at about the time that the Industry Commission was to report on this industry but apparently in complete ignorance of it, the Opposition announced that it would go to zero tariffs by the year 2000 if it were elected. It has not yet-two years laterannounced the steps that it will take to meet this target. It has also given no indication as to what of the present car industry it expects to survive if zero tariffs were to be introduced. In some statements it suggests that it does not, and cannot, know because it is not its decision. In other statements it says that if nothing in the car industry survives it is not rea-ly its business. (TIme expired)",37
132,Mr MACKELLAR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In relation to the estimates for the Department of the Treasury, I wish to raise a matter concerning the administration of an agency within the Australian Taxation Office. I am talking about the Child Support Agency. I will briefly inform the Committee of the background to the matter which I wish to raise before I go on to a more critical analysis of the Child Support Agency. I was contacted by one of my constituents whose daughter's marriage unfortunately came to an end in 1990. In May of that year the Family Court at Parramatta issued an order requiring the husband of the marriage to contribute an amount towards the support of the son. In the 17 months since the order was made, only one payment was received and that was in November 1990. Since the date of the original order, the daughter of my constituent had frequent contact with the agency in a bid to secure regular payment of the commitment. My constituent says: The contact with the Agency has been marked by inertia, bungling, rudeness and lack of results. His daughter took up the matter with her local member, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay), and the honourable member's office secured an apology from the agency and a promise of action. That was in July 1991. Following that apology and promise of action, the agency said it would ensure that 'the appropriate follow-up action quickly takes place'. But no payment was received following that letter. My constituent says that the staff at the honourable member's office agreed with his daughter that she should consider contacting The Investigators. Unfortunately, the honourable member's staff now ignore her telephone calls and her last call to the agency ended when the contact officer hung up the telephone during the conversation. At all times this constituent's daughter had made known to the agency the address of the husband and his employment details. My constituent states that the husband: '. . . is in a stable residential situation and also in stable employment. He receives, apparently, a substantial regular salary. That letter was written to me in October 1991. I wrote immediately to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator MCMullan) on 30 October drawing the matter to his attention. I concluded my letter by saying: I believe that some action can be taken to improve the situation for those women who rely on these payments to make ends meet and the irregularity of the payments does little to enhance their financial security. I would be grateful for your examination of this matter and your assistance in having it resolved satisfactorily. That was on 30 October 1991. I wrote again to the Parliamentary Secretary on 13 May 1992, advising him that I had written to him on 30 October. I said: It is now seven months since I wrote to you, the situation remains unchanged ... I would be grateful for your urgent response to this matter. There was no reply. I wrote to him on 31 August 1992 and I concluded by saying: Having received no further advice I wrote to you again on 13 May ... To date no acknowledgment or reply has been received to my representations. As it is almost twelve months since I wrote to you I now ask when might I expect to receive an answer? I wrote that letter to Senator MCMullan on 31 August this year. I did get a reply from Senator MCMullan on 8 September, in which he says: As is usual in these matters, I sought the comments of the Child Support Registrar. A further summons has issued through the local court, for maintenance which has accrued between the period 1 August 1991 to 1 February 1992. The Child Support Agency is actively pursuing all available methods to secure payment ... However, payment of maintenance can only be made where a payment is actually received by the Child Support Agency. I trust this information is of assistance to you. This reply was dated 8 Septeml,Jer 1992almost a year after I was in touch with him in October 1991-and still the daughter of my constituent has not received any child maintenance. I understand that the CSA was established in 1988 and it is said to be generally doing a good job. This is indicated by the fact that before the agency began less than 30 per cent of maintenance was being paid. I believe the agency is now collecting 70 per cent. The average maintenance payment per child has risen from $27 per week in 1988 to about $50 per week at present. I do not make any assumptions about that. I am told that a Federal parliamentary inquiry of February 1992, which was headed by Justice Fogarty, reported favourably on the scheme. It is estimated that 2,000 new clients per week are being added to the agency. That is a comment on marriage breakdown within this community, which is a very sad indictment of the state of the situation regarding marriage in Australia. Having said that, in the face of those encouraging statistics the example of my constituent's daughter comes to mind very starkly. It is well over 18 months since this case was brought to the attention of the Child Support Agency. It has been through the offices of two members of parliament. Unfortunately, it seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary was very dilatory in dealing with my letter of 30 October last year. It took me almost a year to get something out of the agency through him, and even then the agency has not done anything to alleviate the circumstances of my constituent's daughter. The main criticisms of the agency that I receive in my electorate office are that it is too slow, it is rigid and bureaucratic, it is totally inflexible in adjusting or correcting errors, its decisions sometimes appear arbitrary and ill-explained, and it is often suggested that the agency is under-staffed. If it is a fact that the estimated 2,000 new clients per week are being added to the agency, obviously the question of its staffing needs urgent attention because we are dealing with a situation in which many people are in very critical financial circumstances. If we have a situation repeated, such as that being experienced by my constituent's daughter, the agency is simply not doing its job. I would suggest to the Government that whilst there is a real need for an organisation such as the Child Support Agency, and I am glad that Justice Fogarty found favourably in relation to its operations, a great deal more attention needs to be paid to the administration, the staffing and the work of the agency if it is to fulfil its basic function of providi-g services to those whose special needs are brought to its attention. In raising the question of the agency and its administration within the estimates that we are debating here this afternoon, I hope that the Government will look very clearly and closely at how the agency is actually functioning and whether it is effectively carrying out its charter of providing support for people who often find themselves in very real financial problems.",39
133,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and republic Cabinet, I want to focus on some words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) Tonight himself. We meet here today in the wake of the great Liberal-National Party victory in Victoria with the largest swing in the postwar period which savaged former Premier Joan Kirner and the Australian Labor Party. Those sympathetic to the Labor Party generally would see that election as fought on State issues but, as Glenn Milne, the Australian change. newspaper's political editor put it under heading 'Voters hate bad economics', the significant message of the Kennett victory is that 'voters will not tolerate failed economic policies'. That includes Federal policies as well as State. That is precisely what the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blax land, embodies: the failure of his economic policy manifested in the recession we had have, and in the highest levels of In unemployment since the Great Depression. When one counts underemployment as as unemployment, in the order of 111z million Australians and their families are affected with all the tragedy and deprivation that involves. But, what is more, the Government has no comprehensive, concerted program, plan to address the deep-seated problems this country. The first and foremost problem is tragic unemployment. Second is the slide debt problems. in Australian living standards so that we are set to be the first generation of Australians who pass on to our children a lower standard of living than we ourselves received. Third, is the problem of the vast and disabling overseas debt, which currently totals $200 billion if one includes net equity liabilities as about well as debt in a strict sense, and all that that involves. There is no plan but rather there is just the prescription of more of the same plus a stimulus, and the groundless faith that all will be fine. It has always been the line that things will be fine-when, in fact, the truth is that they will not be fine until we start to make some fundamental changes. We can go back over this Prime Minister's own words. I start back in 1987 when, over in the provisional Parliament House following the banana statement of 1986, as the Treasurer of the bringing in the Budget he said: I can report that Australia is winning. In 1988 he said: . . . thls is the one that brings home the bacon. The Prime Minister seems to have developed a particular interest in this area. In 1989, Mr Keating, the then Treasurer, said: Australia is entering a golden era of economic the In 1990 in the election he said: I won't let there be a recession. He was very emphatic and yet he knew that his policy of business interest rates greater than 20 per cent for more than a year would - . bring without any doubt the very recession which, when it really hit, he said: to That was the recession we had to have. the previous session of the Parliament the Prime Minister was still conveying this impression that things would be fine. In that well incredible speech to the Press Club he mounted an all out attack on the coalition's comprehensive plan to come to grips with that Australia's great challenges; that is, the Fightback package. He said scarcely a word no about what he or the Government would do of about reforming Australia's economy and overcoming our tragic unemployment and",40
134,Mr COBB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"They have no answers. Â·Dr HARRY EDWARDS-That is the only deduction one can make. A specific charge that the Prime Minister mounted both in the last sitting week and in the Press Club address the coalition's Fightback program was: . . . it would put the entire economy at risk to deliver one political objective-a 30 per cent marginal income tax rate for most taxpayers. The way that reads there seems to be a question mark over that particular objective itself. But I would strongly assert that that is a most desirable objective, particularly from the point of view of creating incentive. Incentive is at the core of the Fightback package. What we offer is an income tax structure in which from an income of $20,700 per annum all the way to $50,000 the marginal rate of tax is 30 per cent. That would cover something like 95 per cent of Australian taxpayers. Incidentally, when one thinks of the sort of support expressed for the BjelkePetersen flat rate of 20 or 25 per cent, our proposed tax table would involve an average tax rate of only 20 per cent or less right up about $40,000. This is a very important proposal. But the tax cut objective is not only our view- it is also the Government's view, because the Government has pursued the same objective of a 30 per cent marginal rate for most taxpayers from the February One Nation statement right through to its desperation moves in the sales tax amendment Bills which were introduced in the last sitting week. Those Bills were brought into dredge out an extra $4.5 billion towards the financing of that sort of marginal tax rate. Terry MCCrann described them rightly as, 'Prime Minister plums the depths of cynicism'. In that reference to Fightback creating difficulties to achieve one political objective, I stress that the Fightback program is not focused on a single objective-although there may be only one that occupies the Prime Minister's mind. The coalition is primarily concerned with restoring strong and sustainable economic growth and thereby real jobs for all Australians-two million by the end of this decade. In the tax area-which is just one part of the 20 point coalition plan along with antiinflation policy, industrial relations reform involving real enterprise bargaining, microeconomic reform and so on-the Opposition proposes also a goods and services tax. The Prime Minister claims that the Government can deliver its tax cuts without the goods and services tax. I doubt that.",41
135,Mr COBB,ASSENT TO BILLS,He must be Mandrake.,42
136,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"He must be Mandrake, as my colleague says. But the Poles Apart document further claims that there is a choice between jobs and a goods and services tax. There was a headline in the Australian saying, 'It is GST or jobs, Labor warns'. That is absolute hogwash-pun intended. The coalition's goods and services tax will enable us to abolish wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, petrol tax and the other archaic and distorting consumption taxes, in effect, that currently exist. The goods and services tax is an integral part-not the be-all and endto all, but an integral part-of the coalition's total program for strong sustainable growth and jobs. It is not a case of GST or jobs, but GST as part of a total program for jobs. The essential point is that with the abolition of those taxes we can strip away millions of dollars of cost burden on industry, and in particular on goods to be exported and goods to compete with imports. So, there will be increased production in Australia of export goods and the goods that compete with imports. This will lead to more jobs. By increasing exports and minimising imports the program will attack our balance of payments problem and our great and burgeoning debt. I want to stress that this is a total program for restoring economic growth and jobs which the Australian people, I am certain, strongly support. (TIme expired)",42
137,Mr SCHOLES,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No.1), I do not want to go into a long debate about the goods and services tax. We will have many opportunities to talk about that, and there are not many opportunities to debate the matters I wish to raise. I would like to remind those honourable gentlemen who have such blind faith in current economic fads that Britain has a goods and services tax but is not doing very well; Italy has just imposed $75 billion worth of cuts in its support services, some of which Australia will pay for particularly because of adjustments to Italian pensions; New Zealand has a goods and services tax but is not doing very well; and the United States has a right wing government of the same philosophy as honourable members opposite which is about to be removed or at least severely censured. There are no magic solutions and everyone knows that, including honourable gentlemen opposite. I seem to remember the same speeches being made by exactly the same honourable members in 1975. In 1983 those opposite were thrown out because they still had not got around to working out what they were talking about in 1975. Recently the High Court took a decision, correctly or incorrectly, relating to free speech. I have some serious concerns about the long tenn implications of that decision. Firstly, one wonders what the tenn 'free speech' means when we talk of free speech at $2,000 a second. It is supposed to reflect the expression and communication of political views when in fact, no matter which party is involved, it is a cut and paste job by an advertising agency which almost without question in noÂ· way relates to the political process or to any of the policies of the parties concerned. I make that point because I think the movement of the High Court into the interpretation of matters which are not necessarily spelled out in the Constitution, moving in the direction of the American Supreme Court, is extremely dangerous. While in Europe last year I followed a number of the Senate hearings on the appointment of Mr Justice Thomas. I watched them on television as they were broadcast ad infinitum. I have to say it was certainly a demeaning experience for anybody who had reached a stage in life where he should have been either accepted or rejected as a person suitable for appointment to the highest court in that land. It was demeaning because Mr Justice Thomas was not questioned on his legal qualifications, his experience in jurisprudence or his likely ability as a judge; his appointment was being based on his likely political or social attitudes to questions where the Supreme Court of the United States, and not the Congress of the United States, exercises the political power and makes the political judgments-and, in fact, legislates. I would hate to see our High Court move in that direction. I would hate to see a situation where this Parliament felt that it had to take unto itself that sort of cross-examination or that sort of questioning of people chosen to go to the highest court in the land. We all dispute some of its decisions, but generally High Court judges in Australia have achieved a great deal of respect. If the Court moves itself into the political arena, then it must expect that the political process will move into the courts. This is not necessarily to the benefit of either. One would hope that the courts in this country can remain independent of the political process. I repeat what I said before: I have grave doubts about this judgment in which the High Court chose to express its view, but I will not criticise it here. I have to say that a 30-second political advertisement does not really seem to me to be an expression of free speech. The vast majority of Australians could not even get on television once in a lifetime-they would have to sell their house to do so. The other matter I wish to speak on is a matter raised by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar). It relates to the Family Court. I have no solutions to the problems confronting the Family Court, but I do believe that the whole operation of the Family Law Act and the Family Court should be looked at-probably not by this Parliament but by the next Parliament. We should have a very long look at the Act, at the enonnous degree of bitterness coming out of that Court, and at the way in which some of the judgments and some of the legislation is affecting the lives of ordinary Australians, people who have lived nonnal lives until an event which unfortunately occurs too often, the break-up of a marriage, suddenly becomes an almost wartime battleground between two individuals. As it is operating at the moment the Family Court appears to have no reconciliation role. It certainly does nothing to mitigate the circumstances in which a separation is taking place. The procedures which exist certainly make the way in which some non-custodial parents, to use the correct tenn, are being required to live subsequent to a break-up almost impossible. A lot of questions need to be resolved and there are no easy answers. It important to draw to the attention of the House the fact that the system is not working at the moment. As I remember it took three years for the Family Law Act to go through this Parliament; it may have been even longer. To commence a review at this stage of the Parliament would not necessarily achieve much, but I believe one of the most important things for the next Parliament to deal with is how that Act can be made to work better. In my opinion it is not a matter which impinges on party politics. Some of the worse aspects of the Act were passed here in good faifh by majorities, and I think the time and effort put into it by individual members may well have been thought to have been in everyone's best interests, but the Act is not working and we have to look at it. As it is considered to be non-party and as the votes from the House will be non-party we will have to look at it as a Parliament, not as a group of individuals. Certainly I do not think the House will accept a Government-imposed solution to a serious social issue. I have one other point that I would like to make. I have heard two honourable members so far in this debate make reference to decisions with respect to the current generation and what we pass on to our children. I remember that the Commonwealth Bank Board in 1930 and 1931 took a decision not to allow the Government of the day to borrow money in order to finance a budget deficit, a procedure which was subsequently undertaken by the Roosevelt Administration in the New Deal in order to try to create jobs. The result in Australia was not in the best . interests of the country. At that time the Commonwealth Bank Board was not capable of being qirected by the Government, and an opposition Senate agreed with the board. The Government had to cut. across-the-board almost all of its areas of expenditure. right for people now to say that this will be the first government to pass on to its children a country which is in a worse' condition than it was received. It may well be that if we had not had a Second World War the mess that was created by the bad decisions of the Commonwealth Bank Board, and upheld for several years by governments in this country, would not have been resolved by now. The Second World War is all that pulled us out of the 1930s Depression, nothing else, and I do not think that any of us want a third world war to end this recession. We need soundÂ· government policies which can be pursued.Â· I make the point, as I did at the start, that'there is no evidence that a VAT or a GST has worked in any of the countries in which it is being used at the moment.",42
138,Mr COBB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I would like to open with some remarks about the speech of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). He said that the GST is not working in New Zealand. I do not know whether he has been to New Zealand recently, but when I was there last, as was the position when other members from this side of the House were there, it was working brilliantly. The country . is leaping out of its skin. New Zealand was almost a basket case 10 or 15 years ago, and now it is winning contracts hands down from Australian companies on just about everything it is tendering for over here. The GST and the industrial relations package that it has put in place have rationalised the taxation system over there, restored incentive and got the number of trade union strikes down to almost record low levels, as I understand it. It is somewhere between 10 and 11 months since the coalition launched the GST Fightback package. We are now within two years of having a GST Fightback package in this country up and running, as the first day it will be operating from will be 1 October 1994. I for one think that is a very exciting thing to contemplate. The effect that it has had on this country and on this Government since the launch has been quite dramatic. I have noticed in my electorate where I have It is all gone around and explained it-we had a meeting of 600-odd in Dubbo last week-that people have embraced it very willingly indeed. But since the launch of the Fightback package, it has had a very dramatic effect on the Government. We have had three Treasurers since it was launched. All of them have fallen either directly or indirectly as a result of that package which has been brought down-and I am referring to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). We have also had one Prime Minister fall, whose fall perhaps was coming but it was certainly hastened because of the Fightback package as he could not answer the magnificent things contained in it. At the next election I think: another Prime Minister brought down as a result of it as well. I have noticed since the package launched that in Question Time 80 by my calculations, of the questions from If Government members to their own Ministers you have seemed to precipitate a wailing and gnashing of the teeth against the GST. The Ministers seem absolutely obsessed with it. is all they seem to talk about in Question Time. Given half a chance, or even no chance at all, they inevitably get on to the GST the Fightback package and try to bag it and tries manufacture some excuse as to why it will not work. It gets a run in the media and then dies away, never to be heard of It again. It appears to me that Government members have no policies of their own that they want reform. to talk about at all. All they can talk about our policies-the GST. It is contained in speeches. Even the previous speaker started off by talking about the GST and finished talking about the GST. No doubt as this Â· debate continues later this afternoon and tion) tax: through the' night we will have Government First,Â· members talking not about their own policies but about tJte GST and saying what a dreadful thing it is. It almost makes one suspect that the policy is even better than one knows that it is. Dr Harry, Edwards-They protest much.",44
139,Mr COBB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"They do protest too much. atinue Despite all this energy that they to try to knock this package, despite all the fear and angst that it seems to be generating structure amongst them, they either still do not will understand the package or they do understand Â· it and are representing it in a dishonest also fashion as to how it will work. I think: that there is no more expedient and dishonest exponent of how the package work than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself. I sat there today listening to him in Question Time saying almost the opposite of our what I think he actually believes only to tum back to some of his statements 1985 when he was the greatest exponent of this type of taxation reform in this country. we will see On 12 May 1985 he said: The purpose of tax reform is unambiguously to redistribute the burden of taxes, not to facilitate an was increase in that burden. per cent, On 4 June that year he said: we don't as a nation adopt this proposal, then won't see significant reform in this country in taxation for the balance of this century. It How true that is. We have seen the mess that the Government is in at the moment by trying to reform the wholesale sales, tax system and difficulties it is getting into. The more it to reform, the further the difficulties it finds itself in. At the National Press Club on for a day 5 June that year he said: is now well recognised that the Australian tax system is unfair. It is also widely appreciated that it encourages inefficiency and is extraordinarily complex. Clearly there is a need for action: for is Â· .. We must stop dealing with symptoms. The tax their laws are in need of radical surgery. up Later in that speech he said: .. There are three main advantages of (consumpit will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector. Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same too potential for this purpose. Third, it generates tax from those who will conto evade or avoid income tax. That provides useful 'net dividend' for distribution to the rest are putting in of the community. , . . The virtually zero exemption, single rate of the tax is a crucial design feature. It assist both administration and compliance. . . For business, this is a simple tax. They will benefit from no longer carrying the cost of the wholesale tax which they pay and have to finance on their stocks. will Later in that speech he said: ,"" , , For too long the politically unpalatable decisions have been put off in this country because politicians have not had the strength of purpose in. One has to tackle the hard issues, in There it is-wi overwhelmingly strong endorsement of what the coalition is advocating today. I want to quote once more from the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. On 7 June 1985 in Melbourne he said: Â· . . All of us, especially those in positions of influence, have I believe, an important duty to ensure that the debate in the lead-up to the taxation summit remains on this higher plane. Â· .. We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice. And 'we should realise that some people will be trying to do just this. Â· .. It would be all too easy to let the discussion collapse to the lowest common denominator. The emotive claim of the screaming headline will always be a strong temptation. But the question is whether we have, as a nation, the maturity to pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve such overdue change. I have no doubt that, unless this climate is acted upon, tax reform will be thrown back into the too hard basket for another 20 to 30 years at iinmense cost to the vast majority of Australians. If that were John Hewson speaking, one could understand it, but that is the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, speaking back in 1985. I can tell honourable members now that he has not changed his mind. He still believes that this is the best way to go, but he has to be expedient about it and tell us the opposite to what he actually believes. It is a very sad situation that we are in. The Prime Minister is not only saying things like this, but also he is changing his mind on policy matters. There was no greater advocate of lowering tariffs. He was telling Senator Button to hurry up and get on with the job in the car industry. What is he doing today when he finds himself in a desperate position? He is saying that we have to maintain tariffs at a higher level than the coalition is proposing. Those who have analysed the debate thoroughly since the Prime Minister did a back flip in this area can see that the car industry now has some future under a coalition government. It will be able to sell its cars cheaper, which will mean that it will sell more cars; it will have more efficient work practices, which will make it internationally competitive; and it will be able to export cars on a proper footing, which we are not able to do now, except by using various devices. We are also giving the car manufacturers up-front benefits worth hundreds of millions of dollars by abolishing payroll tax, sales tax, fuel excise and things such as this. The car industry manufacturers should be embracing it, as is everybody else in Australia. The more the Australian people analyse our policies on this side of the House, the more they can see that the GST Fightback package has the answers for Australia, whereas the Government policies, which amount to no policies, mean more of the same-longer queues and a more desperate economy.

140,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Before I call the next speaker, I note that, during his speech, the honourable member for Parkes used a term which I think would be generally regarded as unparliamentary.

144,Mr WILSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In debating this section of the Budget, I want to deal with matters that relate to the retirement incomes policy. It comes very much to mind in this section of the Budget, as the Australian Taxation Office is being given responsibility by the present Government to collect the superannuation tax levy. In one form or another, the retirement incomes policy has, since Federation, been a perennial issue on the agenda of this Parliament. Over the years, there have been debates about many topics related to it: for example, the desirability of a universal pension scheme as opposed to a selective or means tested provision; the desirability of flat rate pensions as opposed to earnings related ones; the desirability of simple as opposed to complicated eligibility tests; the desirability of funded schemes as opposed to unfunded ones; the desirability of schemes which encourage personal responsibility as opposed to those which expand public sector dependency; and the desirability of allowing Australians personal control over their savings and choice as to how they are best invested as opposed to the conscription into the hands of fund managers over which they have little, if any, control. For a long time. I have been an advocate of a universal approach to a retirement incomes policy. All Australians must be assured of a reasonable standard of living in retirement. The role of government should be to help and encourage all who are able to take responsibility for providing their own retirement incomes. But those who do should not be penalised for doing so. The self-reliant should not be burdened by taxes imposed to fund the retirement incomes of those who could afford to be self-reliant but choose, for whatever reason, not to do so. Those who fulfil their responsibility to provide their own retirement incomes should be fully compensated for relieving the Government of expenditure it would otherwise incur. One approach would be to pay the age pension to everyone. Another is to make payment of such a pension an alternative to a preretirement tax incentive for private provision for retirement, with the value of tax incentives being equal to the capital value of the age pension. Since the age pension was first introduced, eligibility has nearly always been the subject of a means test of one kind or another: a double means test, a combined means test, a tapered means test, an income means test or an income and assets means test. All these methods of so-called targeting have had serious adverse side effects. They have distorted normal work patterns; they have distorted normal consumption patterns; they have distorted normal savings patterns; and they have distorted normal investment patterns. People do behave in a rational way. They adjust to optimise their situation. If, at some time in the past, the universal approach had been adopted and a flat rate pension paid to every residentially qualified Australian citizen, government expenditure on age pensions could well have been substantially less than it is today. If this course had been followed long before now, we would surely have questioned the appropriateness of continuing with earnings related tax concessions to those providing themselves with retirement incomes above the universal flat rate pension. If we had wanted to encourage saving in this way, the right to a flat rate pension could have been made convertible into tax relief in recognition of long term saving for retirement. When Labor came to office in 1983, four out of five of those of pensionable age were in receipt of a part or full pension. The direct cost of abolition of the age pension income test could have been less than the indirect cost to the economy of its retention. Labor's action to limit those costs still further has given us a retirement incomes scheme which is a mishmash of complex and confusing arrangements-confusing to pensioners and self-funded retirees. Pensioners have more difficulty than ever before understandingÂ·the assets and incomes tests. Many of those with super entitlements are forced to seek advice from experts, who themselves have difficulty coping - ith the legislative nightmare put in place by the present Government. Age pensions are paid at a flat rate; they are not earnings related. On the other hand, the reasonable benefit limits imposed as a precondition to the favourable tax treatment of superannuation savings are earnings related. Under the system of RBLs, the greatest benefit flows to those with the highest income. It is amazing that a government which seeks to justify so many of its actions on social justice grounds should continue to offer huge tax breaks to those with very high incomes. Labor gives to those earning $90,000 a year superannuation tax concessions worth about $57,000; but to those earning $30,000 a year, tax concessions worth only $8,700. Labor's retirement incomes policy is based on the assumption that people cannot be trusted to manage their own affairs or discharge their responsibilities to provide for their retirement. Its latest act of State paternalism has been to legislate to garnishee a portion of every worker's wages. This money taken from their pay packets is syphoned to a small group of powerful fund managers with an unreliable promise that contributors will be better off than if they had managed their,own savings. This anointed oligopoly of fund managers holds these conscripted savings until contributors reach retirement. Until contributors are denied the opportunity of using their long term savings in a manner which enables them to determine how those savings might best be invested. The Liberal Party offers an alternative in Fightback policy. In developing our retirement incomes policy, we have abandoned the selectivity approach and adopted universality as the basis of our approach to the solution of a problem not solved by means tests. The main features of our policy are the retention of the compulsory employer contributions at about 3 to 4 per cent; capping of lump sum entitlements; access to superannuation for casual and part time employees and people outside the paid work force; abolition of lump sum tax; protection of lump sum entitlements accrued up to 1984; introduction of a tax refund of up to $1,500 for singles and $3,000 for couples on superannuation contributions of up to $6,000 and $12,000 per annum respectively; the right to carry forward unused tax refund contribution entitlements; the availability of retirement savings accounts and other low cost alternatives with the same tax concessions as superannuation funds; and access to accrued superannuation benefits for the purposes of first home purchases. In the remaining moments that I have available to me, I want to stress what we say about retirement income savings accounts and other low cost alternatives. I believe that every Australian should have the right to directly control his or her own retirement savings. What is the public policy concern in the way in which I invest my retirement savings? The concern, surely, should be limited to my commitment that I will not expect other taxpayers to pay taxes to pay me a social security pension. If, therefore, I am willing to pay for a financial institution to give me a performance bond that I will honour that commitment, I should have the right, subject to whatever security I have to give to that financial institution, to invest those retirement savings as I please-on my home, on a share portfolio, on real estate, or in whatever way I like, provided I give that performance bond. Furthermore, it becomes very important that then, we look to the opportunity to fund our retirement income scheme. In Fightback we propose that government superannuation schemes should be funded. I hope, in addition, that it will not be too long before we its start funding the Government's social security commitment to those who could have provided for their own retirement but did not do so. I put in a different category the funds that are paid to those who could not achieve that objective out of their own savings. (Time expired)",46
145,Mr CADMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"We are dealing with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury. These are the departments that offer advice on those great areas of government activity. I wish to run through what must be the advice received from those departments by referring to the speeches of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during the period he was Treasurer and since he has been Prime Minister. In his Budget Speech in 1983, he said: Obviously, the economic policies of the previous Governmentthat is, the Fraser Governmenthad failed to come to terms with Australia's deep seated problems . . . 1983-84 holds promise of a considerable improvement in economic performance. At that stage the foreign debt was $23 billion. In his Budget Speech in 1984, he said: Tonight, I am proud to be able to tell the Australian people that we now have strong economic growth, many more jobs, a substantial fall in inflation and declining interest rates. The Government's policies are on track ... The foreign debt at that time was $27.9 billion. In his Budget Speech in 1985, he said: ... I have outlined the Government's strategy for the new financial year. It is a strategy that builds upon our very significant successes ... and puts further behind us the despair and economic failure of the former Government. Foreign debt was $51.2 billion. In his Budget Speech in 1986, he said: The 1986-87 Budget which I have presented tonight rings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy. Foreign debt was $75 billion. In his Budget Speech in 1987, he said: Notwithstanding the enormity of the trade difficulties we have faced, our economic strategy is now bearing fruit. Foreign debt was $82.7 billion. In his Budget Speech in 1988, he said: The nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation ... this is the one that brings home the bacon ... Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. Foreign debt was $92.8 billion. In his Budget Speech in 1989, he said: . . . as a result of the Government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. Foreign debt was $100 billion. In his Budget Speech in 1990, he said: This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up ... delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. Foreign debt was $124 billion. In 1992, as Prime Minister, he said: The Keating Government's economic strategy is to accelerate recovery from recession, and at the same time build a stronger Australia. It is a four year plan. It begins now with an immediate boost to spending and employment. It ends in 1995-96 with the Budget back in surplus and dramatically reduced marginal income tax rates for most Australians. Foreign debt is $145 billion. This is a sad record of someone seeking to confuse, distract and mislead the Australian people. I am really surprised that the great departments that we are discussing at the moment can stand idly by to allow a leader of government to make these misleading statements year after year...:.... every year the debt going up, every year the claim being made that we are in a better economic position, that we are not going to have a recession, that we are not going to have high unemployment, but every year unemployment increasing and the foreign debt increasing also. Over a lO-year period from 1983 we have had a foreign debt of $23 billion increase to a debt at the moment of $145 billion. It is an incredible record. It is a bad record. This man who said he objected to the quarter-acre block and the Hills hoist in the backyard, by implication, was indicating that his view of Australia would be for everybody to live in a flat, to hang their clothes on the balcony and to ride a bike to work. I think that what was expressed by the Prime Minister is a deplorable goal and objective for the Australian people, but one can only draw those conclusions when one looks at. his record and the record of advice he has received. One does not know the totality of advice, but one can assume that the Prime Minister would not ignore the advice he has been given by great departments of State. The World Economic Forum has made an assessment of the government policies which will best lead to success. The World Economic Forum has put New Zealand as No. 1 for having government policies most likely to succeed, Germany as No.2, Japan as No. 3 and the United States as No.4. In that table Australia ranks No. 13 as having government policies most likely to bring about success. At the bottom of the list, unfortunately, are countries such as Greece and Italy. The World Economic Forum says that they are least likely to succeed. The rest of the world has judged that we are nowhere near being in a reasonable position, yet we have a man, both as Prime Minister and Treasurer, on successive occasions, year after year, making misleading speeches and misleading statements. I believe the Prime Minister will say anything and do anything to confuse and mislead the Australian people and to have them think that the record of the Government is good when it is bad, it is deplorable and, in fact, it is one of the worse in the world. It has not been enlightening for the Australian people, with the release of the Budget and Poles Apart, a document produced by the Australian Labor Party, to see the Prime Minister spend his whole speech at the Press Club condemning the Opposition. There was nothing positive. There were no ideas, no optimism, no plans, no vision and no goals for the Australian community to reach out for or to be encouraged to reach out for by their Government. The recent spectacle of the Prime Minister in Japan with his arms around Dr Toyoda saying, 'Yes, we agree between us that Australians should continue to have the automobile regime that we currently have', was not an enlightening picture. They were saying that Australians should pay $4,000 more for their automobiles. Why would not Dr Toyoda be agreeable to that proposal? His finn, with its head office in Japan, would be the beneficiary of such a policy. It is time that the Prime Minister became a little more nationalistic in favour of the Australian people and started to back Aussies instead of trying to find slick answers to difficult questions. To back Aussies, we do not need more taxes, as we have in the current Budget, tax after tax after tax-I have got two pages of taxes here that I thought I might have time to read out-and changes to taxation which will produce another $4 billion for the Government in its current Budget. I had rather hoped that, instead of reading. out these increased taxes, I would have been able to read out a list of proposals the Government has to improve the way of life of and to offer a glimmer of hope for the Australian people. What is needed is a release from personal income tax, relief from the fuel excise, and an incentive for Australians to earn more. Those are the proposals that are offered in Fightback. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) had great difficulty coping with Treasury advice that was offered to the Government because it supported what the Opposition wanted to do. We have the Prime Minister failing year after year. We have an alternative which I believe is generally supported by thoughtful leaders in the Public Service as being the way in which Australia needs to go to put it back up that list of the World Economic Forum. It will bring us near the top and close to New Zealand with the most appropriate policies not the mishmash that we have in the current Budget. We need vision and opportunity for the Australian people; the opportunity for incentive by reduced income tax; the chance for people on average weekly earnings to double their income without going into a new tax scale; the opportunity for employers to be relieved of some of the imposts they have, and thereby create jobs. The Opposition is not about smart new taxes; it is about creating a situation in which Australians can do better. Everybody knows there needs to be a sensible change. That is what the coalition is offering the Australian people. But we get denigration instead of reasonable debate, and statements that are misleading instead of real facts. Proposed expenditures agreed to. AUorney-General's Department Proposed expenditure, $779,636,000.",48
146,Mr COSTELLO,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I wish to raise two areas of the Attorney General's Department and the expenditures that relate to them in the short period that is open to me to comment in the committee stage. The first is of course the area of corporate prosecutions. You will note, Madam Deputy Chair, that the Budget Papers show that last year the Director of Public Prosecutions underspent the budget by $4.8m. In other words, $4.8m was set aside for prosecutions, and that was not spent. We might ask ourselves why that is. Is that because Australia is so law abiding? Is it because all of those who have breached the law have now been successfully prosecuted and are being punished, and therefore we did not need that $4.8m to be spent? Can we say that corporate Australia now has a squeakyclean image and all those who may have transgressed have been brought to justice? No, we cannot say that. There is a much worse, darker reason why the corporate prosecutions budget was underspent in the last year. We have had this extraordinary tale develop of argument between the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions about the responsibility for enforcing corporate prosecutions. A new development occurred just this afternoon when, in an attempt to finally do something about this, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) tabled some papers in the Parliament; I will come to those in a moment. The first point I want to make is that there is a legitimate fear in the Australian community that high profile names who were involved in some very public companies during the 1980s have not obeyed the Corporations Law, have treated public moneys as their own, and have not been brought to justice. The Australian Securities Commission knows itself that that is the case because in about September. 1990 the Chairman published a list called the 'Big 16' of well known companies. He said they would be given full resources and money for them to be investigated and for charges to be brought to be trial. The Australian Securities Commission actually publishes a scoreboardÂ· on the Big including the charges that have been laid, the briefs to the DPP, civil action, and convictions. I have never understood for the life of me why we should have a scoreboard on our investigations but let me make this clear: not only did the Australian Securities Commission establish as the yardstick for corporate enforand cement in this country the Big 16 but it puts out a scoreboard as to how it is going. The scoreboard I have here was the scoreboard as of 30 June, the last one put out. This scoreboard names all of the companies. There are lots of briefs to the Director of Public Prosecutions. There are lots of civil actions, but very few convictions. This scoreboard looks like the St George score line against the Brisbane Broncos in the Rugby League grand final-lots of activity but very few charges heard in the court; in fact, only in relation to two cases of the Big 16. One is Estate Mortgage, where charges of false advertising led to convictions, and the other is in relation to Rothwells. It that Alan Bond was gaoled, but of course he was granted a retrial. It also mentions Aleco Vrisakis, David Hurley and Nicholas Lee. Of course, Aleco Vrisakis was the Government appointed adviser on the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee to advise on the law. The Australian Securities Commission claims the Government's first legal adviser as one of its successful prosecutions out of Rothwells Ltd. I pass over without saying any more. But the reason why there was lots of activity down on the back line but very few convictions has now become public for everybody to see; it is that a serious argument has developed between the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is an argument about who bears responsibility for bringing these convictions to .trial, and each has its own case. I do not know who is right. I do not know whether Tony Hartnell is right and it is all Michael Rozenes's fault. I do not know whether Michael Rozenes is right and it is all Tony Hartnell's fault. Michael Rozenes said in evidence to a parliamentary committee that the fighting between them 'must give them 16, some heart, though'-it must give corporate criminals some heart. I do not believe that we can, as a parliament, say who is right and who is wrong, but the one thing I know is who is responsible for both of them; it is the Attorney-General. I know that he is responsible for both of them. I know that for 12 months he did nothing. Twelve months ago I had put out a release and called on him to intervene; I said that bureaucratic wars were impeding law enforcement against corporate crime- He did nothing. He had to be dragged kicking and screaming into this issue after 12 months. He finally said, 'I am going to fix the problem'. He stood up here in the Parliament in a very theatrical performance and said, 'I am going to fix the problem. I've called them to Canberra'. He called them to Canberra. One can guess what happened, they refused to agree. He called them to this big meeting where-as his spokesman promised in the press-he was going to bang heads. The only head that got says here banged in this meeting was his. I have never seen such a deathly press conference. When the Attorney-General went outside after his great theatrical performance he said, 'I am going to bang heads, and it is all going to be agreed' . They came to Canberra, but they took no notice of him, which was very predictable. In the Australian newspaper in March of this year, Tony Hartnell, when asked about a report on the Bond Corporation, said: Mr Duffy had no need for the reports, and sat on them anyway ... What benefit will it [reporting Mr Duffy] have other than helping Four Corners and the ABC ... ? That was the Attorney-General's own Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission on 10 March of this year. He knew that in the Attorney-General's Department there was no interest in these things. He knew there was a problem. Michael Rozenes knew there was a problem. The only person who would not admit a problem and do anything about it was the Attorney-General himself. He puts out statements-in the paper that has been tabled in the Parliament-and says, 'Look, it is much better than you think. We had 668 cases, so many criminal cases and so many civil cases'. We always had those cases. When the corporate affairs commissions were operating separately, they were always bringing multiple cases. We did not set up an Australian Securities Commission because we were worried about minor convictions at the bottom end. The Australian Securities Commission was set up because there was a worry, at the top end of town, with the big cases. One only has to read his speeches-every one of his speeches-when he comes into this Parliament and says, 'Australia's reputation has been hurt and I am going to clean it up'. He is talking about the same thing as Tony Hartnell was talking about-that is, the Big 16. They have been identified. There is a scoreboard published. It shows that progress has not been made, as we would have hoped. We now know that bureaucratic wars between two agencies for which he was responsible have held that back. We know he did nothing for 12 months. We know that when he finally intervened he was unable to get an agreement and has now given directions to the men to agree and, when they cannot agree, effectively, to have their arguments arbitrated by the Secretary to the Department. The second point that I would like to make is that for a very long time now there has been the one person holding the chairmanship of the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission. The one person was given the job for one reason: the two to agencies were going to be amalgamated. Today, he announced his resignation. After 12 months-again, of inactivity and bureaucratic war; Treasury would not let go of the PSA, the Attorney-General's Department would not let go of the TPC-the Attorney-General's grand plan, which was the reason why he appointed Professor Pels to the Trade Practices Commission, failed. For a year, no progress was made to resolve the situation. In the end, the Chairman of the TPC, Professor Fels, resolved the situation himself and resigned from the PSA. This is yet another example of ministerial inactivity, a failure to administer the agencies for which he is responsible properly, a failure in administration, and is a matter of great concern in relation to what should be a great department.",50
147,Mr LINDSAY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Herbert) (5.28 p.m.)Having just heard the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), speak on some of these issues, I would have replied with one answer-that is, that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) adequately dealt with the first point he made in this chamber some two weeks ago. In respect of the second complaint that the honourable member has made, I would have thought that Professor Fels was quite able to speak for himself on that issue and that there is no substance to the honourable member's objection. In any event, one of the chief responsibilities of the Attorney-General is to ensure that there are adequate resources provided to the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies for the maintenance of law and order and to combat crime. The increasing incidence of crime is now a major cause for concern to many Australians. The prevalence of home burglary, break and enter of stores, robbery with violence, physical assault, particularly against women, is now the topic of ordinary conversation amongst citizens, rather than being confined to the offices of law enforcement agencies. Whilst these are matters primarily dealt with by State police forces, the Commonwealth has an increasing role in the national fight against crime, and in particular against organised crime. In that respect, the role of the National Crime Authority in counteracting organised criminal activity in Australia is crucial. The National Crime Authority is unique among law enforcement agencies in that its investigations are not limited by jurisdictional and territorial boundaries. In November 1990, the Authority adopted a new policy in strategic direction. The Authority has now placed increased emphasis on acting as a partner to other law enforcement agencies. It is continuing to develop the multi-disciplinary, multi-task force operational approach which has proven so successful. One of the past criticisms of the Authority was its alleged failure to disseminate relevant criminal information and intelligence. The Authority now gives high priority to the dissemination of criminal information and intelligence. As a result, there is now a good working relationship between the National Crime Authority and other law enforcement agencies throughout Australia. The National Crime Authority has developed a corporate plan for 1992 to 1995. This plan sets out strategies for which the Authority achieve its \ objectives and also contains performanceÂ· measures by which the effectiveness and efficiency of the Authority can be determined. Over the past year, the National Crime Authority has continued to conduct and coordinate a number of major investigations into organised crime, but the primary focus on the investigations has been drug related and so-called white-collar crime. As a result of these investigations, some 42 persons were eventually charged, by either the National Crime Authority or other agencies, with 1,343 offences. The program performance statement for 1992-93 of the Attorney-General's portfoliothat is, in Budget Related Paper No. 9.3notes that, in addition to these charges, over $30m in taxation and licence fee assessments were issued in 1991-92 by the Australian Taxation Office and State revenue agencies. This is a very creditable performance. The increasing prevalence of so-called drug related and white-collar crime places enormous pressure on the resources allocated to the Authority. This year's Budget outlays on the National Crime Authority amount to nearly $35.5m. Officers of the Authority are now located in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. This financial year, the Authority will be opening an office in Brisbane. The establishment of these regional offices will enhance the National Crime Authority'S capacity to investigate organised criminal activity and assist the Authority to strengthen its attack on the monetary proceeds of organised criminal activity. The Government will ensure that the legislation enabling the National Crime Authority to facilitate the seizure of the proceeds of organisedÂ·crime will be kept under review to block even sophisticated attempts by criminals to salt away their ill-gotten gains. The annual cost of crime through whitefairly collar crime and money laundering is immense-$1.7 billion a year in insurance fraud; between $300m and $700m a year in computer fraud; $2 billion in business fraud; and between $2.3 billion and $9 billion a year by fraud committed against the Commonwealth will Government through the tax, social security, Customs and Medicare systems. It is the whole community that suffers from the impact of large scale fraud, irrespective of whether it is by tax cheating, fraud on shareholders, or f-aud against banking, government and insurance. It is just over eight years since the National Crime Authority was established. In that time, it has grown into a competent, professional national law enforcement agency. As I have said previously in this House, it is now the most important agency in the national effort to combat organised crime. I pay tribute to the staff of the National Crime Authority. Under the inspired leader-' ship of its previous Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, and his equally inspired successor, Mr Tom Sherman, the National Crime Authority is now well placed to serve the people of Australia in the fight against organised crime. I now tum to the issue of social justice. The Attorney-General's portfolio has responsibility for a number of social justice programs, including the issue of racial vilification. It is claimed in Budget Related Paper No. 9.3 that 'the issue of racial vilification will be considered by the Government with a view to enacting legislation to proscribe it'. It is also claimed in that document that reports of both the national inquiry into racial violence and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody contained recommendations to ban racial vilification. Whilst one can have certain sympathy for the motives of these proposals, I wish to make some observations about them. Last week in two decisions, the political as case and the Nationwide News case, the High Court asserted for itself the role of guardian of one of the fundamental concepts of the Australian political system, the concept of representative government. We in the Australian Parliament have been elected by our constituents to fulfil our' role in Australia, that is, to function as a representative democracy. But the High Court has asserted the meaning and foundation of representative democracy-the right of political expression. The striking down of legislation attempting to regulate political advertising in the electronic media should send shock waves through this Parliament. But this issue is not over yet; it is only beginning. The High Court has held that legislation must be subject to a balancing test. It has laid down important criteria for determining whether legislation is compatible with this constitutional right to freedom of political expression. It seems to me that racial vilification legislation must satisfy the five most important tests laid down by the High Court. The first is the extent to which freedom of political discourse is restricted and the effect that this may have upon representative government. For example, in the current political climate espousing the catch cry of the level playing field, it is difficult to understand why legislative protection will be available to some and not to other vulnerable groups in society, for example, women and disabled people, and not on the issue of violent films and pornography. The second test is the importance of the competing interest in an ordered democratic society. It seems to me that the strength of a democracy is the acceptance of diversity of opinions. People exercising their free speech must win support for their cause in an open way and on its merits. The third test is whether the restriction on freedom of political discourse is proportionate to the interest served. In this regard no doubt the High Court would query whether the legislation was disproportionate because the normal means of protecting reputation is through the common law in the civil courts. The fourth test is whether the restriction does not go further than what is reasonably necessary to prqtect the competing interest. That test speaks for itself. The final test is whether there are other methods of protecting the competing interest which do not restrict freedom of political discourse. In this case of course that test can be satisfied through education and in many other ways. For example, there are adequate provisions in the existing criminal law. Section 51 of the Australian Constitution, which enumerates the main legislative powers of the Parliament, contains an overriding proviso that Parliament has the power to make laws 'for the peace, order and good just government of the Commonwealth'. It seems to me from my reading of some notes on these two particular cases that that section, is going to come under active consideration by the High Court when applying the tests that I have just mentioned and determining whether or not legislation passed by this House can stand.",52
148,Mrs BAILEY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I note under the section of the, Attorney General's Department there is a referen\:e to trade practices and consumer affairs. It s-tes: The Government has also decided to establish a Consumer Protection Advancement Program to improve the protection of consumers' interests, including in the use of financial services. Literally just minutes ago my office was advised by Mr John Wood, the director of the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, that this consumer protection advancement program, at a cost of $500,000, has three components. The first component is money for staff to undertake work on consumer and financial services, that is, policy formulation and recogpition that the financial services area is a major item on the consumer agenda. I do not disagree with that, but I will come back to that in a minute. The second component of this program, at a cost of $500,000, is to expand the product safety compliance section. It is proposed that one person will be positioned in Brisbane and that that person will go out and inspect goods on the market to ensure that they meet safety standards. As I have said, I have only just received notice of exactly what is envisaged in this consumer protection advancement program, but I must say that I wonder why there is one person and why the capital city of Brisbane has been chosen over other cities. The third component of this program is that the program will be administered by the Office of Legal Aid to provide extra money for financial counselling. As I have just received notice of this and as there is little time available for me to speak, I am loath to go into any analysis of the three sections of this program. Albeit that the consumer protection advancement program is Ilooking at financial serVices, it seems to me that the form of consumer protection is for consumers actually to have a job. The Budget Statement, and this section of the Budget Statement, has missed the opportunity to put into place programs that would really protect the Australian consumers by putting into place job creation programs. This Budget has in fact missed the opportunity to remove all of those impediments that are preventing Australian consumers from having a job. That is a tragedy on a national scale because the opportunities were there. The Government had those opportunities and it has deliberately chosen to let them simply slip through its fingers. When I say 'provide a plan for the future, provide some job opportunities', the sorts of opportunities that I am talking about that would really protect consumers are those to reduce those very high oncosts that business is facing today. Not one member in this chamber could drive throughout his or her electorate and not see the physical evidence of the missed opportunities of this Government, which has refused to grasp these opportunities of reducing these high business costs. That physical evidence is in the number of empty shops in small towns and urban shopping centres. It is in the number of people who are joining the long and ever increasing queues of the unemployed. It is in the number of families who have lost their homes because they cannot meet mortgage payments. It is in the number of familieS who have disintegrated under those financial pressures. So, when this Government talks about instituting a consumer protection advancement program and about looking at protecting consumers in regard to financial services, I say, 'Why hasn't this Government actually tackled the problems at first hand-the problems that people are struggling with to meet their financial. commitments simply because they do not have a job?' Those high oncosts for business that I am talking about are those high amounts of sales tax, fuel tax, payroll tax, the training guarantee levy and now, of course, the superannuation guarantee levy, All of those costs feed into the costs of best business and make businesses no longer viable. They have deliberately caused so many thousands of. businesses g<!L to go the wall and therefore have caused the loss of the jobs of hundreds of thousands of consumers. This Government has missed that opportunity to abolish those taxes, to lower the production and distribution costs of all businesses. In doing so, it has neglected its prime responsibility to look after the Australian consumers by, firstly, ensuring that they have a job. It also has neglected its responsibility to look after the rights of Australian consumers because, by maintaining those very high oncosts in business, itÂ·is ensuring that Australian consumers pay far more for their goods and services than they really have to. The Government is also denying the Australian consumer competitive prices. It is denying the Australian consumer a wide choice of goods because, as more businesses go to the wall, more people lose their jobs in businesses. That means a reduction in the amount of goods produced in this country and a limit to the choice that Australian consumers actually have. Let me give just one brief example of the practical nature of the way that these very high costs feed into the costs of all businesses. I cannot think of a business or an industry that does not depend on our transport industry. Just one of those large six-axle articulated vehicles, commonly known as large semitrailers, has a retail price of $250,000. Included in that price is $38,000 worth of sales tax. The vast majority of owner-drivers and transport companies do not buy those vehicles outright; they lease them. By removing the sales tax alone, those ownerdrivers would save $945 per month on their lease payments. If one adds onto that sales tax $1,675 for just one set of tyres, one gets a bill of in excess of $2,000-just for the sales tax and the spare parts that those companies must use to maintain their vehicles on the road. I am reliably informed that the average rate of travel for one of those vehicles is 195,000 kilometres per year. The fuel bill for that sort of distance is $57,500. If one removes the fuel tax, one removes almost $25,000. When all those costs are added up, the total is in excess of $40,000 per vehicle per year. If one starts to pull that sort of cost out of business, because the cost of that transport is factored into the cost of all goods and services, one starts to lower the costs of production and distribution, and that is of direct benefit to Australian consumer. The Australian consumer is being denied that opportunity in these Budget Papers. It is all very well to have political rhetoric and to talk about a consumer protection advancement program, but surely this Government owes it to Australian consumers to go right to the heart of the matter and remove all those oncosts, thereby ensuring that Australian consumers maintain their jobs and get a range of goods at competitive prices. There are many innovations in Australian industry, but it is those high costs which prevent many inventions being developed in this country. Once again, the Australian consumer is denied the choice of those new products. (TIme expired)",54
149,Mr MELHAM,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It was interesting to hear the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), earlier in the debate. One cannot help feeling that he is still suffering from the knockout blow that the Attorney General (Mr Duffy) delivered to him some weeks back in Question Time when one would have thought that it was a dorothy dix question being asked by the honourable member for Higgins. It was quite amusing to watch the honourable member for Higgins squirm as the Attorney-General took him apart limb by limb, but it was more interesting to see his own shadow Ministry, his own backbench, delighting in the Attorney-General tearing him apart limb by limb. I intend to further put on the record some material in relation to the Australian Securities Commission, but before I do so I think it is important to point out the major deficiency relating to the Attorney-General's Department and the provision of legal services to ordinary men and women in Australia that will arise from the introduction of a goods and services tax. We heard nothing about that from the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins. What a goods and services tax will do for the delivery of legal services in Australia is add 15 per cent to the bill of every person seeking legal advice and assistance. Anyone who has a will made or is involved in a the conveyancing transaction will be charged 15 per cent on top of the fees presently charged for advice and assistance. Senator Cooney's committee in the Senate is currently preparing a report for tabling in the Parliament in relation to the high costs of justice in Australia. A consumption tax will add another 15 per cent to the cost of services. What we have is a proposal by the Opposition to tax people from the cradle to the grave. The honourable member for Higgins made great play about the Australian Securities Commission and what it has done with its resources. It is important to again put on the record what progress the Australian Securities Commission has made in bringing to book the corporate wrongdoers of the 1980s. Of its budget of approximately $ 132m for 1992-93, the Australian Securities Commission estimates that it is devoting about $50m to investigation and associated legal and litigation activity, with external litigation costs in particular expected to amount to about $13m. The focus of its infqrmation program also strongly supports those activities. Additionally, some $5m in funding is being provided for corporate prosecutions to the DPP. This expenditure on corporate investigations and prosecutions far exceeds that provided for investigations and prosecutions under the cooperative scheme. Those increased resources are !llready starting to bear fruit. It is a matter of public record that there a dearth of prosecution activity under the old arrangements. I am pleased to say that the Australian Securities Commission, it appears, has vigorously applied itself to its law enforcement functions. One has only to go to the answer that the Attorney-General gave to this chamber some weeks back. I will restate it. The Australian Securities Commission initiated 668 new civil and criminal cases in 1991-92. These included some 80 significant criminal cases. As at 30 June 1992, there were 116 serious criminal trials under way. Trials during 1991-92 resulted in 36 significant convictions, 314 minor convictions, 12 acquittals of a significant nature and one acquittal of a minor nature. There were 89 discontinued trials. As at 30 June 1992, a total of 77 civil matters were under way. The point needs to be made to honourable members and the Australian community that corporate investigations and prosecutions are costly, because one needs to get behind a very complex framework. They are not like break, enter and steal, murder, rape, robbery and other cases along those lines. Corporate prosecutions involve bringing in accountants and getting behind a complex structure. They can involve months and months of court time in terms of preliminary hearings and eventually bringing people to trial. Their only equivalents in the criminal court system at the moment are the long drug trials, the conspiracies to import. It is a costly and complex exercise. It also takes time to bring to account those involved. The Australian Securities Commission only commenced administration of the new Corporations Law on 2 January 1991. There is no doubt that there has been a learning process and I think people need to bear that in mind. I want to detail a number of the charges which have been laid against persons associated with prominent corporations in the 1980s. They include: Garry Carter, who was committed for trial under section 173 of the Crimes Act and section 229 of the Companies Code in relation to Entity; Brian Yuill, who was committed for trial under section 229 of was the Companies Code, to do with Spedley; Christopher Skase, who was charged under section 229 of the Companies Code in relation to Qintex; Robin Greenburg, .who pleaded guilty to charges under the Criminal Code and subsections 229 and 232 of the Companies Code; Kevin Parry of Estate Mortgage, who was charged under subsections 229 and 230 of the Companies Code; Abraham Goldberg and Katy Boskovitz, who were charged under subsections 229 and 556 of the Companies Code to do with the Linter Group; Reuben and Richard Lew, who were charged under the Crimes Act and section 229 of the Companies Code; Laurie Connell, who was charged under the Criminal Code, the Companies Code, the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Code, the Securities Industry Code and the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Code in relation to Rothwells; Alan Bond, of course, who was acquitted on appeal; John Avram and Stanley Schneider, who were charged under sections 229 and 129 of the Companies Code to do with Interwest; Dallas Dempster; who was charged under section 129 of the Companies Code in relation to Rothwells; and Michael Fuller and Joseph Cummings, who were charged under section 229 of the Companies Code to do with the IRL Group. I understand that the Australian Securities Commission has made strong progress on the 16 investigations designated as national priorities by the Chairman of the Commission. Criminal charges to date have been laid in relation to eight of those investigations and civil proceedings have been undertaken in relation to six matters. I understand investigations are continuing in the balance of these matters and briefs have either been delivered. to the DPP or will soon be completed. It is a nonsense for the shadow Attorney General to come into this chamber and attempt to score cheap political points. We are talking about complex investigations and complex trials which take time. It is no accident that the Government has allocated huge resources to the Australian Securities Commission and to the prosecution authorities in order to bring to book the corporate criminals of the 1980s. There is no doubt that many of the corporate criminals and practices of the 1980s will go undetected because of the nature of corporate crime. In many cases it is conducted behind closed.doors and unless someone within the organisation comes forward to reveal a scheme it can take many years to detect. I appreciate that the shadow Attorney General is trying to make a name for himself, but I think all he is doing is making a fool of himself in the way he is conducting himself in relation to these matters. He could do a lot better by acknowledging that a lot of work has been done. There is no doubt that there is a lot more work to be done in a partnership arrangement between the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. I think the Attorney-General ought to be commended on the way he has handled that dispute. It will bear results future.",56
150,Mr ANDREWS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I address my remarks to the Budget allocation within the Attorney-General's portfolio pertaining to the provision of legal aid and family services, in particular the grants made to family service organisations. On 24 July this year the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) announced that the Government would increase support for community-based family service projects nationally in 1992-93 to about $19m. This announcement is reflected in the Budget. I state at the outset of what can be only reasonably brief remarks that I support the increase. Indeed, I have argued consistently that the allocation ought to be greater-a position supported in recent research funded by the Attorney-General's Department. The release of findings of a national study about marriage education highlights the inadequacy of Federal funding for these programs. This study, entitled Love, Sex and Waterskiing: the experience of pre-marriage in Australia, involved surveys of 1,698 persons marrying for the first time who attended pre-marriage education programs throughout Australia between January and March this year. Key findings included the fact that 5 per cent of couples either cancelled or postponed their weddings after attending a pre-marriage education program. As one person said: . We were made aware that we didn't know eachÂ· other as well as we thought. [We] discussed issues previously overlooked. Discovered differences we couldn't resolve and which probably would have become major points of conflict in our marriage. I believe now we hadn't thought enough about marriage and everything involved. We would not have lasted. We are very grateful for this program. After attending a program, 91 per cent of couples reported that they would seek professional help if problems arose in their marriage and 83 per cent of couples reported learning new skills as a result of attending a program. One-third of couples said that their program raised new issues for them. Forty-two per cent of couples said that their ideas about marriage had changed a great deal and nearly 80 per cent of couples who participated in the survey in the rated their program as good or excellent. These findings highlight the usefulness of the programs and the inadequacy of the funding. Even with the increase in funding for marriage education to $1.18m this yearwhich I acknowledge is a substantial increase on what was provided before-the Federal Government spends, on average, less than $10 per marriage on programs of preparation and education. Yet the cost of marriage breakdown is estimated at some $3,OOOm annually to the Australian community. Given the paucity of this allocation, what also concerns me and those involved in providing the services is the apparent absence of a clear Government policy about the allocation of funds. In September, the President of the Australian Association for Marriage Education, Jim Pilmer, wrote: Despite the good news of increased funding a concern of AAME is that there appears to be 'no discernible Government or departmental policy on how these funds are allocated. He continued: In several instances grants for new programs were made when existing programs needing infrastructure and support in the same city were left languishing. This process of 'sprinkling' money around rather than allocating it according to clearly understood developmental criteria has been a cause of concern for some years now. That concern remains. Since then, similar complaints have been raised with me about the allocation of marriage counselling funds. I was pleased, therefore, to hear the Minister for Justice stro-gly refute claims that' grants for family servIces were made on a party political or electorate basis when launching the national research into marriage education in Adelaide and indicate that all grants were allocated according to a clear policy. It would appear, however, that the policy remains unknown to everyone but the Minister and his Department. Less than two days after the Minister's remarks, the retiring President of the Australian Association for Marriage Education, Jim Pilmer, said in his report to the Association's annual general meeting: I want to record again this year our bewilderment with the funding process or more accurately with the outcomes of the process. Generally speaking we are unable to discern a departmental policy regarding the assessment of submissions and the approval of gmnts for marriage education funding. This is not the place to go into detail, but fund existing agencies with programs up and running and then to fund agencies in the same cities and towns to start new programs seems to penalise those who have developed a service and reward those who haven't. The approval of grants to secular bodies is to be applauded. The main issue is on what basis the grants were allocated. I am delighted, therefore, that there is a policy, as the Minister for Justice announced in Adelaide. I simply ask: will the Minister provide me with a copy of it? For more than a year my friend the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and I have been asking the Minister to provide details of the number of persons with whom each agency that is funded by his Department has dealt with in that year. I have asked questions on notice, I have raised the issue in this place and I have asked departmental officers directly. The matter has even been raised in Senate Estimates committees. In each case the answer has suggested that the information is provided in a variety of ways by the agencies but that somehow it is statistically flawed. All I am asking for are the figures actually supplied by each agency; that is, when an agency is providing marriage counselling, education, parent-adolescent or family mediation or a family skills training program, and it applies for a grant or a continuation of funding or makes its regular return to the Department which it is contractually bound to do, I ask for the actual figures as they are recorded by each agency in relation to each program. Both the Attorney and the Department have conceded that these figures are available. In fact, I would be surprised if a competent junior clerk would take more than half an hour to collate them. So I ask again: will the Attorney provide me with the figures for each program-that is, for marriage education, for marriage counselling, for family mediation, for parent-adolescent mediation and for family skills training programs for each agency which is funded pursuant to this Budget allocation by the Parliament for the year 1991-1992, and it is conceded that those figures are available, and I also ask the Attorney, whilst he is doing this, for the not to figures which are projected for 1992-93. I note, for example, that the Department has collated the figures itself in Budget Related Paper No. 9.3. At page 172 the following is recorded: . an estimllted 980 persons were assisted the family skills training program. . during the 1991-92 financial year approximately 32,000 couples received marriage counselling. Last year the Attorney was able to inform that 9,434 couples attended marriage education education programs, but somehow he could not indicate how he arrived at this figure agency by agency. I submit that the only-way of arriving at these total figures which have been recorded, and which have been conothers. ceded, is by taking the figures supplied agency by agency and by simply adding them up. It is not my intention to make these matters the subject of party political debate. As I said at the outset, I applau9--tlleTilCfeaSed funding but I do believe that tpinimum parliamentary accountability and review require that Attorney provide both the policy which the service agencies seem _!lllawi\re _of and basic numbets-of persons to whom services in are provided as a consequence of this alPresident location in the Budget of CommonwealthMarriage funding. I therefore ask the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, the honourable member-been for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), to take these questions on notice on behalf of the Attorney-General and to provide the detailed answers in due course.",58
151,Mr WEBSTER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I am happy in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) to follow the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who has focused upon the very area that I have been pleased in many ways to focus upon following the Budget each year since I have been elected. I applaud the thread of his contribution and the points that he made during his delivery the committee debate on this matter. I wish to focus my comments on the Attorand, ney-General Department's programs, which appear on page 3.106 of Budget Paper No.1 and which are referred to as 'Grants to apefforts proved marriage counselling and marriage education organisations'. Each year we get opportunity to speak in these debates issues related to various parts of the Budget, and I think this matter is being brought very much to the fore at the moment by the comincrease ments of the honourable member for Menzies through and, I hope, by what I have to add here tonight. Over many years I have argued for incJeased budgetary allocations for family me (cOunsell1ng organisaIions;-for marriage organisations and for family reconciliation centres in order that the tragedy of marriage breakdown might be minimised. It is a huge problem and indeed a g-te!lrtragedy that confronts this nation and, indeed, many Over these same years I have been encouraged to see a significant boost to these types of---programs, and this year is no exception. I was delighted to find in this year's Budget that allocations in this area have increase<l to -$19.76m.which, as th.e_Budget_ documenf says, represents a 100 per cent increase since the 1989-90 Budget. I do the commend the Government for that. Recent statistics show that the divorce rate the for married couples rose from 10.6 per cent 1986 to 11.6 per cent last year. The retiring of the Australian Association for Education, the Reverend Jim Pilrner, states that this level of family breakdown has estimated to cost the nation $2.5 billion each year, although I estimate that it is probably closer to $3 billion-and when one takes all the other related areas of influence into account it runs into many more billions of dollars Marriage breakdown in the community should be a major concern to us all, and I believe that underpinning the family unit should be made a priority bY,any government. I do not think I would find anybody on either side arguing about that very principle. I have, therefore, been greatly encouraged in recent in times by the growing interest of honourable members in the whole area of family policy in particular, I would like to pay tribute to the marvellous work being done by the honourable member for Menzies. I believe his in this area of policy will have far-reaching effects on the well-being of many the Australian families, and I thank him for his on interest in and commitment to this area. One of the important facts that has come out of his recent work is that even with this in Federal funding the Government provides less than $10 for marriage education per person, yet the cost is over $12,000 for each separation. I was therefore delighted to read in the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 September that a recent study entitled Love, Sex and Water-skiing has confirmed what I and others have been saying for many years, and that is that much more emphasis should be placed on pre-marriage education-that is, learning about the problems and how to overcome them before the marriage takes place, and preferably well before. The study found that premarital education and a continuing commitment to education and counselling could save couples from breakdown and all the difficulties, problems and sadness associated with divorce. It is interesting to note that 5 per couples who undertook this education program either postponed or cancelled their weddings, yet only 12 per cent of Australian couples now do the courses. I think that is probably a slightly exaggerated figure. The problem is how to convince more young couples to undertake such courses, and at the appropriate times. Of those attending the program, 91 per cent of couples reported that they would seek professional help if problems arose in their marriages, and 83 per cent reported learning new skills. One-third of the couples said the program raised issues they had never thought about before such as expectations of the physical relationship, the role of religion in the relationship, the relevance of alcohol, the control of finances, and even annoying habits which are not talked about prior to getting married and which, added together, cause major problems later on. Nearly half the couples said that their idea of marriage had changed as a result. The 1,698 engaged couples who undertook the premarital counselling for the study reported that getting married without first coming to terms with the pitfalls could be very dangerous. However, when young couples who are starry-eyed and longing for nuptial bliss come to face up to the prospect of marriage education it bec-mes a task in itself to get them to acknowledge that they might be about to walk through a minefield. There is no reason why we cannot bring about attitudinal changes with effective education programs. Who would have thought 20 years ago that we would be as concerned for our environment as we are today? Who would have thought 20 years ago that drinking and driving would be the unacceptable social practices that they are today? These two examples amply demonstrate that attitudes can and do change. There is, therefore, no reason why we cannot see that 12 per cent participation rate in premarital education become 75 per cent or higher 10 or 20 years down the track. I hope it does not take that long. But we must start somewhere, and there is no bytter time to start than right now. We have to have rocks in our heads to cent of even begin to think otherwise. Personally, the place I would like to start is in the high schools around the nation. Although premarital education does not have to be taught as such there, there is no reason why we could not design a course for senior high schoolers centred around interpersonal relationships and communication as a very first step in overcoming this dreadful problem that is confronting our community. I am sure that honourable members would agree that the most important health and psychologically promoting relationship that anyone could have is a marriage relationship. Therefore, if young people are taught the basics of interpersonal relationships and how to be an effective communicator before they leave school, the poor communication skills that can undermine these relationships can be corrected before the crucial union takes place. Ideally, a young person could start with such a course in high school- later undertake a premarital education course with his or her engaged partner, follow it up, say 12 months later with a short course for the newly weds, and then some years down the track undertake marriage enrichment courses-a perfect formula for dramatically reducing the divorce rate. Whenever we talk about marriage breakdown, one of the most startling facts is that 70 per cent of all breakdowns occur through benign neglect, not through malicious intent. Therefore, marriage needs to be constantly worked at and early help sought if problems do occur. It seems so simple. Although we all wish that divorce could be avoided, the fact is that some marriages do break down, painfully tearing apart a once intimate relationship. In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to those who are dedicated to helping such people. There are many fine agencies right around Australia, some funded, many not. One such program that has been designed to facilitate the healing process needs to take place so that victims of divorce do not carry unwanted baggage into new relationships is a program called Fresh Start. It is a program that to date has received no funding, yet has proven to be invaluable work. Although this divorce recovery program has been in Australia only since 1990, it has helped many individuals and children of divorced parents cope with the grief associated with marriage breakdown. Fresh Start program organisers have conducted 18 seminars around Australia, with three to be conducted in Melbourne in the ensuing months. In total, 450 divorcees and children have received counselling and, in Canberra alone, 50 people are continuing to meet in a support group ona weekly basis. I would like to close with an appeal to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his colleague Senator Tate to look further at this whole area of family services and consider the benefits of pouring more money into bringing about that attitudinal change that needs to take place in order that more and more people in our community may experience a full and rich married life. The savings would far outweigh any costs.",60
152,Mr ALDRED,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In speaking to the set of appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department, may I mention briefly my adjournment speech of Tuesday, 18 August last, in which I detailed the fate of the Gillespie children-Iddin, aged 9, and Shah, aged 7-from the time they were last seen by their mother, Jacqueline Gillespie, at 5 p.m. on 9 July 1992 until Sunday, 26 July, when she wasÂ· infonned that her children were detained by their natural father Raja Bahrin Shah, a prince of the Malaysiaroyal family in Kuala Terrengganu on the north-east coast of the Malaysian Peninsula. May I also remind the members in this place that the Gillespie children are Australian citizens and are being held in open defiance of Australian laws and Australian Family Court orders, and even their basic right of access to Australian consular officials has been refused. For two months now Iddin and Shah have been denied any contact with their that mother, also an Australian citizen I might point out, who is now suffering as perhaps only mothers of seriously endangered children can. In an interview conducted by Margaret in its Fletcher on Radio 3AW, Melbourne, on Monday, 31 August, Jacqueline Gillespie expressed the emotional torment suffered by her and her husband, lain, since the disappearance of their children: the emptiness of their home; the unchanged rooms due to a police request that it be so; even the family dog taking the children's toys as sleeping companions. Jacquie explained that she was born in Australia and lived here until she left the country as the bride of Raja Bahrin Shah. She described the change in her first husband's attitude to her when they lived together in Malaysia, when her self-respect was taken from her, and, finally, she recalled the day when she was bundled on a plane with rddin and Shah bound for Australia. Raja Bahrin Shah did not apply for custody of the children and actually signed over their custody to Jacquie at that stage. I will seek pennission to table documents in that respect at the conclusion of my remarks. I have, in a previous adjournment speech, covered the action of Coastwatch and the Australian Federal Police in failing to adequately deal with the children's abduction. This was followed up in the Senate by my colleague the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Robert Hill, and subsequently an inquiry was set in motion by Senator Tate. However, the tenns of this inquiry have been criticised as being far too narrow by both Senator Hill and Mrs Jacquie Gillespie. Today, I wish to emphasise in the strongest possible tenns the failure of the Australian Government to protect its own citizens, with particular reference to the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. Despite the clear obligation of the Labor Government to uphold Australian laws, protect Australian citizens and uphold the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which it is a signatory, the Minister responsible, Senator Gareth Evans, continues to insist that this destruction of Iddin and Shah's rights is a private matter. Senator Evans insists that Mrs Gillespie submit herself and her children to Malaysian law, when even his personal request for a visa for Mrs Gillespie to visit Malaysia has been ignored by the Malaysian Government. This is also despite the fact that an Australian Family Court order, stating the children are allowed to phone home at least once a day, has been completely ignored. After the Gillespies had been informed by Mr David Rutter of Foreign Affairs on Friday, 24 July, that their children were 'in Indonesia travelling towards Malaysia', attempts were made by the Gillespies' legal firm, Price Brent, to retain Indonesian lawyers, but Foreign Affairs refused to provide additional information. Mr Rutter informed Mr David Abraham, the managing partner of Price Brent, that Senator Evans had met with the Indonesian Foreign Minister at the ASEAN conference in Manila and was also seeking to meet with the Malaysian Foreign Minister. No details of the discussions between Senator Evans and the Indonesian Foreign Minister were ever released. I now tum to the subject of government financial assistance. As honourable members may imagine, the enormously time consuming details of events since the kidnapping-and that is what it was-of Iddin and Shah have done much to deplete the Gillespies' financial resources. Moreover, the costs involved in tra velling to Malaysia and pursuing a protracted legal battle there are unimaginable. So far Jacqueline and lain Gillespie have received no financial assistance whatsoever from this Government. I return to the events of 26 and 27 July. When Iddin and Shah Gillespie arrived in Malaysia with their father, Raja Bahrin Shah, he announced at that time that he had taken the children for religious reasons and that it was Allah's will. Statements supporting his case were made by the Malaysian Prime Minister, the Malaysian Law Minister, the Malaysian Trade Minister, Rafidah Aziz, and the Malaysian police. Yet Senator Gareth Evans continued to insist publicly that this was a private matter and not a matter for the Australian Government. More recently, repeated requests from the Australian consulate in Kuala Lumpur for access to IMin and Shah to check on their welfare have been refused. Mrs Gillespie has still not been allowed to talk to her children on the telephone. She has not been able to tell them that she loves them or that someone in Australia cares about them. Honourable members should keep in mind the fact that the children spoke only English at the time of their departure. Surely, such a small request, which would mean so much to Jacqueline, Iddin and Shah Gillespie, should not be denied. It seems ironic, as Jacquie Gillespie commented on the 3AW radio interview, which I mentioned earlier in my remarks, that the Labor Government was prepared to give assistance to Barlow and Chambers, two Australians accused of drug trafficking in Malaysia, and yet nothing has been done to assist Iddin and Shah Gillespie, who have committed no crime whatsoever. They just happen to be the natural offspring of a Malaysian prince who relinquished his rights to them a long time ago. I re-emphasise that Iddin and Shah Gillespie are Australian children from an Australian family. Their mother, Jacquie, is an Australian, born of an Australian mother and a Malaysian father. The children's stepfather, lain, is of Scottish origin and has been in Australia for over 30 years. They have two stepbrothers: Tyson, aged 20, and Drew, aged 17; a stepsister, Skye, aged 14; and a foster sister, Felicity, aged 16. They are part of an Australian family which is now broken and broken-hearted. The children were kidnapped over two months ago, yet their mother cannot phone them, no consular officials have been allowed to visit them, and Jacquie feels that she is farther removed from her children now than she was two months ago. Jacquie wrote to Senator Evans on 16 September requesting a meeting 'as a matter of urgency', but was refused. Honourable members should keep in mind the fact that, although over two months have elapsed since the kidnapping, Senator Evans and Mrs Gillespie have never met. On Sunday, 30 August, Prime Minister Keating stated that he wished to develop Australia's international profile 'as a caring nation'. Yet representations to him from friends of the Gillespies have also fallen on deaf ears. After representations to the Prime Minister by Mr E. D. MCArthur of Hughesdale, Victoria, an official of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet merely forwarded the comments to the office of Senator Evans. I conclude my condemnation of Senator Evans and the Labor Government over their appalling handling of the Gillespie affair by, seeking leave to table certain documents to which I have referred throughout my remarks and which I have already shown to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton). Leave granted.",62
153,Unknown,ASSENT TO BILLS,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 8 p.m.,64
154,Mr RUDDOCK,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I wish to raise in these estimates concerning Attorney-General's Department a matter relating to accountability. I am concerned in relation to an issue which I have raised with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on a number of occasions and about which, to date, I have not received any formal advice from him. Were it not for the fact that I have had responses from other Ministers which have suggested that they also have referred issues to the Attorney, I would be in some doubt as to whether or not the matter was receiving attention at all. I first wrote to the Attorney on 16 December 1991. I wrote again on 15 May 1992 and, subsequently, in August of this year. To identify the issue, I am concerned particularly about litigation involving Mrs Sylvia Margaret Faulkner and the Commonwealth of Australia. I want to take the opportunity; may, in as short a way as possible, to advise the chamber of the issues that are relevant in this matter that I referred to the Attorney, firstly in December 1991, then in May and, finally, on 13 August 1992. This matter is described as involving proceedings commenced by Mrs Faulkner in the High Court in 1974. She, as the plaintiff, claimed to have suffered a considerable loss as a result of fraudulent and/or negligent statements made by Brigadier Flint as Engineer-in-Chief in the Australian Army. Proceedings wereÂ· transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court. While all this was happening, Mrs Faulkner became bankrupt and the proceedings were continued by the trustee in bankruptcy of her estate. The costs in relation to that matter were to be met by the Commonwealth under the provisions of section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act. A shorthand description is that that information was taken from some brief advice by the Australian Government Solicitor to the Law Council of Australia as to the issues. The Commonwealth in this matter was responsible for both the costs of defending the Commonwealth-that is, the Department of Defence-and the costs of the proceedings of the plaintiff because she had a substantial claim against the Commonwealth. If that claim were to be successful, the estate would the be reimbursed considerably and perhaps there would be funds left over for Mrs Faulkner. In the course of the litigation, the Commonwealth reassessed its decision, which at first involved an acceptance of the total liability to meet the costs for properly conducting these proceedings. The Commonwealth reassessed its position and, shortly before the matter was to be dealt with before the court, on advice from the Solicitor-General, I am told, the Commonwealth determined to constrain the basis upon which the proceedings could be pursued. It is important to note that there were quite extensive restrictions placed upon the conduct of those proceedings. There were restrictions as to the amount of time and the extent to which counsel could be involved. There were restrictions placed upon the evidence that if I could be brought in these proceedings. They were very limiting restrictions which Mr and Mrs Faulkner believe effectively constrained their ability to be successful in these proceedings. Witnesses were required from abroad in order to adduce the necessary evidence to sustain the case. Once it had been detennined that the costs of bringing those witnesses could not be met as part of the defence, the ability of the plaintiff in this to be successful was severely jeopardised. There is a very real concern, which I have raised because it has been raised with me by Mrs Faulkner's professional advisers-and it seems a proper point to be made-that, in order to protect himself, the Commonwealth Attorney sought advice from the Solicitor General. The Solicitor-General, Dr Gavan Griffith, was the Commonwealth's principal legal adviser in relation to the proceedings involving the defence of the Commonwealth's position. As I understand it, he was not directly conducting that case, but he was called upon to give advice, wearing another hat, to the Commonwealth as to whether or not the aid under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act should continue. Here he was, trying to set up a Chinese wall. That term is used in relation to legal advisers and other professionals who are acting for both sides and are supposed to set up some wall which would enable them to make their judgments quite independently of the other pressures that might ordinarily be there. The Faulkners, properly, believe that the fact that the Solicitor-General was asked to deal with this matter in that way put him in a very invidious position. They were also not confident that it was an effective wall. They believe-and this point has been made very clearly to the Attorney in the correspondence that I have sent to him-that this matter may have been settled. I am told that there had been certain intimations that amounts as high as $800,000 might be talked of in view of effecting a settlement in this case. If those negotiations had been pressed and an offer made, a settlement may have been concluded. It seems somewhat more than coincidental that at a later time, after the Solicitor-General had had the opportunity to pursue the claimants' evidence and the way in which they were intending to conduct their case, not only was there a certificate given under section 305 limiting the assistance available to conduct the case-only a matter of weeks before the case was to be tried-but the formal offer which had been intimated might be forthcoming never came. Here we have the Commonwealth's adviser case able to look at the evidence on the one hand and offer advice. Perhaps we would be led to believe that, having undertaken that review, none of that information made its way into the hands of the Commonwealth, wearing its other hat, to enable the Commonwealth to know that if the matter were pressed, the claimants would be in a very much more difficult position to sustain their case. I have seen some advice from Mrs Faulkner's legal advisers to the Solicitor-General indicating quite clearly that they would be in a very much more difficult position to be able to sustain the case in this matter if those overseas witnesses were not available. My principal reason for raising this matter is that I think there are substantial matters that need to be addressed by the Attorney-General, and they need to be the subject of review. There are letters from me from December last year, through to May and August, that have not been replied to. Mr and Mrs Faulkner are both elderlyÂ·Â· people. There is medical evidence that suggests that, as elderly people and with the illnesses they are suffering from, they may even lose the ability to prosecute this matter as a result of the intervention of death. I would regard it as a tragedy if the delay in dealing with these matters were to further prejudice Mr and Mrs Faulkner. I think there are serious matters that the House ought to be aware of and that the Attorney ought to address as a matter of urgency. That is the reason I take this opportunity in these Estimates of pressing these matters at this time. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Transport and Communications Proposed expenditure $1,316,482,000.",64
155,Mr SMITH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Transport and Communications, one of the starting points should be the structure of the Department and whether or not it is appropriate to have transport and communications combined. The number of Ministers we have had in the transport and communications area, and the number of assistant Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, is quite staggering. the communications area particularly has seen some dramatic changes in policy. Of course, this has to be reflected in the Budget allocations. These dramatic changes in policy have taken place over a period when we have had six Ministers. We have had Minister Kerin and Minister Richardson. We have now the current Minister, Senator Collins, and previously we had Minister Willis. Senator Evans, I think, was the first Minister, and there was Minister Beazley. The dramatic changes that have been taking place in these policy areas and, at the same time, the rapid changes in their administration by. a variety of different Ministers, do raise the prospect that this area, which is vital for micro-economic reform, perhaps has not seen the level of ministerial overview that it might otherwise have had. Certainly the instability in this area has been regrettable. Despite all of that there have been some changes, the most dramatic of which have been the changes to telecommunications last year and the recent changes to broadcasting law which came through the Parliament recently. When that broadcasting legislation came to the Parliament, it went to the Senate where an element of it was extracted-the pay TV area. That was sent off to a committee of the Senate to determine what might be the best way to deal with the start-up of the pay television industry in this nation. The Senate has now reported and we wait here today to determine what might happen and what is the state of play with regard to pay television. We are all rather intrigued to know exactly what the Government is going to do. Many potential players in the industry have waited a long time. I remember in past years a former member from our side of the chamber introduced a private member's Bill to try to facilitate pay television in this country. That was some number of years ago now, and we were almost on the threshold of commencing pay television. That opportunity was snatched away at the last moment because of the Government's inability to think through its policy. It arrived at the position that it took into the Senate in a Sunday morning television interview from the Prime Minister In recent times (Mr Keating). But enough is enough, and it is appropriate in this appropriations debate to make some judgments and some statements about where the pay television industry is going. To highlight this particular point, I wish to move the following amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1992-93: That the proposed expenditure be reduced by $10. (as an instruction to the Government to appoint for one year only the balance of board members to the Australian Broadcasting Authority; and to bring forward legislation to implement the development of an open and competitive satellite subscription broadcasting industry in this country which puts consumer interest first: (a) by issuing all satellite subscription television licences at the same time with no exclusivity period; (b) by not mandating the technology to be utilised by subscription television licensees; (c) by requiring a common standard for customer reception equipment for a period of two years; (d) by requiring an Australian content level of only ten percent.) I think I need to outline why it is that I have taken this rather unusual step to highlight the difficulty that the Government has got itself into with regard to pay television, and I also wish to raise another matter. This amendment seeks to reduce the appropriation applied to the Department of Transport and Communications by the sum of $10, being a clear instruction to the Government, and particularly to the Minister and the Cabinet, to develop an open and competitive arrangement and structure for pay television in this country. There are a couple of key points that I outline in this amendment that I know the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  and unfortunately we will have to divide on the matter. Those key points will have to be at the forefront of Senator Collins's mind and the Cabinet's mind as they finally formulate a pay TV policy. First, we should be issuing all satellite subscription television the same time with no exclusivity period. There ought not to be a preferential position for any particular players; everyone ought to be able to bid for the available transponders that are going to be offered by Optus at the same time. We do not believe, and I have said this many times, that there ought to be any exclusivity period. Secondly, we ought not to be mandating the technology to be utilised by subscription television licensees. It is a real trap when there are rapid changes in technology for parliaments to be sitting here and to say, 'In 1992 you have to use a particular type of technology'. If parliaments do that, they may be circumscribing the possibilities for market players to adopt other technologies that can deliver perhaps a better service at a better price to consumers. Who are we to say, and how are we to say, that we have all the knowledge to be able to determine what the technologies ought to be? So I think it should be a clear policy, and this is a policy that the Government did pursue in its telecommunications legislation, of being technologically neutral. We must not mandate the technologies that can be used. The third point is that we ought also be aware that, in the multiplicity of delivery mechanisms that might become available for pay television, we do not want to see happen in Australia what happened in the United Kingdom when pay television arrived. There was a variety of customer reception equipment that was incompatible with each other, so a person would take one particular service and buy one particular black box which would have the capacity to take only one type of signal. There are possibilities for there to be black boxes that are compatible with a variety of reception capacities so that one can take several different signals, mating from different technologies. Consumers would not then find themselves in a position where, if they wanted to change, they have to go out and spend another $500-odd on reception equipment. I have said for some considerable time, as indeed the Senate committee has said, that we must look towards trying to set a common standard for customer reception licences at equipment. One of the things that I think has not underpinned the Government's approach to communications policy is putting the consumer first. Whatever happened to the consumer? I think many from the Government side involved in the administratiori of the communications area have forgotten about the consumer. They are the ones we ought to be putting first. What those opposite have succeeded in doing in a whole variety of television decisions and radio decisions is visiting upon the industry extreme financial difficulty which has meant that the range of services provided to the community has diminished in variety rather than increasing. I can point to the devastation that has been visited upon the radio industry over a long period of time. For forty years other countries have had a broad range of FM services, but in this country we are still seeing many areas where PM has not become available. That has all been a product of a ludicrous government policy in more recent years that has meant that PM has not got to regional areas particularly, and I think that is very regrettable. The aggregation policy, the amount conceived with a view to trying to service and give extra choice to consumers, has been done in such a way that consumers have actually had to pay mightily for it. The amount of money that taxpayers have put into try to make aggregation work-that is, three competing services in regional markets-has meant that taxpayers have funded well over $140m-odd a year with sales tax concessions and so on to try to make this policy work. But at the same time these competing services have seen the range of programming diminish rather than increase. I well remember in the old chamber, I think in 1986, speaking in the debate about aggregation and trying to bring to consumers extra choice. We debated then multi-channel services, as they were called, and different options for utilising different technologies to visit upon consumers extra choice but still the same time make it viable for the communication company deliverers of those services to continue to be viable. Of course, the Government would not listen, so we have continued to pay year on year extra subsidies, extra support for a policy that was conceived with possibly the right motives but in total ignorance of what its impact would be. That would not be so bad if one could not foresee it, but people in the industry and members of the Opposition told the Government what the problem would be. That is why we see this huge figure being appropriated in the Budget to support those services. (TIme expired)",65
156,Mr HOLLIS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Let me say at the outset that I do not agree with the amendment, but let me also say that there is one point on which I agree with the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). I also find it quite puzzling why we have transport and communications lobbed in together. No-one consults me on the composition of departments, so I am as puzzled as he is. My personal view, which does not reflect the view of the Government, is that they are such important and diverse departments that perhaps we would be better served if they were separate departments headed by separate Ministers. But that is only my personal view. To illustrate his point, the honourable member for Bass spent his allocated time talking about communications. I will be spending my allocated time talking about transport. The appropriation for transport and communications illustrates this Labor Government's approach to these two disciplines. This has to be contrasted with the approach of the Opposition. Nowhere are the proposals of the conservatives more discredited than in the area of road transport. Not only is their policy as presented in the Fightback! document discredited, but also this much-vaunted document has a $6 billion hole in it. In Fightback much is made of the abolition of the fuel excise. We are also told that the conservatives would implement cost recovery in each vehicle class. So, while theÂ· Opposition runs around Australia promising at cheaper petrol, it knows that there is a $6 billion funding shortage for roads. Honourable members opposite talk about the cut in the cost of fuel but there is also a slug there. There would be a reduction in the cost of fuel but the slug would be for the road user. Those opposite would slug the road user with another tax. Quite recently we saw a stunt by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in Lismore selling petrol for what he said was a GST price. Obviously, this was a farce, about something the coalition knows it could never deliver because it would never fund a roads program. It is no wonder that the local newspaper on the north coast labelled it a 'ridiculous stunt' and said that the Opposition must take the local people for mugs. I invite the honourable member for Flinders to try that stunt in the Illawarra and see the reception he gets. The people of the Illawarra, especially the truckies, would want to know the real cost. The coalition's secret tax, a road user charge which it says it will impose but which it will not spell out, is causing considerable anxiety in the road transport industry and, indeed, in the wider community. There is no doubt that the coalition's position on road user charges continues to be riddled with confusion. This has to be contrasted with the Government's co-operative consultation with the road transport industry to create long term stability for operators. The Opposition's refusal to spell out details of its secret road tax will lead to serious undermining of confidence. Its reluctance to come clean and spell out exactly what road user charges would be imposed by it is having a destabilising influence on those industries relying heavily on transport. Earlier today I heard the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) say that he had recently addressed a meeting of some 600 people in his electorate and that after he had explained the GST to them they were very excited. Far be it from me to doubt the explanative ability of the honourable member for Parkes, but 'very excited' might be the operative words. All road users should get very excited. I guess the honourable member for Parkes has many farmers in his electorate. They should be concerned and excited about the imposition of a road user tax ofÂ· up to $30,000 on their trucks. No wonder the National Farmers Federation is very concerned. If the Opposition disputes this it should the Australian people how the nation's roads are to be funded. The Government has spelt it out in its document. Is the Opposition not going to build roads? Is it not going to repair them? The coalition needs to explain its policy on roads fully to the road transport industry. It needs to explain it fully to the farmers and to the wider Australian community. Until it does so no-one will regard its policies as having any degree of credibility. The honourable member for Parkes also spoke glowingly about New Zealand. The New Zealand that he visited must have been a very different place from the one I visited with the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of this chamber in June. We had a look at how the transport system was working in that country, and I came back with a markedly different view from that of the honourable member for Parkes. The Opposition has been saying that cheaper petrol prices will lower the price of goods, but how can they when the road user charge will be passed on? Does the Opposition believe that this hidden levy will not be passed on? Not only will the Opposition collect a 15 per cent goods and services tax on everything, but the hidden road user tax will also be added to everything. The present Federal fuel excise, which the coalition claims it will abolish in government, is, as already stated, approximately 27c a litre. Private motorists, according to the Opposition, will pay about 19c a litre less under a coalition government, which means that they will be left with a GST of about 8c a litre. But, as the coalition well knows, on present national fuel consumption levels this 8c a litre is only one-third of what is required to fund Australia's annual $5 billion road construction and maintenance program. In any case, the GST is intended to be a general revenue tax and not a road construction tax. The Opposition has several options. The first option is to add a 16c a litre road user charge to its 8c a litre GST to finance the $5 billion national road program. But the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is adamant that this will not-repeat, not-take the form tell of a fuel tax. The second option is for the coalition to collect the shortfall by direct charges on private motorists and on commercial vehicles-a move which for motorists and commercial operators would largely negate the removal of the fuel excise. The third and only remaining option available to the coalition unless it intends that $3 billion plus of federally funded road works-that is, Federal special purpose grants and untied funds-be suspended per year is to finance the $3 billion plus gap out of general revenue. Obviously, this would mean diverting $3 billion in government funds from other programs such as defence, health, education or social security. It would also mean that the Opposition would have to drop all pretence of being committed to the user pays approach to charging for road use. This principle, which the Opposition presently supports, is crucial to the reform of the road transport industry. Simple arithmetic tells us that unless the Opposition arranges to suspend over $4 billion worth of road words across Australia every year-road works paid for or underwritten by the Federal Government in one way or another-it must maintain a fuel excise of at least 16c a litre in addition to its GST of 8c a litre for private motorists. Mr Hawker-This is all nonsense.",68
157,Mr HOLLIS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The honourable member may think so. The clear implication is that the price of petrol for private motorists could not possibly be reduced by 19c a litre. At an absolute maximum it could be reduced by no more than 2c or 3c a litre by abolishing the present 27c excise, introducing a new 16c fuel charge and adding 8c to the GST. Our appeal to the Opposition is to stop this nonsense, to come clean and tell us how it will fund the roadworks of Australia. In conclusion, I commend the Government for the figure in the Budget to update the Indian Pacific. I think the Indian Pacific has the potential to become one of the great train journeys of the world. It can be a paying proposition, but it has to be promoted correctly. As we have seen with the Ghan, if it is promoted correctly it can be a revenue earner for the Government. The Government took a commendable step in allocating that money for the upgrading of the Indian Pacific. I think it will be a decision the Government will reap many rewards from.",69
158,Mr HAWKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I must start by refuting some of the utter nonsense espoused by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I thought he understood the basic thrust of the Budget a more than that. I remind him that the base funding from the Commonwealth for roads is around $1.4 billion. How he could say there is a $6 billion shortage for roads in Fightback is beyond me. It does his own credibility a lot of damage. He obviously had difficulty in reading the notes that he was given, let alone thinking about how nonsensical it all is. His speech was riddled with confusion, and simple arithmetic would tell him that. The Commonwealth puts a base rate of $1.4 billion into roads, and another $600m has been allocated in the February economic statement. There is no question that, once the Government has had that one-off extra spending, it will be winding that back, as has been shown in the Budget Papers. I also point out very clearly to the honourable member for Throsby that the National Farmers Federation in its analysis said that the Fightback package would benefit farmers by between 7 and 22 per cent, depending on the type of farming operation. If we read the words, we see that that analysis included a worse case assumption on what a likely road user charge might be. The honourable member ought to do a bit more homework and take a bit more time to study and understand the matter before he comes into this chamber and makes a complete and utter fool of himself. I wish to talk specifically about the land transport program. The recession we 'had to have' has taken a very big toll on the freight volumes of both road and rail sections. If honourable members look at Tasrail, they will see that Tasrail freight volumes have certainly been affected by the recession. because it relies largely on export freight, such as woodchip logs. The other thing to note about this recession we 'had to have' is the effect that it has had on employment. Employment has fallen in four successive quarters. Nothing I have heard today would point to the fact that that is likely to change in the immediate future. I guess of equal concern is the fact that, since the 1990 September quarter, private investment has fallen continually. A dismal bit picture has been painted by the recession we 'had to have', and the architect of that recession is the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I tum now to road funding. Although there has been an increase in spending-this was announced in the February statement and is only for the next two years-it is only a vote buying exercise. If we look a bit deeper at the record of this Government, we find that Labor has an appalling record. Since this Government came to office, dver the last nine years-apart from the current year-we have seen a steady erosion, or reduction in real terms, in the amount of money going into roads. At the same time, the amount of revenue that has been taken off road users has risen quite dramatically. Fuel excise alone, which is dragged off motorists, is now over $7 billion a year. This shows the cynicism the Government has towards the road users and, in particular, the road freight industry. The Government is prepared to tax the industry to the hilt as a source of general revenue rather than looking at the question of user pays, which contrasts strongly with the approach that will be taken by a coalition government. We have to remember who allowed the deterioration of our roads today. The Government has belatedly recognised this deterioration and has given a sudden one-off increase, which would be phased out in the next election if the Government had a chance. Mr Bill Bytheway, the Chief Executive of one of the major road freight companies, Mayne Nickless, made the following point about the taxing of the road transport industry: Nearly one third of Australia's transport costs on government taxes anacharges, Ilurting Australia's micro-economic reform process. That spells it out very clearly. There is a for micro-economie-reform ---'l'he fact is we want cheaper, more efficient One of the major areas of refonn, which the ightbaek package addresses so _cltmrly, take the tax off road freight. It is an mediate cost to business. To tax road freight for the sake of taxing it means that the cost of doing business in Austr.aliaJs....significantly increased - - -- some Let us look at the various taxes. As I mentioned, the Government expects to raise $7.3 billion from fuel tax alone this year. Sales tax is expected to rise and it will extended to some categories of fann trucks. The Governmenfnas failed dismally to tackle another major tax on road transport: payr()ll tax. The Government has clearly fourullCtoo hard and is not prepared to bite the bullet, despite the fact that it has been given a lead by the coalition through the Fightback age. One can only assume that the poration's Government's approach in this whole area that it is t60 hard and that it is going to taxing the industry, keep using it as a milch cow, and keeP taking more and more out with this indirect, hidden tax without ting to the Australian public just how much it is taking and, more significantly, ever admitting how little of the revenlle=t'aised===w=mu-h=n0is-acle,particularli through road users actually goes back into roads I would like to tum quickly to the of rail funding. After having neglected _ nearly-as-theGovemment has suddenly recognised the difficulties it has caused our railways. There is a belated effort to - ttl--1'edress that imbalance. I noticed in the ly. Budget Papers that the National Rail Corporation was allocated $4Om last year as Commonwealth's equity contribution. For the year it was able to spend only $S.9m-less than one-quarter of the amount that allocated. This was due to the late date caused by delays in negotiations between the NRC and the rail unions. This Government always tries to pride itself on its .close relationship with the unions. Yet when went it is put to the test these are the sorts of results. The Government has allocated $162m to rail this year. Again, we must raise very need serious questions as to whether that will be that spent because that industrial agreement has transport. still not been signed. Un-er that heads of government agreement, is to that mdustrial agreement was supposed to interhave been signed by this month and then the equity contributions would be paid. But the question then arises: since the agreement has not been signed, and if it is not signed for time, what will happen to that money? have Also, very significantly and most importantly, what will happen to interstate rail freight? We see today that the New South Wales be State Rail Authority is already winding down its operations in interstate rail freight because it says that it is now the responsibility of the National Rail Corporation; but the National Rail Corporation still does not have that agreement in place. Will there be a hiatus and a loss of business? Will that jeopardise further packthe prospects of the. National Rail Cormeeting its,farget ofbreaking-ev6n is within three years and being profitable after keep five? These are very serious questions because we are talking about not only very large sums of money but also the fact that our railways ever admitare losing so much money. Again I come back to the question of spending by this Government on rail and how in the the February economic statement, the One Nation statement, about the big allocation to rail; question how .$45-m was going to be spent. The rail for question IS: how much of that money has been spent to date? We are now in.Octoo-er for - e.re was a lot of hYl?e and promise a-out try thiS, the money was gomg to be spent qUlckI leave honourable members with a very the simple question: how much of that money has been spent to date? If so little has been spent, as I understand to be the case, why has the was Government been such a dismal failure in start-up getting that program under way?",70
159,Mr SNOW,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Eden-Monaro) (S.41 p.m.)The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has just stated that there are a number of serious questions to be answered about road and rail. Well, at last there is an attempt to develop a strategy. At last, after nearly 30 years of rail being allowed to decline substant-:> lly and of not looking at the true costs of either road or rail or at the real need to bring our various transport systems together-shipping, air, road and rail-there is an attempt to develop a plan and at last we are looking at the serious issues. At last those questions are being tackled and I welcome the increasing national approach that is being taken, particularly by the Federal Government but also by State governments, as we try to make ourselves one nation as regards transport and as we try to develop one transport system that is efficient and could save many billions of dollars through increased efficiency and coordination in getting away from the old bad habits that we had. The Opposition has come up with some alternatives in its Fightback proposals. The more one looks at Fightback the more one finds holes in the alternatives that the Opposition has presented. With regard to the Opposition's fuel tax, it tells us that there be 19c off. I remember the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) daring any member of the Parliament to attack the proposal of the Opposition to take 19c off fuel taxes. But hidden away in Fightback are the words 'the user will pay'. The honourable member for Wannon has just mentioned that we collect about $7.3 billion in fuel taxes. We collect at least $7.5 billion in licences, registration fees and fuel taxes all together. We are paying out about $5 billion, we were told, in road costs. Mr Hawker-I didn't say that.",71
160,Mr SNOW,ASSENT TO BILLS,"No, he did not say that. It may be more; it may be less. But one thing is certain: total road costs, by the time one includes the environmental costs, traffic lights, kerbing and guttering and accidents, will be well above that $5 billion. In fact the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has just revealed an estimate of the cost of road accidents to be about $6 billion in total. One can add the environmental costs to that. We are gradually finding out the figures that previously were too hard for us to work out. This is the important work being done by organisations such as the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. That creates very real problems for the Opposition with its user pays philosophy. The user will pay for roads. We have been talking about getting to the truth about rail. Let us start talking about getting to the truth about roads. It could mean a large increase in fuel costs if the user really does pay for roads. Will it be $10 billion or $7 billion? Those opposite would have to add, not take off, fuel taxes. Of course, they do not say exactly how the user will pay for roads. What will they do? Will they do what they did with the payroll tax? They were very generous in saying that they would get rid of payroll tax. But who collects payroll tax? It is the State governments. Would the Opposition do that to get the alleged reduction of 19c a litre fuel tax with the user pays principle on the roads? Will it tell the States that they can develop the roads, run the roads and upgrade the will roads; that they can spend all the money and raise the money? Will the States collect it? Just like the payroll tax, it is an easy piece of duckshoving-just send it over to the States and let them do it. It could be added on to registration fees so that we would have huge registration fees, with perhaps pensioners paying out large amounts once a year. With a principle of user pays, the money has to come from somewhere. So will pensioners have to pay it in their registration fees? If not, will it be added only to trucks? If it were added to trucks only, let us think what that would do to costs in places such as Bombala where there is no rail, or places on the south-east coast right down from Bombaderry to the Victorian border in New South Wales. In all of those towns such as Batemans Bay, Moruya, Bermagui, Narooma, Eden, Bega, Merimbula and all the small towns around people would have to pay a lot more because, instead of a $4,000 fee for some heavy vehicles, which has just been agreed to by the Premiers and by the National Road Transport Commission, it could be $17,000. Mr Hollis-Or $30,000 on a Kenworth.",72
161,Mr SNOW,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I thank the honourable member for Throsby, who is a real expert in land transport issues. Just think what $30,000 would do to prices-the prices that pensioners and others pay for food. So those opposite have to tell us exactly which of these it will be. Will it be any of these, will it be something else, or will it be the lot? They say that the user will pay-so we and the people of Australia want to know how they will administer this user pays policy in their Fightback package. They cannot do it and reduce petrol prices by 19c a litre without adding to the costs somewhere else. So they should be telling us clearly where it is going to be. Today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) mentioned that $30 billion was being given to the States. Unfortunately, last year the Federal Government agreed with the Premiers that it would no longer be designating funds to the States specifically for roads. I believe that was a wrong move by this Government and by the Premiers. That should never have been done because we here have to be accountable for taxpayers' money. I think it is two years since the Auditor General indicated that 18 months after money had been transferred from the Federal Government to the States the Federal Government was unable to account for $6 billion of that funding that had been given to the States-Federal taxpayers' money, not the Federal Government's money; it had not been properly accounted for. So we do not know what is happening to our money. It is important that we as a Federal government are - ccountable to our taxpayers for money that IS spent. It was a wrong move to stop naming funds specifically for roads to both Federal and State governments. We have seen plenty of mistakes. For instance, many years ago New South Wales Premier Askin refused funding from the Whitlam Government because it was not going to be spent in the way the Whitlam Government said; so he would not take it. This has given us a legacy of bad roads in New South Wales. We are still catching up with those mistakes. One can drive in many other States and find that the roads are much better. I firmly believe it is because the New South Wales Government was being difficult about a Federal government telling it how to spend money that it had collected from Federal taxpayers. We also had the case where the New South Wales and Victorian governments disagreed on where an inland link between New South Wales and Victoria should be. They disagreed on whether it should be the B6nang Highway or the Monaro Highway. The Victorians decided that it should be the Cann Valley Highway, which leads into the Monaro Highway. New South Wales decided that it should be the Bonang Highway. Each did their bit of bitumen and both lead to nowhere. It will still be another two or three years before we catch up and the New South Wales Government completes the Monaro Highway and joins it up with the already bitumened Cann Valley Highway in Victoria. This hopeless situation is not just costly; socially it is a bad decision. Economically, from a tourism point of view . creates huge problems. It . ' Then there is the case of the Princes Highway and the Kings Highway in New South Wales. The State Government has decided that it does not regard these roads as warranting national arterial priority, so it did not include them in a list to the Federal Government. We are giving the States money and saying to them, 'You work out what your priority is'. They decide what the priority is and we have no say. The States' decisions may not necessarily suit the nation. It may well be that the Pacific Highway and the Princes Highway are a great and important second link between Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales-an alternative link-and it may not suit the nation not to list those highways as a priority. The Federal Government ought to be making the decision itself, and it ought to be making a decision in favour of those highways. It cannot do so because it suits the New South Wales Government to say that its priority is different. (Time expired)",73
162,Mr SHARP,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It is interesting to follow the contribution of my friend the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) tonight. Without wishing to offer too much advice to him, I would suggest that he spend less time read ins the propaganda that is put out by Australian Labor Party headquarters about what the coalition's Fightback package and its heavy vehicle road user charge i- all about, bec.ause I can assure honourable members that what theyÂ· have just heard from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is simply that it is just propaganda designed to scare the good citizens out there and to distort us from the truth of the policy that the coalition takes the next election in. regard ,to road funding and the heavy vehicle road user charge. By any fair and objective measurement, one can easily see-as I am sure the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, when he is not reading Labor Party propaganda, would agree-that the coalition takes a far better policy for road funding to the next election campaign. Our road user charge will be applied after the fuel excise has been removed. An amount of 26c a litre will be taken off the price of fuel for those heavy vehicles. Any charge like that has to be better than a charge that will be imposed by this Government which will be a heavy vehicle .road user charge on top of the 26c a litre tax that the Government is imposing at the present time. It is worth noting also that since this Government came to power in 1983-nearly 10 years ago-it has increased that fuel excise from some 6c a litre to 26c a litre and in the interim it has reduced the amount of road funding from the Commonwealth by about 26 per cent in real terms. My colleague the honourable member forWannon (Mr Hawker), I am sure, will be able to correct me if I am a little wrong. It is around 26 per cent in real terms since this Labor Government came to power. This Government has nothing to crow about when it comes to road funding. Indeed, distorting the coalition's policy will,do it good because people in the heavy vehicle industry and the various motoring associations around Australia and organisations such as the National Farmers Federation-a body that is very important in the electorate of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro-all recognise the virtues of the coalition's policies on heavy vehicles and road funding and indeed in terms of the cost of motoring for the average motorist, let alone for heavy vehicles. Tonight I wish to speak a little about the waterfront reform program that has been undertaken by this Government. Indeed we are coming up very shortly to the third anniversary of waterfront reform, which should to be the conclusion of waterfront reform under this Government. We have seen a great deal of trumpeting from Senator Collins, the former Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, over the last year or so about what the Government has achieved and more particularly, as he would tell us, what he has achieved in waterfront reform. He seriously misinformed the people of Australia by telling them that if waterfront reform was not completed within 12 months of his taking over the job he would resign. Having had a 12-month anniversary of his taking over the job and waterfront reform being a long way from completion, he did not resign. So we immediately knew the type of personality and character that we were dealing with. Senator Collins has continued to provide rather exaggerated statements about the benefits of waterfront reform. The acid test of any reform process, whether on the waterfront or whatever, is whether the process has delivered reduced costs and improved services. Using that as our basic measurement. to analyse whether waterfront reform has been successful in Australia, I think we can say quite categorically that under this Government waterfront reform has not achieved what it should have. If honourable members went to all the shipping and waterfront conferences that I have the pleasure of attending they would hear the people who use the waterfront no continually getting up at conferences and in the question times that follow speeches and saying, 'Look, we've been using the waterfront for the last few years and we've not noticed any reduction in the cost of moving goods across the Australian waterfront'. . If we compare that example given by users of the waterfront with the experiences in New Zealand, we soon realise that when New Zealand undertook its reform process on the waterfront three years ago-exactly the same time that this Government did-New Zealand, by undertaking real reform of the waterfront, has achieved real advantages. For example, this Government's own document which it released in May this year, which did an analysis of stevedoring costs over the last couple of years, shows us that when waterfront reform commenced in New Zealand the cost of moving a 20-foot container was $298. '!\vo and a half years after waterfront reform had been undertaken in New Zealand, the cost had gone from $298 a container to $166 a container-a fall of some $132 per container. Meanwhile in Australia, under this Labor Government, with waterfront reform commencing at the same time and being analysed under the same process, the cost of moving a 20-foot container was $282 when waterfront reform commenced and in May, according to the figures that were published then, the cost of moving a container had fallen by the mighty sum of $4 to $278 a container. In New Zealand there was a $132 fall in the cost and in Australia there was fall in the cost of moving a container. The comparisons could not be more stark when we look at one of the major users of .our waterfront that travels between Australia and New Zealand-that is, Tasman Pulp and Paper, which has a couple of ships which supply the Trans Tasman. Its representatives said at the Australian Port and Marine Authority's conference held in June this year in Manly-in fact I spoke at it-that their stevedoring costs in Sydney ranged from $9.16 to $11.13 per tonne. Yet in New Zealand, after its waterfront reform had delivered the sorts of benefits that would be the envy of anybody, the cost of stevedoring was $2.72 to $2.96 per tonne. So it is easy to see, from $11.13 to $2.96, that New Zealand, with its waterfront reform process, has achieved the sorts of things that the coalition intends to achieve with its own waterfront reform process. Having had virtually no reduction in the costs of using our Australian waterfront, we have seen massive amounts of taxpayers' money going into the hands of retiring waterside workers. The Commonwealth Government, under the auspices of its waterfront reform program, will have spent $43Om over the last three years in topping up the retirement packages of retiring waterside workers-an additional redundancy payment of $100,000, on average, on top of their normal superannuation, long service leave and sick leave payments-to entice waterside workers to retire ahead of schedule. By anybody's measure, that is the most accommodating and generous redundancy package that has been offered to any Australian worker in the history of this country-all because the Waterside Workers Federation is a very powerful element of the Australian labour movement and this Government does not have the courage to stand up to it. As a result of that $43Om we have undoubtedly seen some reductions on the waterfront in terms 'of waterside labour. But have we seen benefits for the people whom the waterfront is designed to serve-that is, the users; the exporters and importers? Have we a $4 seen them get any benefits? The answer is no. The only people who have derived benefit from the Government's waterfront reform process have been the retiring wharfies who have picked up an extra $430m. Needless to say, very few sectors of Australian society can boast that sort of generosity from this Government. Whilst ever we have legislated jobs for life for wharfies, whilst ever we have stevedoring levies in place, whilst ever the Waterside Workers Federation has an iron grip on the Australian waterfrorit, and whilst ever stevedore managers look to the. Commonwealth to solve their business problems nobody in this country can claim that the . Australian waterfront has been reformed I properly and that the benefits of it have flowed through to the people whom the waterfront is designed to serve: the userS. This is the sorry tale of the Government's three-year refonn process. It will continue for the next few years, I think at great cost exporters. This Government will simply add further taxes to the cost of our exports as a result of its refonns on the waterfront. (TIme expired)",73
163,Mr OKEEFE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I would like to participate in this debate and pick up some of the comments made by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and provide a broader, and perhaps more accurate, explanation of some of the issues which are before us. I think the Government's record of reform in transport and communications, particularly since 1990, is one which nobody can criticise or fail to be impressed by. If one runs through the range of issues and achievements in this portfolio, including the announcements contained in the One Nation statement earlier this year and the Budget, it becomes a fonnidable list. I will tell you, Madam Chair, about an interesting experience I had a few weeks ago. Mr Hollis-Tell us all.",76
164,Mr OKEEFE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I will; I will tell the P,arliament. I took a group Of about 80 of what I guess I would call opinion leaderspeople who are the chalnnen of their local regional development committee, mayors or people who have a lot of influence around the local community in Victoria-for a tour of the Melbourne transport hub. I did it for one reason and one reason alone. The honourable member for Gilmore, in particular, is one who wanders around Australia telling people about all of these problems. So I thought, 'Hang on, instead of hearing all this kind of stuff why don't you have a look for yourselves?'. We started at Melbourne airport-an airport that has been described by the Opposition and others as a Third World airport. The group looked at the development plans and saw for themselves the work which is taking place. From there we went to see the western bypass which has just opened-the new national highway ring road which will eventually link the Hume Highway to the Western Highway. It will take the trucks off Pascoe Vale Road but, more importantly; willÂ· provide a major link between road, rail, sea and air in what is arguably Australia's transport hub. We then went to see rail transport. The to our honourable member sitting beside me, my good friend the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), will take particular delight in this. We went to South Dynon rail yard where the National Rail Corporation is about to take over operations-which is the first time in Australia that we have a national rail corporation encompassing the six States and bringing their operations together in this way. We could see there a quite amazing turnaround, not only in the business being won by rail in the area of heavy transport but also in goods being delivered with very high levels of efficiency and on time: When the honourable member for Gilmore talks about the costs not being passed on, I can tell him that a factory in Cheltenham in the southern part of Melbourne which wants to send a container overnight to Parramatta in Sydney and which was previously sending that container for between $900 to $1,100 overnight on a truck, can now put the same container on rail on the superfreighter for $450. They are very significant improvements. The container arrives in Sydney next morning and is delivered on time. The people I took around could see all of this. We then went to the waterfront. Many of these councillors-particularly the rural councillors off the fann-had heard the honourable member for Gilmore and his colleagues talking about all of the wharfies sitting around playing cards and that sort of thing. What did they see at the waterfront? They saw stacks and stacks of containers-no wharfies in sight. We happened to arrive when a ship was due to leave. Honourable members know the old story: when a ship was due to leave they used to say, 'Well, you know, it will be going at 5.30 p.m. You had better get off the ship at around 20 past five'. We left the ship and it was stacked up, packed up and gone. At 5.30 it was out in the middle of the river on its way to Tasmania. About two minutes before the ship closed its gate a truck arrived with a container. I said to the foreman, 'Well, I guess he's missed the boat' - to coin a phrase. The foreman said,Â· 'Oh no, we'll get him on'. In front of us all this container was taken off the light truck, loaded onto the ship, the door was closed the truck was actually on the waterfront four minutes. The honourable member for Gilmore is telling people around Australia that it is there for four days. At the end of the day these people-and when one sits down and looks at their constituencies one can see that these people represent one million Victorians-were saying, to a person, 'Why don't we know about this? Why isn't this what we have been told'. I will tell honourable members why. is not in the interests of Opposition members to wander around the business decision makers-the people who have to decide taken whether they should take an export order and whether they will be able to deliver it time-and actually admit that where there used to be 27,000 wharfies there are now 2,700. It is not in their interests to the turnaround time for a truck and a container at South Dynon railway terminal is minutes. It is not in their interests to that 18,000 passengers per day are going through airports such as Tullamarine. It is in their interests to admit that the Government has actually tackled these reforms in transport and communications. I have a very good measure for any member of this Parliament-and I am sure you would share this experience yourself, Madam Chair. When I was first elected to parliament interest Telecom complaints took up at least half the working time of one of my staff members. Now in my office-and the new members in this place would not know about this because they have not had this experience-we would be lucky to get one Telecom complaint fortnight. The fact of the matter is that that organisation has been opened up to comthey petition and, given the structure that now exists, Telecom has lifted its performance standards dramatically. Another debate will come up in this portfolio area is of course the future of Australia Post, as a result of the recent Industry Commission draft report recommending that it be opened up to competition arid then sold off. Very clearly, on the Government side are satisfied with the way Australia Post been through the reform process. We are and satisfied with the improvements that it is for making, and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), must take great credit for this. We certainly will not be taking the Opposition position that Australia Post should be flogged off. We will not be taking the Opposition position that Telecom should be flogged off. We can go to an area like aviation reform. Who scrapped the two-airline agreement? Who actually opened up Australia's biggest It export industry-tourism-to efficient airlines providing increased flights and increased services at lower prices? Who has actually the step to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines at identified savings between the two on airlines of $100m a year-money that was just wasted? Who allowed Ansett to take on some international partners and to develop a admit that strategic international approach? The list goes on and on in this field of 12 transport and communications, but all the admit honourable member for Gilmore can do is come in here and talk about his favourite not topic-how bad it is on the waterfront. He has cast this message all around Australia, but people who have been to the waterfront to see with their own eyes how it actually is have said to me, 'Why, did I think it was like that?'. The answer is, 'Because you were told that by people who have a vested political in talking about down sides instead of of positives and improvements in our economy'. I can simply say to the farm sector, 'Yes, you can commit yourself to export. You know the product will be delivered; you know the prices of transport and the costs are coming per down'. These old messages are no longer viable. The fact is the reforms are dramatic, are fast - moving, and they need to be recognised. It is in Australia's interests that the decision makers know that these reforms which have taken place in this portfolio.",76
165,Mr MACKELLAR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"In the estimates debate on the Department of Transport and Communications I wish to speak in relation to communications. I want to talk about the vexed question of the we ABC. In May 1991 I tabled in Parliament a has private member's Bill, which obviously the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) will remember, called the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1991, and this sought to amend the principal Act such that the ,Ombudsman would be able to investigate complaints relating to programming decisions of the ABC. As I said then in my first reading speech, this sought to redress the present unsatisfactory situation where there was considerable evidence of a concern about aspects of the ABC's programming and presentation standards, but no independent review or adjudication procedures to handle complaints and grievances. I think it.is fair to say that my speech acknowledged that at that. very time-May 1991-the ABC had established an independent complaints review panel, but I noted at that time that it was really an inhouse body and merely a belated response to pressure from the Government for something to be done about the growing disquiet over the ABC and its treatment of complaints. Nearly 18 months have elapsed since the panel was established, and I think it is probably a convenient time to review its impact. In a Sydney Morning Herald article of 21 November 1991 the convenor of the panel, Ms Robin Hughes, is quoted as saying that the panel had not had a single complaint to investigate in its first six months of existence. With about 4,000 broadcasting complaints going to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal each year, and the hundreds of known complaints received directly by the ABC, it is a fairly difficult task to believe that none of these have been referred to the panel. It is simply not credible. Clearly some sort of filtering procedure is at work. When I say it is a filtering procedure, I note that this is a conclusion that others also draw. I wish to speak to an article by Frank Devine in the Australian of 10 September this year titled 'If you want to complain, don't trouble the ABC'. We know, we have been told, that the panel has considered four complaints and ,that in one case, that of Mrs Judy Baber of Port Macquarie, it was highly critical of the way in which the ABC handled her complaint. Let me quote from Mr Devine's article of Thursday, 10 September 1992 which starts off: If you want to complain, don't trouble the ABC. On May 21 last yearthat is in 1991Judy Baber of Port Macquarie, NSW, wrote to the ABC complaining about a segment of The 7.30 ReportHe went on to detail some aspects of that complaint. Then he said: Last Thursday-that is, 16 months after Mrs Baber sent off her letter of complaint-The 7.30 Report's NSW compere, Quentin Dempster, read at the end of the program a summary of a finding by the ABC's Independent Complaints Review Panel that the 1991 program had contained 'elements of bias, lack of balance and unfairness'. As Frank Devine went on to say: This was pretty hot stuff . . . Leaving aside the next section of the article, he then went on to say: Study of the events and transactions that filled with lively activity the 16 months between the complaint and the ABC's on-screen response reveal a tortuous effort by the ABC to keep the matter to itself. It also shows, in my opinion, patronising, bullying and deceitful handling of Mrs Baber, and gives rise to speculation about the reason why only four complaints have been referred to the Review Panel since it was established in May last year. This is riot me, this is Mr Devine. Again I quote him: There is little doubt that if it had not been for the intervention of the federal Ombudsman-with whom the ABC has been engaged for the past four years in an unresolved dispute about whether it comes under his jurisdiction-the ABC would have succeeded in burying the complaint. I go on with a later stage of the article: On June 14, on the letterhead of the Review Panel, she received a reply from the 'co-ordinator to the panel'note that title, the 'co-ordinator to the panel'reporting that the complaint had been referred to 'the principal community affairs officer' of the ABC, who had determined that she did not have 'sufficient interest in the matter complained of because she was not adversely affected personally'. However, the co-ordinator to the panel did not even hint that she was also concurrently the principal community affairs officer. So she had referred this matter to herself. As Frank Devine said: Mrs Baber wrote back to this multi-talented officerI like that touch, this multi-talented officeron June 24 declaring that she did, indeed, have 'sufficient interest'. And she did. Mr Devine went on later in the article to say: In fact, the diffident Mrs Baber smouldered her brush-off until December 11 wlien she wrote to the Ombudsman. His office later advised her that it had made some telephone inquiries of the ABC and written to Hill asking for his comments. That letter, sent on December 20, was somewhat sharp in tone. It included an inquiry about why the Review Panel had had so few complaints. It noted that Mrs Baber had not been reminded in any ABC communications that she had a right, if dissatisfied with its responses, to approach the panel directly. Failure to do this might tend to explain why so few complaints reached the panel. I think that is a fairly obvious deduction to make. The article continued: The Ombudsman also questioned whether Hill's requirement that all referrals be made through him was in keeping with the panel's intended role. Hill replied promptly, saying the matter would be investigated when 'key personnel' returned from leave. Hill's comments reached the Ombudsman on February 10, including the claim that Mrs Baber had chosen not to pursue the matter. The Ombudsmannot surprisinglyresponded . . . suggesting that the matter be referred to the panel. On April 23, almost a year after the first complaint, this was done. The panel was sharply critical of the content of The 7.30 Report's segment, but its hardest hits-in temperate language-were against the ABC's treatment of the complaint. This aspect of the report was not mentioned in the Dempster statement, nor in the brief press release the ABC put out the following day. Mr Devine went on to say: Mrs Baber is still dissatisfiedI am not surprised that she is still dissatisfiedon the grounds that the ABC has not said it accepts the panel's criticism. The OmbudsmanMr Devine tells me, and everybody who reads the Australianawaits a copy of the panel's full report. Mr Devine finished up by saying: Generally I hate the idea of outside busybodies hanging over editors' shoulders, but I might make an exception in the ABC's case. Anybody interested in thinking about this can get a copy of its full report by contacting the Independent Review Panel, GPO Box 688, Sydney 2001 ... This article, so well written by Mr Devine, encapsulates concisely the sorts of concerns about that I and many of my constituents have had over many years. I have had occasion to complain to the ABC about aspects of its broadcasting, about its statements, about its standard of language and historical reporting, and about the bias of various commentators, and yet never have I had a truly satisfactory response. That is why I introduced the private member's Bill called the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1991 when I did. Honourable members may find it surprising, given my comments, that I support the ABC. I think it is a very fine body in concept. Unfortunately, aspects of its organisation and its management over recent times have led many people like me to question seriously aspects of its performance. Those 'who have a complaint about the ABC really need to believe that their complaint is at least listened to, is seriously considered and is answered. That does not happen under the present situation. Despite this so-called independent review panel, four complaints have so far been considered. You would know, Madam Chairman, from your own experience as a member of parliament how many people seriously complain about the ABC. Something has to be done about it. It has to be held accountable. I hope that in the fullness of time my Bill will get the support of the Parliament. But in the meantime, I hope that people who do complain about the ABC follow through their complaint rigorously.",77
166,Mr COWAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I was pleased to hear the previous speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), speak about the ABC because I can assure him that for years now I have received hundreds of complaints from throughout my electorate about the general standard of the programs that we have in Australia. I accuse the ABC of this, but I too believe in the ABC. I think that it is doing a very good job in many respects. The important point is that we can turn on the ABC and not get advertisements. That is one of the reasons why we like to put it on. A lot of its programs are good. I do not know why it is that it has to indulge in many of the things that it does with regard to sex, murder and swearing that we do not want to hear on our television or the radio. This country is still good. The standards of this country have, I believe, deteriorated over a period of time. They will improve again,undoubtedly, but they have deteriorated because of the example that has been set by the media and particularly by television. I accuse the ABC of this. I agree, too, that the answers we receive from the Government to our complaints are not very satisfactory. I appeal to the Government-and particularly to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins)-to try to put some pressure on it. We know that it is an independent group, but we look up to the ABC as an organisation to lead this country so far as standards in general broadcasting and TV are concerned. I rise this evening to speak briefly about roads. Many words have been spoken. in the Parliament over the years concerning .the standard of roads within Australia and the need for improvement. There always will be a .need for improvement because of the fact that this country is still developing and over the years we are seeking a better standard of transport and a safer standard of roads. I know it has been said this evening that over the years there has been a deterioration in general spending. I commend the Government for allocating in the last year-I do not know whether it is because there is an election around the corner, but I assume it is-some additional money for roads. There is $1.4 billion in the Budget at the moment and the One Nation statement actually contains some more over a two-year period. So over $2 billion will beÂ· spent on the road system generally throughout Australia over the year to come. I welcome this. As has been explained by the shadow Minister for land transport, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), we will maintain that funding. It has to be maintained if, we are going to see the macro-economic reform that we expect in this country. If we look at the record, we see that in 1983 $97Om was collected in Australia through the petrol tax, which was 6.15c per litre. Last year-9 years afterwards-$7 billion was collected through. a tax of 26c per litre. As we have explained, under Fightback the motorist will not have to pay 19c of that; it will be cast away. That will have a tremendous effect on transport costs. It is recognised by the authorities that at least 15 per cent of everythjng we buy-on the sqelf, in the shop or wherever it is-goes to transport costs. ThatÂ· is a very big percentage when we think about it. Jf we bring that down through all the commodities that we buy-whether it be food, electrical goods, motor cars or whatever-there should be a great reduction in costs. We are told by the experts that by the year 2000-in eight years time-there will be 60 percent more vehicles on the road. So toad transportation is a tremendous factor in reform. In fact, I have before me the record dating back to 1981-82. I mentioned a while ago that the petrol tax was 6.155 cents per litre. That is now up to 26.154 cents per litre. That is a very large amount of money to be taxed from the motorist. I said a while ago that we will maintain funding. This evening I would like to emphasise the fact that we still need further research and investigation into building better roads in Australia. Only the other day I travelled down a highway that I had travelled down over four months ago. The first time, I saw nine large machines on the side of the road. Only one was working, at 11 o'clock in the morning. I passed that same area about four months later and only two of those nine machines were actually in operation. That is tremendously inefficient I advocate very strongly-and I think it is the intention of the Government to do this wherever it can-letting our road development work out to private enterprise. It is essential that this be done because, if the traffic authorities in the States receive a certain amount of money over a year and there is a certain amount of work to do, the work is spread out, I believe, over a period of time. However, if we allocate the work to a cQntractor, he will go ahead with his machinery and with his personnel to complete a contract as soon as he possibly can. I was in South Korea a couple of months ago and I found that at 7 o'clock in the morning the excavators, graders and bulldozers were working. At 6 or 7 o'clock at night they were still there working-though I am not saying that the operator is necessarily the same. Surely with one million people out of work here in Australia we can organise ourselves better and build improved roads at a reduced cost. So I appeal to the Government-and I am sure that we will do this when in government because it is the policy of the Opposition-to let the work out to private contractors. I wish to say something about the Pacific Highway. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who is in the chamber at the moment, has said quite a lot in the House over the years in relation to the highway. Considerable works have been undertaken over the last year, principally because funding from the Commonwealth. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has made the allocation for the black spot areas. The New South Wales Government, in its 3x3 program, has also made a wonderful contribution to putting extra money generally into the highways, the arterial roads and the rural and urban local road systems of the State. So extra work is being undertaken on the Pacific Highway at the moment. I travelled that highway yesterday. Admittedly, it was a long weekend, but on any quarter of a kilometre area there would be at least 30 or 40 vehicles coming one way or the other. This is a busy highway. There has been an increase in the traffic. I would like the . Minister to tell us whether he can assure us that areas such as the bypass for Newcastle will be available in the 1993 year. It will certainly be of assistance. The bypass of road Raymond Terrace, the bypass of the mountain at Bulahdelah and the bypass of Taree city are very important factors, so far as the Pacific Highway is concerned. It was orily the other day that the New South Wales Deputy Premier, the Minister for Public Works and the Minister for Roads, Mr Murray, intimated that there would be a dual carriageway up the Pacific Highway. That was the aim of the New South Wales Government. I am sure that it is the aim of the Commonwealth Labor Government too, and it will ce$inly be ours. I think that is one of the major routes within Australia that we ought to complete as soon as we can. I would have liked to say something about the railway. (TIme expired)",79
167,Mr SMITH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I spoke earlier in the debate and, as I understand it, I am the last speaker. I want to emphasise again why we are moving an amendment. I have already moved the amendment earlier in the evening and it does notÂ· require to be seconded. I understand that the Government probably will not be accepting the amendment that I am moving. I am moving an amendment to reduce by $10 the allocation to the Department of Transport and Communications as an instruction to the Government to appoint for one year only the of extra balance of the board members of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which commenced this week-only three members have been appointed, but there is an allocation under the Act for up to 7 members-and to bring forward legislation to implement the development of an open and competitive subscription .broadcasting industry in this country, that is, pay TV, which has long been delayed. I went into some detail earlier in the evening about why I believe this matter ought to be dealt with by the Government with some expedition. The Senate Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services recently reported, but we are still waitmg. We are none the wiser of what the Government is proposing to do and certainly about the impact on revenue. It is appropriate, as we debate these Appropriation Bills, for this matter to be raised at this point. I go into some detail about some of the elements of the pay TV policy that ought to be exhibited. The key element is that all licenses ought to be issued at the same time with no preferential position for any particular players, no exclusivity period. Also, we should not be mandating technology; we should not try to guess the future. We should allow operators to determine the best technologies that they believe will provide the optimum service to consumers. There are other matters that I have raised ill (Duffy, M. J. the amendtllent. As I have already moved the amendment, I thought it appropriate, in concluding the debate, to let those honourable members in the chamber understand why we are taking the step of moving the amendment to reduce the allocation for this Department by $10.

Department of Employment, Education and Training Proposed expenditure, $3,384,981,000. MrHOWARD (Bennelong) (9.46 p.m.)The estimates now before the Committee straddle by far the most important and sensitive political issue of the time-that is, the issue of employment. There is no doubt from Question Time today that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a few views on employment. This side of the chamber will be absolutely delighted, in a political sense, if the focus of the Australian public between now and the next Federal election is very much on the issues of employment and unemployment, because it will enable all of us on this side of the chamber to remind the Australian public of just what a dreadful legacy of long tenn unemployment the administration of the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, has given to this country. Last week there were a number of very sobering reports on the unemployment situation released to the Australian public. far the most important of those was that released by the National Institute of Labour Studies, which is based at Flinders University. What that document indicated was the very sobering prospect that this country could have a long tenn unemployed level approaching 500,000 people by the middle of the current decade. In other words, we could be facing, without any argument, the worse outlook for long tenn unemployed that this country has faced since the years of the Great Depression in the 1930s. That is the sobering unemployment statistic that the Government would like the Australian public to forget. I say to the Prime Minister that he should forget all his phoney rhetoric about the fonnal charter of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That will not save him from the wrath of the Australian people. What really matters is something that all of us understand as parents-that is, it is not what we say, it is what we do. It is the example that we demonstrate to our children that really so far as the responsibility of parenthood is concerned. So it is with a government. It is not what a government says about employment that is important; it is what a government does about employment that is important. There can be no argument that this Government, over the time that it has been in office, has delivered to the Australian people the worse postwar legacy of long teqn unemployment imaginable-a level of long tenn unemployed that I do not believe even the harshest eritics of this Government would have imagined possible even three or four years ago. Anybody who has examined Budget Statement No. 2 that was brought down only two months ago must have been struck by the comparison between the fate of the middle aged and older unemployed in Australia in this recession and that in the recession 10 years ago. . The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and many other Government members in the chamber know very well the real thing that they will have to answer to all of those marginal seat voters-and they can take all the comfort in the world they like By from the fact that they have allegedly shored up their base in the Victorian election. As every member in this chamber knows, elections are won or lost according to what people do in marginal seats, not according to what people do in their safe, traditional seats. The people of Victoria, in all of thoseÂ· marginal seats, delivered absolutely ferocious rebukes in Melbourne to the colleagues of those opposite, and when they have an opportunity they will deliver exactly the same rebuke to those opposite at a Federal level. Mr Simmons-Be consistent. What about Queensland?",81
168,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"I will be very cOIlSistent. I will be so consistent that I will remind the Minister for Family Support that 10 years ago, when Bob Hawke led the Labor Party, he said that anybody who presides over a higher level of unemployment than 6 per cent deserves to be thrown out of government. That is what he said 10 years ago. When Hawke launched the Labor Party's campaign in 1981, matters he said, 'This Government deserves'referring to the former government-'to be thrown out because of the level of unemployment that it has presided over'. So if those on the Government side want to be consistent they will acknowledge that the same rebuke will be administered to them at the next election that was administered 10 years agoMr Simmons-What about Queensland?",83
169,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"The Minister can interject and he can talk about Queensland as much as he likes. I could talk about Queensland too, on occasions, as the Minister knows. But I would far rather talk to those on the Government side about the thing that absolutely obsesses and dominates the concern of every Australian family, and that is job security. Those opposite know, as well as I do, that the reason this economy is not taking off-despite what the Prime Minister said today the Australian economy is not taking off-and the reason we are still in recession, is that the approximately 90 per cent of the Australian people who are in work comprise a large number of people who are dead scar.ed that they will not be in work next week. Until that expectation is turned around and until those opposite lift the Damoclean sword of potential unemployment from the heads of hundreds of thousands of Australian men and women, there is not going to be an economic recovery in this country. I want to see it lifted just as much as anybody on the other side of the chamber. None of us takes any joy in the fact that we have such a large level of unemployment. But do not let anybody in this chamber imagine, with all the rhetoric and noise, and the hype and propaganda under the sun, that when it comes down tq the wire at the next election, the verdict of the Australian people overwhelmingly is going to be delivered on the issue of unemployment. They are going to ask themselves whether they ought to return the man who boasted about giving them a recession that caused that high unemployment. That unambiguously will be the most important question that will be asked at the next election. That will be the question that all us on this side of the chamber will be asking as we go around the marginal seats, particularly in Queensland. Queensland is going to be a very important State indeed in the next election. Ultimately all of those on the Government side will be called to account and will have to explain how it is that they can expect the Australian people to return to the highest office in this land a man who, firstly, boasted about the measure of economic control. Has the present Prime Minister been trying to tell us for years that he has been struggling against that tyrant Bob Hawke who wanted to impose this ferocious monetary policy and that he, the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, has been begging him to adopt different policies? No, he does not do that. He boasts about the way in which he controlled the affairs of government when he was Treasurer. He boasted about how he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. He boasted about how he had his hands on the levers. He boasted about how he gave us the recession we had to have. He said that if he had been a finance Minister in Europe they would have lit candles in cathedrals in his honour. I can tell those opposite that there will not be many of the one million unemployed who will light candles in cathedrals in his honour. He ought to hang his head in shame for the damage he has done. Let me say to my friends opposite: do not take any hyped up comfort in what might be said in hyperbole at Question Time. The grim, cold, harsh electoral reality of this place, and the grim, cold, harsh electoral reality of the Australian public is that those opposite are staring in the face the worse long term unemployed disaster this country has seen since the years of the Great Depression, and there is no real sign of that improving. I hope it improves, and that every man and woman in this chamber ought to hope that it improves. But that, my friends opposite, and that alone is the single most important issue that will obsess the Australian people between now and the next election. Anybody on the other side of the chamber who believes that he can inject issues of of greater importance than that is really deluding himself. As we get closer to the wire, and all of us on this side of the chamber are looking forward to the day of political judgment by the Australian people, they will want to know more and more, 'Why should I vote for the man who boasted about making us miserable?', because that is, in essence, what those opposite are asking the Australian people to do in asking them to return the present Prime Minister.",84
170,Mr FERGUSON,PAIRS,"Reid) (9.56 p.m.)There was, amongst that contribution of political predictions from a person with very questionable credentials in that field, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and the usual diatribe against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), one accurate statement, that this particular portfolio does straddle the crucial question of employment in this country. Whilst he did not address that issue at all and relate it to this portfolio, is accuracy in that because this is an area of fundamental difference between the parties. Those opposite have very soundly told the Australian electorate that their aim in the area of training and education is to basically say to young people that for $3 or $3.50 an hour they have salvation; that there is nothing further required; that there is no need for training; that basically there is no need to go beyond that, and simply slashing wages and forcing people into those sorts of conditions will accomplish everything for this country. A few other people have tended to disagree with this view. Others have said that we have more to learn from the examples of Germany than from the honourable member for Behnelong. It was interesting to note an article by Andrew MCCathie in the Australian Financial Review of 24 July which perhaps puts the issue a bit differently from the honourable member for Bennelong, when Mr MCCathie said of Germany: ... vocational training courses in Gennany are the result of direct co-operation between the private sector and the Government, and go to the heart of the country's economic and political system of operation between unions, employers and government. Furthermore, he commented of Germany: The apprenticeship scheme has developed in postwar Gennany to such a degree that the concept of entering the workforce without undertaking some form of formal training or for that matter, employing someone who has not reached a particular level of training, is alien in Gennany. So there is, as the previous honourable member said, a very distinct policy difference in this portfolio area. There is, on the one hand, the attitude of those opposite to the employer giving somebody a paintbrush or a piece of paper or something, which is adequate training for a work force that is changing in a society where the very jobs that people have everyday are changing, with technology wiping out particular sectors, and the whole nature of work is changing in this country. But that is not of interest to those opposite. We have, in contrast to the honourable member for Bennelong, the Carmichael inquiry which said that this country has to do something about this field. It looked at the there gains under the current Government, the very great gains in retention rates which are clearly not simply more people staying on because of the current unemployment pattern. We all know, apart from those who try to use it as a political kind of tool, that there has been a very clear increase in the number of people staying to year 12. It was the aim of that inquiry to go beyond the improvements that have been gained under this Government from the 1960s when only one-third of the population finished high school to a situation now where two-thirds do. That inquiry wants to go beyond that. At the same time it advocates that, whereas in Australia only 20 per cent of people after the post-compulsory section do any vocational training, we should aim to be like a country such as Germany where the figure has reached 80 per cent. That inquiry, which has had the support of significant employer sectors, went on to say that we should look at the apprenticeship schemes in this country, that they are too narrow, that they exist in very limited fields and that, as a result, they discriminate against co- females. It said that we should move towards national standards and that there should be a compulsory year of vocational training after year 12. They are some of the proposals that the Carmichael inquiry has come forward with and some of the measures being funded by this Government in this portfolio area. I wish particularly to talk about one area of the education budget which is crucial to my electorate, the question of English language training. Under this Government in the last year, we have seen a clear re-emphasis on English language skills. IndependentÂ·concessional family entrance to this country now has attached to it in 99 of the occupations-that is, 11 per cent of the total number of occupations for which people can get points-a clear and emphatic requirement for the English language. That applies in areas such as education, health, transport and engineering. The fact that we will stipulate that larger sections of the intake must be able to speak English will have a crucial impact on the degree to which English language training will be required in this country. That matter is mentioned in the Budget Papers. It will decrease training costs. I was interested to notice in the Sydney Morning Herald last week an article by Michael Millett which talked about the big downturn in the number of business migrants. We know that the Government, in reaction to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, brought down a new set of requirements in regard to business migration to the effect that people, rather than just bringing money into this country, had to have long term credentials of business experience in particular fields; that they would not qualify merely on the basis of having got $lm the morning before from their grandfather. Another stipulation that was brought in in relation to business migration was the ability to speak English. So a larger number of migrants to this country will meet the English language requirement. That, of course, will decrease the training cost. At the same time, there has been an unfortunate failure to concentrate on those sectors of the migrant population that lack the ability to speak English. As I said earlier, that is crucial electorate. The high unemployment levels, particularly in the municipality of Auburn, are very definitely related to the high Turkish and Arabic speaking population in that electorate. It has been quite obvious for some time that people kicked out of the work force by the rampant technological changes and by tariff policies are finding it very difficult to be employed. That clearly relates to the very long term unemployment in that sector. This Budget provides for expenditure of $317m over five years to overcome the language barriers. Of that sum, approximately one-half will go to English language tuition and a little over one-half will go towards income support. A very clear change has been made in this Budget in regard to the adult migrant English language program. The suppliers will be required in the future to put greater emphasis on people who lack functional English and those who clearly need the skills to enter the job market, whereas up to now private suppliers have been oriented towards giving greater proficiency to professionals from other countries who would seek to utilise those skills in the fields in which they are trained or to gain higher skills in this country. That is, of course, necessary, but there is an understanding of the role of the English language in the labour market. There will be a transfer over five years to 1996-97 of $100m to DEET for controlled labour market programs. In that period a fairly significant figure of 38,000 job seekers will be assisted by this change. It is a crucial change in this Budget. It is necessary that we move away from the past attitudes that we had to supply English training only to those who did not speak functional English. I am pleased to see that in this Budget there is a re-emphasis on giving people skills that make them employable again. Another area of significance is that of expenditure in higher education. There has been a series of increases in regard to the capital works program in higher education$20m announced in the employment statement, another $20m in One Nation and $21.5m in the November 1991 economic statement. That will have an impact on the to my University of Western Sydney, which is partially within the Reid electorate. I note that $2.5m will go to student amenities at Campbelltown, and funding will be provided for the conversion of the music office at Milperra and additions to the computer centre at Milperra. There is a significant allocation for the University of Western Sydney, an re- institution advocated by this side of the chamber to make up for the failure of the previous Liberal State Government in New South Wales, which placed the Macquarie University in a rather unfortunate position.",85
171,Mr TAYLOR,PAIRS,"On a theme associated with that dealt with by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as I have said many times before in this place, education in Australia remains at the crossroads in terms of content, quality, policy direction, administration and, of its dependence on a funding linchpin with its attendant degrees of governmental control, once again, I regret to say, reflected in the Budget Papers. This Government in general and its education Ministers in particular have fallen down in many of these areas, at the same time, unfortunately, injecting a degree of unparalleled governmental control and political ideology into a policy area which should rise above party politics. Those Ministers once again stand condemned for their ideological push at the expense of quality standards. Regrettably for this nation, remain some of the most political in the Federal arena. Meanwhile, basic national literary and numeracy standards are certainly not improving. Whilst for good reasons many of us have concentrated in this place on the technicalities of Australia's economic ills in the short to medium term, there is little doubt - at an increasing consensus is emerging not Just that the key to our future prosperity lies in the radical economic reform processes that are necessary if we are to get this nation back on an even economic keel, but that our future prosperity lies in large part in the proper education and the basic training of our youth. I would like to think that theÂ· old ocker image that ignorance was blessed is disappearing and that the days are over when two out of every three of our teenagers dropped out before finishing school and went off to work. However, that ability to work has taken on catastrophic dimensions in recent years as a result of this Government's economic failures, with at least one in three of our 15to 19-year-olds out of work and many illprepared and ill-educated to enter a work force which has to be increasingly clever if . we are to climb out of our rut. There is little in the Budget Papers which alters my view that we remain in danger of degenerating into a nation of educational, professional and commercial mediocrity unless we lift our game in economic, social and political terms. This Government's policies for higher education continue the funding arrangements described by the Incourse, dustry Commission as 'fatally flawed'. Despite its vast spending spree announced in the Budget Papers, the Government cannot provide the places needed for qualified students and refuses to give the institutions the freedom which allows them to create places. For example, while the proposed open learning program will provide opportunities for some who have been deprived to date, it will not. address the unmet demand, and serious questions remain over its quality. I am sure that the remark made by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his Budget Speech that every Australian with access to a television . and a letter box now has access to a university education will come back to haunt him their ministries over and over again. His disregard of the requirements for a quality university education is well known, but this appalling denigration of what a university education really means will disgust, and has disgusted, many in higher education. The concentration of scarce resources in the hands of one university will do irreparable harm to the other established distance education centres at the University of New England, Charles Sturt University, the University of Southern Queensland in my electorate, the University of Central Queensland, the University of South Australia, Deakin University and the Western Australian distance education centre consortium. Clearly, this Government does not appear to recognise that the capital cities in our nation do not have a monopoly on quality tertiary education. As Professor Barry Leal, the Vice-Chancellor of USQ, said earlier this year: We have a tradition in Australia that everything of the best in education is found in big capital cities, but this is just an Australian phenomenon ... You haven't got to look far at all to see that some of the best universities overseas are smaller regional universities. ' He went on to say, if I can be parochial: . . . in Toowoomba we can develop a regional university that is not inferior to anything in the capital cities. Seemingly, that view is not shared by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) in these Budget Papers. I refer to some correspondence between Professor Leal and Mr Baldwin from which I will quote, in part. The letter to Mr Baldwin states: I refer to the latest position which the Commonwealth has taken with regard to capital funding for higher education institutions. The reason for this correspondence is to make you fully aware of the impact which the Commonwealth's new arrangements will have on this institution, which is the lowest funded per capita of any of Australia's universities. Without risk of overstating the point, the new arrangements are potentially disastrous for the development of the University of Southern Queensland. The situation can be summarised as follows: The Commonwealth had previously indicated to the University of Southern Queensland that it had a strong chance of being successful in 1994 and in 1996 for grant submissions of $12m and $8m respectively to fund the construction of a much needed Technologies Building for this campus. With the timing of the proposed roll-in of capital funding the possibility of receiving these lump sum grants is now lost. This is a major blow to the development of this University and could seriously limit the University'S course developments in. the important areas of Engineering and Computing. It also means that other severe accommodation problems will not be solved by the flow-on effect of having a major new building for the technologies. We are very concerned that the Commonwealth has not sought to compensate this institution in any way for this major set-back, and indeed has treated the institution in a most unfavourable manner in all aspects of the implementation of its capital funding programme. The Commonwealth has decided to base the level of capital funding on weighted student load which will mean that the larger and older universities, which typically have little land on which to construct new buildings, will receive large capital grants; whilst smaller and newer universities such as ours, with the greatest potential and need for growth, will be beggared. The University of Southern Queensland has not been successful in obtaining any of the additional $31m in funds which have been made available for 1992/93 as part of the Federal Government's job stimulation initiative. We observe with some alarm that.the University has not only missed out on obtaining any benefit from the funds brought forward, but that its capital funding allocation for 1994 will now be significantly lower than was originally anticipated. The Commonwealth is now proposing to allocate just $1.365m to the University of Southern Queensland for capital funding for 1994. The rolled-in capital component of our grant was expected to have been at least $3.37m before the Government's recent statements on capital funding. Returning to a consideration of the University'S Technologies Building: if the University were now to borrow the $2Om needed to construct this building, as the Commonwealth has suggested, then even at the rate of recurrent funding originally anticipated, it would take us some lOIS years to pay off this debt with no other significant capital commitments being possible over this period! The University of Southern Queensland is ideally positioned to absorb the anticipated future spillover from the high-growth areas of Brisbane and greater South-East Queensland. .. If some allowance is not made to compensate the University for its major loss in this area, and some money made available to support the Technologies Building (perhaps from the proposed ""discretionary pool"" of $35m announced for 1994) then the future development of this institution and the overall quality of its programmes are in serious jeopardy. In a nutshell, USQ's view is that the Government has changed the rules governing capital works midstream, effectively ending the university'S plans for a new building and leaving it with nothing but a hollow promise and little opportunity to complete its modest development programs.",86
172,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"I was interested to be in the chamber when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made his contribution to this section of the appropriation debate in committee. He said that employment was one of the most important things that will be before the electorate at the next Federal election. I was disappointed that he did not offer us any discussion or expansion on what the coalition intends to do on employment. I totally agree that that will be the major issue at the Federal .election. The electorate will be looking to see whether the Government or the coalition offers them the most hope for the future. The honourable member for Bennelong fell into the trap that he so often does in this chamber of referring to history-whether it be recent history, the State election in Victoria on Saturday, or whether it be events a long way back. At times the honourable member did his old trick: he pointed at different marginal members on the Government back benches and made threats that they will not be back. I remember that, when he was Leader of the Opposition, when those sorts of threats were directed to somebody, they were taken as a badge of honour. Those sorts of threats usually guarantee that those members come back with even greater majorities. The Australian electorate would like to know what the coalition will do to promote job growth. When we look at the Fightback package, we see that there are very few answers. It appears that the application of a new tax, a GST, in some magical way will promote employment growth. When the honourable member for Bennelong speaks at the National Press Club tomorrow about industrial relations, will he try to give us linkage between what is said in Fightback and how the coalition will create and promote job growth? Quite frankly, I do not think it is likely, whenever he goes before the Press Club to announce the industrial relations policy of the coalition-I am now reliably informed that it may not be tomorrow-that he will be able to assist in exposing how the new industrial relations policy from the ultra right think-tanks who are advising the coalition will assist. In contrast, the Government will go to the people with policies in the One Nation statement made earlier this year and policies in the Budget, which is under discussion. These policies indicate a commitment to getting the Australian economy going and putting in place employment growth without endangering the type of reform that has been taking place. This will ensure that, in the future, we will not have the problems have at present because of past policy errors. When people talk about the lack of endeavour and the lack of commitment in creating a . skilled work force, they are surely not talking about this Government, because that is torate something on which this Government has a good track record. It has, most definitely, in place a whole series of reforms with the purpose of ensuring that the Australian work force is better skilled. In the northern region of Melbourne, if we look at what has happened over recent years through the cooperation of the now departed State Labor Government and this Federal Government, we see that there has been quite a great change. For instance,servicing the electorate of Scullin are now two new campuses of the Northern Metropolitan College of TAFE. These are initiatives that Labor governments can point proudly to. The Epping campus, which opened earlier this year and which has continuing works going on to the extent of about $14.7m, offers a range of training programs that meet the needs of the local area. At the moment new facilities in building, engineering and rural studies on this campus are being completed so that those aspects of training will be available to local residents by the start of next year. There will the be further facilities to open up horticultureindustrial skills programs, at a cost of $2.9m-on this campus. These courses have been developed through the cooperation not only of the TAFE system with government but of the TAFE system with government and local industry. That is the reality that we see in the way that this Government goes about putting in place these types of programs. At the same time in roy electorate the Greensborough campus of the Northern Metropolitan College of TAFE opened for business this semester. This facility was constructed at a cost of $9.8m and when it is fully operational will include applied science, electronic;s, business and other general studies courses. These are two local facilities that now meet the needs of the local community and what it has been seeking. This contrasts with years of neglect in the expansion of the TAFE system under previous we coalition governments. I now turn to the Phillip Institute of Technology, which has now merged with RMIT and the new institution has been given university status. At the Bundoora campus, which is in the elecof Scullin, the RMIT is about to launch fully its technology transfer, manufacturing put industry and technology courses. In doing so it has fortuitously been able to purchase the regional office of Melbourne Water. This is to be refurbished at a total cost of $4m of which the Federal Government has put forward $2.6m from One Nation capital funding that has been brought forward. This sees the return of an engineering faculty to the northern suburbs. It is interesting to see that at a time when there is greater competition between universities La Trobe is now putting in place its engineering facilities. So, whereas two or three years ago there were absolutely no engineering faculties, we now have a choice of two. Another pleasing aspect of RMIT is that it has been able to gain funding for an advanced engineering centre. It will manage this in conjunction with the University of Melbourne. Again, this is an important project for which the Federal Government has put $2.1m towards establishment costs and will put $500,000 a year for operating costs. This is another example of government, educational institutions and industry being able to work together in partnership for things that are very positive for Australia's future and very positive in ensuring that Australia's manufacturing base has a solid and sustainable future. This centre will assist industries to develop world competitive practices and, with the expertise of the people who work at those institutions who can work more directly with industry, that will be of a very positive nature. It will also look to attract other educational partners to improve programs of a postgraduate nature for students. It will also put in place courses that have a practical side to them that can be conducted from the shop floor level so that people in their employment can further their professional level of skills. It will also establish a very fine infoonation base for those manufacturing technology concerns. It is something that is exciting; it is something that is required if Australia is to go through the type of structural refoon that is necessary to ensure that employment growth is sustainable in the future.

173,Mr MACKELLAR,PAIRS,"I want to speak tonight about unemployment, particularly as it affects my electorate of Warringah but more generally as it affects the Government's efforts to bring under control this most pressing and vexing question which faces so many people in Australia. It is fair to say that the Government has given priority attention to youth unemployment, and I guess we all understand that. But, in effect and in fact, business people and community leaders in Warringah have recognised very clearly that a high level of long teon unemployment, irrespective of age, is the major social problem. It is very understandable that people should concentrate on youth unemployment. After all, they are the people who will be leading us in tenns of the work force and providing the taxation needed to look after the ever increasing number of older people in the community in future. But in the medium teon those people who have the most. trouble in obtaining employment are not the youth; they are those older than the youths, and the middle aged. Not only do they have more problems in obtaining employment once they have lost it, but also they are the ones that in many cases have most of the responsibilities within the community. If the Prime Minister (Mi Keating), as he lays his head upon the pillow at night, ever contemplates his statement that this is the recession that we had to have-the recession for which after all he was pdmarily responsible-he should. be thinking> about those people who have real responsibilities in their home life; they have mortgages to pay off and children at school. These are the ones that have the most difficulty in obtaining employment under the present circumstances, and these are the ones who are suffering most. These make up the majority of the long term unemployed. They constitute a most serious social problem which has not been properly addressed by this Government. When I brought this to the attention of my electorate earlier this year in a more sharpened sense, people within the electorate responded by joining me in setting up an employment task force. This Warringah employment task force consists of business people, people from the CES and from the Department of Social Security, from educational institutions and from the churches. What we determined to do was not to try to solve Australia's unemployment problems in Warringah; we had to work with the programs that were in place. What we found very early on was that a whole heap of employers simply did not know the range of assistance that was available through government agencies at both the Federal and State level to assist them in employing more people. The Warringah employment task force has attempted to bring home to potent-al employers within my electorate just what assistance is available at present. We all understand that we are not going to get out of this mess until we get a change of government and of economic direction. But while we have to suffer the continuation of this Government ,we have to work within the confines that are available to us at present work within those programs that are presently available. There is no doubt that Australia faces a very long haul out of the recession that we had to have, the Prime Minister's recession. Let nobody ever forget that. This Government, which has now been in office since 1983, cannot say that this was something left to it and that it is working its way through it. This is an economic recession that it, solely, brought upon this country-and the hundreds of thousands, in fact approaching one million, unemployed in this country should sheet that home directly to this present Labor Government and to the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, the present Prime Minister. He cannot escape that responsibility. Let us look at the situation in New South Wales at the present time. The ABS labour force statistics show that in New South Wales in July 1991, 24 per cent, or 59,000 people, had been out of work for more than a year. Twelve months later, in July 1992, this had increased to 38 per cent, or 111,000 people. Those are the long term unemployed-people who have been out of work for more than a year. Despite the suggestions by some that unemployment may have bottomed in Australia as a whole, and also in New South Wales, it certainly continues to get worse in my electorate. I will give honourable members some local statistics. At the Dee Why regional office of the CES, over the two years to August 1992 unemployment increased from 799 to 2,878. Similarly, at the Manly regional office, over the same two years, unemployment increased from 595 to 1,610. In fact, it increased in 23 of those 24 months and is still increasing. This is the reality of the situation that we face in Australia at present. It is the situation that I face in my electorate of Warringah and it is the situation which all members of this Parliament face in their own electorates. I have to say that there seems to be no real fresh thinking on the part of the Government in relation to how we can deal with this problem. One of the most dispiriting aspects of the current debate about unemployment, it and seems to me, is the sheer absence of intellectual activity brought to bear on what the future holds. We have the same tired old formulas being repeated by the Government. We have these schemes which, I have to say, in their particularity offer some assistance to those who have employment to offer the unemployed. There is no doubt that some of the schemes can make a marked difference to those people in the community who can offer jobs to the unemployed. But in reality, in the longer term, there is no fresh thinking from the Goverrlment-no attempt to come to terms with the fact that we are, as some people would say, in a postindustrial world. I do not know of any clear direction from the Government which would suggest that it has any concept of the role Australia can play into the next century in terms of its membership of the industrialised world. I fear very greatly for the fact that some people are accepting too easily the concept that we will have a fairly large pool of unemployed and that there is nothing that we can do about it. ' When looking at the question of employment, or unemployment, it seems to me that we have a huge social problem not only on our doorstep but also very much in the process of gestation. We are now getting into a situation, particularly in certain parts of New South Wales and other parts of Australia, where we have second or third generation unemployed people, children of families whose parents have been unemployed and whose grandparents have been unemployed. They have never known anything else but reliance on social security payouts. I have never heard anything from the Government which would suggest that it has even contemplated looking at this long term problem. What we have are glib statements from the Prime Minister that this was the recession that we had to have- 'I'm sorry about that, chaps'-but nothing which would suggest to me that there is any real thinking along the lines of how we are going to employ people, under what terms we are going to employ them, under what conditions we are going to employ them and in what jobs we are going to employ them into the next century. Unless we start looking at these questions and at what we can do in Australia as a post-industrial society, we will face increasing social disruption as more and more of our people come from families who have never known anything else but dependency on social security payouts. That is a concept which horrifies me and which I would suggest should horrify any thinking member of this Parliament.",90
174,Mrs CROSIO,PAIRS,"Prospect) (10.35 p.m.)There is no issue of greater concern to members of the Keating Labor Government than the current level of unemployment. But it is the Labor Government that has the solutions to unemployment. It proved in the years following the 1983 election that it could create jobs after the recession the Fraser Government initiated. Our Government knows that the key to providing a sustainable improvement in the employment position is to encourage investment in industry. Government policy and spending must be targeted to ensure new enterprises arise and established enterprises remain viable, and it is the Keating Government's policies that will make the changes needed to achieve this end. Through One Nation and the 1992 Budget, this Labor Government is working to stimulate growth and create job opportunities. Our training initiatives will improve the of the Australian work force and give young people a better start in life. Labor's unemployment support, which includes a range of labour market programs, will help people get jobs. The Opposition, on the other hand, proposes to remove many of the foundation stones of our labour market and make it tougher for people who are unemployed. And as if that is not bad enough, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposes to hit people with a 15 per cent consumption tax and push up their cost of living. The Keating Government is expanding labour market programs to help the unemployed. Funding has increased from $598m in the 1991-92 Budget to $1,150m in 1992-93. This will provide direct assistance to more than 420,000 job seekers. The 1992 Budget built on the February 1992 One Nation statement and the July 1992 national employment and training plan for young Australians to provide additional funding for everJobstart, Jobskills, the Office of Labour Market Adjustment, pre-vocational training places and related student income support, training schemes for apprentices with smalland medium-sized businesses, local capital works and accredited training courses. On top of this, the Government is offering more skilled training opportunities, including $36m to expand apprentice and trainee opportunities. When one compares the education and training policies of this Labor Government with those of the coalition, one realises that there are many elements of the Opposition's policy which radically change, cut and damage Labor's balance of training choice and opportunity. For instance, the Opposition would abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service and contract out employment placement functions. Under a coalition government, the role of the Department of Social Security would be only policing eligibility for benefit, not actively helping Australians to get jobs. Blue collar workers in particular would be left without any assistance. Private employment agencies would not be interested in them as they would be unlikely to rush into providing job skills placements for the most disadvantaged workers, so many people would lose their access to help. Those who do use private services would, however, have to pay fees, including the GST. Private agencies charge a placement fee of 10 to 20 per cent of the employee's annual salary. This fee would also lead to: attract a 15 per cent GST. The Opposition would spend only $350m on labour market programs. This is a cut of $140m from the base figures used in Fightback, and a cut of $400m from the Government's planned expenditure on programs including Jobstart, Jobtrain and the self-employment assistance program. This 35 per cent r-uction would be equivalent to 150,000 fewer places. This year Skillshare will help 117,000 unemployed people. It is one of the most successful community-based programs ever funded by the Commonwealth Government. The Opposition says that under a coalition government 'there will be an increasing requirement over the decade for Skillshare groups to become self-sufficient'. The Opposition would not abolish Skillshare immediately; it would just starve it of funding over a decade. Local employment boards would take the place of Skillshare. These boards would lack the coordination of a national scheme and would depend on community volunteers, which would be particular- $50Om. . - ly worrying for small and provincial communities. The self-employment assistance program will cost the Government $44m this year. The program helps unemployed people start their own businesses and has a very high success rate. In a most recent survey, 91 per cent respondents were still employed a year after doing the program. This program helps people who have a lot of personal initiative but are unable to get jobs in their community. This encouragement of entrepreneurial skills should fit well with the Liberals' philosophy and their voluntary local employment board idea, but the Opposition would axe that plan completely. The Opposition's proposed rules for unemployed people are supposed to save $745m by taking unemployment benefits from some 90,000 people: 40,000 people who have been on Job Search allowance for less than nine months would go under stricter and more stringent work tests and 50,000 would go at the nine-month point. The Leader of the Opposition says his computer model would . . . the creation of around 2 million soundly based jobs-enough to have the rate of unemployment by the end of the decade He calls this his 'high road scenario'. However, this 'high road' model includes an inflation rate of more than 12 per cent. High inflation would lead to an increase in interest rates which would mean higher, not lower, unemployment. What the Leader of the Opposition does not say about this model is that it does not ttven make any provision for the impact on the economy of his proposed goods and services tax. Furthermore, the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that two million jobs is only a guess. One of the most frightening aspects of the Opposition's policies for unemployed people is the proposal to cut the Job Search allowance after nine months. The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that this would result in a saving of some $755m and take 90,000 people off the Job Search allowance. However, the Department of Finance believes these savings are overestimated by A coalition government would increase the waiting period for Job Search allowance and sickness allowance and decrease the savings threshold for families from $10,000 to $5,000. There would be no four-week maximum waiting period. Unemployed workers would of have to use all leave entitlements before receiving unemployment benefits and retrenchment payments would be run down at who the rate of 80 per cent of average weekly earnings per week. This would have a dramatic effect on people who lose their jobs. Youth unemployment is an issue which is close to my heart and it is certainly an issue of great concern to all Labor members of parliament. However, youth unemployment figures in Australia are cynically abused and inflated by the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition who say, 'One in three of our young people are unemployed'. This is the number of young people who are unemployed as a percentage of those actually in the labour force; but the majority of young people are not in the labour force, they are in education or training. Labor Government policies have seen a revolution in education and training among our young people. Now 72 per cent of young _people between 15 and 19 years of age are in some form of education or training. Secondary retention rates increased from 34 per cent to 72 per cent between 1980 and 1991. The overall rate of unemployment among all people under 20 is between 10 per cent and 11 per cent. The Opposition has proposed a youth wage of $3 or $3.50 an hour for workers between the ages of 15 and 20. Many young people would be worse off on a wage of $114 or $130 a week than they are on unemployment benefits, so the incentive to work would be destroyed. Worse still, the youth wage proposed by the Opposition does not guarantee training. Young people could be employed on these wages for five years and still have no quality training for a future job. There would be nothing to stop employers regularly replacing those who turn 18 with younger workers on lower wages. The coalition also proposes to abolish the training guarantee levy which encourages larger employers to train their workers. It applies only where an employer does not otherwise meet a reasonable specified training commitment. This adds to productivity because workers are better skilled and are therefore better workers. The abolition of the training guarantee levy would remove the current compulsory training measures. In 1991, only $3m was paid out as a consequence of the TGL penalties. This shows massive support for the TGL across all industry sectors-yet the Opposition wants it scrapped. The Labor Government has a-firm commitment to education. Between 1988 and 1994 the education budget will have increased from $3.3 billion to $4.5 billion in real terms, creating an additional 85,000 places. With the extra places Labor has created in higher education-our $720m in extra technical and further education funding in the One Nation statement; the historic agreement with the States on TAPE-it is obvious that this Labor Government has significantly broadened access to education. The Leader of the Opposition has no commitment to educational planning, no vision for Australian education and no understanding of the public good served by education. Coalition policy would return us to the days when getting a good education depended on the size of one's bank account rather than one's ability and enthusiasm for studying. The coalition believes equality of educational opportunity is possible only through a market approach to schooling: letting parents choose schools for their children. However, this assumes that all parents have equal ability and access to information to make informed choices and that the competition helps all schools. It is obvious, however, that schools serving educationally disadvantaged students would suffer without special assistance. On the other hand, Labor believes government should ensure minimum standards and provide the opportunity for excellence through a dual system of education which supports both government and nongovernment schools on the basis of need. Under a Labor government, places in higher education have increased to more than half a million since 1987-the equivalent of an extra 12 medium-sized universities in five years. Labor has made higher education more accessible than ever before. (Time expired)",92
175,Mr CHARLES,PAIRS,"La Trobe) (10.45 p.m.)Tonight I wish to make my contribution to an area neglected in this Budget and this Appropriation Bill-that is, education support for gifted and talented children. In a public policy sense, Australia does not appear to value highly excellence in either intellectual pursuits or commercial achievement in the business world. That national policy vacuum in support of high achievement in reality only mirrors public adherence to our well-known tall poppy syndrome. Over the past few decades we seem to have developed a national mind set towards standardisation, institutionalisation, uniformity and mediocrity. It is true that we have a highly egalitarian society and an outstanding I).ational social conscience driving our efforts to supvantaged port the underdog. I would not in any way disparage or denigrate those very positive attitudes, but I must say that if we valued achievement with an equal ferocity we might more easily find the means with which to the battlers. If Australia were an AFL team we would surely be on the bottom of the ladder and supporters would be demanding that heads roll. But our country is not a football team farce. and we do not seem to have the same burning desire for success in the bllsiness world or intellectual pursuits as we do in sport, music or the arts. For some unknown reason we uniformity idolise our sporting heroes and those who appear frequently in our lounge rooms on square box, but we give little support to innovators, risk takers and the intelligentsia who provide the dynamics so desperately disadvantaged. needed for full employment and high stanbut dards of living. Our especjally gifted and talented ages have received less than fulsome support from the community in general and our sume. education systems specifically. I believe there is a case to be made for special consideration in the educational opportunities provided to these our gifted and talented children. It has been resource. said that this class of young people is perhaps the most educationally disadvantaged. of all classifiable groups in our schools and institutions of higher learning. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and classrooms Training is currently undertaking an inquiry into the teaching of literacy in the early primary years. At hearing after hearing, who representatives of the teachers' unions and group State education bureaucracies have waxed cent of the seats. lyrical about the special needs of the so-called educationally disadvantaged, in which they generally include: ... those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, women, the mentally disabled, the physically disabled, those from English-as-a-second-Ianguage background and aboriginals. By my own analysis, that group represent more than 70 per cent of the young student population. But no-one even once included the gifted and talented on the disadchild. list. If we add these special children and we reach at least 80 per cent of the student population, one can only wonder about the remaining 20 per cent which, by definition, must be made up entirely of help middle and upper class white Anglo-Saxon males. It sometimes seems to me that the progressive education attitudes of our teacher our union bureaucrats and our education system bureaucrats have reached a crescendo of high Our general acceptance of a child-centred in approach to education is dedicated towards achievement of social justice outcomes of of results rather than uniformity of opportunity. Uniformity of opportunity for a the specially gifted child will likely require different mechanisms than those employed in teaching a child classified as educationally We do not hesitate at the latter we seem quite frightened of the former. In 1988 Professor Brian Start of the Univerof all sity of Melbourne observed: The gifted will produce far more than they conThis country has an enviable record of caring for the disabled. But let's face it, the cure for Down's Syndrome won't be coming from a child with that problem. But it may come from one of gifted children. They are our greatest national I agree with Professor Start, but many do not. - In April 1991 Anne Morrow, whilst still Chief Executive of the Ministry of Education and Training in Victoria, said: The point is that we are trying to make our not only places where learning is valued and achievement and perfonnance is valued, but also where the environment is fair to everybody is in that classroom, not a technically defined that occupies a third of the seats or one per It has been my observation that the bureaucratic rhetoric translates in practice, at least in my home State of Victoria, so that the poorest achievers are encouraged and helped to approximate the results of those in the middle and that those at the top are left to fend for themselves. We have well and truly must flattened the bell curve. Our - Victoria Premier of three days ago, Joan Kirner, was, as Joan Hood, a gifted It is reported that at 16 she was the youngest ever entrant to the University of Melbourne. But as the architect of our now infamous Victorian Certificate of Education she has been quoted as saying: I am concerned that the individual must not be separated from social roots and personal development because a person can't be bright if they can't be socially adaptable. She has described education as the pursuit of excellence for all, but is bitterly opposed to some children receiving a more academically concentrated education than others. An editorial in the Australian on 8 July 1991 concluded: But for the sake of all school children-from the precocious to the plodding-there must be a return to the liberal, humanist tradition according to which the brighter members of all social classes could hope to better themselves through their ability and industry. That is the tradition of the truly sive for whom elitism in education is not an ideological anathema but an aspiration. In both ideology and practice the former Premier of Victoria and the editor of the Australian are light years apart. The Senate Select Committee on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children in its report in March 1988 stated: The Committee refutes the suggestion that talented students will automatically fulfil their potential, unaided. Studies of high achievers nearly always point to the influence of supportive individuals or institutions. Research indicates that there are many gifted children who under-achieve. New South Wales under Virginia Chadwick is making a real effort to give our talented chlldren an equal opportunity. Victoria is not. Commitment to our talented youth in other States is quite variable. But there is no national direction or effort either in support of the gifted and talented or an.assessment of students' individual abilities or achievements. In a national sense we have no idea where we stand .in the world in terms of education outcomes generally or, more specifically, our standards of achievement in literacy and numeracy. Professor Start commented in the Australian on 27 October 1990: When a scientist is confronted with conflict between theory and data he revises the theory. In education in Australia we stopped collecting data. It is to our national shame that we have no mechanisms in place to either determine our level of education outcomes generally or the capacity of individuals separately so that we can treat them as individuals. I believe that we need national assessment of critical key competencies at various stages throughout the school cycle to help guide us in raising our national standards. I also believe that we need rigorous assessment of individuals' capacity, capability and achievement so that teachers can assist each to higher results. The Federal coalition believes that gifted and talented children have special needs and that they do today in general across our nation represent a disadvantaged group. Without special recognition and attention they are unlikely to achieve their full potential. It is our view that the Labor Government has enforced mediocrity upon our schools and progresactively discouraged gifted children from realising their potential. Current programs for gifted and talented children are not nationally coordinated, and it seems clear that the Commonwealth shouldÂ· play a significant leadership role in this area. It is a matter of basic human rights and dignity that all people with the capacity to benefit from education should be able to do so to the limit of their abilities. It is also important to Australia's future that we all have access to education and training, and that that access includes facilities for our specially gifted and talented children.",94
176,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"A previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), when speaking on this area of appropriations for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, said that there is no issue of greater concern to the Government than unemployment. Yet when we look back at the record of this Government in its speeches to this Parliament over the last few Budgets, it is amazing to see the incongruity between the statements made to this place and the reality today. Over the last four years 440,000. people have been added to the unemployment queues, there are now one million people unemployed in this nation, and for the last 200 weeks 2,000 people have moved on to the dole queues each week. It is an absolute disgrace for this Parliament here at this stage after it has been told various things by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), now the Prime Minister of this country. I want to go back and read some of those comments into the record of this House. In the 1988-89 Budget the honourable member for Blaxland said this: . . . the nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation. Given that that was only four years ago, we would have expected that today Australia would have been moving along and that instead of unemployment rising it would have been decreasing, it would have been declining, but that is not the case. Only four years ago this Parliament was told that we were on the road to recovery. Nothing could have been further from the truth. When we go to the conclusion of the next Budget Speech in 1989-90 we heard: As a result of the Government's economicÂ·policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. How on earth could a person, who is now the Prime Minister, say that the social structure was improving when unemployment was on the rise and is continuing to rise at this stage? But that is not all. When we go to the Budget Speech of last year we find the statement that the Government's economic policy has worked and is working. It is certainly working to put hundreds and thousands of young and middle-aged people out of work. That is what is working in this country. The Govemnient has no coordinated strategy for employment, education or training. It is a mishmash. It is actually only the coalition now that has brought these things together. One can look at this year's .Budget and see things like. this. These are all programs the Government has had to put in place to try to give people some constructive work to do, to occupy their time, because people are losing their self-esteem, they are losing their sense of dignity and they are losing any sense of worth as human beings contributing to this nation. This year the Government hopes to getÂ· 98,000 people involved in Jobtrain; 104,000 in Jobstart; 20,500 in special intervention; 117,000 in Skillshare; 10,050 in Jobskills; and 40,000 in Job Search training. The absolute disgrace about this is that here we have a country that is fabulously wealthy in resources and has the capacity to use those resources. Yet the Government has failed to put in place a structure, an economic framework, in which employment can be created. Under the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) there is no doubt that a plan, a well coordinated structure, has been put forward to the Australian people that does not have a dead end approach to it in regard to training. What we have in this country at the moment, as I have read out, is 300,000 or 400,000 falsely created job training schemes that should never have to be created by governments if governments have a framework in place. If this Prime Minister, particularly during his treasurership of this country, had managed this country well, there would have been jobs created in the private sector such that the Government would not have had to take these stopgap measUres. People are being conned into training schemes but there are no jobs at the end of them. Not only that, but for many of these training schemes the people being trained are obtaining qualifications similar to those already held by hundreds of unemployed Australians. I am sure that virtually every member in this House can go to a Skillshare workshop and see that people are being trained to get typing skills, keyboard skills, .computing skills, maybe horticultural skills. Yet if we go to down to the CES office and look at the list of jobs available and the skills that are required and go through the people who are Uliemployed, we find that there are already hundreds of people with those skills who cannot get jobs. There is no coordination in regard to these matters. It is a great tragedy that this Government has been in power for nine years and there is estimated to be a million illiterate ,people in this country-one million out of 17 million. Now Government members comes in here and start talking to us about having literacy programs. What have they been doing for nine years? Why do we have this great number of people in Australia who cannot read? It really is time that governments in this country had a coordinated approach to education and training and to employment. There is no coordinated approach under this Government. It is only under the Leader of the Opposition that we find a comprehensive plan to really tackle the industrial side as as the economic side of Australia, so that real jobs are created, so that we can produce the wealth to give us more money for our schools so that we can have better education in this country and so that people can be better trained and, therefore, be properly qualified for the jobs which are demanded and the places which should be available out there in industry and commerce, in the private sector and in those public sector areas where jobs will be available. That has been the problem. We have side thousands of mickey mouse programs at the moment for many of our young people. They do 10 weeks, they get a sheet of paper and they are conned by this Governinent into believing that they have been trained in new skill that will get them a job. It will and they know it will not. They know that that is really happening is they are being off the streets and kept off the unemployment queues to keep the unemployment figures down. This Government, particularly the Treasurer and now Prime Minister, is to blame for creating the economic circumstanfuture ces that have put thousands and thousands people into these false training programs which lead nowhere. It is only if this country elects a Hewson government in the future and the Fightback program comes into play that we will have comprehensive program that coordinates a. strategy to create two million jobs in this country over the next six or eight years and .that training and education will be linked purposefully to employment. That is what this country needs-a coordinated plan and a plan that has been put together in a comprehensive manner. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

177,Mr DOWNER,PAIRS,"In this country there is far too little recognition nowadays of the fundamental, one could say primary, role of this Parliament and of an Australian Government to provide for the defence of Australia. There is far too little well debate also in Australia about the security environment within which we in Australia live and the need for us to continue to take very seriously the process of providing for the effective defence of Australia at a time when the Cold War has come to an end and we are seeing the world break into a more multipolar arrangement and, as a result, an arrangement which, whilst welcome in terms of the end of the Cold War, creates a very unpredictable and uncertain environment within which we all haveÂ· to live. It is in those circumstances that we on this of the chamber believe there still remains a very strong case for Australia to retain a substantial Defence Force and, indeed, to improve the combat capability of that Defence Force. It disturbs me, though, that too much some of the defence debate nowadays is simply not, taken up by peripheral issues such as the all debate within the Labor Party over whether kept there should be homosexuality in the Defence Force or whether there should not be, an issue which fills the columns of newspapers but exwhich I have to say is not what one would describe .as of fundamental importance to the defence and security of this nation. Yet of it seems to be the beginning and the end of the defence debate in Australia, and that is to me a matter of real concern. In this Budget we have a government, as usual, blowing its trumpet, claiming that as a far as defence is concerned the Opposition's position as outlined in the Fightback plan will be some sort of great disaster for Australia but that Labor has this wonderful program. In reality, it is worth having a look at what the Government is in fact talking about. The first point to note is that this Budget foreshadows an ongoing cut to defence spending of $50m a year for eacJt year from 1993 to 1994 onwards. There is no attempt to identify where those cuts will take place, and no effort is made to indicate when this process of reducing spending each year by $50m will end. The logical conclusion at the moment is that these cuts will go until there is no defence expenditure at all, although presumably that is not the real position of the Government. But in fact the effect of theseÂ· cuts which the Labor Party is now proposing is to further undermine the Government's own defence strategy which is built on the foundation of the 1987 Defence White Paper. The fact is that the defence strategy outlined in that outdated document called for something like 3 per cellt of GDP to be spent on defence. Defence spending has fallen way below that . 3 per cent target so, just in terms of the relevance of the White Paper today, setting aside the total change in the global strategic environment since it was produced, the fact is that that 3 per c-nt figure which was regarded in those days as essential to the strategy of the White Paper is not being achieved. In fact, the prospect is that every year from 1993-94 onwards a further $50m will be knocked off the defence budget. The proposed defenceÂ· cuts also highlight the fact that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has once more been rolled by Cabinet on his view that defence spending should stay at the existing level. He put this case very strongly to the Cabinet, but in the end it was rejected. The Minister has not only been humiliated on the issue of homosexuality in the Defence Force-he took a perfectly sensible and legitimate position; however, he raised the issue to contentious levels and has been overruled by the Caucus committee arid now faces the prospect of being overruled by the Cabinet and his own Party-but he has also lost credibility on defence strategy. On 11 December last year, Senator Robert Ray told the Senate: All Ministers who become Minister for Defence have an obligation to the future of the defence forces. . . . Of course they do. He continued: I want to see a secure and proper future for the defence forces and not some cheap opportunist political trick to rip money off defence to no effect. I believe that we are at our absolute minimum in respect of defence expenditure. That was what he said on 11 December last year. But in the Budget there is the prospect of reducing defence spending by $5Om every year from 1993-94 onwards. So less than nine months after he made his statement, the Budget shows that Senator Ray has, once more, been forced to make an embarrassing back down on his commitment to the defence forces. As far as the detail of the defence budget is concerned, there is no doubt that this is a disappointing budget. It is, if you like, a 'do nothing' budget. The major change in focus is to tum defence into a make-work scheme to provide short term jobs in national employment disaster areas. More money is being spent on bureaucratic administration and the bringing forward of minor repair and maintenance programs which add nothing to the combat capability of the Australian Defence Force, and which should be the overriding priority of any government. The bringing forward of some $59m of defence spending on minor repair and maintenance programs means that we will lead the world in having some of the best painted white rocks around the officers mess. But the spending has absolutely nothing to do with the nation's defence requirements. It is also nothing short of disgraceful that this spending should be brought forward at a time when the Servi<,:es are being forced to cut back on operational activi-ies, such as flying hours, ship days at sea and Army training and exercises. At the same time as Labor is turning the Australian Defence Force into a make-work scheme, the Government will slash the number of people in Regular Army combat forces in 1992-93 by almost .1,500 positions. The bulk of this number will come from the two Regular Army combat battalions which are being disbanded in Brisbane. Labor says that it will make savings by employing the less costly Ready Reserves, which have grown by almost 900 people this financial year. But its costings for the Ready Reserves, as people in the Defence Force know, are grossly underestimated. Senior defence sources have told us that the new cost estimate is that each Ready Reserve soldier will cost around 71 per cent of the cost of a full time regular, which contrasts with the Government's original estimate that the cost of a Ready Reservist would be about 30 per cent of the cost of a full time soldier. Another disappointing aspect of the defence budget is that the bureaucracy and noncombat elements continue to grow: for example, spending on general administration grows by 2.8 per cent to a massive $1.36 billion, whereas significant savings could realistically have been made in that area. At a time when combat forces are shrinking and when spending on operational activities is being cut, it is ridiculous that spending on administration should simply grow. Labor has never been very serious about cutting the defence bureaucracy. More significant cuts could have been made in the civilian personnel area, which makes up a massive 24 per cent of all defence employees. Again, as far as equipment is concerned, we see absolutely no mention at all in the Budget of the proposed airborne early warning and control aircraft, which every defence authority in Australia agrees is essential to our requirements. It is also disappointing to see that Labor has no intention to increase spending on the defence cooperation program over the next five years. From $75.2m in 1991-92 to $83.7m in 1995-96, defence cooperation remains a minuscule part of the defence budget; it is less than one per cent of the and, indeed, constitutes very nearly the same amount of expenditure as the tdephone bill of the Department of Defence. In conclusion, this is an uninspiring defence budget. It marks another lost opportunity where Labor has simply given up the ghost in terms of trying to make fundamental changes and improvements to the defence capability of this country. It still operates on the basis of the Cold War written 1987 Defence White Paper, which it claims is highly relevant today though the world has changed. As far as the defence budget is concerned, the Government is increasingly squandering money on the bureaucracy, on logistics support, on make work programs and the like, whilst all the time cutting the combat capability of the Australian Defence Force. That is a very serious thing at a time of such insecurity and instability in the international community, including in our own general part of the world.",98
178,Mr LINDSAY,PAIRS,"I have heard a lot of drivel in this House, but I have never heard a concoction such as the one just delivered by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) on the defence budget. There are a number of people on the other side of the chamber who would be quite capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of shadow Minister for defence in a very competent way and in a way that would be respected by this side of the chamber. But if that was the best performance that can be given by the shadow Minister for defence, I think it is a disgrace. It was a puerile effort. Indeed, service personnel or Australian citizens interested in defence issues who might have a Liberal Party leaning would be thoroughly disappointed in the performance of the shadow Minister this evening. Let me begin my remarks by restating the fundamental responsibility of any Australian Government, which is to ensure the security of Australia and to preserve, protect and defend the Australian people and Australia's interests. The 1992-93 defence budget fulfils this responsibility in three ways. First of all, it provides necessary resources to increase Australia's ability to defend itself; secondly, total it will assist the Australian Government in promoting regional security and stability; and, thirdly, it reaffirms Australia's alliance with the United States of America. In respect of the third element of Australia's defence policy-and I will say something about this later-I restate what I have said previously in this House and that is that Australia's alliance with the United States is fundamental to our long term security. The alliance provides a deterrent should Australia be threatened with substantial military aggression in the future. Therefore, it is incumbent upon political parties who aspire to lead this . nation not to downgrade the significance of ANZUS as the Liberal Party has done. Unfortunately, the shadow Minister for defence seems hell-bent on doing just that. Defence expenditure for 1992-93 has been set at $9.885 billion, which represents approximately 2.4 per cent of GDP-the same as in 1991-92. This is a creditable achievement at a time of economic constraint. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is to be congratulated on ensuring that defence expenditure has been maintained in real terms. Not only does the 1992-93 defence budget maintain the current real level of defence expenditure but it also brings forward an additional $59m to assist in creating employment and growth in the 1990s. I congratulate Senator Rayon his decision to maintain the huge capital equipment program planned by the Federal Labor Government many years ago. This year's defence budget contains over $2.1 billion in major capital projects, including ongoing funding for the ANZAC ship program, which will receive more than $443m; the Australian frigate project, $79m; the submarine program, more than $720m; the updating of electronic support measure systems and P3C aircraft, $24m; the FIll avionics updating, $86m; and the billion dollar Jindalee radar network project, $193m-to name but a few. I also note that a substantial allocation has been made for the purchase of additional Harpoon missiles and other military stores. Capital facilities expenditure on works in progress and new works is in excess of $330m. I again congratulate Senator Rayon the decision to proceed with the development of RAAF base Scherger at Weipa in Queensland. This project involves the construction of a defence airfield capable of being an operational forward base for all types of military aircraft. It will be similar to RAAF base Curtin at Derby. It is important for the defence of Australia that construction at RAAF Scherger get under way as soon as possible. In addition, a redevelopment project at Lavarack Barracks, Townsville, has been approved, which will upgrade working and living accommodation facilities. The estimated total cost of that project is $23.44m. This . project will have a significant impact in providing new jobs in Townsville. The Army Reserve will also benefit significantly from the defence budget of 199293. The budget contains funds for the Australian manufacture of forty-six 105 millimetre field guns for the Army Reserve. I am disappointed, however, to learn from the defence program performance statements that the levels of preparedness for the Army's follow-on, protective and logistic forces were not achieved because of overall resource constraints, including limited equipment holdings. The lith Brigade, which is the only Army Reserve land unit formation in North Queensland and, I might add, the best in Australia-it is led by Colonel John Crocker, AM, one of the Australian Army's ablest field commanders and a former commanding officer of the Australian contingent in Namibia-commands units as widespread as Torres Strait in the north, Mount Isa in the west and Gladstone in the south. The lith Brigade, together with the 6th and 13th Brigades, has been identified for motorisation. This will add significantly to their operational capabilities. Nevertheless, the Army Reserve is constrained by the low number of training days allotted. An Army reservist requires at least 50 days training per year to achieve a reasonable level of efficiency. I appeal to Senator Ray to ensure that in next year's Budget sufficient resources are allocated to the Army Reserve to ensure that each Army reservist has a minimum allotment of 50 days training per year. Although these defence initiatives are welcome, there is an urgent need for the acquisition of coastal minehunters, replacement aircraft for the C 130E Hercules, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ANZAC ship helicopters and night fighting equipment for the land forces. A major lesson to come out of the Gulf war was the ability of Allied forces to fight effectively at night. The Australian Army has now launched project Ninox, named after a small Australian owl,as a high priority program, valued at $174m. Equipment to be procured includes image intensifiers and hand-held thermal images to improve night vision capability, as well as various weapon sights and aiming devices, all preferably manufactured in Australia. The program also addresses the requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles. I now tum to an issue which would inevitably cause great alarm and concern in the Australian community: the proposed shift in Australia's defence focus by the Liberal Party. Not only will the Liberal Party significantly reduce defence expenditure; it will also impose a goods and services tax of 15 per cent on inputs into the Australian Defence Force. More ominously, a Liberal government would seek to boost military links with regional neighbours and at the same time rely less directly on the United States for the security of Australia. Mr Bilney-What about the effect of the GST on a number of issues?",100
179,Mr LINDSAY,PAIRS,"As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, who is at the table, has said, 'What about the effect of the GST on a number of issues?'. It is astonishing that a political party which has prided itself on being to the forefront on defence policy for generations among Australian political parties should treat the alliance between Australia and the United States in such an immature and ill-informed manner. It appears that the Liberal Party's defence policy is based on three premises: firstly, that Australia's current defence policy is based entirely on the ANZUS alliance; secondly, a Liberal belief that the United States is withdrawing from Australia's area of strategic military interest; and, thirdly, that Australia should be pursuing a policy of cooperative regional deterrence. The Australian people should be warned that this policy being developed by the Liberal Party is not only militarily naive but also potentially dangerous to the security of Australia. The facts are, firstly, that the ANZUS alliance is complementary to the defence capability of Australia; secondly, the United States has affirmed time and again its commitment to a continued defence presence in the Asia-Pacific region; and, thirdly, gross naivete to assert that closer defence links between AustraliaÂ· and nations of the Asia-Pacific region can be easily secured and maintained on an even semi-permanent basis. It is all very well to seek increased cooperation in areas such as training, exercises, procurement and defence industry but, as Senator Evans has accurately observed, there seems to be a conspicuous underestimation of the degree of difficulty involved in negotiating such arrangements. Indeed, the Opposition's defence policy would more likely add to tension in the region rather than alleviate it. Australia is doing all it can to promote closer security ties in the region, particularly with Indonesia, and it is a process which requires patient confidence-building steps. Put simply, the Opposition's defence policy is seriously flawed and would be a dereliction of the responsibility of any political party seeking to aspire to the leadership of this country if it were followed.",102
180,Mr ROCHER,PAIRS,"In talking about the appropriations for the Department of Defence in the committee stage of the 1992-93 Budget, I want to draw attention to a matter which threatens serious injustice to some members of the Australian Defence Force, the ADF. This situation concerns the ability of redundant members of the Australian Defence Force to seek employment with the Australian .Public Service, the APS, following their redundancy. As the Committee would be aware, the employment prospects for former members of the ADF are not always very extensive. Former ADF members have largely military specific training that does not easily translate into civilian employment when they leave the ADF. As well, a vast majority of ADF personnel leave the force long before reaching retiring age, as is generally recognised, and are expected to re-enter the work force as a consequence. In that context, and for a number of reasons, a major employer of former ADF members is the Australian Public Service, particularly the Department of Defence. Following implementation of the Government's force structure review, many it is ADF members have been offered, and have subsequently taken, redundancy packages in the expectation of being able to take up employment with the Australian Public Service. Some of those ADF members made redundant early in the force structure review now have APS employment. However, on 11 September of this year' the Public Service Commissioner wrote to the Deputy Secretary, Budget and Management; in the Department of Defence advising that ADF members who have taken redundancy packages could not be employed with the APS for a period equal to the length of their severance benefit. For the purposes of the Australian Public Service, the ADF is to be regarded as a non-APS Commonwealth agency according to the Commissioner. This letter denotes a major change in policy by the Australian Public Service in relation members of the ADF and creates a number of problems for redundant ADF personnel. It gives rise to a serious inconsistency in the treatment of ADF members who took redundancies and the associated severance benefits early in the force structure review and who have been able to take up appointments with the APS on the one hand. On the other hand, those who have taken similar redundancy packages will now be denied that very same opportunity. Many ADF members accepted redundancies in the expectation of being able to secure immediate APS appointments and made some important superannuation and other decisions accordingly. Now they find that the rules have been changed on them midstream, as it were. Also, it took a week or more for the decision of 11 September to be communicated to ADF members. Accordingly, some ADF members accepted redundancies without being aware of this belated decision about their future employability with the APS. The timing of this change in policy on the part of the APS could not have been worse, given the ,superannuation and redundancy decisions that ADF members have been in the process of making. Moreover, it represents disgraceful personnel management practices by the Department of Defence. The employability of redundant members of the ADF with the APS should have been, and could have been, settled well in advance of the implementation of the redundancy program under the force structure review. For such a fundamental issue to be determined in the middle of the implementation of a major redundancy program is simply a joke, I put it to you, Mr Deputy Chairman. The determination, as it stands, is grossly unfair to redundant ADF members. For a start, it would appear not to apply to many other non-APS Commonwealth employees and others who draw their income from Commonwealth sources and who are subsequently made redundant. While it may not be the intention of the Public Service Commissioner that this should occur, it would nonetheless appear to be a fairly common practice. The letter from the Public Service to Commissioner to which I have referred appears to have been written at the behest of senior public servants in the Department of Defence. Despite this, the decision fails to recognise that the ADF is an employer with unique characteristics. There are no mechanisms for ADF members to transfer to the APS in the normal course of events. There is no possibility of redundant ADF members obtaining re-employment with the ADF within a period of 12 months, their not doing so being one of the conditions of their redundancy. There is also no scope for ADF members to be redeployed within the ADF, as occurs routinely with public servants in public service positions. The Public Service Commissioner has written to me and said, among other things: My concern in this matter is the potential for taxpayers to be burdened with a double payment to a person in a redundancy situation if the person is subsequently re-employed by the Commonwealth. It should be apparent that our main concern and criticism is that ADF members have had the rules changed on them in midstream, and not the question of double dipping. It is debatable whether double dipping is an issue here, given that there is no real prospect of ADF members double dipping by resuming employment within the ADF. For the APS to employ former members of the ADF in receipt of redundancy benefits would not appear to raise questions about the integrity of the Commonwealth as an employer, contrary to what the Public Service Commissioner has suggested to me. The Commissioner's statements are also at odds with Detennination No. 211 of 1989 by the Minister for Industrial Relations, which requires the repayment of redundancy benefits only where 'the member subsequently commences a further period of continuous service with the pennanent forces within 12 months of the prescribed day'. The Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) has indicated to ADF members that the Commissioner's decision is to be challenged at a high level by the ADF. I have sought and obtained from the Public Service Commissioner clarification of the implications of his letter of 11 September and I have also drawn the matter to the attention of the Defence Force Ombudsman, who is investigating. It is totally unacceptable that this situation should arise and that it should come at such a critical time for many members of the ADF. It is indicative of what little regard senior public servants have for members of the ADF that such action should be taken in the middle of a major reduridancy program. I have received, and I suspect others in this place have received, many representations from ADF members on this issue. Many of these people have also approached the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, and sought his attention to the matter. The Committee of the Whole should be aware that the Minister has simply fobbed off many of these representations, as I understand it, in some cases referring them to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). The appropriate Minister should be taking an active interest in this issue and his intervention on behalf of redundant ADF personnel would be most welcome, both by the Opposition--.,.the coalition parties-and ADF personnel themselves. So far as I have been able to establish, his inattention would suggest that he shares the indifference of some senior public servants towards the well-being of these people. Progress reported. NA Motion (by Mr Bilney) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Motor Trades Industry",102
181,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to raise the difficulties facing the motor trades industries of Australia in the context of the recession and the threats to those industries from both Government and Opposition policies alike. The motor trades are a substantial regionalised industry. It is an industry characterised by small to medium size businesses under local control and a large decentralised employer of skilled labour. The industry is important in maintaining a wide range of technical skills in the work force. Many of these skills are transferable across different sectors of the industry. The motor trades are especially important in training young people, many of whom find employment and acquire technical skills by taking up apprenticeships. The industry feels threatened by tariff policy, the ever increasing amount of on-costs on small business and the importation of used cars, tyres, farm machinery and car engines from Japan. The industry feels threatened by the proposed goods and services tax, increased State charges, the imposition of the superannuation guarantee levy, the current tax regime, the need to ensure that the new simplified sales tax does not unfairly affect business, and the unfair competition between government business enterprises and the private sector. The future for motor trades is unclear under both current and likely future policy. Unrestrained imports would soon consign a substantial part of the industry to the fate accepted by both Government and coalition for Australia's textile, clothing and footwear industries-that is, no future. Motor traders, like other industries, are carrying enonnous on-costs of su-h items as payroll tax, superannuation, work cover, the training levy, leave loadings and public holidays. Irrespective of the merits of these charges, they do not exist in Asian economies; and the Government cannot have it both ways. If these charges remain it is unreasonable to demand unprotected competition. Japan has a huge supply of second-hand cars and parts with no local market, so they are dumped overseas. Last year some 66,000 used engines were imported. These are brought in cheaply, many entering apparently as scrap metal. These engines can be installed for under $1,000. This is having a dramatic effect . on the local engine reconditioning industry and has reduced the intake of new apprentices sharply. There is a substantial trade in second-hand tyres from Japan. Some 700,000 of these tyres are entering Australia each year. The safety of all Australians is threatened by this trade. So far no action has been taken by the Government to stem the flow of these imported used engines and tyres, which makes a mockery of Australian standards and design rules. This is in contrast to the high volume importation of second-hand Japanese cars which the Government recently decided to stop with a $12,000 tariff. Even this has not been fully effective. Now that Japan has developed a range of prestige cars, it is only a matter of time before we imports of such models as the Lexus, the Honda NSX and the Nissan GTR. The Government's $12,000 tariff is a flat tax and it will not stop the importation of these luxury cars. There is also uncertainty and alarm about the effects on the industry of the Opposition's goods and services tax. The GST has the potential to dramatically alter the used car industry, through not only the coalition's opposition to tariff on used cars but also the application of the GST to car dealerships., Five years ago. 45 per cent of used cars were sold privately, and the proportion has now climbed to 60 per cent. With the GST applying to dealerships but not to private vendors, legislation attempting to protect consumers and public safety on used cars will soon be meaningless as the 40 per cent of cars sold through dealerships shrinks to negligible proportions. The Government needs urgently to address the problem of the importation of used car components such as engines and tyres. Otherwise we will have a serious loss of employment in skilled trades and declining road safety. Many government enterprises compete unfairly with the private sector. They enjoy a wide range of subsidies in relation to motor vehicles. They receive sales tax concessions, then depress the used car market at auctions by bypassing dealers bearing the full weight of government charges. They are doubly subsidised by the private new car buyer, who pays sales tax and then receives a lower resale price. The most blatant and obscene example of unfair competition and political hypocrisy is Comcar. Aboriginal Sacred Sites",104
182,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to talk about hypocrisy and the motives of certain people in the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I have mentioned before in this House the situation we have had with the brewery in Western Australia. Here we have a historic building, one of the few remaining tum of the century industry complexes. I believe it should be preserved. It was the subject of some very spurious land claims and it was being held up see in the name of Aboriginal people by a certain Mr Bropho and people who supported him. It is on the record that I was able to muster support from Aboriginal people who were sick and tired of having others, mainly whites, speak in their name. We assembled at the brewery site 120. Aboriginal people to be confronted Â·by fewer than 20 Aboriginals from Mr Bropho's family but hordes and hordes of white people-a motley collection. There were the Greens, the animalliberationists, the Democrats, the Trotskyites from the CMEU and the Liberal Party. It is on the record that we were able to stop the Aboriginal Legal Service from funding Mr Bropho. After funding to the extent of at least $300,000, we were able to get the Legal Service to stop it. The minute that funding was stopped-and bear in mind that the Service had represented Mr Bropho something like 45 times and Mr Ivan Yarran, one of his camp followers, some 34 times at this enormous expense-these people immediately went to the Liberal Party and demanded an inquiry into the Aboriginal Legal Service. I have no complaints about that; I believe that there should be full accountability. .But having cut off the funds from the Legal Service we were then appalled to find that this group was being funded by certain people in the Liberal Party. What are the motives of these people? Is it some high moral ground that they seek to hold? I think not. One of these people is Marie-Louise Wordsworth, the wife of David Wordsworth, a member of the upper House in Western Australia. I do not thinkÂ· he had spoken in the upper House since he was elected until recently when he applauded the decision of .that House to reject the Government's legislation which would have allowed the brewery to go ahead. Why would Marie-Louise Wordsworth fund Aboriginals? Anyone who knows her would know that it is not out of compassion. There is, however, an interesting scenario. She is a proprietor, amongst others, of the Captain Stirling Hotel. The Captain Stirling Hotel happens to be the first hotel out of Perth on the Stirling Highway. Marie-Louise Wordsworth is, if nothing else, a very vigorous businesswoman, and she thought that a tavern located between her and the city would have been injurious to business. Frankly, I do not think that is the case. I do not think hotels get their trade that way any more. I do not think people rush out of the city and say, 'First pub: let's stop and have drink' . But she was clearly concerned. So she funded Mr Bropho in the very early days. I am told that two other prominent liberals also funded him, and I will have their names in due course. We now see that the Liberal Party is engaging in advertising and it has advertisements in the newspapers rating against development. It is certainly a strange situation: theÂ· Liberal Party in Western Australia is opposed to development. As a great believer in the Western style of democracy, I find this very worrying-fraught with danger, in fact. How can we have responsible government when we have such an irresponsible Opposition? There is no doubt that Marie-Louise Wordsworth has been culpable, greedy and self-serving. But so too, by association, has the entire Liberal-National Party in Western Australia. I think it is about time the public were made fully aware of the hypocrisy that pervades the Liberal Party. Clearly, it is not fit to govern. Bicentennial National Trail",105
183,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (11.45 p.m.)Despite the late hour, I would like to refer the House to an outstanding national asset. That asset is the Bicentennial National Trail. The Bicentennial National Trail is the longest marked route of its kind in the world, stretching over 5,000 kilometres, from Cooktown in tropical North Queensland to Healesville in Victoria. The inspiration of one of my constituents, the legendary bushman R.M. Williams, the trail follows historic coach and stock routes, old pack horse trails, brumby tracks, bullock trails, fire trails and country roads. Wherever possible along its length, the trail has been designed to be a living history just of our country, following the routes of our early pioneers and highlighting historic sights and artefacts along the way. The trail links 18 of the country's national parks and reveals some of the most spectacular scenery in Australia. It traverses lush tropical rainforests, rugged mountains, valleys and gorges, remote dry plains, 'alpine meadows, snowfields and wilderness country. It gives access to some of the wildest, most a remote country in the world and provides endless fascination for those interested in Australia's own unique fauna and flora. While still very much in its development phase, the trail's enormous potential is now being tapped by people involved in all sorts of activities, as well as the horse riding and bushwalking for which it was initially established. Camping and fishing, fossicking, canoeing, bird watching, orienteering, survival training, mountain bike riding and travelling in horse drawn vehicles are just some of the activities being pursued along its great length. The trail lies within four hours drive of 11 million Australians and its length and variety ensure that it can be all things to all people; a wilderness or a weekend ramble, a place for the experienced trekker or the first time adventurer. Age is no barrier to enjoying its pleasures. All people, from young children to those of advanced years, will find are-s suited to both their fitness level and their ihterests. Experienced trekkers will find as many challenges as they care to confront, while the less experienced can choose a section of the trail which will give them more easy-going adventure. Everyone who loves the Australian bush and its unique attractions will find the trail a profoundly enjoyable experience. To help enjoy the trail, there are 12 separate guidebooks covering each 400to 500kilometre section. Navigation along the trail is by the maps and directions provided in these guide books and the trail is also marked with red and yellow striped triangles attached to trees and posts along the way. For the benefit of the House, details are available from the Bicentennial National Trail at post office box 2235 in Toowoomba, telephone number 076383501. Finally, during a recent TV program on the trail; it was disappointing to hear a very biased comment from the conservation movement that it welcomed the people on the trail and yet it did not welcome the horses. Clearly, this is yet another example of a narrow environmentalist view which is both unrealistic and myopic. All I would say is that here is a national trail which is part of the real Australia that more Australians need to see. Member for Dawson",106
184,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"Hinkler) (11.49 p.m.)On Thursday 17 September in a private members' debate on the 'sugar industry, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) not only misrepresented me but also made two untruthful statements about my business interests and about my farm. As well as that, after the first issue was made, the honourable member denied that he had made that comment. I would like to retrace those steps because it is a matter that has been raised by members of the National Party for . eight years in Queensland. I am pleased to be able once and for all to clear the matter up here in this House. During the debate, after I had finished speaking, the honourable member for Dawson said-and I quote from Hansard: The honourable member for Hinkler talks about being a cane farmer. He is a good example of how one buys a small business in Australia. He was bequeathed the big farm, had to sell it because of mismanagement ... At that point I raised a point of order. The honourable member for Dawson then went on toÂ·say: The honourable member is very sensitive. I did not say he sold his farm. So he should listen. That was said even though it is clear in Hansard that he did say it. After Question Time, I rose to make a personal explanation and in doing so I read out those two parts of Hansard. After I had made those two points very clearly, the honourable member for Dawson rose to make a personal explanation and went on to say: I think that what I said was contained in the slmtence I was using, and I will correct that copy to this extent. I said: 'It is a good example of how Labor makes a small business out of a big business. The honourable member for Hinkler was bequeathed a big farm and had to sell part of it'. After that comment was made, I rose on a second personal explanation to point out very clearly that I have never had to sell any part of my farm and that I still own it. I also made the point that my father and I in fact bought an extra 20 acres of our property prior to my buying out my father's half of the farm. I am very disappointed that on two occasionsa colleague in this House has made untruthful comments about my business interests. While I can cop it and I am used to copping it and dishing it out, when untruthful comments are made about business interests, I think it denigrates the standard of the House and all members of the House. I am disappointed that the honourable member for Dawson is not prepared to apologise and admit that he has made two untruthful statements in this regard.",107
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I do not want to interrupt you but I would warn you to be very careful. It would be better if you could use a different word.,107
186,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall. What it does is bring discredit on all politicians. As I said at the start, the National Party in Queensland has said this for eight years even though it is not correct; it is untrue. I am very disappointed that the honourable member for Dawsonwhom everyone on our side of the House has respected over the years even though we have had our disagreements-would make t,hese sorts of comments. I am sure that any of us that inadvertently made such a comment about another colleague in the heat of the moment and was wrong, especially about another colleague's business actions, would admit it. I certainly would. I know we get hot under the collar at times, but it is pretty disgraceful for the honourable member to knowingly make an incorrect comment on two occasions. Everyone in Queensland knows that I own Sunnyside and that I live on it-it is no secret. I acknowledge that I have raised the heat in the tariff debate on sugar, but I do not apologise for that. I have exposed the fact that the honourable member for Dawson has found it hard to stand up in Mackay and say that Fightback means zero tariffs. But that is about exposing points of view on both sides of the House, just as we on both sides of the House are under scrutiny in regard to our type of policies and what we represent. That is quite legitimate in the to and fro of debate. I will continue to expose what I think is duplicity. I do not mind having the spotlight put on me but, as I said, I am very disappointed that another colleague in this House would make two incorrect comments about someone else's business interests. My dog is as disappointed as I am. In fact, if the honourable member ever goes up Windermere Road my dog would probably bite him. It is disappointing, and I am sure that I would be equally disappointed if anyone on our side of the House made an incorrect comment about the business interests of any colleague on the other side of the House. I think it is incumbent on the honourable member for Dawson to be big enough to show a bit of integrity and decency and to walk away from some of his State National Party colleagues and apologise and admit that what he said is untruthful. Education: Victoria",107
187,Mr FORD,ADJOURNMENT,"Dunkley) (11.54 p.m.)Nowhere is the tragedy of contemporary education more evident than in the disaster of the VCE-the Victorian Certificate of Education. This public manifestation of a subversive and sinister political agenda is the work of former teachers cum union hacks who now infest what used to be the Education Department. What was once a relatively apolitical aspect of public endeavour is now largely in the grip of the Marxist graduates of the 1960s and 1970s. It is the VCE more than any other attempt to undermine ,what is the basic purpose of education-the transmission of knowledge-that has revealed the parlous state of education in Victoria. Of course, the VCE was never meant to provide students with an education. Students these days are not meant to know anything. They are allowed to know only how to do things. The school curriculum has become an extended sociology course, a boring and mundane exercise involving endless research projects and puerile hands-on experiences-experiences which, we are told by the social engineering architects, will empower the hapless and thoroughly aggrieved victim with the knowledge necessary to assert his or her rights. Needless to say, there is never any reference to the concept of responsibilities. The idea that citizens have certain obligations to the rest of society is anathema to the trendies. Of course, this is hardly surprising since the whole intention of the VCE and related campaigns to undermine the value of learning is based on the politics of envy and a desire to bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator. Indeed, one of the VCE's most ardent advocates, failed Premier Kirner, summed up her. malevolent intentions in 1984 when, as Minister for Education, she aimed to 'reshape education so that it is part of the socialist struggle for equity, participation and social change, rather than an instrument of the capitalist system'. Eight years later, the result is the total collapse of confidence in what was once a great system of education. Instead of an education system which passes on knowledge and rewards and encourages achievement, Big Brother has decreed that the main aim of education is to keep all students incarcerated in a classroom until the end of year 12. The only qualification needed to obtain this worthless certificate is that one is still breathing at the end of year 12. Any distinction between good and bad work, correct and incorrect answers and knowledge-or lack of it-is forbidden. To ensure that no one actually learns anything of any worth, legitimate academic subjects like maths, languages, history, English and science are abolished and replaced with nebulous course,designs called 'areas of study'. Anyone who dared challenge these social engineering education bureaucrats has been publicly ridiculed or victimised with a malevolence so characteristic of the Left. Fortunately, a latter day Richard the Lionheart emerged from the Vice-Chancellor's office at Melbourne University to lead the crusade against the VCE. Undaunted by the vitriolic attacks on his motives, for the last five years Professor David Pennington has most eloquently and courageously defended the cause of educational integrity against those who seek to impose a new Dark Age of intolerance and ignorance' through their insidious control of the curriculum. In this endeavour, Professor Pennington has been ably supported by the work of the Institute of Public Affairs and the writings of such critics of the VCE as: Robert Rofe, the Principal of Brighton Grammar; Michael, Hallpike, a secondary teacher from Bendigo; and Kevin Donnelly, a Master at Camberwell Boys Grammar School. So what, if anything, has been achieved by this tragic exercise in neo-Marxist social engineering? Is anyone better off? The facts speak for themselves. Apart from the gang of education bureaucrats who have undoubtedly achieved social justice for themselves by acquiring highly paid and politically' influential jobs, everyone else is worse off. VCE teachers are exhausted by the horrendous work load. (nme expired) Motion (by Mr Bilney) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affrrmative. House adjourned at 11.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Ms Fatin to move That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposals contained in reports of the Joint Standing Committee on the Parliamentary Zone presented to the House on 4 June 1992 and 20 August 1992, namely: Administrative Building carpark, Commencement column plaque, Electricity upgrade, National Library lakeside podium, Parliament House Interpretive trail, Loading dock and carpark/gardeners' storage area, and Signs within the Zone.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Treasury: Trade Union Grants (Question No. 886) Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 June 1991: What are the details of all grants made since March 1988 to trade union groups by the Departmentfs and agencies for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following agency within the Treasury portfolio has provided funding to a trade union. Australian Taxation Office No grants to trade union groups have been made by the ATO for the period March 1988 to 30 June 1991. Funding has been granted to the joint ATO/PSU Union Research Centre on Office Technology (URCOT) from 1 July 1991. The amount allocated to URCOT in 1991/92 was $357,000. This has come from a total funding envelope of $1,768,000. It is anticipated that these funds will be expended over a four to five year period, with 1992/93 funding likely to be between $353,000-$442,000. The purpose of the funding is to bring about the co-operative introduction of ATO's major technological change through gaining commitment to the change program from staff and the Union. URCOT is intended to provide an independent expert advisory service to staff in regard to the impact of technological and organisational change taking place in the ATO and options for responding to the changing environment. The PSU is not required to provide any funding to URCOT. The funding is provided under the program Taxation Administration. NA Recreational Fishing Equipment (Question No. 1032) Mr Tuckey asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 September 1991: (1) What revenue does the Commonwealth derive from taxes and excises on recreational fishing equipment. (2) Will he provide a breakdown by State of the (a) taxes and (b) excises referred to in part (1). Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Although there is limited data to rely on, it is estimated that the Commonwealth derived about $7 million in the 1990-91 financial year from sales tax on recreational fishing equipment, which includes, rods, line fishing tackle and fish landing nets. There is no provision in the Excise Tariff for collection of excise on recreational fishing equipment. (2) A breakdown of the sales tax estimated by State is not available. Tax Havens: Accrual Tax (Question No. 1200) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 November 1991: Is income from trusts which were set up in a tax haven by a person who is now dead exempt from accruals tax; if so, (a) why and (b) would removing the exemption result in an increase in revenue; if so, could the revenue gained be used for urgently needed national infrastructure, education and other community services and so contribute to reducing unemployment. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Income from a trust set up in a tax haven by a person who is now dead is not necessarily exempt from accruals tax. The precise tax treatment of such income depends on the circumstances of the particular case, as set out below. The accruals tax measures, which apply from the 1990-91 income year, contain provisions that deal with certain non-resident trusts which have had property or services transferred to them by Australian residents. These provisions are referred to as the transferor tax measures. In general, they treat the low-taxed income derived by the trust as derived by the resident who transferred the property or services to the trust. The transferor tax meaSures do not always apply to the beneficiaries of the estate of a deceased transferor. This is because a beneficiary of the deceased estate cannot be treated as having transferredÂ· property or services to the trust merely because he or she is a beneficiary. However, this does not mean that such a nonresident trust is necessarily outside the scope of accruals tax measures. For example, if a person other than the deceased has also transferred property or services to the trust, the low-taxed income of the trust would then be treated as income of that person. The definition of ""transfer"" is sufficiently wide to include transfers made by companies controlIed by a resident and transfers made on behalf of a resident. Moreover, if residents have a present entitlement to a share of the income of the trust, they will be taxed on that income on a current basis under the normal trust provisions. Where there is no present entitlement and the transferor tax measures do not apply, low-taxed income accumulated by an offshore trust will still be subject to Australian tax when it is distributed to an Australian resident or applied for the benefit of an Australian resident. In these circumstances the taxpayer is liable to pay, in addition to the tax, an interest charge to compensate for the deferral of tax. (b) It follows from the answer to (a) that there is no automatic exemption from the accruals tax measures for the beneficiaries of the estate of a deceased transferor. So the question of ""removing the exemption"" does not arise. The Government is not presently considering altering the measures to treat the beneficiaries of such estates as if they themselves transferred property or services to the trust. Such treatment would be counter-factual and could produce unfair results in many cases. If the Government were to alter the measures in that way, the revenue effects are not clear. Any additional revenue that might arise from such an alteration could of course be applied to any purpose, including those listed in the question. The Government is satisfied that the package of accruals tax measures, together with the Foreign Investment Fund measureS announced in the 199192 Budget, strike a good balance between ensuring that Australian residents with foreign source income pay their fair share of Australian tax, and not discouraging legitimate Australian investment offshore. Land: Overseas Purchasers (Question No. 1297) Mr Filing asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: What means are available to. (a) monitor the acquisition of Australian urban land by .-verseas interests and (b) ensure that the condItiOns of the Foreign Investment Review Board approval of land by overseas interests are met. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) The acquisition of Australian urban land by foreign interests is regulated by the provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Act). Under the Act, any overseas interest acquiring an interest in Australian urban land is required to seek approval unless that acquisition falls into a category which is exempt by regulation. Foreign investment policy is tightest in the area of existing housing, where most. proposed foreign acquisitions-other than by Australian citizens abroad and foreign nationals entitled to permanent residence in Australia-are examinable and not normally approved, except for foreign nationals temporarily resident in Australia for a year or more, and a few other special categories. In its Annual Report, the Board provides summary details of the level of expected foreign investment in urban real estate. The Board's Annual Report for 1990-91 was tabled in Parliament on 25 February 1992. In some instances the acquisition of Australian urban land by foreign interests may be subject to the parties meeting certain conditions. The .most common condition applies to proposed acquisitions had of real estate for development, and normally requires that the development work commence within 12 months of the date of approval. Under the Act, there is provision for the imposition of penalties on foreign investors who, without good reason, fail to comply with conditions. Where aIJeged breaches of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act are brought to the Government's attention, they are foIJowed up, and would be referred if necessary to the Federal Police or Australian Government Solicitor for appropriate action. However, it is the experience of the Government that compliance with foreign investment policy is generaIJy high. Taxation Office: Central Queensland (Question No. 1483) Mr Wright asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: (1) Does the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) branch office in Townsville serve the Central Queensland region; if so, (a) is Townsville inappropriate on logistical and geographical grounds to serve a region which extends to Bundaberg, (b) is Rockhampton better suited as an administrative centre for individual and business taxpayers in central Queensland and (c) would establishing an office in Rockhampton contribute to decentralising the ATO. (2) Will the Government establish an ATO office in Rockhampton similar to that in Townsville. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Branch Office in Townsville administers the taxation affairs of some 600,000 taxpayers in northern and central Queensland and is supported by Regional Offices in Cairns, Mackay and Rockhampton. Gladstone is the most southern fringe of the area covered by the Townsville Branch Office and the area between there and Brisbane is being served by the new Chermside Branch Office. (a) Queensland has been divided into 4 regions for ATO administration to be serviced by new Branch Offices at Chermside and Upper Mount Gravatt, a smaller Brisbane CBD Office and the Townsville Branch Office. This division is consistent with the ATO policy of moving towards offices of 600 to 800 staff. Offices of this size have been found to be more efficient and capable of providing a high level of service to taxpayers whilst providing career opportunities for staff. The policy will result in a total of 2S branch offices being established throughout Australia by the end of 1994. Significant planning and lead times are involved and as a result a 3 to 6 year time frame is not uncommon in finalising construction of a branch office. Townsville Branch Office covers a large geographical area but was selected as the most practical location to service taxpayers in the northern region of Queensland. (b) The taxation base of Central Queensland represents less than 2S% of Townsville Office's file size and as such would not warrant the establishment of a full branch office in the Rockhampton region. In addition to the s.ervices available from the regional office in Rockhampton a range of other initiatives have resulted in a better level of services to taxpayers throughout Australia. Recent developments such as TaxPack are going a long way towards meeting the needs of individual taxpayers. The introduction of BillPay means that people will no longer have to pay their tax bill at a Tax Office but at the local Post Office. 008 numbers are available for country people to seek assistance on a variety of subjects. The ATO is also looking at a number of initiatives under its Modernisation Program that will result in a better service to people making general phone enquiries to the ATO. (c) Decentralisation of the ATO is progressing rapidly with a total of 2S branch offices to be in operation by the end of 1994. These branch offices are currently supported by 19 regional offices mainly located in large rural centres where branch offices are less accessible. The regional offices at present do not provide a comprehensive range of ATO services to rural Australia. However the extensive Modernisation programs being implemented by the ATO are expanding the services available in rural areas. A recent review of the functions and extent to which regional offices add value to the ATO has resulted in a number of recommendations which are to be pilot-d in selected regional offices during the next financial year. The Cairns Regional office has been selected to participate in the pilot exercise as it has the capacity to readily accommodate extra staff. (2) Pending the trial and review of the recommendationS. concerning the regional offices and the successful implementation of ATO modernisation strategies and systems the ATO is not in a position at present to give any assurance on the eventual functions and size of the Rockhampton Office. The Townsville Branch Office will be pursuing the results of the pilot program. The current lease on the Rockhampton Office expires in approximately 12 months and any significant increase in . function or staffing for the office will necessitate a revision of lease requirements. Nature Conservation (Question No. 1558) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: What action has been taken on the recommendations adopted at the 18th Session of the General Assembly of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature-The World Conservation Union (Perth, 28 November-5 December 1990) on (a) Australian resource security legislation; (b) mining in national parks and nature reserves, especially in Australia; (c) Kakadu National Park; (d) the Kimberley Region; (e) conservation of Arid Zone Wetlands, especially in the Lake Eyre Basin; (f) wilderness and forest conservation in Tasmania; (g) Fraser Island; (h) mineral, including oil explorLake ation in or adjacent to marine parks and World Heritage areas in Australia; (i) prohibition of oil tankers inshore of the Coral Sea/Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area; and CD sub-Antarctic islands of Australia.",108
188,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As the honourable member is aware, in many cases the recommendations are comprised of a number of parts which deal with specific issues in some cases specific areas which are not reflected in the question. For this reason copies of relevant recommendations have been provided to the honourable member and additional copies are strategy. available from the House of Representatives Table office. However, in terms of the broad question asked, and having regard to the recommendations made, action on those recommendations adopted the 18th Session of the General Assembly of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature-The World Conservation Union (Perth, 28 November-5 December 1990), which were Island directed to the Commonwealth Government, is follows: (a) The Government's resource security legislation, the Forests Conservation and Development Bill, was defeated in the Senate on 5 May 1992. (b) Although the Commonwealth Government operative opposes mining in national parks, and such activiagencies ties are banned in Commonwealth national parks, the matter is generally one for State Governments. (c) 1. The Kakadu eonservation Zone of Stage III has been incorporated into Kakadu National Park. 2. labiluka and Koongarra Project Areas have been incorporated into Kakadu National Park. Mining in the Koongarra Project Area is not permitted under the Government's uranium mining policy. 3. Kakadu N-tionaI Park, including Stage III, has been re-nominated to the World Heritage List and was recently recommended for listing by the World Heritage Bureau. 4. The Government continues to honour its obligations to protect Kakadu National Park under the relevant international nature conservation conventions. (d) I. The conservation of the. Kimberley is essentially a matter for the Western Australian Government. 2. A National Wilderness Inventory study by the Australian Heritage Commission of northern Western Australia has begun with the cooperation of the Western Australian Government. (e) la. Investigations into the vulnerability of the Eyre wetlands is essentially a matter for the State and Territory Governments concerned. lb. The South Australian Government has advised . that over 11.4 million hectares of the Lake Eyre Basin have been protected in national parks, reserves and as wetlands of international importance under the RAMSAR convention. le. The Commonwealth and relevant State Governments are considering the possible nomination of the Lake Eyre Region to the World Heritage and List as part of the Indicative List process. 2. The protection of wetlands in arid areas is the being considered by the Commonwealth Government as part of its overall nature conservation (f) 1. The Commonwealth Government has not nominated any additional Tasmanian World Heritage areas, nor placed areas on Australia's Indicaat tive List since the mCN General Assembly. (g) Logging ceased on Fraser Island inDecember 1991. The World Heritage nomination of Fraser was submitted to the World Heritage Comas mittee in September 1991. The World Heritage Bureau has recently recommended that Fraser Island be inscribed on the World Heritage List. (h) la. My Department, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority have established a coprogram with relevant State and Territory to develop a national representative system of marine protected areas around Australia. lb. The Government has neither reviewed nor deferred its offshore oil exploration program as proposed in the recommendation. There is communication between my Department and theÂ· not Department of Primary Industry and Energy prior to every stage of the offshore release program and areas known to be environmentally sensitive are referred to the Minister for Resources for a decision on whether to release and conditions of release. Ic. The Government has given a commitment that any proposals for petroleum exploration in the vicinity of World Heritage properties will be the subject of the strictest scientific and environmental analysis. Management. plans for Commonwealth marine parks and reserves do not allow petroleum exploration. However, petroleum exploration and development is allowed in areas which are adjacent to Region Commonwealth and State marine parks and reserves subject to Commonwealth environment protection legislation such as the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 includes stringent requirements to ensure companies carry out all activities using appropriate equipment and procedures to prevent blowouts or any other escape of petroleum. In addition, special environment protection conditions may be required for exploration or production in sensitive areas. The Government will not countenance any drilling that would endanger sensi-iv:e m-ri-e environments and has ruled out any dnlhng wlthm the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The former Prime Minister and the Minister for Resources have stated that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would be asked for a full assessment of any proposal for oil exploration adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef before any such exploration could be contemplated. Any proposals for exploration near the Park would trigger the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. (i) 2. Legislation came into force on 1 October 1991. 4. The Commonwealth Government has not taken any action on this recommendation. (j) 2. The Government nominated Macquarie Island to the World Heritage List in September 1991 on the basis of its geological values. 5. Macquarie Island was nominated to the World Heritage List on the basis of its geological values and activities in the marine areas are.not expected to have any effect on the vah,les. Taxation Office: Production of Document (Question No. 1613) Mr Aldred asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 May 1992: (1) Has his attention been drawn \0 the sending of a document by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) on 24 April 1990 to Mr Geoffrey Manners through the Australian High Commission in London. (2) Was the document produced by Australian Taxation Office (ATO) officials in 1986 irl a Victorian court in which Mr Manners was not present. . (3) Is it a fact that Mr Manners was unable to inspect the docur;nent b-fore .24 April 1990 - ause no official proVided him With a copy despite the ATO and the DPP claiming that the document had Mr Manners' consent. (4) Is the DPP's version of the document at least 45 pages long. (5) Is it a fact that the DPP has (a) never confirmed that page 45 is the final page and (b) not supplied Mr Manners with the first 6 pages. (6) Do some of the 45 pages refer to ATO officials agreeing to pay large sums to a solicitor's firm which has never acted for Mr Manners; if so, did ATO officials deem the solicitor to have authority to sign the ATO document as if he were acting for Mr Manners. (7) Is it a fact that no DPP official will provi-e Mr Manners with any reasons for the ATO s authorisation of the solicitor to sign as if he had Mr Manners' consent. (8) Has the Ombudsman stated that irlformation he sought from the ATO officials concernirlg the Manners case irl mid-1991 has not yet come to hand; if so, why. (9) Did ATO officials - Canberra take 6 - onths irl 1982 to decide to reject a settlement With Mr Manners and his family's entities which senior ATO officials in Melbourne had requested them to ratify; if so, why. (10) Has Mr Manners been provided with a letter signed by Acting - en-or Assistant Comm-ss!oner D. G. Lewis which mdlcates that the CommISSIOner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, had directed ATO actions concerning Mr Manners. (11) Has Mr Manners stated that Commissioner Boucher knew that the ATO document was fraudulent. (12) Did Commissioner Boucher deny Mr Manners legal representation. (13) Did Commissioner Boucher acknowledge that the document could not and did not have Mr Manners' consent. (14) Has Mr Manners been asking the DPP sirlce 10 May 1990 to irlvestigate the alleged fraudulence of the DPP's version of the ATO document. (15) Has his attention been drawn to submissions made by Mr Manners to irlquiries being undertaken by parliamentary committees which indicate !hat he can provide evidence that Mr Bo?cher, With the assistance of the DPP, has acted Improperly and then illegally to prevent Mr Manners from disclosing ATO wrongdoings. (16) Did a senior ATO official warn Mr Manners in 1982 that other ATO officials intended to misuse ATO facilities to bankrupt him and to charge him falsely. (17) Is it a fact that Mr Manners cannot safely re-enter Australia to provide evidence to parli8Il.lentary inquiries until the ATO withdraws its court orders and claims in relation to him. (18) Has the DPP withdrawn all ATO-based allegations but not the barriers to Mr Manners' safe re-entry to Australia. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A review of the Manners matter has involved the inspection of a great number of files of so-e antiquity and, as you may appreciate, some matenal is no longer available. Mr Manners left the jurisdiction on 19 June 1983. Many of the allegations now made relate to matters that he alleges occurred in the period 1982 to 1986. Since this time there have been considerable changes in staffing within both the ATO and the DPP, whose input was required in relation to some of the questions asked. (1) The only document which the DPP has been able to locate, which was sent to Mr Manners through the Australian High Commission on or about 24 April 1990 is the Consent Orders in the action brought by the ATO against Mr Manners and his company Terrule Pty Ltd. (2) Mr Manners was not in Australia when the Consent Orders were entered into but he was represented by Mr Tony Kelly, Solicitor of Messrs Henty, Jepson and Kelly, Solicitors. (3) We have no knowledge of whether Mr Manners was able to inspect the document in question. (4) On the assumption that the Consent Orders is the document referred to, then the document is 39 pages plus the length of the covering letter. (5) As we are unsure of the document which Me Manners is referring to, we are unable to answer this question. (6) The Terms of Settlement dated 23 June 1986 in the matter of Henty, Jepson and Kelly v Terrule consents to judgment being entered for the Plaintiff in the sum of $142,347.85. File note made by a DPP Solicitor, notes: ""Kelly appeared to consent to Orders on behalf of G Manners ... "" and later in the file note: ""Kelly indicated that he had been in communication with Geoffrey Manners. He indicated that Manners agrees to what happens here today"". (7) Do not have any knowledge of this. (8) The information waS sent to the Ombudsman on 28 November 1991. (9) Unable to answer this question. (10) Mr Manners was provided with a letter signed by Acting Senior Assistant Commissioner, D. G. Lewis which read ""The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr T. P. Boucher, has asked me to reply to your letter... "". This letter does not indicate Mr Boucher had directed ATO actions concerning Me Manners. (11) This is a question which only Me Manners can answer. (12) Me Manners was not denied the right to be legally represented. He was in fact represented by a barrister and/or solicitor in all significant court actions. (13) Mr Boucher has no recollection of such a statement. (14) The DPP has a copy of a letter dated 10 May 1990 to the Australian High Commission which contains various allegations relating to alleged fraudulent documents. The letter contains allegations but not evidence. This and other matters were again raised by Mr Manners in August 1990. Mr Manners has been requested to provide evidence of his allegations but has not done so. (15) Yes. (16) Officers of the ATO who are familiar with the case have no knowledge of any warning given to Mr Manners. Nor are they aware of any plans to misuse ATO facilities to bankrupt him and to charge him falsely. (17) No, the only outstanding issues are in relation to the payment of Me Manners' taxation liability. (18) There are no ""barriers"" imposed by the DPP to Mr Manners return to Australia.

(12) Is she able to say whether the (a) Australian Institute of Sport, (b) Australian Olympic Federation or (c) Australian Cycling Federation will review their selection policies for the Commonwealth or Olympic Games after 1992; if so, in each case, (i) what form will the review take and (ii) who will conduct it.",116
190,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) According to the selection criteria of the Australian Cycling Federation (ACF) which applied to Australian female cyclists for the 1992 Olympic Games (copies of which have been forwarded to the tabling office) the ACF set qualifying times for the following events before the 1992 National Track Championships, held during March in Launceston: Women's 3000m Individual Pursuit-Below 3min 46secs Women's Flying 200m-Below 11.80secs I am advised by the ACF that the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) criteria for selection of female cyclists for the 1992 Olympic Games required that the AOC Planning and Review Commission be satisfied that track and road team trial riders be likely to finish in the first eight places, and the individual road cyclists be likely to finish in the first sixteen places. (2) The total sum spent on the three camps held in Adelaide between January and April 1992 is as follows:(a) AIS: $28,557 (b) AOC: $8,000 (c) ACF: $2,000 (3) AIS (a) Nil (b) Nil (c) 100%-$28,557 (d) Nil AOC (a) Nil (b) Nil (c) 58%-$4,664 (d) 42%-$3,336 ACF (a) Nil (b) Nil (c) Nil (d) 100%-$2,000 (4) (a) AIS $28,557 from National Sports Program $16,264 AIS Residential Program $12,293 (b) AOC $8,000 from Australian Sports Commission Sports Development Program $4,664 AOC General Funds $3,336 (c) ACF $2,000 from ACF General Funds $2,000 (5) I am advised by the ACF that the selectors for female cyclists were Me A Fulcher (Chairman of S-lectors), Me H Vogels, Me H Salzwedel, and Me C Walsh (Track selector only). Mr Fulcher was present at the third camp only, Mr Vogels and Me Salzwedel did not attend any of the camps, and Me Walsh was present at all three camps. In the case of selectors not being present at the camps, reasons stated include business commitments and overseas cycling engagements. (6) I am advised by the ACF that the National Women's Coach, Me Gary West, maintained close contact with the Chairman of Selectors and submitted written reports covering the results Â·of training, racing and sports science testing. During the third camp the Chairman of Selectors interviewed the National Coach, the AIS Head Coach and the head of the Exercise Physiology Department of the South Australian Institute of Sport to ascertain details on individuals' progress and performance in the above areas. He then interviewed each member of the women's squad to discuss these details before passing them on to the other members of the selection committee for consideration, prior to determining the final team. (7) The ACF has interpreted the start point of funding assistance in this case as from the naming of the respective Olympic squads. The men's road squad was formed on 29 October 1991. The men's track squad was formed on 9 December 1991. The women's road squad was formed on 1 October 1991. The women's track team was named on 30 March 1992. From the time of naming the respective men's and women's cycling squads the total cost to the following agencies is: (a) The AIS (i) Men's $61,000 (ii) Women's $28,557 (b) The AOC I am advised by the AOC that a cash grant totalling $268,300 was paid to the ACF in 1992 for team selection, preparation and competition. (i) A further $123,017 in airfare costs were charged directly to the AOC which can be attributed directly to the male squads. (ii) A further $21,404 in airfare costs were charged directly to the AOC which can be attributed directly to the female squads. (c) The ACF The ACF advised t\1at they incurred expenses of approximately $10,000 in relation to the selection of Australian male and female cyclists for the 1992 Olympic Games. It is difficult to establish the exact amount has been expended specifically on the actual selection of athletes, as the expenditure outlined relates to squad preparation and elite athlete development in general, with team selection being one component of the total program. (8) AIS Expenditure (a) Nil (b) Nil (c) 100%-$89,557 (d) Nil AOC Expenditure (a) Nil (b) Nil (c) 58%-$239,378 (d) 42%-$173,343 ACF Expenditure not applicable. (9) AIS Expenditure $89,557 from National Sports Program $16,264 AIS Residential Program $73,293 AOC Expenditure $412,721 from Australian Sports Commission Sports Development Program $239,378 AOC General Funds $173,343 ACF Expenditure not applicable. (10) I am advised by the ACF that following the selection of the male track and road Olympic squads eleven male track cyclists and eleven male road cyclists travelled to Europe. Six of these cyclists were not members of Olympic squads, but were AIS scholarship holders who were sent for experience and also to assist with the entry numbers for major tours. (11) Sixteen cyclists were wholly funded by the AOC at a total Cost of $317,977. Six cyclists were wholly funded by the AIS at a total cost of $61,000. (12) The Australian Institute of Sport does not set criteria for selection of athletes to compete in the Commonwealth or Olympic Games. I am unable to say whether the AOC will review their selection policies but am advised by the ACF that it annually reviews the selection criteria and policy, and should there be need for change, this would be effected by the sport. Counter Current Extraction Technology (Question No. 1668) . Mr MCLachlan asked the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, upon notice, on 24 June 1992: (I) Have (a) Howden Refrigeration Pty Ltd, (b) which Bioquip Australia Pty Ltd or (c) Counter Current Technology Pty Ltd received grants or other assistance from Austrade for the promotion or development of counter current extraction (CCE) technology; if so, in each case, (a) what sum or other assistance was provided and (b) under what scheme was it provided. (2) Has Austrade promoted CCE technology for overseas trade; if so, has it issued a disclaimer that CCE technology is unsuited to the production of orange juice, however described. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I)(a) Yes. Howden Refrigeration Pty Ltd received an Export Market Development (EMD) Grant in the 1979/80 grant year for the promotion of Industrial Refrigeration Equipment-a Counter Current Defuser. (I)(a)(a) $951. (1)(a)(b) Export Market Development Grants Scheme (1)(b) Yes. Bioquip Australia Pty Ltd received an EMD Grant in the 1984/85 grant year for the promotion of Agricultural Equipment and Industrial Property Rights-Counter Current Extraction patents. (1)(b)(a) $73,536. (1)(b)(b) Export Market Development Grants Scheme. (1)(c) Yes. Counter Current Technology Pty Ltd received an EMD Grant for the 1987/88 grant year for the promotion of Machines and Mechanical Appliances-Food Processing Equipment and Counter Current Extraction technology. (1)(c)(a) $5,430. (1)(c)(b) Export Market Development Grants Scheme. (2) No. In 1988, Austrade made offers in response to enquiries from Counter Current Technology Pty Ltd to do market research in the United Kingdom and to obtain a commercial report in Thailand. Neither offer was taken up and Austrade took no further action in this matter. Subscriptions to Trade and Business Bodies: Tax Deductions (Question No. 1734) Dr Bob Woods asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: What was the total value of tax deductions for dues and SUbscriptions to (a) trade unions, bodies and (c) business and professional associations in 1989-90. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The total value of deductions for dues and subscriptions to trade unions and trade bodies combined in 1989-90 has been estimated at $55Om. Separate estimates for trade union and trade bodies are not available because these items have not been separately identified on a tax return schedule. No estimate is available for the value of deductions for dues and subscriptions to business and professional associations because these also have not been separately identified on tax return schedules. Unanswered Question on Notice (Question No. 1741) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: When may I expect an answer to question No. 1190 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 7 November 1991.",117
191,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The answer to this question appeared in the Hansard of 18 August 1992 on page 73. Unanswered Question on Notice (Question No. 1742) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: When may I expect an answer to question No. 1205 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 7 November 1991.",119
192,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The answer to this question appeared in the Hansard of 8 September 1992 on page 534. Superannuation Guarantee Levy: ATO Letter (Question No. 1744)  (b) trade notice, on 18 August 1992: (1) Did the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) distribute a letter advising businesses of the superannuation guarantee levy before the relevant legislation had been introduced into the Parliament; if so, (a) why, (b) how many letters were distributed, (c) what was the cost (i) in total and (ii) of (A) design, (B) printing the letter, (C) printing the envelope, (D) postage and (E) consultancy fees and (d) who folded and distributed the letters. (2) Was the letter in the form of a black and white information sheet; if not, why not. (3) Were plain white envelopes used; if not, why not. (4) Did the letter contain white printing on a black or coloured background; if so, did the ATO consider the effect on (a) the reader comprehension rate and (b) legibility for persons with restricted colour perception. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) The ATO distributed a letter to employers about the Superannuation Guarantee commencing on 30 March until 13 April 1992. The Superannuation Guarantee legislation was introduced into Parliament on 2 April 1992. The letter was sent out at this time because: the initiative had been announced in the August 1991 budget; an information paper had been issued in December 1991; ongoing public debate about an anticipated 1 July 1992 start date had created an expectation for information; and employers needed to know what their obligations were under the proposed legislation. (l)(b) A total of 617,569 letters were distributed. (l)(c)(i) The total cost for the exercise was $264,868.80. (l)(c)(ii)(A) The cost of designing the letter was $720.00. (1)(c)(ii)(B) The cost of printing the letter was $18,345.00. (1)(c)(ii)(C) The cost of printing the envelope was $18,899.00. (l)(c)(ii)(D) The cost of postage was $226,904.80. (1)(c)(ii)(E) There were no consultancy fees as the letter was produced by ATO staff. (l)(d) The folding and distributing of the letters was done by The Salmat Group (Automail) who were appointed by the ATO following the normal tender process. (2) Due to the amount of material flooding the market by the superannuation industry, the ATO had to ensure that information could compete and be seen as official. Research also indicated that the Superannuation Guarantee had to be seen as a new initiative, therefore the letter was not presented in black and white. (3) Plain envelopes were not used. White envelopes with colour print in keeping with the letter design were used. The envelope had to be distinguished between junk mail to be effective and interest the reader. (4) The letter artwork comprised of white and yellow printing reversed out of a colour background. The influence on reader comprehension rate and legibility for people with restricted colour perception was not considered because: the graphic designer advised that the reverse white and yellow print on purple background would be an effective way to present information and would break through the 'clutter' of other Superannuation Guarantee material on the market; time and budget didn't permit market testing of the product; and the letter was only 2 pages and needed to have maximum impact. Human Rights (Question No. 1751) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: (1) Did consultation conclude with the States and Territories in the forum of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Perth on 2 July 1992 concerning declarations under (a) Article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, (b) Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and (c) Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. (2) Did Australia attend the first session (9-13 September 1991) and second session (30 March10 April 1992) in Geneva of the Preparatory Committee for the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna. (3) When will the third session of the Preparatory Committee be held and will Australia attend it. (4) Will Australia have made the four outstanding declarations before the World Conference is held. Mr DufTy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. However, the Standing Committee is not the only means by which COnSultation with the States occurs on these matters. I have been engaged in correspondence with my State and Territory counterparts on these issues over recent months. (2) Yes. (3) The third session of the Preparatory Commit"" tee will be held from 14-19 September 1992. I understand that Australia will be attending that session. (4) The question of whether and when declarations will be made which extend Australia's treaty obligations is properly a matter for decision by the Governor General-in-Council . Taxation (Question No. 1754) Mr Moore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: Will he outline all taxes, charges, levies and fees imposed by the Government on Australians. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Budget Statement 4 outlines the main revenue raising instruments of the Commonwealth. The main revenue raising tax instruments are listed below: Income Tax: PAYE Instalment Deductions; Provisional Tax; Prescribed Payments System; Medicare Levy; Companies Income Tax; Superannuation Funds Income Tax; Withholding Tax; Petroleum Resource Rent Tax; and Fringe Benefits Tax. Indirect Tax: Wholesale Sales Tax; Excise Duty; and Customs Duty on imports. Other Taxes, Fees and Fines: of which the largest revenue raisers are' Primary Industry Levies and Charges; and Broadcasting and Television Station Licence Fees .. This list is not exhaustive but is indicative of range of taxing arrangements utilised by the Commonwealth. In addition, there are other levies and charges imposed by Commonwealth authorities. Nuclear Accidents (Question No. 1762) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the New Scientist of 20 June 1992 concerning nuclear accidents at the Mayak nuclear complex in Russia. (2) Will he obtain a copy of the report referred to in the article and make it available; if not, why not. (3) Is he able to say (a) where the Mayak nuclear complex is located, (b) how many persons have died (i) as a result of the accidents. and (ii) from nuclear contamination, (c) how many persons in the region have been severely irradiated and Cd) what quantity of radioactive material has been discharged in the environment from the complex. (4) Is he able to say whether the complex is still discharging radioactive material into the environment. (5) Is he able to say whether action is being taken to remove the radioactive contamination; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) involved. (6) Is he able to say what is the current financial status of the IAEA. (7) Is he aware of any other nuclear accidents in the former Soviet Union, other than Chernobyl; if so, will he give details. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, together with a further article on the same subject published in the New Scientist of 27 June 1992. (2) Australian authorities do not have this report which they understand is probably in Russian. If any honourable members should wish to do so, they could seek to obtain a copy through the Parliamentary Research Service. (3) (a) The Mayak Atomic Industrial Complex is located in the southern Ural mountains in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia, near the town of Kyshtym. It has been involved in nuclear weaponsrelated activities since 1948. (b) Other than information provided in the New Scientist articles and a number of other media the reports, Australian authorities have not had access to any official data on these questions. (c) Russian research institutes have reported that a total of 437,000 people have been affected by radiation released from the three accidents that have taken place at the complex. (d) In 1950-1951, radioactive waste was discharged into the Techa River, exposing thousands of people to high radiation doses. The quantity of radioactive material discharged during this period has not been reported. In 1957, an explosion in a radioactive waste storage tank released some 20 million curies of radionuclides into the environment. In 1967, a tornado is estimated to have spread 6,000 curies of radionuclides from the banks of Lake Karachay into which a total of 120 million curies of radioactive waste is said to have been dumped. Unofficial sources estimate total radioactive discharges from the complex between 1949 and 1960 at 1 billion curies. (4) We have no information on this question. (5) (a) I am advised that funds have been allocated by the Russian government to commence the clear up of Lake Karachay; Germany is to donate $US1.3 million towards a regional clean-up and French and Russian organisations have agreed to cooperate in studying the contamination problems. Detailed rehabilitation measures have not yet been announced; (b) I am advised that there is no IAEA involvement. (6) Like most international organisations at present, the IAEA ishavirig to handle a situation of a shortfall in budget contributions, caused principally by the late or non-payment of contributions to its regular budget by a number of member states, notably those that have emerged from the former Soviet Union. , Australia pays its contributions on time and in full. We have been working with the Agency's Secretariat and otherÂ· members to help ensure continued effective operations of the organisation. In general, we are satisfied that the IAEA has handled the situation in a responsible manner, including a 13% reduction of the Agency's more discretionary activities in 1992. In that process, preserving the effectiveness of safeguards activities has been a high priority. Australia supported a real budget increase of $US 1.5 million in the Agency's 1993 budget at the Board of Governors meeting in June. This budget is expected to be approved at the General Conference in September. (7) I am advised that significant accidents involving fuel channel ruptures took place at the Sosnovy Bor 1 reactor in October 1975 and at Chernobyl 1 in 1982. In October 1991, a turbine room fire occurred at Chernobyl 2 and in March 1992, a fuel channel failure led to the shutdown of Sosnovy Bor 3. Claims of other significant accidents before Chernobyl have not been officially confirmed. There have also been a number of nuclear accidents on board Soviet nuclear submarines, notably in July 1961, August 1985, October 1986 and April 1989. Imported Food: Radioactive Levels . (Question No. 1763) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the New Scientist of 20 June 1992 claiming that over 150 million curies of radioactive material has been discharged into the environment in the Kyshtyn region of Russia. (2) Is he able to say how this amount of radioactive material compares with the discharge following the Chernobyl disaster. (3) What steps is the Departinent for Primary Industries and Energy taking to ensure that food imported into Australia is not contaminated with radioactive substances. (4) What levels of radioactive substances are permitted in foods for human consumption in Australia. (5) Who sets the levels. (6) On what bases are the levels determined.",119
193,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Because of the nature of theÂ· Chernobyl accident, it is difficult.to estimate the amount of radioactive material released. I am aware of estimates that the total radioactivity released in the accident was 2 x 1018 becquerels (50 million curies) over a period of two weeks or so. The accident resulted in a high vertical discharge of"" radioactive elements which were dispersed across Europe. The uncontrolled discharge from the Chernobyl accident differs from that at Kyshtyn. The radioactive discharge from the Mayak reactor in Kyshtyn was concentrated to a relatively small area, and was not detected outside the (then) USSR. As pointed out in the article referred to by Mr Scott, the Kyshtyn problem was due to deliberate releases of radioactive waste together with accidental discharge of poorly stored waste material. (3) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service manages an Imported Foods Inspection Program. Under this program AQIS assumed responsibility for radiation testing of imported foods in November 1991. Prior to that date testing was the joint responsibility of the Australian Customs Service, the (then) Department of Health and Community Services, and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL). The present scheme has 3 levels of inspection: all highly susceptible food (cheese, herbs, tea and nuts) from countries most affected by the Chernobyl accident is tested; five per cent of all other food from most affected countries and highly susceptible food from countries peripheral to the high fallout areas is tested; one per cent of all other foods from peripheral countries is tested. Portable equipment for conducting preliminary screening of food consignments is used at most ports. If the preliminary screening procedure shows radiation levels of more than 100 becquerels per kilogram, a sample is drawn forÂ· more detailed analysis at either the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services or AGAL. In some regions where portable equipment is not available, samples are drawn and analysed at the appropriate laboratory. All foods tested by AQIS have met the requirements. (4) Foods are permitted. importation if they contain no more than 600 becquerels per kilogram of caesium 137 and caesium 134 which are the most importantÂ· radionuclides released in the Chernobyl accident. (5) The level was recommended by experts of the ARL who took into account information and recommendations about acceptable levels of radiation in food obtained from European authorities dealing with the immediate and long term implications of the Chernobyl accident. (6) The limit of 600 becquerels per kilogram was determined as a safe upper limit even if all food in a total diet contained that concentration of radiocaesium. ABC: Employment of Sports Broadcaster (Question No. 1773) Mr Aldred asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: (1) Is Mr David MCKay employed as a sports broadcaster or similar occupation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC); if so; (a) in what form of employment or contract is he engaged, (b) for each year of employment, what sum was he paid and (c) when was he first appointed or employed. (2) Is the Minister able to say what relevance sections 91 and 91A of the Public Service Act 1922 have in relation to the employment of Mr MCKay by the ABC; if so, were the sections observed by the ABC; if not, (a) why not and (b) what action will the Minister take.",122
194,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) David MCKay has been employed by ABC Sport for its Australian Football coverage broadcast on 3LO and Victorian Regional Stations since 1984. Mr MCKay has been used because of his high profile in the former Victorian Football League where he played with distinction with the Carlton Football Club. (a) Mr MCKay is employed casually with a ""feefor-service"" for each football match he attends in a working capacity for the ABC. (b) MrMCKay receives the standard ""Around the Grounds"" fee for service for ea'ch match. The value of this fee is regarded as commercially confidential. (c) Mr MCKay has generally worked between 20 and 30 times per football season since 1984. (2) The provisions of the ,Public Service Act 1922 do not relate to the ABC and its employment on a casual basis of an individual to provide a service. Where ABC' employment is sought by someone covered by that Act, it is up to that person to fulfil hisfher employment obligations under that Act as they pertain to sections 91 and 91A. In this case, the Head of ABC Radio Sport understands that Mr MCKay obtained the appropriate permission from his employer to work casually for the ABC, as required. New Times for Older Australians (Question No. 1778)",123
195,Mr MCARTHUR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: (1) How many copies of the June 1992 issue of the New llmes for Older Australians were published. (2) What sum has or will be paid to the publisher of the newsletter. (3) Was the National Media Liaison Service involved in the authorship of any articles in the newsletter; if so, which articles. (4) Were consultants engaged by his Department to (a) write articles in or (b) assist in production the newsletter; if so, (i) who were the consultants, (ii) what sum was paid to each consultant and (iii) which articles did they each write. (5) Is the newsletter distributed to State and Territory organisations; if so, (a) which organisations are they and (b) how is the number of copies sent to each organisation determined. Mr Staples--'-The answe(to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 140,000. (2) The newsletter was published by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services using the AGPS. (3) No. All material was written by Departmental staff. (4) (a) No. (b) The newsletter was designed by Graphic Gesture (Yass) at a cost of $1,261. ,(5) Yes. (a) The mailing list is made up primarily of hostels, hospitals, nursing homes, Home and Community Care (HACC) providers, migrant resource centres, Geriatric Assessment Teams (GATs), senior citizens and community services and health centres, local Members and Senators, and other individuals requesting inclusion on the mailing list. (b) The number of copies sent to each address depends on the number requested, or an assessment of the number likely to be required. Cout,1s and Judiciary (Question No. 1797) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: Further to his answer to question No. 527 (Hansard, 5 March 1991, page 1346), will he cause a search to be made of the law reports to identify subsequent cases before (a) the High Court of Australia, (b) the Federal Court of Australia and (c) a State Supreme Court in which the Government and a State Labor Government have advanced contrary arguments. Mr DutTy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have caused the earlier searches to be extended to include the most recently published volume of The Australian Law Reports, namely Volume 107. The Australian Law Reports contain reports of cases not only in.the High Court and Federal Court but also in State Supreme Courts exercising federal jurisdiction. They do not contain reports of all of decisions of State Supreme Courts, but cases in which the Commonwealth is a .party are in federal jurisdiction. The search identified the five cases hereunder mentioned and I have added references to another two cases argued but not yet decided. I cannot, however, give an assurance that the information provided is exhaustive of the class of cases specified in the question. Mellifont v Attorney-General (Queensland) (1991) 104 ALR 89; 173 CLR 289 MCKain v RW Miller and Co (South Australia) Pty Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 257 Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v State Bank of New South Wales (1992) 105 ALR 161 South Australia v Commonwealth (1992) 105 ALR 171 Accident Compensation Tribunal v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 105 ALR 427 State Public Services Federation; Ex parte Attorney-General for Western Australia (heard before the High Court on 2-4 June 1992) State Public Services Federation; Ex parte Attorney-General for Queensland (heard before the High Court on 2-4 June 1992) Meat Inspection Service (Question No. 1808) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: (1) Between answers to questions Nos 333 (Hansard, 5 March 1991, page 1342) and 1331 (Hansard, 18 August 1992, page 80) what were the (a) dates, (b) places and (c) modes of consultations which the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service had with (i) the Queensland and (ii) Western Australian Governments to advance the policy of achieving a single inspection service for all meat, both export and domestic. (2) When and where will the next consultations take place.",123
196,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) inspects all meat at export establishments in Queensland and Western Australia, which is intended for consumption within Australia. The Queensland and Western Australian Governments have responsibility for the provision of meat inspection services at domestic establishments in those States. (i) (a) (b) & (c) AQIS, on the 24 June 1991, corresponded with the Queensland Government Minister for Primary Industries offering its comments on domestic meat inspection arrangements in Queensland. The Queensland Government, however, has chosen to transfer meat inspection from the Department of Primary Industries to the Livestock and Meat Authority of Queensland. This decision took effect on 8 August 1992. (ii) (a) (b) & (c) AQIS and the Western Australian Health Department hold annual consultative meetings, the last on 11 February 1992 in Perth. The issue has not progressed beyond this stage. Additionally there are on-going informal meetings between AQIS and the Health Departments at a local level. (2) A single national meat inspection service remains a policy of the Government. Given Queensland's domestic meat inspection was recently restructured, AQIS has no specific consultations planned with the State at this time. The next annual consultative meeting with the Western Australian Health Department is expected to occur in the first quarter of 1993. Developments in domestic meat inspection arrangements are subject to examination on a regular basis by the recently formed Domestic Meat Industry Advisory Committee (DMIAC), an advisory committee to AQIS which meets on an approximately quarterly basis, and includes representatives of the Queensland and Western Australian meat inspection authorities. The next meeting of DMIAC is scheduled to be held on 9 November 1992. Shipwrecks (Question No. 1820) Mr Shack asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 20 August 1992: (1) Have any vessels. that were sunk off the coast of Australia during World War II been added to the Register of Historic Shipwrecks; if so, in each case what is its (a) class, (b) type, (c) identification number and (d) nationality. (2) At whose request was each vessel referred to in part (1) added to the Register and on what date. (3) Has permission been sought for the exploration of the vessels referred to in part (1); if so, in each case (a) which vessel, (b) who sought permission, (c) on what date was permission sought and (d) was permission granted. Ms Fatin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The following vessels, sunk off the coast of Australia during World War II, have been added to the Register of Historic shipwrecks: AHSCentaur (Qld) (a) Requisitioned motor passenger vessel (b) Hospital - hip (c) 147275 (d) British, chartered by the Royal Australian Navy Uribes (WA) (a) Munitions storage vessel (b) Wooden schooner (c) Unknown (d) Australian SS Cambridge. (Vic) (a) Merchant vessel (b) TwinÂ· screw steamer (c) 71571 (d) British Submarine 1-124 (NT) (a) 1-121 Class (b) Type KRS ocean going mine laying submarine (c) 1-124 (d) Japanese (2) AHS Centaur-Gazetted 31 October 1990 at request of Mr BC Robert of Cool urn and the Queensland Museum. Uribes-Gazetted on 12 March 1982 at the request of the Western Australian Museum. SS Cambridge-Gazetted 011 1 August 1989 at the request of the Hon Tom Roper MLA. Submarine 1-124-Gazetted on 12 July 1977 at the request of Senator Kilgariff and the Japanese Government. (3) Under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, a distinction is made between access to historic shipwrecks, which is unrestricted except for a small number of wrecks in protected zones, and 'exploring' (ie disturbing) wreck sites, which requires a permit. AHS Centaur-The exact location of the Centaur is not known and no permission has been sought to explore it. Uribes-The site is often visited as part of the Rottnest Island Wreck Trail. No permission has been sought to explore it. SS Cambridge-No permission has been sought to explore the Cambridge. (a) Submarine 1-124-A protected zone of 200 hectares, having the wreck as its centre, has been declared. A permit is required to enter any purpose. The Australian Government respects the view of the Japanese Government that the submarine should not be disturbed in any .way. (b),(c),(d) (i) The Darwin Sub Aqua Club sought permission on 13 September 1979. Permission was granted but the dive did not eventuate. (ii) The Darwin Sub Aqua Club sought permission on 17 March 1981. Permission was not granted and the application lapsed. (iii) The Department of Defence (Navy Office) sought permission on 25 May 1984 to check reports of mines on the deck which would pose a hazard to navigation. Permission was granted. No mines were found. (iv) Mr M MCCarthy sought permission on 9 December 1988. Permission was granted but subsequently revoked. (v) Mr DC Tomlinson sought permission on' 4 July 1989. Permission was not granted and the application lapsed. (vi) The Darwin Sub Aqua Club sought permission on 20 November 1991. Permission was not granted and the application lapsed. Rural Access Program (Question No. 1828) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 8 September 1992: Who was (a) appointed or (b) maintained in employment during the 1991-92 financial year under the Rural Access Program, and in each case (c) where were they located and (d) what cost was involved. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (a) (b) The names of persons appointed or maintained in employment by recipients of grants under the Rural Access Program (RAP) are not requested from grantees. All applicants are. asked, however, to provide other details about the personnel component of their project, including award rate applied and number of hours to be worked, if applicable, in the proposed budget for their project. (c)(d) In the 1991/92 financial year 161 projects including employment were supported. Of the total funding of $1 519572 for these projects, the salary component was $764 083.
