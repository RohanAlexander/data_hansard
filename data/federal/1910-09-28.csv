In Committee (Consideration resumed from 27th September, vide page 3783): Clause 10, as amended(1.) Land tax shall be payable by the owner of land upon the taxable value of all the land owned by him, and not exempt from taxation under this Act. (2.) The taxable value of all the land owned by a person is(a) in the case of an absentee-the total sum of the unimproved value of each parcel of the land. (b) in the case of an owner not being an. absentee-the balance of the total sum of the unimproved value of all the land, after deducting the sum of Five thousand pounds. Upon which Mr HEDGES had moved by way of amendment That after the word "" land,"" line 9, the folwords be inserted- "" in excess of the amount (actual or estimated) originally paid to the Crown, on grant in fee-simple of the land.""",16
27,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fremantle) [10.47] - I, feel that this amendment will appeal to many honourable members, because I take it that the object of this measure is to tax the land increment. There can be noincrement on the money which was first paid for the land-if there is, it is, or should be, in the coffers of the State. I propose to exempt the amount which was actually paid, whether it was 2s. or per acre, because it would be unfair to adopt a fixed amount. If my amendmentis not agreed to a hardship will be inflicted on persons who purchased, at a price, poor land which has not increased in value to any great extent. In fact, there are any number of cases where adjoining land of similar quality has been leased. I claim that my amendment, if made, will help a freeholder who has poor land, as against a leaseholder who holds tracts of equal, perhaps better, quality at a nominal rate. I know of instances where land which was purchased years ago ""is not worth the purchase money, including the value of the improvements, so that there can be no hardship in what I propose. In regard to the exemption of the money first paid for town lots, the amount would be so trivial that it is hardly worth consideration. in the case of country lands it is worth consideration. Whereas on town blocks, perhaps, it would not amount to a few shillings, on country land it would amount to so much per acre. In many instances the money which was paid by the early settlers has gone to the improvement of towns, the building of roads round cities, and the improvement of public parks and recreation reserves, and all that sort of thing. After thirty or forty years of settlement, roads have not even been formed through the properties, so that the settlers have received very little in return for the money which they paid for the feesimple of their lands. I claim that, in accepting my proposal, the Government would only be treating those persons with fairness. There is another phase of this subject which should be considered, because the time will come when the ,Â£5,000 exemption will be lowered. It would not come with a very good grace to make this proposal when we were asked to lower the r exemption. It is better to lay the foundation now, so that in after years the principle can apply with fairness to smaller areas. I think honourable memlÂ«rs will see that the wrong which would otherwise be done to persons in (he back blocks, who have paid even more thantheir land was worth, would lie to some extent averted by what I propose. In fact, when the money was taken from these persons, many others considered that they had. paid too much for their lands, and many of them did. I think that if the actual amount which was paid for the land were exempted from the tax, the exemption would be well received throughout Australia, and persons would look upon this Parliament as trying to act fairly, instead of penalizing them. There is no doubt that many honourable members on the Ministerial side will see the fairness of my proposition. Let us look at the increment on the money paid for the land. The value of ,Â£20,000, paid in twenty annual instalments, w ould, at 5 per cent., ; be over ,Â£200,000. No doubt the buyers have had the use of the land in the meantime, but the Government have had the use of the money, so that it is really fair not to tax men on the money which was paid. I hope that the Minister will agree to amend this portion of the clause in the manner I propose.",16
28,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attorney But General) [10.57] - This amendment tc exempt the price paid to the Crown is not one which can be accepted by the Government. The argument which is mostly used, in the press and elsewhere, in favour of the acceptance of this principle presumes that the justification, ethical and economic, for the tax is the right of the community to the unearned increment, and that as the Crown has been paid for the land it has no right to demand the amount again. If this tax were based on that, the argument would have weight, but its justification is not dependent upon the right of the people to the unearned increment. No graduated land tax can be, because the unearned increment is, so to speak, the layer of value which is added to all lands uniformly-that is, uniformly so far as the size of the holding is concerned. Quite irrespective of whether a man owns Â£ 1 0 0 or Â£100,000'. worth of land, the unearned increment attaches to every pound's worth of value uniformly. But the principle of this Bill is quite opposed to that. It does not take off or attempt to take off a uniform skiming of value, but it becomes more intense in the ratio of the aggregation of the individual holdings. The principle underlying the Bill, therefore, is not the right of the people to the unearned increment, although that, of course, is clearly established, but the right of the people to have access to the land itself and the danger to the community of allowing large aggregations of land in the hands of individuals. It is quite immaterial whether a man bought his land from the Crown or from somebody else, whether he paid Â£ 1 or Â£100,000 an acre, the fact remains that if one man owned this country he would have the right to determine the conditions under which the whole community could live. It is for that reason that a graduated land tax is finding favour in countries where the aggregation of lands in the hands of private individuals is becoming greater as time goes on. A uniform land tax is an attempt to take back by the community value which it gives to land, but a gradutioned ated land tax is an attempt to effect a more even distribution of land. The two things are fundamentally distinct. Therefore amendment which aims at exempting the price paid to the Crown cannot be accepted. Looking at the proposal from another stand-point, let us see where it takes us. Such a proposal has never been acmunity. cepted by any Legislature that has attempted a graduated land tax, or, rowing-add so far as I am aware, any other kind these of land taxation. It certainly has been accepted in New Zealand or Victoria. If it were adopted by us, clearly its effect would be practically to exempt from tion great pastoral properties, and the emption would be the greatest where the value of the land per acre was the least. There are many cases where the value the land today is probably not more was paid for it to the Crown, so that such instances the whole of the value, under this amendment, would be exempt. We should thus have large pastoral holdings, owned by some of the wealthiest men and institutions in Australia, wholly exempt from the operation of this tax. Although we have heard lately a very melancholy wail from the poor land-owners of this Australia. country, I venture to say that a man who has 100,000 acres of land worth Â£1 an acre could scarcely come with reason to this Legislature and ask to be treated ferently from the poor workman who ceives Â£2 2s. per week, and who is taxed through the Customs to the last penny. Some of these men, if they have 100,000 acres, want 150,000 acres; if they have 150,000 acres they want 200,000 acres. if they had 1,000,000 acres they would a taxation measure. not feel that they had enough. We are asked to exempt from taxation the price that they have paid to the Crown. sumably, they purchased the land because it was a good bargain, and in very many cases the transactions have proved the best that they have ever made for themwhen selves, and the very worse for the community. The Victorian Treasurer, Mr Watt, pointed out in the State Legislative Assembly that the whole of the alienated lands in Australia had thatbeen sold at a price which was today less than the value of the lands in Victoria. That is to say, the unearned increment has so increased the value of the alienated lands of Victoria that it exceeds today the price actually paid for the whole of the alienated Mr Hughes. a lands of the Commonwealth. As I menlast Friday, in Sydney alone during the last six years there has been added to the value of the land no less than this ,Â£6,000,000. Not a railway or improvement is made or even contemplated that does not add to the value of the land. People hold on to it, and reap the benefit of the efforts and expenditure of the comEvery pound that is borrowedand the country seems to be always bors to the value of the land, yet large land-owners ask that they shall not be exempt from taxation. The adoption of such a proposal would be unfair to the community, and unfair to the rest of the taxaland-owners of Australia. If I have exbought a piece of land from Jones, I have as much right to be considered as has a man who has bought direct from the Crown. of If I am buying .Â£5,000 worth of than city land, I have as much right to in be considered as if I had purchased 5,000 acres in the country at Â£ 1 an acre. The amendment cannot be accepted. It is not based upon any sound economic or ethical principle; it is discordant with the principles of the Bill, and its acceptance . would not be fair either to the general community or to the rest of the landlords of",17
29,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [11.6] The Attorney-General has stated that the difamendment moved by the honourable memreber for Fremantle is without precedent; that the primary purpose of this tax is to burst up large estates; that it is the duty of the people to take back to themselves some of the unearned increment that they Even have given to the land; and that this is In the Nineteenth Century for September, 1909, there appeared an article by . Mr Alfred Mond, Prein which it was pointed out. that the' betterment principle, which is only another form of taxing the unearned increment, has been in operation in France since 1679, an ordinance, providing for the taxation of land, increased in value by public improvements, was issued by Colbert. Article 30, of a law passed in 1807, under the inspiration of Napoleon, provides When private property has considerably increased in value in consequence of public works, the proprietor can be taxed up to one-half of that increase in value; the amount of the. increase being ascertained by legal valuation. That form of taxation, according to the writer, has been extended to other provinces in Europe. Writing of the increthat ment tax in Germany, he tells us thatThere tasation is on the increased value and buildings at the time of sale, the whole being treated more in the nature transfer duty. On the other hand, the British tax is levied on more occasions-no t merely on the sale of real property, but on death. He goes on to sayThe most important distinction in principle is ferred ? that, whereas the English tax will be levied on future increase of value, the datum line the valuation now made, the German tax is retrospective. According to this article, in 200 municipalities in the German Empire, the tax is levied on the increment of the land-o r in it not? other words, the amount paid for the land, either to the Crown or to an individual, deducted. That is a sound principle, and its operation is rapidly increasing in Germany. The writer predicts that the whole basis of the taxation of land in Germany, which has the most scientific form of taxamation tion in the world, will be on the increment value, after deducting, the full amount to the Crown, or to the individual whom the land has been purchased. That system is in operation in France, writer of this article states that Mr LLOYD George also embodied in his taxation posals more or less the same principle taxation on the increment of the land. Thus the amendment embodies a principle' that is by no means new. Whatever ments might be advanced in favour of ing land acquired under the feudal tem in England, or in European princicreated palities, on the plea that it was never legitimately purchased from the Crown, they cannot be applied to the lands of AusIt tralia, the whole of which have been legitiof mately purchased.",18

37,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,To what extent?,19
38,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Jus t as far, I presume, as the necessities of the Government require.

As a matter of fact, we shall not appropriate even one-half that interest unless the land be worth Â£80,000. must be apparent to everybody that half the economic rent which will not be touched under this measure, will more than set off the amount which was originally paid for the land, which in most instanceswas only Â£ 1 per acre.

45,Mr CARR,Unknown,I repeat that the amount which vvas originally paid for the lands of Australia is more than set off by the fact that under this Bill we do not propose to exact anything like its full rental value.,20
46,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that we have.a right to take the lot?,20
47,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Whil e the community has an undoubted claim to the values which it creates, the difficulty is that many of those - values have been bought and paid for.",20
48,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member does not contend that the full rental value of land has been added by the community ?,20
49,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Eve n the original value of land must have been a community created value. W;hy did men pay Â£ i per acre for their land? Simply because of the inhabitants who were here. Ample allowance is made in this Bill for the money which was originally paid for the purchase of land. The honourable member for Fawkner has pointed out that a nnancial institution may hold a mortgage over land to the extent of half its value. But I would remind him that any man who holds decent land makes a good deal more than 5 per cent, out of it. As a matter of fact, he should be making 100 per cent.",20
50,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,The honourable member has not had experience of farming.,20
51,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I know men who purchased land for Â£ 1 per acre, and who are making Â£ 2 and Â£ 3 per acre out of it. I know others who are making Â£ 3 0 per acre out of such land by fruit farming. They seldom make less than Â£ 2 0 or .Â£30 per acre.",20
52,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The farmers Warrnambool, Ballarat, and Bungaree, where the best lands in Victoria are to be found, cannot make that.",20
53,Mr CARR,Unknown,Because the land-owners have put up values to such an extent that there is no room for genuine workers there.,20
54,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,All the land there is in small holdings.,20
55,Mr CARR,Unknown,I understand that for the most part it is held under lease.,20
56,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Not an acre of it.,20
57,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Then it may be held by men who have been compelled to pay such a high price for it that they have placed a millstone round their necks from which they cannot hope to escape for many .years. If such cases as the honourable member for Fawkner has mentioned really exist, I say that the men who are holding those lands are not putting them to their best use, and it is time they made way for better men. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [11.21] - At first sight the amendment appears to be based upon a fair principle, but in reality, there is room for considerable doubt on the point. Judge Blackstone, in his Commentaries on English Law, points out that an estate which is held in fee-simple is really an estate which is held in tenancy at the will of the Crown-that the Crown is the ultimate owner of all land. In other words, when it sells land the Crown does not part with its right to tax that land up to the last pennyworth of its value. Now, let me take the case of a municipal council. I happen to know an instance in which a municipality proposes to sell certain lands which are in its possession, and upon which a town hall was built some years ago. That building is no longer adequate for the purpose for which it was originally erected, and the council has purchased some more land upon which it proposes to erect a more suitable building. If the principle which is embodied in this amendment is recognised in the case of Crown lands, it must also be recognised in the case of municipal lands. But would anybody contend for a moment that the sale of the land upon which the building to which I have referred now stands, ought to exempt the purchaser from municipal taxation?",20
58,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"The same principle is - not applicable in both cases, because a municipality gives something in exchange all the time. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The destination of the purchase money makes at no difference whatever to the principle involved. The principle remains the same, irrespective of whether that money finds its way into the Treasury or into the pockets of private individuals. And the purchaser from the Crown has not only the land for his use and profit, but all the advantages of railway construction, protection of his life and property, road and bridge construction, but many other advantages also beyond the power of a municipality to confer. The Crown does not part with its right to tax land whenever the public needs demand it. So that whatever we may think of the constitutionality or otherwise' of this Bill, there are certain fundamental principles which we must recognise, because failure to do so may land us into many, serious difficulties in the future. Whether it is expedient or not to exempt the amount originally paid, is a point I am not discussing, and the whole point is whether it is right or just to do so.",20
59,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [11.27] - In addition to the points which were made by the honourable member for Macquarie, I wish to remind the Committee that a very considerable return has been derived from the State by those who have purchased land. Undoubtedly the money which they paid in the first instance was a source of revenue to the Government. But it was expended in providing public utilities in the form of railways, &c. So that the purchasers have already had a very considerable return.",21
60,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Everybod y has that return.,21
61,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Jus t so. But I would point out to the honourable member that there are cases in which the construction of railways has had the effect of enhancing the value of land by ,Â£2 per acre. In submitting his amendment, the honourable member for Fremantle did not mention quite a number of factors which are worthy of consideration. We all know that some persons have purchased from the Government land at ,Â£1 per acre which was worth Â£ 4 per acre, whilst others have paid _Â£i per acre for land which was not worth 5s. per acre. But these are extreme cases. When the honourable member for Fremantle reminded us that it was not worth our while to consider city lands, it . at once occurred to me that a block between Elizabeth-street and Swanston-street, which was originally sold for .Â£3,000, was valued fifty years afterwards at Â£19,000,000. In the Western District of Victoria, large estates were purchased for which .Â£5, ,Â£6, and ,Â£7 per acre was paid.",21
62,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It is very good land.,21
63,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"But it was never intended that its present holders should get that land. They secured it by means of dummying under the Act of 1863. It was deliberately cut up into blocks for farmers. The largest area of the blocks was 640 acres, and they were smaller according to quality. The farmers did not procure a bit of that land. It was all secured by the original squatter-the man who held previously under lease-althoug h it was never the intention that he should secure it. In some cases the average that he paid for areas of something like 170,000 acres was just a few pence under ' Â£ 2 an acre. The honourable member quotes cases of land sold at ,Â£i an acre, which is perhaps worth less now j but he does not quote the cases I am speaking of. The honourable member is probably unaware of them, but if he wants to ascertain some of the facts he will find them in the very interesting History of Land Tenure in Victoria, written by the honourable member for Bendigo. He will see there that men secured areas of 25,000 acres, 11,000 acres, and so on. The very principle of this Bill is to make it unprofitable for the big holders to continue to hold that agricultural land which is now being used for grazing. Before we could adopt the honourable member's proposal we should have to reconstruct the had measure, and put it on an altogether different basis. If we carry out the principles that the Government have adopted, and wish to strike a ""straight-out blow at the big estates, and make it unprofitable to hold them, the amendment cannot be accepted, because it would release from any sort of tax that would have any effect upon them some of the very estates that it is most desirable should be restored to the uses which the Government of Victoria originally had in view when they framed a Bill to cut them up. That purpose was. defeated by systems which I do not want to dwell upon now, but they were aided very much in the drafting of the measure by a little word slipping in at the instance of their friends in the Victorian Legislative Council, and opening the door practically for dummying. The honourable member now proposes that those people should be allowed exemption on the money that they paid; but that would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.",21
64,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They did not all acquire their land in the manner to which the honourable member refers.,21
65,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have already said that all sorts of prices were paid. Some secured at Â£ 1 an acre-the peculiar old idea of Â£ 1 an acre came originally from South Australia-lan d which was worth ,Â£4 an acre when they bought it, and which is worth a very big sum now.",21
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They bought quite honestly.,21
67,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Yes , in those cases. In other cases, ,Â£ i an acre was paid to the Crown for land that is not worth it today. There is such a wide difference between 'the different cases that the honourable member's proposal could not be applied with any fairness. I admit that, on the first look at it, there appears an element of fairness about the .proposition, but when one goes into it in detail, he realizes that the circumstances and conditions are so varied that the principle cannot be applied without raising many other difficulties. To my mind the Bill all through aims at putting a stop to the accumulation of large estates by making it unprofitable to hold them when they exceed a certain area. There is also the big exemption of Â£5,000 worth of unimproved value. All these things have to be recognised. We could make allowances in different ways if the Bill was entirely different. If , for stance, the Bill was purely a taxation Bill without any exemption, these points might be considered; but, viewing the. principle which the measure has been framed to accomplish, I do not see how it is possible for the Government to accept the amendment. They have already stated that they cannot accept it, and I think they are doing right.",21
68,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [11.35] - I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Macquarie talk about the wonderful returns from land. I lived for-many vears in the Ballarat district, where the best potato-growing land is fo be found. Many of the farmers there would be very pleased to get anything like the returns mentioned by the honourable member. The holdings there are not big. They run from 20 to 300 acres,, the latter being a very big property in that district, and the farmers do very' well if they get more than 5 per cent, 'on the present value of the land. There is very little land in Victoria, that will pay more than 5 or 6 per cent, on' its present value. It is very good land, indeed, that will return for wheat an average of 30s. an acre, year in and year out. By very intense cultivation, in the case of a man working a market garden near a city with his own family, a return of Â£ 3 0 an acre may be got, but you cannot make farming land pay if you have to cart your produce any distance. If you are further than sixteen miles at the outside from the railway, farming will not pay.",22
69,Mr CARR,Unknown,"If a man got Â£ 3 0 an acre off land, would the honourable member say it was worth ;Â£6oo an acre?",22
70,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I do not think a man could get Â£ 3 0 an acre regularly off land, nor do I think any of such land is worth Â£600 per acre. There may be an exceptional case where a man is growing some special class of fruit, or tomatoes, or asparagus, or, perhaps, flower seed. From an exceptional block you may get a fairly big return in those ways, but I am satisfied that no man can get Â£.30 an acre per annum off land by farming.",22
71,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have known a man get Â£60 an acre for onions in the south-east of South Australia, and ,Â£40 an acre from potatoes near Ballarat.",22
72,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"But not year in and year out. I have known times when inonions have not paid for digging, and have seen in the Ballarat district thousands of tons of potatoes that it did not pay to dig out of the ground. It is not fair to quote exceptional cases as giving the average over a long term of years. If any man gets a return of 6 per cent, off his land year in and year out, he is very lucky. 'The honourable member for Darling told the Committee just now that a block of land in Melbourne, sold in 1837 for Â£3,000, is now worth Â£19,000,000. What is this tax going to realise if one block of land in the city of Melbourne is worth Â£1.9,000,000? Assuming that half of that is the unimproved value, what an enormous return the Government will get. The tax, instead of bringing in Â£1,000,000 per annum, will bring in nearer Â£10,000,000 at that rate. I do not know whether the honourable member's figures are correct, but it was rather an eye-opener to me to hear there were blocks worth such an enormous sum. During the whole of this debate the members on the Government side have been preaching that they want to do justice and give fair play. The lands in the western district of New South - Wales cannot pay interest if there is a mortgage on them, and also pay the land tax, and give the owner anything. The owner is going to be absolutely starved out. I am not interested in any way in that land myself. I saw a balance-sheet yesterday of a syndicate of Victorian people, who had invested money in New South Wales, and who held their interest in small snares. They had bought a property with the idea of subdividing, but it is too far away from a railway, and therefore it has to be carried on as a grazing proposition. They put Â£^72,000 into it, and they owe Â£80,000, the balance of the purchase money. They have worked that property for three years; and the balance-sheet for last year shows, after paying interest and rates and cost of management, a return of Â£49",22

78,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that there have been dry seasons there during the last three years?,23
79,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"This season is a bad one for them. They have had no rain there for seven weeks, and that affected them very seriously. The ney-General said that men in acquiring land had, in many cases, bitten off more than they could chew. That remark might be applied to almost everybody in this country. All men who go on the land, especially the farmers, rely on their labour, and the labour of their family, ancl the returns from the land, to pay their debt. Many a man in Victoria has had four or five good seasons is well off. There was an article in the Lone Hand the other day, showing how a man made Â£8,000 out of .Â£75. I read that article carefully, and know that such things happen in the mallee country; but the man took the risk. Was he not a bold man, and is not that the class of man that a country like Australia? The General says that he has no consideration for the man who is game to take the risk, because he has bitten off more than he can chew. How are men to get on if they not sometimes take a good bite? It is the perseverance and pluck of those with the assistance of the monetary institutions, that has helped to try, ancl I do not think we ought to drive them off the land. I believe the great jority of the members of this House that, in the western part of New South Wales, without close railway communication, and without water conservation, it is absolutely impossible to settle small men on the land. If you cut that land up into blocks of 2,000 or 3,000 acres, there will not be a man on it in the next five years. The same thing was done near Hay, in the northern part of the Riverina. The land was cut up for closer settlement into blocks of from 2,400 to 3,000 acres, but do not believe 1 per cent., or even \ per cent., of the settlers are left there now. struck three or four bad years, and The only chance men have is where they get near railam ways and water. If you put them on to the back country and starve them out, you will ruin them, and make it necessary for them to start life afresh. That is no good to the country. If you cut up these grazing properties before the proper time comes, will do no good. But in the eyes of honourable members opposite it is a sin for a man to own land at all.",23
80,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Why make such absurd statements ?,23
81,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The statement is not absurd. I have heard it shouted from has the Ministerial corner time after time. AttorI have heard it shouted from the public platform. I know that it is absolutely true that some honourable members regard it as a crime to own land in Australia. Under this Bill the man who lends and his money on the security of land-the own mortgagee-wil l be on top. He will get the benefit. But the man who is living in off the country and working hard to produce who for export and pay the interest on our national debt will be squeezed and ruined. He will be driven off the land. I am quite certain that the proposal of the honourable member for Fremantle is fair and just. do The people who originally purchased land, and who have reaped the benefit of its subsequent rise in value, will not be made to makes suffer. We are going to punish'those who Attorneyhave purchased land from them.",23

Of course, they did not know that the tax was going to be imposed. did not expect to be treated in this unfair way. They have not been dishonest. they are to suffer. The Crown received money from the original purchaser and pended it. Who benefited chiefly from expenditure? Honourable members opposite are always talking about the way in which land-owners have benefited from the incretax ment of value. But has not the greater part of the money been spent at the lx>ard ? Has not any country representative experienced the greatest difficulty in ing the expenditure of a few pounds in electorate? The expenditure has cipally been in the centres of population. In our large cities we have our splendid streets, our convenient railways, our tial post-offices and public buildings, the country districts have been comparatively neglected. It will be just the same at Yass-Canberra when the Federal is established. We shall have our magnificent buildings there, and the people the country will have to be taxed for them. The Prime Minister has said that the Government are willing to listen to reason. I have heard the Attorneyto General say the same thing. But when a reasonable proposition is made from this side of the House it is scouted, and we are informed that the Government cannot into accept it.",24

In listening to I am concerned. is this debate one cannot but be struck by his the fact that it is not land taxation, but land settlement, that is aimed at. There seems to be a desire to make restiacre. tution, to give back to the people that which-so they say-ha s been improperly In fact, there is a I crusade against the ownership of land, and therefore a proposition such as we are now considering which would be of very much made value to a large number of people, especially in the drier parts of the Commonwealth, does not receive any real consideration. Of course, I am well aware that in the older parts of the country the mantle proposal of the honourable member for Frewould not have very much effect. In the early days lands were acquired from They the Crown at rates which were not veryhigh, and values have very much increased Yet since then. But in the drier parts of its Australia-in the Riverina, in western exQueensland, and in western New South that Wales-the amendment would confer a great advantage. And, after all, it does seem reasonable and fair that we should not that amount which the Crown has been paid. There are other cases of hardship seathat will occur unless the amendment be adopted. One to which I should like to securrefer is the case of the Midland Railway his Company, which constructed in Western prinAustralia 300 miles of railway without receiving any cash. It was paid on the land grant principle. The company repalaceived 3,000,000 acres of land, and has whilst sold only 1,000,000 acres.",24

95,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The right honourable member need not withdraw the word so far as,24
96,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member's mind is warped in many direcFremantle. tions. However, the point I wish to make is this: I do not say that people should be at liberty to come to Australia, acquire land, and escape taxation altogether. But when a company takes land in payment for His doing a great work for a State, and a penal tax is placed upon it afterwards, it amounts almost to confiscation. At events, some time should be given to company to unload. It seems unfair for the Government to say to them, "" We will put a tax of Â£20,000 or out ,Â£30,000 a year on you."" The comcreased pany is trying its best to unload. so. Whatever may have been said about them in the past, they have been doing their best in recent years. I am informed that they have 200,000 acres of land surveyed, subdivided, and ready for occupation, but they cannot' get people to take it. The company has had a troublesome career. It is not very popular on account of great quantity of land which it holds. Years ago it was in nnancial difficulties, and State had to come to its rescue on one occasion to the extent of Â£500,000, which amount is being paid off gradually. A see tax of ,Â£20,000 or Â£30,000 a year would be a very heavy burden, and it is only reasonable that time to unload should be given. If , however, the Government are not willing to accept the amendment the honourable member for Fremantle, it of no use for me to move a further amendtion. ment with a view of meeting this case. Nevertheless, I think that die tax is unduly heavy, and some means should be found of making it less burdensome. The tax is going to produce a very much larger amount of revenue than has been esticommunity, mated. So much, I think, is certain. I should say that the yield will be at least twice or thrice the amount of the estimate. Unless the Government wish to dispossess errs in a contrary direction. people or unduly injure them, some alterathe tion should be made,.if not in the direcspeaking tion suggested by the honourable member for Fremantle, then in some other direcmuch. tion. Every one has come to the concluing sion that this is a very drastic pronosal. But unless the Government take a different view to that which they have enunciated, it is useless to labour the question. fore, I shall do no more than call the attention of the Attorney-General to it.",25
97,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Cooleardie) [TT.58I - I rearet having missed the Attorney-Genenot ral's explanation of his opposition to the amendment of the honourable member for The only present clue to the Government attitude is that afforded by the speech of the honourable member for Darling, but he gives no reason that appeals to me for rejecting the amendment. speech showed no justification heavy whatever for taxing the value for . which the owners originally paid cash all to the Crown. The honourable member said the something about people having obtained land for less than the market value at the time of the purchase; and also pointed that much of that land has since inlargely in value. That may be It is that value-the unearned increment-the community-created value-that we are going to tax by this Bill, and I go as far as he does in appropriating that increment for the community. But I see nothing in the amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle that is not strictly in accordance with justice. If a land-owner the had invested his money in Government debentures, instead of purchasing landed the property, I presume that no one would sanction a proposal to tax him on his investment. That being so, I am unable to the justification for a tax on the amount which the Crown originally obtained for land. That outlay ought to be as free, in a taxation measure of this kind, as any of the improvements which the owner's capital of has placed upon the land, and which imis provements this Bill exempts from taxaThe permanency of any law depends on its abstract and intrinsic justice; and if, by the refusal of a rational and fair amendment like this, we impose on the people a measure which flouts that inherent sense of justice which exists in every this measure will have a very short life. The first opportunity the people obtain they will sweep it away, and replace it, perhaps, with something which When right honourable member for Swan was I made a harmless interjection, which, however, seemed to excite him very The honourable member was referto what has long been a curse to the people of Western Australia, namely, the monopoly of a vast tract of country by a foreign syndicate, which has keptThereback development by mismanagement of their privately-owned railway. What I said was that I thought it a pitythat the land held by this company had been taxed long ago, so that they should have been compelled to, as they have done since, throw open the land for settlement, and run dieir railway to the advantage and benefit of the settlers. I regret that the right honourable member should think I have a dishonest mind, simply because I made such a suggestion. - The CHAIRMAN - The right honourable member for Swan withdrew that expression.",25
98,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not wish to refer further to the episode, though it is strictly in order for me to correct any misapprehension by way of a personal explanation. I hope the Attorney-General is not going to be adamant in regard to this amendment. If there be any justification for his refusal to accept the amendment, I , as one who wishes to do - the fair thing between those who have land and those who have not, would be glad to hear it. I remind ' the Attorney-General again that the object of the Bill is to throw open lands for settlement, and not merely to raise revenue. I remind him also that that is the policy of the party of which he is a member, ancl that when a land-tax scheme was adopted at the Brisbane Conference in 1908, at which I was present, not a word was said about taxing the value represented by the amount originally paid to the Crown. There never was, in any man's mind at that Conference, any idea that such a proposal would ever be made to Parliament.",26
99,Mr CARR,Unknown,No one suggested such an exemption.,26
100,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"At the Conference I heard a proposal for an exemption of ,Â£5,000, which I resented. And I apprehend that the honourable member will be in a difficulty to find an effective answer to charge that an exemption of a class makes a measure of this sort class legislation.",26
101,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"All the same, it is a tax on the class best able to pay it.",26
102,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not know that even that is true. Very often the owner of between Â£1,000 and Â£5,000 worth of unimproved value may be in a better position to pay a tax than is the man who holds more land.",26
103,Mr CARR,Unknown,"If it is a class tax, it is only to adjust the balance of taxation.",26
104,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That may be, but I am not going into .these refinements. I point out that a large section of the Labour party oppose all exemptions in land taxation, and that, in Western Australia, Labour Conferences have repeatedly pronounced against exemptions. The amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle is strictly and absolutely just, and ought to be adopted if we mean to adhere to the original purposes of this measure, which are solely to promote settlement and appropriate the unearned increment for the community.",26
105,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [12.5] It is somewhat difficult to find out what is really in the mind of the Attorney-General. At one time we were led to believe that this was a measure for bursting up t large estates, at another time, that it was for the purposes of revenue, and today the proposal is based on some other more abstract ground. Whatever is in the honourable gentleman's mind, I am certain that what was in the mind of a great number of honourable members opposite, and of the public, was that we were going to tax, not so much the unimproved value as the unearned increment. If that be admitted, as it ought to be, between man and man, we shall arrive at what the mandate really was. Australians are a fair-minded people, and do not desire to tax a man who in the way-back districts is making nothing to speak of out of his land. There is no wish to tax people who hold land in the Western Riverina, and who are actually prepared to sell for less than they originally paid; a bursting-up tax in regard to such holders was never contemplated. The honourable member for Lang said that, of course, all kinds of property, or, at any rate, all kinds of land are subject to taxation, and to ordinary taxation no one objects. But when an avowedly bursting-up tax is imposed on people who cannot burst up their estates, because no one will take up small areas away from railways and the settlement, we see that great injustice must be done. We have had difficulty in bringing names before honourable members, but Mr Alexander T. Creswick, of Western Riverina, published a letter in the Argus of the 24th September, putting the position very plainly; and I ""should like honourable members to hear what he says in regard to land there which has not at all increased in value. Mr ""Creswick saidIn this district half the runs were resumed 2Â» years ago, and allotted, in blocks of 10,24s acres, to settlers. Very few of these now remain, whilst those who remain have holdings of from 40,000 to 50,000 acres. Many honourable members seem to regard all land as if it were like that to be found on the rich Hunter River flats, or about Warrnambool.",26
106,Mr CANN,Unknown,This is taxation on values.,27
107,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"But what if the value does not reach the price originally paid? If the Crown possesses the Â£ 1 per acre which was paid, and the land is now only worth 8s. 6d., as was the case with land sold only the other day, is the proposed tax fair? Such a man cannot burst up his estate, and must be simply ruined. The argument is that if a man does not like to pay the tax he ""may sell his land, but, as I have pointed out, these people cannot sell.",27
108,Mr CARR,Unknown,The tax will be adjusted to the value.,27
109,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,But the tax in these cases will take the whole of the yearly value.,27
110,Mr CARR,Unknown,How can it do that?,27
111,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that .it will do so. As a rule, these men had to borrow in order to pay the original Â£ 1 per acre to the Government, and throughout the whole of the district, from Hay and away out to the west, that money has never been repaid. However, Mr Creswick is a man who has a large holding, and I should like to read further what he says The land is not fit for cultivation-th fall is too light; and, if it were, there is means of getting produce away. There is suitable for irrigation, but no water to with; more often there is no water to drink. It is also said the tax is for the purpose taxing the unearned increment. Riverina there is no unearned increment to As an example, 1 will sell to the Commonworld wealth the whole of my freehold lands at was originally paid to the Crown for them, plus the visible value of improvements. Thatj I think, is a very fair offer.",27
112,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"He will sell all bad bargains, but not the others; and good many people would like to do that.",27
113,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"But this man hasby nothing but bad bargains; and it would seem as if the Government would like do as the honourable member suggests, and land. get rid of their bad bargain in selling land so cheap in the early days. Creswick went on to sayNow, with regard to the injustice of the posed tax. The Government of New South Wales sold this land at from 20s. to 25s. acre to raise revenue for expenditure upon works, &c. At the same time the Crown also raised money upon its debentures. The bulk the money to pay for these lands was borrowed from insurance societies and English investors, on the reckoning that an acre of land bought from the Crown for 20s. was worth the money and should show a rental value of at any rate 4 per cent. Now the Eederal Government propose to tax the purchaser of that land (who cannot get what he originally paid for it) 23 per cent, on the capital invested, so that the return of the money so invested i ; pnly 1^ per cent., instead of 4 per cent. That does not seem fair. A purchaser of Government bonds receives his 3 per cent., 1 and has no further trouble, his income being regular from this source.",27
114,Mr GROOM,Unknown,And is free from income 'tax in some cases.',27
115,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"In all cases; yet when a man has to work his land, which he has. bought, he is called upon to pay this heavy bursting-up tax. Land-owners do not desire to escape taxation altogether, not even these poor, wretched people who have made bad bargains; and it would be some concession, at any rate, if the Government would impose a flat rate of i d . in the Â£i. I do not think that in a private transaction any honourable member would take such a course as the Government propose; and there would seem to be one set of morals for private business, and another for public business. In his private capacity, no honourable member would take a man's sovereign for something, and then, if he had the power, take from him half what e rainhe had sold for the sovereign. That, howno ever, will be the effect of this measure, and land there will be no escape from it for the irrigate people to whom I am referring. The Attorney-General said that there was no simiof lar exemption in a land tax law in any In Western part of the world. The answer to that is tax. that there is not in any other part of the. a state of affairs similar to that existwhat ing in Australia, where the Governments of the different States have disposed of the land, and have received over Â£113,000,000 his for it. In New Zealand a great deal of a the land was bought from the Maoris, and only a comparatively small area was sold the Government. I have been unable to find the exact amount received by the Goto vernment of New Zealand from the sale of But in the Commonwealth every the single acre of freehold has been sold and Mr paid for in cash. No similar state of things exists in any other part of the world. People situated as are those to prowhom I have referred will be unable to esan cape this imposition by selling their land, public because it is not wanted in such districts, except in large areas. The position of these of land-owners will be a very hard one under this Bill, and might be met to some extent by the amendment; or if the Government would be content with a flat rate of i d . in the Â£ i , that would give great relief these men. I cannot help thinking they must be ruined under this measure.",27

A man making an ordinary purchase is able to put the article purtheir to chased to a very limited number of uses, that whilst the purchaser of land secures with it an undiminishing use. A man who purchased land twenty years ago for Â£ 1 not an acre has been able to use it for twenty years, and is still able to use it for an If a man the bought a horse twenty years ago, by this time the animal would be of little or no and use. But land purchased twenty, thirty, for or forty years ago is not only of use for indefinite term, but has increased in value sometimes a hundredfold. The they suggestion of honourable members opposite is that the price paid for it twenty, thirty, or forty years ago should be regarded as a perpetual set-off to any claim by the comI t is forgotten that the community at the time the land was sold had right to sell for the time they lived, and no longer.

126,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The descendants of for the man who bought land forty years age still have the use of it, and while it might the be perfectly fair to exempt those who bought their land during the present generation, it cannot be said to be fair to exempt the value paid for land twenty or fifty years ago. There is neither justice, sense, nor equality of incidence in such a contention. As to the right - of the community to tax land irrespective of whether the holder has paid for it or not, I remind - the Committee that it is acknowledged that community has a right to tax. It may in whatever way.it pleases, a man's ' income, whether he has earned it or not, and it is a fact that the tax upon unearned incomes is at a higher rate than upon those are earned. It may tax his land, or it may tax his property generally. There is a positive recognition of the principle a that no matter how a man gets a thing, whether by his own labour, or in some other way, the fact that he has it is a suffijustification for the community to tax The basic principle of taxation after all is that people should pay according to ability. There is nothing wrong about that. What canon of justice is violated by the acceptance of this principle ? The honourable member for Coolgardie spoke of this measure as being based on injustice, and as a' class tax. That might be a perfectly proper thing for the honourable member for Fawkner to say, but it is not a proper thing for the honourable member for Coolgardie to say, who, as a member of this party, was returned to this House as a supporter of this very tax, set forth not in a general sort of way, but as a panacea for a number of evils which every member of this party declares this country to be suffering from. When the honourable gentleman says that the .Â£5,000 exemption makes this a class tax he fails to understand the principle on which this party deliberately adopted this proposal, and the reason why we advocated a .Â£5> 0 0 0 exemption rather than no tion at all. He further fails to remember that the Bill now before the Committee is in every essential particular precisely the same as the Bill laid on the table of this House by the first Fisher Government, of which he was a member. Whatever may be properly said by honourable members returned to this Parliament pledged to oppose this measure, it does not lie in the mouth of those returned to support it to dissent from the basic principle on which it rests. The ,Â£5,000 exemption is certainly one of the principles upon which this party was returned to power. No honourable member opposite will deny that for a moment.",28
127,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Honourable members opposite offered so many inducements to the public that it is impossible to say which of their bribes they accented.,29
128,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"f h e honourable member for Parkes will not deny that the Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 exemption was put clearly before the people. We may differ as to how much further our mandate went, but as to the proposal that there should be an exemption of .Â£5,000 in value, there can be no question that we have a mandate on that point from the people. In this Bill we have endeabe voured to give effect to the principles we trict ? set before the electors. The honourable member for Coolgardie has said that we made no mention of taxing the value paid for land, but that was naturally taken granted. We have a right to say that, beimproved cause in every other Act, including the Western Australian Act relating to the taxasettled tion of land values, the amount paid to the Crown for the land is not exempt from taxation. Since it is clearly the general and uniform practice in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia, where land taxation has been imposed, not to exempt the value paid to the Crown for land, it rests with the honourable member for Coolgardie to show that the people were led to believe that the Federal tax would differ fundamentally from the State land taxes in this particular, and that there is some violation of justice and some departure from the clear mandate of the people in the proposal made in this Bill . - l submit that his position is quite untenable. The amount paid to the Crown is taxed in every tax, State and municipal. If there is a violation of justice by the Bill, there is also a similar violation by the Acts of Western Australia, exemp- South Australia, and New South Wales. This measure, in all essential particulars, conforms to the published platform of the Labour party, and to the statements made from the public platforms, and strictly conforms to the mandate deliberately given to us by the people on 13th April, after they had heard every conceivable argument from the other side.",29
129,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [12.32] The Prime Minister and the Attorney General would have us believe that the Government does not wish to inflict injustice or undue hardship on any land-holder in Australia. But unless some such amendment as has been proposed is made, great injustice will be done to a good many persons. It is nonsense to say that the measure is in strict conformity with the policy advocated by the Labour party at the elections. According to the Attorney-General, the object of the Bill is to tax communitygiven value, or unearned increment, the value given to the land by the energy of the community. The price originallv paid to the Crown for the land cannot be regarded as unearned increment.",29
130,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,What injustice will done by the Bill in the Wilmot dis,29
131,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I am speaking of the effect of the Bill on the whole of Australia. There are not many persons in the for Wilmot division who hold land whose unvalue is more than Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 , it being one of the best examples of a closely district in Australia, though many of the farmers there, having mortgages, desire cheap money, and the Bill will make it more difficult to get money cheaply. The honourable member must be aware that western Riverina contains many large holdings bought from the Crown, and heavily mortgaged, and that their owners will be ruined if the Bill is passed as it stands, cause their returns will not enable them to pay interest on their mortgages and a tax on the unimproved value of the land, including the price at which they bought from the Crown. In that district estates are being offered today with all their improvements for the price paid to the Crown for the land in its unimproved state. Mortgagees are offering the land totday in the open market, and cannot get JQI an acre for it. There must be persons similarly situated in the other States.",29
132,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Would the honourable member exempt the Van Diemen's Land Company ?,30
133,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I have no desire to exempt any company or person, but I wish to prevent injustice. Honourable members opposite seem to think that because a man holds a large area of land he must be wealthy, and must be preventing settlement; hut in western Riverina there are many holdings on which closer settlement would be impossible, and if the present owners were dispossessed, the land would fall out of use. It now produces a certain quantity of wool, but were it to fall out of use our wool clip would be less, and wool still represents a very large part of the wealth annually produced in Australia. The people who are struggling on this land today are using it to the best advantage, considering its conditions. They are some of the most capable managers of grazing areas that we have. If the land could be put to better use, or sold to advantage, they-would not continue to use it only for grazing. Is it likely that they would stand in the way of bettering themselves? In Tasmania there has been a great outcry against certain owners for not selling their land, but I know that they would gladly sell at reasonable prices, if they could get them. Many of the Riverina land-owners cannot get even what they originaly paid to the Crown.",30
134,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [12.40] The Attorney-General supports his opposition to the amendment with just the sort of arguments which I anticipated he would use. They are not altogether unfamiliar, and therefore one is able on the spur of the moment to subject them to a short analysis. He told us that had the present generation received the money paid to the Crown, it might be equitable ""to exempt the holders from taxation in respect of the sums so paid, but that the land having been bought beby a generation which has passed away, no such exemption can be allowed. In other words, he would exempt payments for land made by a man three years ago, but would not make an exemption in respect of payments for land made by his father. He reminded us that land has an undiminishing use, but forgot to add that so has Government stock, and so has every other form of investment in which the original purchase money or its equivalent value remains intact. If , forty years ago, one man had paid Â£1,000 for land, and another the same sum for Government stock, while the first would have had the continuous use of his land ever since, the other would have been in the regular receipt of interest from his investment.",30
135,Mr CARR,Unknown,He would not have gained any unearned increment.,30
136,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am not objecting to the taxation of the unearned increment; I am speaking of the taxation of the sums paid to the Crown for the purchase of land. The honourable member will see that we are now singling out for special taxation the money originally invested in land, while allowing the money originally invested in Government stock to go scot free. That seems to me an utterly indefensible proceeding. It is absurd for any one who knows the history of Australia to say that because the generation which has gone received the money paid to the Crown for the land, this generation does not benefit by it. To what purpose has the land revenue of the States been applied? Has it not been devoted to the construction of railways, the building of bridges, the making of roads, and the carrying out of other public works, whereby the present generation benefits? It is nonsense for the Attorney-General to contend that this generation has received no benefit from the expenditure of the money which was received during the time of a former generation! The bulk of this money has been expended on what may be called national improvements.",30

138,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Not at all. I am not objecting tb the taxation of the unearned increment.,30

140,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Nothin g of the kind. I am adhering to the proper principle; that is the taxation of the community-created value. I do oppose taxation of the money which owners honestly paid to the Government, and which, had it been invested in Government stock, or anything else, would be free from taxation under this measure. The honourable gentleman undertook to inform me as to the proper interpretation of the Labour platform, but I decline to accept him as the sole interpreter of it. He may be very astute, but I was present at the Brisbane Labour Conference, and know what was in the minds of its members a little better than he does, since he was not there. He complained that the Bill is identical with that of the Fisher Government, of which I was a member. We certainly have here the skeleton of the measure brought down by the Government, but we have also sheaves of this Government's amendments which leave little resemblance between the two Bills. And let me remind him that the basic principles of the measure brought in by the Government of which I was a member, are set out clearly in a memorandum attached to the Bill itself. This memorandum shows that the Bill was designed to burst up land monopoly, to promote settlement, and to obtain for the community some of the land values created by communal expenditure. It contains no hint or suggestion of a proposal to tax the value represented by the purchase money paid to the Crown by the possessors of land. The Attorney-General now tells us that the taxation of the amount paid to the Crown was to be taken for granted. I for one never took such an unfair proposal for granted; and I say now that nobody, on reading the Bill or the memorandum, would ever suspect that the amount which had been paid to the Government honestly by the owners of land was ever likely to be taxed. The Attorney-General further attempts to justify his attitude by pointing to the fact that in land taxation by the States no exemption is allowed for the purchase money paid to the Crown. He instanced several States, among them Western Australia, where no exemption of this sort exists. Even if that be correct, it does not bear on this measure. This Bill is one to tax community-created values and to dislodge the land monopolist. The State taxation measures which he cited ap- had a totally different design. Their object was to raise funds to meet the ordinary expenses of government; and fheir Parliaments recognised that land, like other forms of property, should bear its legitimate share of general taxation. There is, therefore, no precedent in State enactments or policy to justify the Attorney-General's contention. He can scarcely have overlooked the essential distinction between the two cases. He must know that, whereas we are taxing the community-created value, the Governments of the States tax land for the purpose of getting revenue to defray the cost of administration- a totally different thing. If he is aware of this fact, and desires to conceal it, then his action is pitiable. It looks like a deliberate attempt to misstate the case in order to mislead the Committee.",31

147,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member has withdrawn the statement.,31
148,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I think that the common knowledge of the Committee will enable members to decide between my assertion and the apparent denial of the Attorney-General. The State Governments do not tax land to get in the accrued value, but to raise revenue, just the same as they do by taxing other forms of property. That is the difference, and an important one it is, which the Attorney-General ignored. He also stated that persons are expected to pay taxes according to their ability. Of course, that is perfectly correct in a general way, and it would be proper in the case of an income tax. But this Bill does not involve the payment of tax according to ability, but rather the payment of tax according to the amount of property the value of which was created by the community. The honourable gentleman also said that it was not proper for me, as a member of the Labour party, to say that this measure is not in accordance with that view-that it would be a proper statement for the honourable member for Fawkner to make, but coming from a member in my position it is little short of flat blasphemy. I do know by what warrant the Attorney-General sets himself up as a judge of my conduct. I decline his arbitrament, and shall exerpublic money. cise my rights here irrespective of his opinion. I wish to see land taxation fixed on equity; and if we are to have an endurto ing law, it must be based on just foundafor tions. I see nothing improper in that contention. Probably the Attorney-Genestand-point. ral desires the Bill to go down to posterity as one of the monuments of his great dom and constructive statesmanship. so, he will be solicitous that the Bill does not violate the principles of natural justice, and that it is in accordance with the existence. dictates of fair play and common sense. And in that regard I think it is very for a member of the House, charged with responsibility to the whole nation as well as to his constituents, to say that he hopes the measure will ultimately be fashioned so as not to inflict injustice or hardship anybody. My reference to the Â£5,000 exemption was made in consequence of an interjection by the honourable member Macquarie. I recognise that the exemption is provided for in the programme our party, and have no wish to disturb it. But surely it is not heresy for me to say Acts. that as the exemption had my strong opposition when it was being' placed in the platform, I am sorry it is there; and that its being there leaves this Bill open to the charge of being a class measure. It is logical, however far it may be defensible on the ground that we should not at present stage of affairs include in it sons who have only a small interest land. Our object is to break up large country estates which are suitable for agriculture, and by discouraging these from aggregations of land to promote closer out thatwhich settlement, and add to the populatlers tion of this country so that it may be properly defended. There is not syllable of my previous remarks which propose to withdraw.or to qualify in the slightest degree. I regret that the Atat torney-General has not better reasons those which he cited in the beginning his speech for his opposition to the amendwere ment. I think that if he is prepared admit, as he did, that allowance ought to be made for money paid three or four years ago, the benefit of which is enjoyed of dummying and other illegalities. by this generation, he has no warrant refusing to make allowance for money honestly paid to the Crown by the Mr Mahon. not decessors of this generation, seeing that the latter are also sharing in the benefits brought about by the expenditure of this",31

He has also stated that in some cases they bought the land, not merely the ordinary upset price of Â£ 1 per acre, than but at the exaggerated value of Â£ 2 per of acre, and that if the proposed exemption allowed, those estates would escape to taxation under the Bill. There can be no doubt that large areas of land in Victoria and other States were acquired by means If for the Parliaments of those days had been in a position to examine the transactions it prewould have been right and just on their part to pass laws superseding titles which had been dishonestly acquired. would point out that the titles were acquired many years ago; and that many of the dummymongers have passed away.  ants are still here.",32

159,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I have no particular figures, but, generally speaking, diere been an increase in value on the price originally paid to the Crown. In some parts of Australia there may be estates which have not increased on their original capital upset price; but if any landed estates have had no public betterment value since we being purchased from the Crown, we have proof of one of three things: In the first place, it may prove that the original upset was too high, and that there has been have no increment because of the anticipated payment of too much value. Secondly, it may be that the land, because of its situathe tion or poverty, is not capable of any f it increased value; ancl, thirdly, it may be that the owner has had only a limited use of the land. We may fairly draw the coninclusion that if , at the present time in Australia, with all its progressive tendenDoes cies, there is a landed estate which has increased in value since it was originally purchased from the Crown, at probably Â£ 1 per acre, there must be something inherent in its situation or potency that renders it incapable of increasing in valuethat there is a limit to its possible use, and was that this tax should not operate upon of that peculiar and poverty-stricken character. I suppose that it is not desired even by the most enthusiastic advocates of progressive graduated land tax that large aggregations in country districts which are incapable of being put to any use save pastoral occupation should be burst up.

180,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [2.45] - The honourable member for Nepean was somewhat unfortunate in comparing Australian conditions with those of England as regards land. In England, there is no such thing as an absolute ownership of land; it is all held there under an old feudal system, by which the rights of the Crown to obtain practically the whole economic value have been preserved for all time. It is not so very long ago, comparatively speaking, that practically all the taxation of that country was raised from land. Under the domination of certain influences that taxation was gradually taken off the land and put on the shoulders of the people as a whole, but those conditions do not apply to Australia. Here, rightly or wrongly, the land is parted with absolutely by the Crown. It may also be said that it is parted with absolutely at pretty well its market value. So far as the greater part of the lands of Australia are concerned, and having regard to the time at which they were taken over, the price put by the Crown on them represented approximately as much as they were likely to bring. In Western Australia the Crown is increasing the value of its lands according as the demand goes, and is very careful to keep it as near as possible to the present requirements of settlement. The Attorney-General would be doing his own cause and party a good service if he simply sat tight and allowed .his battalions to speak by means of their voting, because the last time. I heard him refer to the amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle I felt almost under compulsion to reply to what he said. He indicated that the honourable member for Fremantle practically contended in his amendment that once land was parted with by the State the State was not entitled to place any further charges upon it. Nothing could be further from the real contention of the honourable member for Fremantle. It was quite a simple matter for the Attorney-General, having stated the position to suit himself, to proceed to demolish it. The honourable member for Fremantle does not contend that the State has no right to whatever increment may be added to the land subsequently. He merely contends that the price originally paid for the land shall not be regarded as portion of that unearned increment. If the Government are contending for the taxation of the unearned increment, I fail to see how they can, consistently with their own principles and position, refuse to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle. It will come upon the farming community as somewhat of a shock to learn from the speeches of honourable members on the other side that, apparently, the one form of unearned increment which the Labour party, in this Parliament, at any rate, have any regard for taxing is the unearned increment on land. Undoubtedly, as this principle is extended, and the limit of Â£5..ooo becomes reduced, as must inevitably happen, those people who are being protected by the exemption will no longer have that advantage. They will begin to realise before very long that the unearned increment, added to their smaller holdings, will be part and parcel of the plan of taxation that is now being adopted in the case of the larger estates. I think that if investigation were made of some of the speeches of the Attorney General, not perhaps in this House,"" but in connection with debates in which he has taken part in the past, there would be found in his own language the best possible refutation of the contention that we have a right to the unearned increment on land, but not on any other form of wealth. Every individual member of a civilized community obtains, either to his labour or to his capital, the unearned increment added by the general operations of the whole community, and I fail to see, therefore, why the man on the land should be selected as the object of a tax of this kind while the unearned increment in other respects escapes altogether. If the Government had been in earnest in the desire to tain a percentage of the unearned increment created by this community, they should have applied another kind of tax altogether.",35
181,Mr BEARD,Unknown,"We did so the other day, in the Notes Bill; we are doing a bit there.",36
182,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The Labour party are doing a little bit here, and there, but are only nibbling at their own principles. I believe that by the methods they are adopting tliey will yet land themselves in the mire. The amendment is in absolute harmony with the principles and objects of the Bill, and I shall give it my hearty support.",36
183,Mr BEARD,Unknown,"Batman) [2.53] - I hope the Attorney-General will not relax in the least his opposition to the amendment. We ought to keep the Bill as it is now. I am surprised to hear the honourable member for Coolgardie trying to persuade the Committee that the Federal Parliament is not endeavouring to raise revenue by means of this tax, although the State Governments do apply land taxes for purely revenue purposes. The principle of this tax is to raise revenue. I distinctly stated that what commended this tax largely to me, amongst other very beneficial effects, was that it would raise a considerable amount of income for purposes of defence, and other necessary works. I therefore say it is to a great extent a revenue Bill. The amendment is dressed up in such a wav that at first sight it bears the stamp of equity, but it is not so when you come to analyze it. What will be its effect? How is it to be carried out? The blocks of land that were paid for to the State originally have, in many cases, been split up in a great many ways. Some of them have been absorbed into larger estates. The question as to any particular area of land is, what did the Crown actually receive for it ?",36
184,Mr HARPER,Unknown,That can easily be found out.,36
185,Mr BEARD,Unknown,"I do not see that it can. Take a block that was sold in Melbourne for Â£ 4 6 , and that has since been subdivided in such a way that the original frontage is not in the hands of the present owner. There would be trouble between the Commissioner and the present owner as soon as an attempt was made to fix what the Crown originally got for his holding. Endless difficulties would arise, and such an army of officials and such a large amount of inquiry would be required that ob- it would kill the Bill for any practical purpose.",36
186,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,All the titles go back to the Crown grant.,36
187,Mr BEARD,Unknown,"Honourable members say that many of these people have paid Â£ 1 an acre for the land. That is hardly a they fair way to put it, and I . should not be prepared to give a man an exemption at the rate of Â£ 1 an acre, even if the amendment were carried. The Crown in many cases parted with the land nominally at Â£ 1 an acre, but those who bought it had twenty years' time in which to pay the purchase money. That is practically the same as selling the land at 12s. dd. an acre spot cash. It would therefore not be fair to allow an exemption at the rate of Â£ 1 an acre for land purchased under the category of first-class land at a nominal price of Â£ 1 an acre, as was the case in Victoria. I agree with the Attorney General that the money that has been received for the lands of Australia has been re-expended by the States, and that a great majority of the present enhanced values are partly due to that expenditure The money passed into the Treasury and passed out again for the construction of railways and other works to still further enhance the value of the land. The money was simply transferred to the Treasury, and the value went back to the land, and is still there. The Bill is perfectly fair, but if amendments of this character are inserted it will break down of its own weight. It will be impracticable to put it into active operation, and I believe that that is the object of the Opposition in introducing these specious amendments.",36
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [2.59] - I was interested to hear the Attorney-General's statement of the principles of the Bill. I was certainly under the impression, with the honourable member for Coolgardie, that the principle of the Bill was unimproved value taxation - a tax imposed on unimproved land values for the purpose of bursting up big estates which were suitable for closer settlement.",36
189,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Not a tax imposed on unimproved land values, but posed on the unimproved value of land, which is quite a different thing.",37
190,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I am willing to put it that way. I believe that what I have stated is the impression which the country as a whole gained, but today we are formed that that is not the principle the Bill at all. It is not a mere ming,"" as the Attorney-General put it, the community-added value of the land; the principle that underlies the Bill is of preventing any man in Australia holding more than a certain quantity of land. amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle- I had already given notice a similar amendment, which will not, course, now be moved-is designed to vide that so much of the unimproved value for which the Crown has received full satisfaction should not be taxed. One of great objections to the tax is its uniform action from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. It falls on land which eminently suitable for closer settlement, and for the taxation of which there might be some justification, though I am not tempting to justify it. But the penal clauses also apply in the case of land which is in no way suitable for this purpose, which the Crown has already received full cash value, and which has had no added value given to it since it was sold. No argument has yet been submitted showing that taxation should be imposed on land which is not suitable for closer settlement and which can only be profitably held worked in large areas. If any honourable memher opposite can show any justification for applying the penal clauses to land that description I am willing to hear him, but I have heard no such agument adduced lost during that time. throughout the whole of the debate. When honourable members have an opportunity exempt this class of land they should seize value. it and prevent the penal clauses being applied. If , as it is contended, this tax is also for revenue purposes, surely there are ways and means whereby such land as I have indicated, and city lands, could taxed on a flat rate, and the penal clauses reserved for the case of lands suitable closer settlement. I see no reason that should not be done if it is desired carry out the mandate which honourable members opposite claim they have from the country. The Government might, at all [ 37] J events, make an honest attempt to exclude a tax imthese two classes of land.",37
191,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker) [3.5] VVe have, I think, a very difficult task when we set out to ascertain the unimproved value of land. The land sold in the early days was always the most improved areas inin leaseholds, the improvements conof sisting of houses and outbuildings, "" skimfencing, clam making, and so forth; of this land was sold by auction, always at high prices, and in some cases at much that over the value. At the present day it is almost impossible to say what was the unThe improved value. The honourable member for Darling must recollect that when these of lands were first put up to auction there of were very few farmers in Australia, and prothat, at any rate, they were not expected to buy land. The sales were with a view to getting money out of the squatters; the the people generally did not know the value of the land, and only men with money could buy. The only person who prois fited was the "" land shark,"" who always "" stood in "" to make money. I quite agree with the statement that many of die old' atland-owners paid a great deal more for their holdings than they would be able to get for them today; and many of them abfor solutely ruined themselves through buying at high prices. The money thus raised was spent on the country, and if the expenditure was not wise, it should have been. At the present time, in many cases there is not the slightest indication of the improvements that were made on the land in the and very early days. In my own district, for instance, drainage has greatly enhanced land values, though for years and years afterof wards the land was too sour for profitable use, and the interest on the purchase was As I say, it is simply ridiculous to suppose that we can to now form any idea of the real unimproved",37
192,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,We know that the land was paid for.,37
193,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Quite so; and I be think the only fair basis for arriving at the unimproved value is that presented in for the amendment, though even that would why not, I think, afford much relief. I was to rather surprised to hear an honourable member talking about outside lands being productive to the extent of Â£ 3 0 an acre, because only in very few places can land of. that character be found. The honourable member for Balaclava instanced land at Ballarat, Warrnambool, and other places in Victoria, and I may point to lands at Mount Gambier, and elsewhere, in the south-east portion of South Australia, where such a value per acre might be produced.",37
194,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Any amount of that land carries nothing but sheep at present.,38
195,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"That may be; Federal but I was going to point out that it is only now and then that such high production achieved. After land has been ploughed and produced, perhaps, Â£ $ o an acre, it - I Sirhave has to be sown with grass at a cost of at least jQi per acre, and thus left for some years, when again high production may be obtained. I mention this to show that the condition of the land is stantly changing, so that, I suppose, - once in five years or so can these very - rrops be grown. My own opinion is, - varying are the conditons, that every part - of the country ought to be regarded diftion ferent! y for the purposes of a measure of Commonwealth. this kind. We were told by another orable member that much of the land originally sold on credit; but, as a matter of fact, in the early history of Australia every acre was sold for spot cash; the price was Â£ i an acre, ancl if a man had no money he could get no land. Twenty years after the original sale, an acre was the minimum upset price; and the facts all show that the on the absurd. land-holder is always the one to be penalwas ized. The Government of a State, after selling land at Â£ i an acre, have sold similar land at 2s. <5d. an acre, thus placing the old land purchasers at a disadvantage of 17s. 6d. Financial institutions, which have advanced money on values on the basis of .Â£1 an acre, have found the selling /price reduced to 5s. or 2s. 6d; and to and similar troubles the land-owners - over Australia have ever been subjected. We know that in the old days the Governbe ment used to take from the squatters the ""best of the country, with the object ing it. I recollect well the story of one - man riding up to another man's station in South Australia and inviting his neighbour to come and look at his lovely crop of wheat; but the neighbour told him that that crop of wheat would mean the loss of the land.",38
196,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Has that anything to do with the question?,38
197,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"I am talking about the unimproved value of land. The old owners of land improved their holdings, which were then seized by the Government, and sold at big prices, forcing the pioneers to also pay similar prices if they desired to retain their areas. This Bill is another blow at the landholders of Australia, and every such blow is at development. I hope that this great Parliament will turn their attention to the development of the country, and is leave the poor land-owners alone. WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) [3.14]. been in the chamber only a few minutes, but I have made myself acquainted with the terms of the amendment, which, in my opinion, would practically take conaway the taxable value of a great only part of the land of the country. large It would be quite impossible for the so Government to accept such a proposal, though I think it a great pity that the taxahas one general effect all over the Some parts of Aushontralia are much more valuable for was agriculture than others, and districts possessing a good rainfall should have been declared agricultural areas. To tax all the land in Australia as if it were of one quality, and had the same rainfall, and were equally suitable for agriculÂ£ i ture, is a mistake. The proposal of the honourable member for Fremantle verges In years past land occasionally sold for a keg of rum.

I hope that before the Bill is finally disposed of we shall be able to consider the possibility of declaring certain districts to be suitable for these agriculture; to treat all alike is bad all in principle.

198,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Flinders) [3.28] The honourable member has not dealt with an objection which I have already raised in regard to the like amendment which was carried in paragraph a. It mon in Victoria, and, I think, in other parts of Australia, to subdivide land by leasing it with the right to purchase. This is. advantageous both to land-owners and to men without capital to buy land, who are glad to acquire leases and thus earn the capital necessary to purchase freeholds. But under the proposal of the Attorney General, a land-owner in considering whether he should subdivide on lease with the option of purchase would say, "" If I do not do this, I shall be able to deduct the whole value of the improvements on the land, with their mutual benefit to one another, but if I subdivide in leases, the [i37]- 2 AYES. reductions which I can make will be less, and the amount of tax which I shall have to pay will be more."". Where there is separate occupation of parcels of land, the improvements on them are of less value in the aggregate than where the land is all in the hands of one owner. It necessarily follows, therefore, that as soon as a man puts tenants on his land he at once increases the taxation payable. This is a question upon which I should like to hear the Attornev-General's views.",39

202,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It is possible to recommit if the honourable member thinks that we have done wrong.,39
203,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"But , in the opinion of the Government, we have not done wrong. I had the honour to point out to the Committee last evening that it was necessary - that each parcel of land should be dealt with separately in order that all landowners should be treated exactly alike. I pointed out that we might distinguish is comclearly those improvements which add to the unimproved value of a particular block, from those which were on that block, and were to be distinguished from die unimproved value, and that that could be done only by treating each block or parcel separately. Let us assume,' for the sake of argument, that the land on the south side of Bourke-street, from Spring-street to Elizabeth-street, is held in fifty blocks, each worth Â£10,000, and that the land on the noith side is held by one owner, and is wortli .Â£500,000. It is perfectly clear that the aggregate unimproved value of the blocks on the south side would be greater than the aggregate unimproved value of the one block on the north side, because there - would be deducted from the one block all the improvements that were upon the whole of it, whereas there would be deducted from each of the fifty blocks on the south side only the improvements on that particular block. Now, as the improved value of any one piece of land is the result of improvements made on all ""other lands, it follows quite naturaUy that the amount to be deducted in the one case would be very much less than the amount to be deducted in the other. The principle is perfectly sound.",39
204,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [3.35] - I am afraid that I am not quite clear as to the answer which the Attorney-General has given to the position stated by the honourable member for Flinders. The honourable member referred to the subdivision of country properties, whereas the Minister"" told us what would be the effect of the Bill on town properties that had alieady been subdivided. I am assured by representatives of country constituencies that this method of leasing land, with the option of purchase, is, in certain cases, the only means O of bringing about subdivisions.",40

The fact that few of us know very much concerning it water, light, and traction. is an additional reason why information should be given to the Committee. honourable member for Flinders urged the system to which he referred is much vogue in Victoria and other States, and it leads to the passing of land from owner into the hands of many. If I underhad stood the Attorney-General last night, is the ""principle"" of this Bill, and wish to know how the principle will fected by the position cited by the able member for Flinders with regard country lands.",40
208,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [3.38] - The honourable member perhaps does hot realise the importance this basis of assessment in such a case I have cited, or in the case of a subtenant farmers. division. Let us suppose that a man divides a large block, not by selling it, but by leasing it in various holdings. The question then arises, how is he to be assessed-o n the value of the whole land, less all the improvements on all the land, or upon the value of each allotment, less the improvements on each allotment? The difference is perfectly clear. Let us take the block on which the White Hart Hotel is built.",40
209,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Tak e a country block.,40
210,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"An inn is a good place from which to start, but, in any event, the principle is the same, whether we deal with country or town lands. The honourable member shakes his head. No doubt the whole synthetic philosophy of Spencer would have been utterly crushed if he had seen that shake of the head, but still the fact remains as I have stated. In the case of the White Hart Hotel we should have to get at the site value, whatever it is, because that is what we are going to tax. The owner would have a right to deduct from the site value all the improvements upon it. Now the site value has been way added to by the improvements made, say, on by the owners of the Grand Hotel on the adjacent land, by this building of ParliaHouse, and by all the surrounding The parin ticular site value of a piece of land is increased by the improvements placed on adjacent pieces of land. The site value, he or what we call the unimproved value, is nothing more than the value of the sum total of the whole of the improvements is made by the community, including, of course, public utilities, such as roads, If we take this particular case, and suppose The that one man owns the Grand Hotel, that the White Hart Hotel, and other adjain cent buildings, it is perfectly clear that that in assessing the whole block we should not one be able to take from each that value that been added to it by the improvements that on each neighbouring block. We should I be able to take from the whole only that be afvalue which had been added to it by the honorbuildings and improvements outside it. to Therefore it is very much to the interests of the large land-owner that he should be - assessed on the whole block. For. the sake of argument, let us take a case where a of man holding a large station property has as cut it up and leased it to forty different The value of each subfarm, apart from its productivity, - speakin g of it as a site value-lie s in the fact that there are improvements on adjacent ground, and that there does attach to each block, although, I admit, not to the same degree as in the case of a town property, a value other than the value which is attached to the particular block under consideration. And if no value has been added to each farm by improvements or any other means, then there can be no difference in the methods of assessment. Therefore, when each particular block is taken by itself, there is less to deductthere is more unimproved value than there would be if we took a number of blocks added together.",40
211,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [3.41] - The question is whether we should insist upon a technical adherence to the theory of the unimproved value, or whether we should not accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Flinders, and refrain from insisting upon it, when by non-insistence we should increase the. likelihood of subdivision. I agree with the reasoning of the Attorney-General so far as the principle of taxation is concerned, because if we tax each block separately",41
212,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The municipalities would look after that part of the matter.,41
213,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We are dealing, not with municipal rates, but with the effect upon the tax proposed to be imposed. I do not think there can be any doubt that when a particular area is reduced to one hundred holdings, by taxing each block separately a bigger unimproved value is obtained from the general congestion of population and improvements than would be secured if we simply taxed the one owner who had subdivided. If we are to adhere to the strict reading of the Bill, then we may be right in adopting that principle, but from the point of view of expediency it is wrong, because by following it we shall really take away an inducement to subdivide, since the moment an owner began to subdivide his property he would have to pay more taxation. Considering there are few cases of the kind, I prefer that we should not adhere to the strict theory of unimproved value, but that we should allow in these cases the tax to fall on the lower value. I have before me a letter, referring to a case in South Australia, where, by such a subdivision as that indicated, 129 persons have been placed upon land on which previously only two or three resided. They are all lessees, and they are thriving. It is mere pedantry, for the sake of a few more pounds in taxation, to insist on the owner, in a case where there is no true unearned increment, paying the full rate. My impression is that the reason this amendment is introduced is because it has been decided in New South Wales that it is the true principle of taxation under the New South Wales Act. There was a case in the Cooper Estate that went before the Court. Subdivision had taken place, and it was doubtful whether the owner should be taxed allowing him for all the improvements, including roads and houses, or taxed for each block separately. There was a division of opinion upon the point, and the New South Wales Court decided that each block should be taxed separately. We are not obliged to follow that course, and I think, as a matter of expediency, we ought not.",41
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [3.46] - I do not follow the reasoning of the Attorney-General when he says that the character of the improvements upon a block gives an added site value to the adjoining block. If that be so, how comes it that the site on which the White Hart Hotel stands, in Spring-street, is worth only, say, one-half, of the site value of a block in Swanston-street? It is not the character of the building at all. There may be a worse building and less improvements on the site in Swanston-street.",41
215,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable member is perfectly correct. The character of the building is only one of the elements.,41
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is an element of the very slightest value. If there were the cheapest possible form of improvement on land where business concentrates, it would not stop the site value from incrementing.",41
217,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I said myself that it was one of the elements, together with all those which the community created.",41
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then apply that to country lands. A man has a large block of land, and decides to put roads through it himself, and increased facilities. To whom does that improvement belong but to the man himself?",41
219,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I do not deny that it belongs to him.,41
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But the honourable member is going to tax him additionally for it. He says the value of the sites increases because of the facilities given for placing corner block buildings there.,41
221,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable member is in error. I did not say that.,41
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member may not have used those words, but his point was that land divided up in that way and formed into streets _ is of greatei aggregate value than a piece of land which has no such facilities. He is perfectly right, but I contend that the man is entitled to an exemption under the Bill for all that inrprovement. I should think it would depend on whether he had provided those facilities himself, or whether the State provided' them.",42
223,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If the honourable member admits the fact, the question as to whom the return should go to is, I admit, a matter for argument.",42
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do admit the fact that every facility, every road, does add to the incremental value of the land, but to whom does it belong? If the man himself has made the road ovei his own land, clearly the improvements belong to him, but under this proposal the honourable member is going to tax them.",42
225,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,We do not tax the imwhether provements at all.,42
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"How can it be a community-created value, since it arises from nothing but what the individual has done himself in making the road or breaktreat ing up the block ? - The value is the same each case, until the man himself decides break it up. The moment he breaks up, and provides facilities, people want go there to build, and so the increment on, but the increment is of the man's creation. It is an increment of improvefined ment pure and simple on the whole block, and there is no community-created value it. Before there could be any communityseparate parcel. created value, the State must have purchased from the individual the land over which the roads are made, and spent State money on them, but so long as the man divides his own private estate, and, by providing greater facilities for people go there, increments the value of his estate, it seems to me that it belongs to him just divide. as much as it did before.",42
227,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"He could subdivide and make roads through it, but it would not be worth anything unless some one and bought the blocks and lived on them.",42
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is so; but getting land. on the other hand, if it were not subdivided, it might not be worth anyorable thing, even if there were 1,000,000 people round it. It is availability and accessibility to the people that create the value for business and .other sites. In this case, the value is created by the man himself on his own private estate. It is a different thing where the State resumes land and makes roads through it. I admit that, then, whatever the State does in providing facilities creates an increment in the value of the sites ; but my point is that in these blocks the increment in value belongs to the man, since he himself has created it by providing facilities for access to the blocks.",42
229,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [3.52] - The honourable member for Angas stated that the principle of the amendment is perfectly correct, but the honourable member for Parramatta does not agree to the application of it, although he sees the difference in the two methods of assessment. The only difference he has is as to whether, where a man owns a block upon which there are many parcels or divisions, the benefit of each of the improvements on all the blocks other than on his own particular parcel should go to him, or he should be treated as if he were the owner of only that one parcel. The honourable and learned member for Flinders said he thought that this amendment would not help subdivision, or, in - effect, that to the man who had a big block differin ently from a number of persons who owned to separate portions of the block, did not it make for subdivision.

In the Hopetoun and Sealake districts of the Mallee over 500 men are now owners of the land, who started there with scarcely a shilling. They own their properties now, but they would have had no chance of becoming land-holders had it not been for the leasing or share system. On the Nerrin estate, near Streatriam, belonging to the trustees of the late J. MACPherson, the land has been dealt with in much the same way. One farmer who came down great from the Mallee in 1904, after being starved out of his other place by bad seasons, having only his team of horses ancl his plements, took up 640 acres on the share system on that estate, with the right of purchase. He told me recently that out of his first crop he was enabled to pay his settle people. deposit on the land, and now had the land free of debt. That was in six years, I believe the land is worth ,Â£6 an acre.",43

236,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Yes . The torney-General's amendment is all right regards town properties. I see nothing unfair in it in that regard, but it is ferent when you come to country propercan ties and improvements. Suppose a has 5,000 acres of land which is valued a whole. Take the value of the improveon ments off, and the balance represents unimproved value. If , however, he lets that land in ten farms of 500 acres each. he will be allowed only for his improvements on the one block on which he dwells himself. For each of the other nine blocks that he has let he gets no exemption, there are on them no improvements worth speaking of. Therefore, the whole his allowance for improvements will be on what may be called the homestead block. inducement is there to a man to let land to tenant farmers with the option of purchase if he is going to be taxed at a higher scale that if he retains it all behimself? That is the whole point of the the honourable member for Flinders. on each The Attorney-General says that if is these men put down 15 per cent, they can become owners. I have some prohe perties, and some very good men working for me, and I have said to them, "" As soon as you save .Â£100, and buy plant, I shall give you 100 acres without any deposit."" If these men had to pay me jQ 100 or ^Â£150 I as a deposit, they would not have any money with which to buy their working plant, whereas, under such terms as I offer they can set to work, and out of their first crop provide the deposit. There ought not to be any compulsory percentage so long as the transaction is bond fide. Of course, if there is dummying or fraud, let the offenders be punished; but people who are acting bond fide ought to be encouraged. The allowance for improvements should extend over the whole block, * whether it be leased or not, because, otherwise settlement to a extent will be prevented. So long as the tax is paid over the whole 5,000 acres, and the Government will not lose anything; imthey will receive exactly the same tax whether one man or ten men occupy the land.

The Attorney-General is prepared to allow transan fer in the case of an absolute purchase, when 15 per cent., at least, of the purchase money has been paid, the balance to be this provided at reasonable periods. There is another way, however, by which a chance bemay be given to the poorest man.

250,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is the most refreshing statement we have heard for some,44
251,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"It is an fact; we all admit on this side that, with such a big impost, there is going to be subdivision. But the Attorney General by his proposal is placing a bar in the way of that object. The honourable gentleman proposes the one method of immediate sale, but there is the other method, which will be largely availed of, namely, the leasing of the land with the absolute right of purchase in a given time. I ask the Government to protect themsels'es in every respect, and not to fix the period at more than six years, having satisfied themselves that there is a bond fide registered agreement to lease at a reasonable rental, with the right of purchase, not at a fictitious value, but at a value which will satisfy the ""Commissioner. The Government, if they believe in encouraging subdivision, ought to impose the most favourable conditions; and the suggestion made on this side will assist the very poorest of industrious men who desire to go on the land. To require a deposit of 15 per cent, would deprive such men of the money necessary to buy plant and stock; and we desire to assist those who, with little or no cash, may have strong muscle, and, possibly, a useful family of boys. In nine cases out of ten, suitable men would be able to exercise their right of purchase at the end of six years.

252,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [4.18] I understand that it is intended to bring Bill into line with the decision in the case of the New South Wales Commissioner of Taxes v. Cooper, of which I do not understand the justice. It was there held that a proprietor who had cut up his land, separating it into parcels divided by roads, was taxable on the added value resulting from the subdivision. The value of the land had increased, not in virtue of public betterment or unearned increment; but merely by the action of the owner in dedicating part of his land to the public for loads. The contention of the honourable member for Flinders is that we should make such exceptions as will promote subdivision in accordance with the policy of the measure. If a man divides his land into parcels by making roads through it, we should not tax him on the increased value which thereby results.",45
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) {4.20] - It seems to me that the proposal before us takes away the incentive to subber divide. In the case just referred to by honourable member for Bendigo, the result of the subdivision was to increase the value of the property from ;Â£8o,ooo to Â£240,000. It might happen that a man possessing a block worth Â£50,000 might subdivide it by making roads through it, and thus eventually increase its value to Â£^150,000. If the land were subdivided into thirty blocks, all of which were sold, the original owner would have no tax to pay; but he might be able to sell only ten blocks before the increment increased, in which case he would have twenty blocks on his hands, and his taxation would be increased from Â£440 to Â£^1)593",45

I pointed to a case in which an estate valued at Â£^50,000 had, by subdivision, incremented to ,Â£150,000. The owner might be able to dispose of only one-third of the land before the increment increased, so that taxation payable by him would be three times as much' as he had to pay on the original holding.

The honourable member says that that is the sort of thing that discourages subdivision. I wish I could secure such a chance. I - know of nothing more calculated to encourage a man to subdivide his estate than the prospect of his getting as much for one-third of it as the whole is worth. What is more to the point is that the honourable member says that the remaining two-thirds would be worth as much per foot as the one-third which had been sold, so that the owner would get Â£ 3 for every Â£ 1 , and all that he would be asked to pay by way of penalty, at the outside would be the added amount of taxation on the two-thirds which he could not sell. He would already have in his breeches' pocket as much money as the whole of his estate was worth before subdivision, and two-thirds of the estate would still be in his possession to sell at the same profit. It is this diabolical amendment of the Government that proposes to enable the landlords of this country to recoup themselves in this princely and extravagant fashion at the community's expense which is denounced as a foe to subdivision.

301,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,No ; it is taxation.,48
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Le t us say that the objects are taxation and ing up of estates. I have heard very little about taxation from honourable members opposite until now. The main objective has been closer settlement. If closer settlement is desired, we should give every inducement to people to subdivide their estates as quickly as possible, and if the Bill did not come into force for a reasonable time, it would give those who have large estates an opportunity to subdivide and promote closer settlement. The only objection, therefore, to the amendment is from the revenue point of view. I do not speak with absolute knowledge, but I think it is very unusual for taxation Bills to be retrospective. All sorts of interests are involved when you go back from the time at which you are legislating. We certainly should not go back to the ist of July, seeing that the Bill was not introduced until long after that date, and, I suppose, will not be passed until some time in October. If we make the present holders pay the' tax for the current year, there will be no> inducement, to them to subdivide their lands until towards the time when the tax becomes due again next year. If it were known that the tax would not be imposed, if the lands were subdivided quickly, it would be a great incentive to people to subdivide. The purchaser, of course, would know that he would have to pay the tax if the unimproved value was over Â£5.000. There is no doubt that the main reason for the introduction of the measure is to burst up large estates and give facilities for the closer occupation of land. I understand from honourable members opposite that if they could by one stroke take away all the revenue out of this Bill, and have closer settlement, they would feel that they had achieved their object. I heard one honourable member say that if they had not settled the land difficulty and brought about closer settlement within three years their work would have been a failure. Of course, this Bill is ostensibly a Tax Bill. There is nothing about closer settlement in it, for the very good reason that it is an attempt to invade an arena that does not belong to us. It is not possible to put in the Bill a statement that it is intended; to deal with land settlement or land occupation. Even if it were only a revenue Bill, there would be no justification for making it retrospective.

322,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"However , assuming that the desire is to gain revenue, another obConseject is to split up big estates.",49
323,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Certainly .,49

325,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"If a man is compelled to the pay the taxation, will he not more quickly member split up his estates?",49
326,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The splitting up of the and their own estates is the object?,49
327,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Yes .,49
328,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Then , I am appealing to honourable members on that very point. If a man is willing to split up his estate, and so accomplishes the end in view, surely Swan, he is doing a praiseworthy act ?",49
329,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,We are going to help sound one? The him. to do' so !,49
330,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That being so, I submit that if a man disposes of his estate, even light up to the date on which the Bill - becomes operative, he is doing something 'that is laudable; and it would be better to fix a date after the Bill comes into operation.",50
331,Mr WEST,Unknown,And give an owner longer time in which to pay no taxation?.,50
332,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Giv e longer time in which to induce people to settle on the land. From a legal point of view, prior to this Bill, there was no harm in a man .holding land in large areas; and if he, light up to the date of the coming into - operation of the measure, subdivides his Jand, he should be taxed only on the land ""he then holds.",50
333,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It is only a matter of two or three months.,50
334,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Quite so; the only idea is to do justice by preventing, as - done, a Bill of this kind having a retrospective effect.",50
335,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [5.5] - What was done in South Australia might in one sense be termed retrospective; that is, the tax was imposed as from the ist January, aj the honourable member for Swan now suggests, of the next ensuing year, but it was collected at the full rate of a whole year. Taxpayers, however, did not get the advantage of half-a-year, owing to the fact that, though the next time the tax became due was in the succeeding January, it was paid for the financial year ending in June. Perhaps the honourable member for Swan had in view the making of the financial year, for the purposes of this Bill, from January to January.",50
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The amendment can be altered in that respect.,50
337,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The amendment will do something, but not exactly what has been slated. As the honourable member for Darling Downs has suggested, the Bill is in one sense retrospective-in other words, we are taxing men who are not owners of the land Anstey, F. at the time of the passing of the Bill. Can Archibald, W. O. we legally do this? I draw attention to Beard, H . E. this only as a matter of drafting for the Cann, G. - consideration of the Attorney-General. By Fenton, J. E. way of illustration, I point out that 9 imposes a tax on land owned by the taxFrazer, payer, and primd facie, that means land Hughes, W. M . owned on the date when this Bill comes Jensen, J. A. into force, because taxation must not be Johnson, W. J. assumed to be retrospective unless there are Mahon, - clear words to that respect. Then we have Mathews, J. the clause before us which speaks of land MCDougall, J. K.. owned on the 30th June, and also clause 14 to a similar effect. Who is the taxpayer ? The man whom we can tax; and I do not think the Court would hold that we could tax a man who did not own the land at that date.",50
338,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is land which is owned by the taxpayer, but not owned by the taxpayer who necessarily pays the tax.",50
339,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"What is meant by "" taxpayer?"" Does it mean a man who owned land on the 30th June or afterwards?",50
340,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Not necessarily.,50
341,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"If it means a man who owned land on the 30th June, the effect will be that the man who owned it then, and subsequently sells it, will be taxed on land that he does not possess at the date of the passing of the Bill. If it means the man who owns land at the date of the passing of the Bill, we cannot tax the man who owned is usually the land on the 30th June.",50
342,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall look into the matter; but I think ""owner,"" ""owned,"" and "" taxpayer "" are all defined.",50
343,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not think that the point is at all clear, but it is got over by the amendment of the honourable member for Swan, which means the man who owns the land on the ist January; and there will be no retrospective dragging in of the man who did not own the land at the date of the passing of the Bill. The effect of the amendment seems to be that the full results of the tax will be gained throughout the year, except so far as subdivision takes place up to the ist January.

344,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [5.15] - I move That the following words be added :- "" Provided that an owner of land who, after the thirtieth day of June, but before the thirtieth day of September, One thousand nine hundred and ten, has sold part of the land or has sold all the land to different purchasers, shall, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the sale was bond fide and not for the purpose of evading the payment of land tax, be separately assessed for the year ending on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and eleven, in respect of the land so sold to any one purchaser, and be charged with land tax in respect of that land as if it were the only land owned by him."" Under this proviso any person who, 'before the 30th day of September, subdivides his land will be entitled to be separately assessed for each parcel sold, as if it were the only land owned by him. The owner of land of the unimproved value of Â£150,000 will have to pay a tax at the rate of about 5d. in the Â£ 1 , but if , before the 30th September, such a man were to sell to ten purchasers Â£100,000 worth of that land, he would be entitled to be separately assessed in regard to eleven separate parcels, obtaining an exemption of Â£5,000 on each, which would, of course, mean a very great reduction in the rate and amount of his tax. The concession which we offer is a substantial one. Sir JOHN"" FORREST (Swan) [5.20]. - Seeing that the object of the measure is to burst up large estates, and to bring about closer settlement; the Government, with a view to inducing subdivision, should not curtail the period within which advantage may be taken of the concession provided for in the amendment just moved by the Attorney-General. It must be remembered NOES. that the Bill was not introduced until after the beginning of the financial year, and that we are now within two days of the 30th September, so that this concession cannot become known, and cannot be taken advantage of, unless the date is extended. Nothing will be lost by extending the period during which it will be available, except a slight amount of revenue. We hear on all sides that subdivision is necessary, but why offer an inducement to subdivide which is to have effect only until the PAIRS. Fowler, J. M . 30th of this month, so that it will expire before it can become known? I should like the opportunity to take advantage of the provision to be extended to the end of: the financial year; but in any case it should be extended until the end of the calendar year. I , therefore, move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" thirtieth day of September,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words. "" thirty-first day of December.""",51
345,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [5-25]-The Attorney-General is to be congratulated upon the proposition now before the Committee, but the time within which thf concession offered may be taken advantage of should be extended as suggested by the honourable member for Swan. . If the concession expires on the 30th Septemberthat is, two days hence-land-owner s will not know of it, and will not, in any case,, be able to take advantage of it. There may be a slight loss of revenue if the time is extended, but, as the desire of the Government is to encourage subdivision, it should not spoil the effect of the proposal now under discussion by making it impossible for land-owners to take advantage of it. I hope that the extension of time proposed will be agreed to.  doubt the concession offered will be a substantial one, if the time within which it may be accepted is extended, but otherwise it will be useless. I hope that the Attorney-General will agree to some extension, even if he cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member for Swan..",51
346,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Balacrava)> [5.29] - This morning I informed the Attorney-General that certain Victorians had! bought a property in New South Wales, for/ which they had paid a large sum on deposit, but that they were getting no return for their money. I also handed him their balance-sheet as evidence of their bona fides. Since then I have seen one of the owners, and he informs me that they have now arranged to subdivide the property amongst themselves. Each man will work his own share as a separate property. That will be a bond fide subdivision, and I ask the Attorney-General whether he would object to a slight amendment of the amendment to meet such a case. I suggest that the proposed proviso should readProvided that the owner or owners .of land who sell or bond fide subdivide their landbefore the 30th September, and so forth. By such an amendment, the people to whom I have referred would be treated as if they had sold the land.",51
347,Mr GROOM,Unknown,In that case there would be a partition of the land.,52
348,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Ye s j I should like the word "" partition,"" as well as the word "" sale,"" to be used.",52
349,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [5.32] - Assumin g that the Government adopt the principle suggested by the honourable member for Balaclava, it can be embodied in the Bill by the addition of the words at the end of the clause, "" For the purposes of this section 'sale' includes 'partition.'"" I agree with the merits of the proposition, but wish now to point out how the drafting of this provision will work. The Attorney-General said that a man might sell portion of his land, and it seems to me that, so far as subdivisions and sales are concerned, this is a very fair provision, because, in respect of the portions sold, the tax will be imposed on the lower rate. As regards the part not sold, however, the effect of the drafting is, I believe, that the owner will pay on the rate determined by the whole area. He will not pay the sum total of the tax over the whole area, but a rate to be determined by that on the whole area.",52
350,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [5.34] - Clause 39 deals with double taxation, and would, I think, prevent a man from being charged twice.",52
351,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,No .,52
352,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If it be as the honourable member supposes, then, both in respect of the land so sold and the land remaining unsold, the effect of this clause will apply.",52
353,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What about a partition of land?,52
354,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member for Balaclava spoke of a partition of land under a deed of partnership, and I promise him that when the Bill is recommitted I will include bond fide partitions.",52
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan> [5.35]-The Attorney-General has not said whether he is prepared to agree to my amendment of the amendment providing , for the substitution of the words "" thirtyfirst day of December "" for the "" thirtieth day of September."" What objection can there be to such an alteration?",52
356,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [5.36] - The reason is that it would mean a distinct and very valuable concession, and one that, in its practical operation, would have obvious limitations. The Commissioner will have to be satisfied that a sale is bond fide, and I am afraid that if this period were extended so as to take in the whole of the year, so many applications would be made under this provision that, although I look at the matter from an entirely philosophical stand-point, the Treasurer could not afford to do so. It would be impossible to determine the bona fides of every sale if the whole nation, so to speak, applied for a remission of taxation under this proviso. I take it that we have allowed for a fair and reasonable period. In another part of the Bill we deal specially with leases, mortgages, and marriage settlements, ancl I think that, in the circumstances, we cannot go any further.",52
357,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [5.37] - Perhaps the best course to pursue would be to determine that this clause shall cease to operate on the day on which this Bill becomes law. The Bill may become law at any time within the next month or two, and the course I have suggested seems an easier way of dealing with the matter than would be the fixing of any special date. I can see some reason for fixing upon the 30th June as the date of ownership, so that the tax may be collected .in respect of this year; but in the amendment now before us the Minister is making a concession in order to prevent hardships occurring to persons who bond fide wish to divide their land and so-carry out what I conceive to be the first principle of the Act. People should be given every opportunity - to bond fide divide their land up to the date on which the Bill becomes law. The moment the Governor General's assent is given to this measure it will become law, and then the general provisions of the Act may very well apply to all classes of property.",52
358,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [5.40] - In view of the statement made by the Attorney General that he will amend the clause when the Bill is recommitted, I suggest to him the substitution for the words "" at noon on'' the 30th day of - June, the words ""at the close of business"" on the 30th day of June. A practical authority who has had a good deal to do with land taxation matters states that the words to which I take exception will probably lead to trouble, and he suggests the amendment indicated. Although this clause has been adopted from the New Zealand Act, I am assured that in practical operation the fixing of ownership as at noon on the 30th day of June will make for trouble. In any case, it will involve the Commissioner possibly in some complications regarding time, and as it is now too late for me to move an amendment, I suggest to the Government that when the Bill is recommitted they should consider the advisableness of making this alteration.",52
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Swan) [5.42]. - It is difficult to follow the Attorney General's reasoning. He seems now to think that if the amendment were amended as I propose it would lead to such a rush on the part of persons desiring to reduce the areas held by them that complications would arise.,53
360,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I said that there would be evasions.,53
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The Commissioner must guard against that sort of thing. It seems to me that although the Attorney General said yesterday that the object of this Bill was to bring about the subdivision of"" land, he is afraid that if we extend the date in the proviso to the 31st December too many subdivisions will take place. fail to see why any date should be named. If a person honestly subdivides his property and portion of it is purchased by others, why should not the amount of his taxation be reduced and be chargeable proportionately to the new owners?",53
362,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Why should a man buy if he is by so doing to place on himself a load of taxation?,53
363,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"If I have a large estate and find that I must either reduce it or pay this tax, why should I be discouraged when I propose to subdivide it? The object of the Government, I . understand, is to compel the owner of a large estate, not to pay this tax, but to sub- Higgs, W. G. divide his property.",53
364,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,In the first year the buyer would not have to pay the tax.,53
365,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The vendor would take care that he did. When a property is sold the purchaser has to pay even the municipal rates from the date of sale.,53
366,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,But under this Bill a buyer will not pay during the first year.,53
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,He would probably have to pay the seller.,53
368,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,If the seller could get-it out of him.,53
369,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The seller would always get it out of him, because it is a fair thing. If I sell a piece of land, and pay the rates on it for a whole year, and the buyer has it for half the year, he pays me the rates for the half year. The honourable member gave notice of this amendment, I think, yesterday.",53
370,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It has been on the table for a fortnight or more.,53
371,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"And the month of September is now practically gone. How much notice is that to give to people all over this continent? In my own State, the people have never seen this clause yet, and the fixing of the 30th September is worth nothing to them.",53
372,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,They have had ample notice.,53
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"They have had no notice in the far-away districts. The honourable member thinks of only Melbourne and Sydney. It is most unreasonable to fix a date, and call it a concession, when the period expires two days hence. I cannot understand the reasoning of the honourable member. He says that he wants subdivision, and is doing his best to prevent it.

374,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [5-53J-There is no doubt that this proviso is a great concession from the Government point of view, and makes the Bill very much more acceptable than it was before. But it throws a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the Commissioner. I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" and not for the^ purpose of evading the payment of land tax. Those words are not necessary, because the words ""bond fide sale"" are already used, and they may put into the mind of the Commissioner thoughts that it was never the intention of this House that he should entertain. I cannot see how any one can bond fide dispose of his property a view to evade the payment of land tax.",54
375,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [S-S4]--The words the honourable member proposes to strike out are very necessary. Yesterday, we discussed for hours the insertion of words to make the purpose of a clause quite clear. These words make the purpose of tins clause quite clear, but apparently the honourable member does not desire that. The sale has to be bond fide, but for what purpose? It must not be for the purpose of evading the Act There can be no possible objection to retaining the words. The honourable member ought to give a concrete illustration showing how their retention would be harmful If he could do that, I should be glad to strike them out, but he must provide us with a case. The sale must be bona fide, and not to evade the purpose of the Bill, which is to tax a big holding at a higher rate than a small holding. If the subdivision is to evade the tax, and not for the purpose of a bondfide.subdivision,the owner ought not to get the advantage of it. Mr ..KELLY (Wentworth) [5.57]-- A sale may have been entered into absolutely bond fide in order to get rid of a certain quantity of land, with the 'direct and deliberate object of escaping the penalties of the land tax.",54
376,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is not an evasion. The incidence of the tax is so arranged that PAIRS. if the owner parts with the land the tax Edwards, R. does not fall upon him.",54
377,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The language of the proviso is so indefinite on that point that some Commissioner may hold the view that a Smith, Bruce man who obviously sold his land in order to escape paying the heavier rates of taxation should not get the benefit of the proviso.",54
378,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What does the proposal mean, then?",54
379,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I think it means broadly what the Attorney-General thinks it means ; but it is to be interpreted, not by a Court of law, but by a Commissioner. The words seem to be surplusage, and as we are trusting absolutely to the. discretion of a Commissioner, whose ipse dixit is to be final, it might be safer to leave them out. If the sale is bond fide, that is all we can reasonably ask.",54
380,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [5.59] - I do not think it matters much whether we keep the words in or leave them out. The Privy Council decided, in Sims' case- a South with Australian case-that where a man makes a bond fide arrangement with his family for the purpose of escaping the liability for the tax, it is not an evasion of the tax, but a perfectly legitimate operation. In South Australia, two Judges held otherwise, and the case went to the Privy Council, which sustained the judgment of the Chief Justice of South Australia, as I think is invariably the case. As this proviso only applies until 30th September, I do not think it matters whether we keep the words in or not. I can quite appreciate the anxiety of the honourable member for Moreton that no injustice should be done, but I do not think we can conceive of any case in Australia of an estate having been sold now with a view to repurchase after the 30th September. In any case, the proviso applies only to this year. If it were an annual thing, the words would be clearly necessary, because there might be a sale at the end of the year with a view to repurchase after the 30th June, thus enabling the owners to escape the incidence of the higher rate. The word ""evade"" would be applicable in such case; but, this being a saving provision, I do not see that it matters whether the words are kept in or not. r",54
381,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Moreton) [6.0] - The intention of the Government is that any bond fide sale may be completed; and the inclusion of the words may raise a doubt in the Commissioner's mind as to whether a sale has been made for the purpose of evading the Bill.,55
382,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"He may read "" evade "" as "" escape.""",55
383,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"The Commissioner will put his own construction on the words without any regard as to how we intended them to apply. He may say that a sale effected after the 30th June has been with the object of evading the provisions of the Bill, and he will throw the onus of proof on the owner. If the Commissioner is satisfied that a sale is bond fide, that should be quite sufficient for the Government; and the deletion of the words would be a safeguard against misunderstanding. do not desire to cross swords with the Attorney-General on the matter; but I am asking for an amendment which cannot prove detrimental to the Bill and which will make the clause very much clearer. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment agreed to.",55
384,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [6.2] Does the Attorney-General attach any great importance to the words -"" ending on the thirtieth day of June "" ? I happen to know of some bond fide sales made prior to that date, but they will hardly be regarded as sales under the Bill, seeing that the 15 per cent, provided for in clause 32 was not made. It is very customary to pay a small deposit, and, though the sale actually dates from that time, delivery does not take place until later, in order to allow time to get rid of the stock and so forth.",55
385,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Would it not be a sale as soon as 15 per cent, was paid?",55
386,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Yes , so long as fhat were a bond fide deposit. the Attorney-General would do no harm to the-Bill by simply taking those words out. There are very few instances of the kind, but there are some.",55
387,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [6.4] - If the honourable member means generally that an agreement to sell ought to come within the limits of this proviso in the same way as a conveyance, dated some time between 30th June and the 30th September, I think I see no objection.",55
388,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,That is what I desire.,55
389,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I understand that in such a case there is a legal agreement to sell, that part of the purchase-money has been paid, and tiiat, as with a conveyance, a right of action exists. Under the circumstances, I see no reason why the suggestion should not be acted on. When the Bill is recommitted we shall see that it includes agreements to sell between those dates, exactly in the same way as if they were conveyances.",55
390,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"North Sydney) [6.5]--The way to meet the difficulty raised would be to take an agreement to sell at a certain date as tantamount to a sale, and the same in regard to leases. I have a similar difficulty in regard to a subsequent clause. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 12The following lands shall be exempt from taxation under this Act, namely :I (a) all land owned by a public charitable or public educational institution, however formed or constituted, if carried on for any public charitable or public educational purpose and not for pecuniary profit; (4) all land owned by, and used for the purposes of a local authority or other public authority acting under any State Government; (f) all land owned by a Savings Bank regulated by any State Act; (d) all land, owned by a religious society, the proceeds whereof are devoted to the support of the aged or infirm clergy or ministers of the society or their widows or children; . (e) all land owned by any person or society and used or occupied by that person or society solely as a site for(1) a place of worship for a religious society, or a place of residence for any clergy or ministers or order of a religious society; (2) a charitable or educational institution not carried on for pecuniary profit; (3) a public library, institute, or museum; I think (4) a show ground; (5) a public cemetery or public burial ground; (6) a public garden, public recreation ground, or public reserve; or (7) a public road.",55
391,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [6.6] - I desire to strike out sub-clauses a, b, and e, and to their omission I think the Committee will agree without discussion. I shall then move to insert other sub-clauses in substitution, ancl the discussion can take place on these. move That sub-clauses a, b, and c be left out. Amendment agreed to.",55
392,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [6.7] - I suggest that the sub-clauses I propose to substitute be discussed and decided upon separately; and therefore, I move firstThat the following paragraph be inserted :"" (a) all land owned by a State, or by a municipal, local, or other public authority of a State;""",56
393,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Will these words include the' Metropolitan Board of Works, Melbourne ?",56
394,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is a public authority.,56
395,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Will the words embrace tramways owned by municipalities, as, for instance, those in Melbourne, Bendigo, and Ballarat?",56
396,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In so far as any lands are taxable at all, and in so far as they are held by any public authority, which, of course, includes a municipality, those bodies are exempt.",56
397,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It might also be considered whether the Adelaide Tramway Trust is exempt. These tramways are not municipal in the ordinary sense.,56
398,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is a public authority clearly.,56
399,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"All I desire is that the draftsman might look at the Act under which the Tramway Trust is constituted, because there is a desire that it should be excluded. Even without this provision, all the other bodies are exempt, because we cannot tax either municipal or State ownership.",56
400,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does this sub-clause cover all the exemptions that were asked for by the municipality of Sydney and other municipalities concerned ?,56
401,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes . As to what the honourable member for Angas has said, I think that "" public authority "" will cover a trust formed for carrying on tramways, as in Adelaide. The words clearly cover the Harbor Trust of New South Wales, the - Metropolitan Board of Works of Melbourne, the Water and Sewerage Board in Sydney, and all municipal bodies. If we were to insert the word "" Trust,"" does the honourable member for Angas think that the provision would be made any clearer, as applying to the Tramway Trust in Adelaide ? I am perfectly willing to insert the I word; but I think the Trust is covered by the clause.",56
402,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Personally , I think it is ; but if I were drafting the Bill, I should look very carefully at the constitution of the Trust.",56
403,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I understand that the effect of the interpretation of section 114 of the Constitution in the Railway case, is that we have no power to tax such bodies.",56
404,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There is no doubt that we cannot tax municipal instrumentalities, but the question is whether this Trust is a municipal instrumentality.",56
405,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Sectio n 114 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not impose a tax on property of any kind belonging to a State, and that provision includes municipalities. A State cannot delegate to a subordinate body any powers it does not possess itself-it cannot delegate any authority excepting by virtue of the authority possessed by itself. Anything that a municipality does directly, or indirectly, and anything that a State does, directly or indirectly, must be done by virtue of its public authority; and, therefore, I take it that if we did not insert any words in the Bill, we could not tax a municipality as a corporate entity, or any of its subordinate bodies, such as Boards or Trusts.",56
406,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [6.14] I am glad to have the assurance of the Attorney-Generalbut I . really think there is some doubt whether this clause will exempt, for instance, the Melbourne, Bendigo, and Ballarat tramways.",56
407,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,They are leased.,56
408,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"They are leased under certain rights given fo the municipalities, to which they eventually revert-.",56
409,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,There is no unimproved value in respect of a road.,56
410,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [6.16]. - I do not think that we need trouble about the position of tramway companies, but I should like to point out that, in our dry districts, a number of water trusts, created by Act of Parliament, own water channels and adjoining land. There is such a trust at Ballarat. I am not sure that such a trust could be called either a municipal, local, or pubhc authority, so I ask the Attorney-General to consider their position, and, if he does not think that they are covered by the paragraph, to recommit the clause.",56
411,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [6.17] - 1 emphasize what the honourable member for Balaclava has said. If the words "" public authority "" do not cover water trusts which have borrowed money extensively, and hold large estates, some other words should be inserted.",57
412,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Attorney-General has said that public bodies so constituted are exempt from the operation of the measure.,57
413,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I wish it to be made clear. If the legal members of the Committee think that the word "" trust"" should be inserted in the paragraph, I hope that that will be agreed to.",57
414,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [6.a 8] - In my opinion, the meaning of the paragraph is perfectly clear. If an honourable member wishes to know whether any particular body is or is not covered, he has only to ask himself whether it is a public authority. Is there, outside the Broken Hill Company, any private authority supplying water in Australia? Whether the authorities controlling a water supply are termed a board or a trust, they are exempt from taxation. The provision has been inserted merely to make the intention of the measure clearer, but I doubt whether, even without it, the bodies referred to could be taxed. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the following paragraph be inserted :"" (4) all land owned by a Savings Bank regulated by any Slate Act.""",57
415,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"it the intention of the Attorney-General to include land banks ated by the States, and authorized to advances on the Credit Foncier system?",57
416,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The intention is to empt all Savings Banks. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) proposed' That the following paragraph be inserted :"" (c) all land owned by any society registhe tered under a State Act relating friendly societies or trade unions.""",57
417,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [6.23] This is a fitting time to determine whether the property of mutual building societies should be exempt from taxation. These societiesare registered under State laws, and are kindred to friendly societies, about the desirability of whose exemption there will be hardly any doubt. They are established to encourage thrift, and to assist the working classes in obtaining homes of their own. They do not declare dividends, but under the amendment as it stands their property would be liable to taxation at a high"" rate. When they make advances, they are registered as the absolute proprietors of the securities. A man who borrows from one of these societies to purchase a freehold allows it to register the property in its name, his only title being a deed of defeasance. These societies will, I think, unless specially protected, be liable to taxation on the aggregation of the properties which they hold in trust for various borrowers ; but that is scarcely the desire of the Government. The tax would fall on the thrifty, and could have no effect in bursting up large estates.",57
418,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Fe w of these societies hold much land, except as mortgagees.",57
419,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Yes , but they are registered, not as mortgagees, but as proprietors, of the properties on which money has been borrowed from them. The honourable member for Herbert has given notice of an amendment which would meet the case.",57
420,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [6.26] - I have given notice of an amendment for the protection of what are known as StarrBowkett building societies, which are wholly mutual, the members contributing so much each, and balloting for the right to borrow the whole sum. The winner obtains the money without interest, and uses it generally for building a house, or acquiring a home. I had intended to propose the insertion bf a new paragraph.",57
421,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"If the words "" or cremutual building societies "" were added to make the paragraph, it would meet the case.",57

425,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I suggest that the honourable member should allow the amendment to be agreed to, and submit his proposal as a separate paragraph.",57
426,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Richmond) [8.2] - I wish to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Herbert; but have another amendment to propose providing for the exemption of co-operative dairying and producing companies.,57
427,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [8.3] There will be no objection to the honourable member for Herbert's proposal being inserted as a separate paragraph, if the Attorney-General thinks that that is the more convenient course to adopt; but I should like to know whether the honourable gentleman is in favour of it?",58
428,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney - Attorney-General) [8.4] - I am not in favour of adding it to the proposed new paragraph; but, after the amendment has been disposed of, I shall explain the position of the Government with regard to building societies and co-operative societies generally. Amendment of the amendment, by leave, withdrawn - Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr BAMFORD) proposed - That the following new paragraph be inserted :- "" cc. All land owned by a building society registered under any State Act relating to building societies and conducted on co-operative or mutual principles.""",58
429,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney - At torney-General) [8.6] - Wit h the object that the honourable member for Herbert has in view, I am entirely in sympathy; but am not quite clear as to the extent to which the amendment would go. The honourable member has omitted from the amendment of which he originally gave notice the words. "" and from the operations of which no individual or company derives profit."" With those words, its application was clear; but, as it stands, I do not think that it is. In clause 37, we provide that members of a mutual life assurance society shall be separately assessed, and the mutual principle, I understand, in its application to a life assurance company means that the profits are divided amongst the individual members of it. Starr-Bowkett societies, which my honourable friend has in mind, are admirable institutions; but they are subject to some practical disabilities. As some honourable members seem to be busily engaged in explaining something to each other, it appears to be useless to explain to the Committee the position that the Government take up.",58
430,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [8.9] - I am in doubt as to what is the real intention of the honourable member for Herbert in proposing this amendment. It appears, at the first view, to be a rather dangerous proposition.",58
431,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Is it dangerous not to tax these societies?,58
432,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I do not say that it is.,58
433,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is what the honourable member's remark implied.,58
434,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member is at liberty to place his own interpretation upon my remarks; but he must net commit me to it. The honourable member for Herbert has not explained his amendment.,58
435,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,I did before we adjourned for dinner; but I do not think that the honourable member was present.,58
436,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I have not been absent one moment from the chamber during the Committee stage of this Bill. We have no explanation from this side as to the meaning of the amendment.,58
437,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We never get any explanation from that side of the Committee.,58
438,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Perhaps it is because the honourable member does not care to listen to our dulcet tones. If we are to exempt building societies carried on under cooperative principles, why should we not exempt all co-operative societies? I am personally interested in a co-operative society, but do not desire, at all events at present, that such societies shall be exempt. If the enterprise and industry displayed by a man in becoming a member of a building society are to be recognised by exemption from this tax, then it seems to me to be a very small addition to the principle to exempt all co-operative societies. I fail to see why only co-operative societies relating to the building trade should be exempt when the same principle is followed in connection with all co-operative concerns. At present the amendment appears to me altogether too wide, and possibly the honourable member for Herbert does not care to explain its far-reaching effects. Since we are completely in the dark as to what is intended, we may reasonably term the amendment dangerous until some further explanation is made.",58
439,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [8.14]. - I hope that the honourable member for Herbert will press his amendment. We are told that the New Zealand Act is an excellent model, and that we should follow it. Under that Act all land held by any building society duly registered under any Act relating to building societies is exempt, and it is declared that the annual or other dividends or profits paid or credited to any member or shareholder of any such society shall be deemed to be part of his income, and be taxable accordingly. Building societies which are carrying on operations in Australia are subject, in some cases, either to dividend duty tax or income tax. The exemption proposed by the honourable member for Herbert and the honourable member for Bendigo embodies exactly what is done in New Zealand. It is a fair and reasonable exemption to make on its merits, because building societies are co-operative companies.",58
440,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Some are.,59
441,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Thos e registered under special Building Society Acts are, as a rule, co-operative companies formed for the purpose of enabling people to combine amongst themselves to build their own homes.",59
442,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Quite a number of them are speculative organizations of a proprietary kind.,59
443,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have in mind some of the Queensland cases, where hundreds of little homes have been built through the agency of building societies. A company is formed, deposits are made by different persons, who pay small sums at regular intervals, and the combined funds are used for the purpose of advancing money to. different people to build their own homes.",59
444,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Is that the StarrBowkett ?,59
445,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am dealing, not with the Starr-Bowkett, but with mutual building societies.",59
446,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,They would not be taxed on the money that they lend in that way.,59
447,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The properties which they technically own may be held to be their property, and subject to taxation. This is a class of investment and organization that we do not want to tax. The honourable member for Herbert knows that on the Darling Downs large numbers of people have been able to get their homes through the agency of these purely cooperative building societies, who, without them, would not have been able to get their own homes at all. The real object of the Bill, as the honourable member for Coolgardie put it, is to tax land so as to enable people to become owners of their own homes. If the Government include, as the subjects of taxation, the very institutions which enable people to get their own homes, they will cut right across the very principle of their own legislation. matter is important, because in a case decided in New South Wales-The Commissioners of Taxation v. St. Joseph's Investment and Building Society-it was held that the respondent society were the mortthe gagees in possession of a large number of parcels of land which had been mortgaged to them by different mortgagors, and that the society, being mortgagee in possession, and not a bare trustee of different estates, was entitled to only one deduction on the aggregate value of all the parcels of land. The building societies should be entirely exempt from the provisions 6f this Bill. No advantage is to be gained, and no big estates will be burst up, by taxing them. On the contrary, the Commonwealth will be taking revenue from the very contributions paid to the societies which enable people to get their own homes. They are the small investors, who should be helped, and not discouraged. I can understand the Attorney-General saying that he does not know how far the proposed amendment will go, but if the words were put in it would be easy to recommit the Bill, and technically define them. None of us want to put in words that will leave the measure too open. We want to keep companies that are not bond fide out of it. I hope the Attorney General will see his way to grant the exemption asked for.",59
448,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.20] - The object of the Government is to make the exemptions cover every case that ought properly to be exempted. There are building societies and similar institutions that ought not to come under the operation of the Bill, but the question is to what extent the amendment will open the door to others. The honourable member for Melbourne has given notice of an amendment to tax building societies generally to the extent of only half the amount. On the face of it, that is a proposition to which we could not readily assent. On the whole, I think it is far better to exempt them altogether, or to tax them. With regard to societies that are mutual in their nature, like a mutual life association, we have provided, without exempting them in set terms, that each person shall be assessed separately, the practical effect, of course, being that they are exempt. Whether it would be advisable to include all other mutual societies carrying on business on a mutual basis in the same or a similar class, is a matter which I should like to have an opportunity of considering. This I should be glad if the honourable member will give me an opportunity to look into the matter, with a view to putting all building and other societies conducted on a mutual principle, on the same footing, where it can be safely done without jeopardizing the interests of the Bill. The matter ought to be looked into. I say candidly that the intention of the Government is not to tax any interest which makes for thrift and for the better distribution of land. It is, in fact, the very contrary. At the same time, there are some of these StarrBowkett societies promoted for various purposes, such as providing a manager with a billet, or giving work to conveyancers, and so on; but, generally speaking, I think it is entirely desirable to exempt building societies. I shall be glad if the honourable member will withdraw the amendment, and allow us to deal with .the matter generally on the recommittal of the Bill.",59
449,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [8.24]. - The Committee would be saved a great deal of time if we could, at this early stage, make a distinction. The Attorney General now says that the Government are prepared to wholly admit the desirability of encouraging thrift through genuine mutual co-operative organizations. difficulty, as he has pointed out, is that many of these organizations or associations are started with a mutual principle, but also with another principle present, by which profits are derived from them by individuals. I could name insurance companies which have the word ""mutual "" in their title, but from which certain men are receiving large profits. The word "" mutual"" may be used as an attraction to the public to operate through these organizations, although I do not say it is so. I have every sympathy with the thrift side of these organizations, and with every association that is formed to enable people of small means to help one another by cooperative methods, in the form of friendly societies, insurance companies, or building societies, towards a little saving of their means or earnings; but I should be against including any organizations in the exemption which have underneath them a profit being drawn by promoters or proprietors. The amendment which the honourable member for Herbert proposed contained, in its first form, but not in its ultimate form, words which saved the situation in that regard, because it provided that no profits should be derived by individuals promoting the organization. The Committee seems to lie of one mind on the whole question, and it simply remains for the Attorney-General to shape a provision, either by additions to clause 37, or by another clause, by which all mutual associations shall be absolved from the tax, provided there are no profits being derived.",60
450,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Some one must get some profits.,60
451,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Not necessarily. I can tell the honourable member of many companies which are quite free from any but mutual profits, and of one, at least, very large insurance company in Australia which is supposed to be conducted on mutual principles, but from which very large dividends are being paid to the originators in the form of a commission on the management. If the honourable member looks into some of the great American organizations for insurance purposes, he will find that there are what are called founders' shares, by which immense profits have been derived by these so-called mutual societies for individuals, who have grown extremely rich by using the innocent and alluring word "" mutual "" for the purpose of drawing the public in. The Attorney-General could save a lot of time and The discussion if he undertook to frame a clause which would recognise the merits of the purely mutual form of association, and exclude the other kind which I have mentioned.",60
452,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [8.27] - I have no objection to adopting the suggestion of the Attorney-General. In moving the amendment I had my mind specially directed to Starr-Bowkett societies, and no others. I did not include the societies referred to by the honourable member for Darling Downs. I know of them, and have been a shareholder myself, but they are of such a character that individuals do derive a profit. In Starr-Bowkett societies there is no profit for any individual, nor for .the society as a society. There are no actual profits other than what may be derived from fines or sales of books of rules, and so on. This goes for managerial expenses, and the secretary is the only one who has anything out of it. That cannot be said to be a profit.",60
453,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Do those societies own large areas of land?,60
454,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"They may be mortgagees. I do not say that they come under the operation of the measure at all. They may fall below the exemption, but I want to have it made clear that if they did become taxable under the Bill, as it stands, they should be protected to that extent.",60
455,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It is hardly conceivable that, having regard to their principles, they will be taxable.",61
456,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It will do no harm to explicitly exempt them' in the Bill, and it might do good. The honourable member for Adelaide is rather exacting in asking me for a full explanation in regard to building societies. The only societies referred to in my amendment are Starr-Bowkett societies. As to the other societies referred to by the honourable member for Parkes, I may say that I am a policyholder in one, and derive direct benefit in the shape of bonuses.",61
457,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I was not speaking of bonuses, but of proprietary'interests.",61
458,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I am going further, and saying that bonuses might be honestly declared to be profits under the Bill, i i i the Starr-Bowkett societies, however, there are no profits, but all the money advanced is without interest; so that we may say there are benefits without profits. However, I now ask leave to withdraw the amendment, on receiving an undertaking that the Attorney-General will look into the whole matter, and, if possible, draft an amendment to meet the case.",61
459,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [8.32] Co-operative and mutual building societies are registered under the Friendly Societies Act in New South Wales; but Starr-Bowkett societies cannot be so registered, nor can a building society, unless it is wholly and solely mutual. I have in my mind three so-called mutual building societies, which, however, would not be regarded as such for the purposes of this Bill, inasmuch as they purchase large areas of land and erect buildings on them. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",61
460,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.33] - I now desire to move a new sub-clause (d), dealing with public charitable and educational institutions.",61
461,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I handed you, Mr Chairman, an amendment, which I asked you to submit before the new sub-clause referred to by the Attorney-General was placed before the Committee.",61
462,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I was under the impression that both the amendment referred to by the honourable member for Illawarra and that of the honourable member for Richmond dealt with mutual life assurance companies.,61
463,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [8.34] What I desire is an intimation from the Attorney-General as to how he proposes to deal with sjch companies or societies. When I handed the amendment to you, Mr. Chairman, I had in my mind such societies as the Australian Mutual Provident Society, - and not societies like those referred to by the honourable member for Parkes. I had no idea of including societies carried on for personal or private gain. I desire the Attorney-General to consider the position of societies like the Australian Mutual Provident Society, carrying on business in the Commonwealth. If I have an assurance that these will be considered, together with others that have been mentioned, and dealt with on recommittal, I shall be satisfied for the present.",61
464,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.35] - I shall be very glad to include institutions of the class mentioned by the honourable member for Illawarra ami others.,61
465,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Includin g dairying societies.,61
466,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall be glad to include in the consideration co-operative dairying societies and others which, in the opinion of honourable members, ought fo come within the exemption. I now move That the following paragraph be inserted :(d) all land owned by a public charitable or public educational institution, if the institution, however formed or constituted, is carried on solely for public charitable or public educational purposes and not for pecuniary profit; I find that, according to section 16, subsection 5, of the New Zealand Act, there are exempted in die Dominion any public charitable or public educational institution, however formed or constituted, if carried on for any public purpose, and not for pecuniary profit. As a matter of fact, the proposed new sub-clause is taken word for word from the New Zealand Act. In the New Soulh Wales Act, the exemptions are classified in a different fashion, but they include public charitable or educational institutions, and specify, in addition, some particular educational institutions, but none are carried on for pecuniary profit.",61
467,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [8.38] - I beg to move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the word "" public "" before the word "" charitable."" I propose, later, to move also that the word ""public"" be omitted before the word ""educational,"" and that the word "" solely,"" which does not occur in the original sub-clause, be also excised. I shall not debate the last-mentioned matter now, but merely refer the Attorney-General to a recent .book on rating, in which the word "" solely "" is said to, in nine cases out of ten, destroy the object of Parliament. The amendment which I now propose will bring within the exemptions institutions which are charitable, but which are not public in the sense of being controlled or supported by the State. I have in my mind various benevolent institutions, some under religious bodies, for the purpose of helping the weak and unfortunate, and finding new ways of life for them. If the word "" public"" be retained, these societies will be excluded from the exemptions; and I am sure every honourable member wishes that those legitimate efforts of benevolent people, and the public through their subscriptions, shall receive the same recognition as institutions that have to rely on the State for what should come from benevolence.",61
468,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"The object is to strike out the word "" public "" throughout the clause?",62
469,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Yes .,62
470,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I object to that.,62
471,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"VV e ought to encourage everything that will lead to the development of charity, promote mutual assistance, and ultimately realise, perhaps, that truly Christian state in which man recognises, through the benevolence of his neighbour, that he is one with him. I do not wish to labour the point, because I think the amendment should pass without argument. Honourable members must have wide experience as to the extent to which various societies, religious and benevolent, are deavouring to cope with charitable work.",62
472,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.43] - I direct attention to sub-clause e of the exemptions, from which it will be found that land owned by any person or society, and used exclusively as a site for a charitable or educational institution not carried on for pecuniary profit, is already exempt, as well as public charitable and educational institutions. The only difference is that the proposed new sub-clause has relation, not so much to the lands, although it does relate to them, as to the proceeds. So far as the land itself is concerned on which charitable or educational institutions are erected, it is exempt.",62
473,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Onl y the site?,62
474,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes , the land on which an institution stands; therefore, the discussion ought to turn on the question of proceeds, as distinguished from land. An institution may own land other than the land on which the institution itself is erected. It may use the proceeds of these lands for other than pecuniary profits, and they will be exempted from taxation if the institution falls under the heading of a public educational or a public charitable institution.",62
475,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The Bill does not deal with the proceeds of land.,62
476,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We can exempt from taxation any land, and propose to exempt land the rents and profits from which are devoted to particular purposes. The sites on which charitable and educational institutions stand are exempted by paragraph e.",62
477,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [8.46] Paragraph e of the clause exempts the sites of all charitable institutions, whether public or not. The question raised by the amendment is whether the lands held by an educational or charitable institution apart from the site on which its buildings are erected shall be exempted from taxation. I think that we may well pause before determining to exempt such lands held by charitable institutions. In some cases, they are lands with which the institutions have been endowed, but in other cases they have been purchased with funds which have been collected, ancl it is doubtful whether the purposes of charity would not have been better served by expending the money directly in charitable relief than by investing it, to dole out the annual revenue.",62
478,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Sometime s money is left en- by will to be put to a capital account.,62
479,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That is so. It must not be forgotten that we have heard of charitable institutions the major portion of whose revenues go to meet the expenses of management, only small sums being available for charitable relief. It is questionable whether the lands held by such societies, apart from the sites on which their buildings are erected, should be exempted from taxation. The honourable member for Angas desires to strike out the word "" public "" everywhere in relation to educational institutions, and I hope that that will be done. The words "" and not for pecuniary profit"" are a sufficient safeguard. There are large numbers of educational institutions endowed with lands the proceeds of which are devoted solely to educational purposes, and we, on this side, should be the last to prevent education being as free, full, and complete as it is possible to conceive. If the word "" public "" is used before ""educational institutions"" there will be grave doubt as to whether the lands of certain institutions that have been endowed will be exempt from taxation, because those institutions charge fees to students, though both the proceeds of their lands and the fees are used solely for educational purposes, no person receiving any profit from them. Some institutions may hold land whose unimproved value is thousands of pounds. In some cases specific pieces of land have been given in trust for scholarship purposes. No one would desire that such lands should be taxed. While I agree with the honourable member for Angas that the word "" public "" should not be used before the word ""educational,"" I should like, for the reasons I Have mentioned, to hear further argument before striking out the word ""public"" before the word ""charitable:""",62
480,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [8.55]. - In my opinion, the words "" and not for pecuniary profit "" should be struck out. Institutions like the Wesley College, the Church of England Grammar School, the Presbyterian Ladies' College, the convent schools, and other institutions throughout Australia cannot be kept going without charging fees. My father paid for my education at the Melbourne Grammar School, yet it is a public institution in the sense in which the large English schools are public ; it is not conducted for the making of profits to be distributed amongst the proprietors. The University of Sydney has had some very large bequests, and Challis House, opposite the General Post Office there, was erected out of the funds provided in that way. The University, of course, collects rents for that building. Then the Ballarat OrphanDraftsman on this age has reclaimed 50 or 60 acres of wornout mining land on which it has a market garden and farm, the produce of which is sold, and the proceeds used for the maintee tenance of the institution. In my opinion, such land should not be taxable. block occupied by the Church of England Grammar School here has an enormous unsome improved value which, if taxed, would have to pay more than any income that could be obtained from the school.",63
481,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,The same may be said one of the block occupied by the St. Xavier's College at Kew.,63
482,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The sites of educational or charitable institutions are clearly' exempt by paragraph e. ' Mr AGAR WYNNE - The clause speaks of charitable or educational institutions '' not carried on for pecuniary profit."" It seems to me that these words make the lands of such institutions as those to which I have referred taxable.",63
483,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"What does the honourable member understand by "" pecuniary profit"" ?",63
484,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The fees charged for students, and the proceeds of the produce of land. The Salvation Army has farms outside most of our large cities, on which it grows produce which it sells for the benefit of its charities. Such lands would be taxable under the Bill. Under this provision mechanics' institutes may not be exempt, because the committees of such institutions let their halls and charge rent for them.",63
485,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There are English cases in which it is held that, in such circumstances, the exemption goes.",63

I would point out that the lands of The many religious institutions are held by cor- poration trusts, under special deeds, or, in cases, the synod or governing body of the church is made a corporation. The institutions receive only the rents or profits, apd we need to exempt both the trustees and the persons who get the profits. In or two cases, a question has been raised as to whether a distinction is made between the owners, who are the trustees, and the institutions themselves.

In some cases, an cational institution on land vested in tees, and which charges no fees, is held be a public institution; but the difficulty to determine whether by the mere act of charging fees the privilege of being a ""public"" institution is not destroyed. think that the Committee desires to premay serve from taxation all charitable and cational institutions that are substantially intended for the benefit of the community generally, notwithstanding that they may be limited to specific denominations or percollect sons, provided that they are not carried on by some individual for his own personal gain.",64

502,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Angas has intimated that he intends to move an amendment of the amendment dealing with those words. If a man accepted an offer to carry on an institution as charity and to get what he could out of it, he would probably be carrying it on for his own pecuniary gain, but the institutions to which I have referred are not conducted in that way. The salaries of the teachers in public schools are fixed by public committees, and come out of the funds. Tn other cases public institutions are carried on by sisterhoods, who give their services free of cost, with the result that the whole of the fees charged go to the institution concerned. In other cases teachers are apand receive small salaries to carry on institutions, and all these should be from taxation since they are not on for pecuniary gain or profit. by em Mr Bruce SMITH (Parkes) [9.8] The honourable member for Balaclava edupointed out that the words "" and not for truspecuniary profit"" might be interpreted to otherwise than the Attorney-General thinks is they ought to be interpreted ; and we have to remember that we shall not have the benefit of the honourable gentleman's decision when I these questions arise. The Commissioner take a different view. The honourable edumember for Balaclava has pointed out that in some cases institutions which come within the exemption provisions, invest their money in a building from which they rents, and he expressed some anxiety lest these snould be held to be properties which should be taxed since they produce a. commercial result in the shape of rents. think that we are all anxious to provide that where one of these institutions so invests its money as to derive a profit in the shape of interest from its [accumulated that investment shall not, in itself, constitute it a profit-making concern. I the Attorney-General, therefore to consider whether he does not need some and modification of the proposed amendment. to Passing from that question I desire to know whether the Attorney-General does not think it would be desirable to deal with all these institutions, including building societies and mutual life assurance and friendly societies, in one clause providing for their exemption. As it is, we have one set of institutions dealt with in clause and another in an earlier part of the Bill.",64
503,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-At - applies torney-General) [9.12] - I have no objecknown tion to that. The matter which the Comevidently mittee is now discussing is one of grave interest to large numbers of our fellow citizens. I share with honourable members generally the desire to make this tax press as lightly as possible upon every interest, and especially upon those of which mention has just been made. The word"" "" public charitable or public educational institution "" are by no means unambiguous, and the decisions that have been given under the land and income tax law of point ? New South Wales unfortunately clo not make the position clear. They deal with public charitable, rather than wit!) ] ublic educational, purposes. Under the New South Wales Act a number cational institutions are specified as being exempt. For instance, the University exempt affiliated colleges, ancl the Sydney Grammar School are by name exempted. The institutions that are not so exempted are, of course, liable to taxation. question is what is a charity? According to the technical legal meaning, it covers very wide field, and would not appear to be at all limited by the popular meaning of the term, but it seems to be generally admitted that there must be some public purpose. It need not be a public purpose in which the whole community share, and its benefits may be restricted to a comon the recommittal. paratively small proportion of the community. It may be for the relief of ciate poverty, for the advancement of education or religion, or for other purposes beneficial to the community. It has been laid down, in the New South Wales Courts that words "" public charitable purposes "" have a special and more limited meaning, are not to be construed in their technical, acquired, and legal sense, although they pretty far even there. For instance, in case decided under the Municipalities Act in New South Wales, "" benevolent instituyears tion "" was held to include St. Martha's Industrial Home, conducted by the Sisters of the Order of St. Joseph as a home for destitute and orphan girls. The institution received a substantial sum from fees and what sale of work, but not enough to cover the expense of carrying it on, and the dethe ficiency was made good, and somein what more than made good, by voluntary subscriptions. Similarly, a refuge supported by donations, and carried on in a building 37 used for private worship, was held to be a benevolent institution. The same thing to the Home of Hbpe, a very wellinstitution in our State, where they live on something more than hope. I submit that there is no necessity to leave out the word "" public "" before the word ""charitable."" "" Public charitable purposes "" is a term sufficiently wide to cover the whole field of charity, and if ""public"" were struck out, I doubt very much whether anything could be construed to be a charity that did not effect a public purpose.. Can the honourable and learned member find a decision bearing on that",65
504,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"There was a case in New South Wales where a charity school was held not to come under "" charitable institutions,"" because fees were received of edufrom some of the scholars.",65
505,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am anxious to every charitable institution that is properly charitable, and shall be glad of the name of that case. The New South Wales and New Zealand Acts speak of The public charitable purposes. The South Australian Act and the Victorian Bill do a not use the word "" public."" I do not want to refuse the amendment without the best of reasons, and I confess that there appear to be conflicting authorities. I should like to be allowed to look into the cases, and, if the honourable member is agreeable, this exemption can be considered and dealt with",65
506,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [9.24] - I apprethe spirit in which the Attorney-General has approached the question, but I do not know that much more information can be got upon it. There is a leading English the case, Pensel v. The Commissioner of Taxes, decided about 1894, which defines and what the Privy Council considered was meant by charities. The same significance go would not attach to the term in Australia, a because at Home there are charities under various Acts for the last five or six hundred of which we know nothing, but even there they must not be institutions which are self-regarding. I think it has been decided that the receipt of fees is not the essential difference between what is and is not a charity. It is the object of the application of the moneys that determines charity, and common sense will follow the line of judicial decision on that point. If an institution can further its own objects, which must be charitable, by the receipt of fees, so long as those fees are only applied to the maintenance or the development of the institution it still retains its essential character as a charitable instithe tution. In South Australia, the words of the Act are "" solely for charitable or religious purposes."" The word "" public "" is not used. There was a test case there about five or six years ago as to the meaning of those words in the Waterworks Act. I appeared for one of the institutions-I think the Sisters of St. Joseph-and some other refuges. There is no doubt about their being strictly charities. They are supported by sisters, whose motives in life every one will respect. They do not get a penny piece for themselves, and in some cases have really to deny themselves a good deal in order to keep the institution going. The Crown, after hearing the merits of the case, declared that, whether the Act did or did not cover the case, they would not insist upon the tax if certain conditions in regard to inspection were complied with. Consequently, the defence was never gone into, the requisition for the tax or rates was abated, and the case is left undecided so far as the Supreme Court is concerned. I have not much doubt that the decision .would have been that the institution was a charity within the apparent intention of the Legislature, and ought not to be taxed, as none of the funds were applied to other than charitable purposes. I have in my mind in this matter all institutions which serve every end that benevolence recognises, and which ought not to come under our taxing power. I do not think that, if the Attorney-General looks up the English case I mentioned, or the Victorian case decided some years ago, or the New South Wales cases referred to, he will get much more light than common sense will throw upon the interpretation of these words. In the South Australian Act, there is no limitation to the effect that the institution is not to exist for pecuniary profit. We are putting in additional words of limitation in that regard, which will prevent the possibility of institutions carried on purely for private ends being exempt. I propose to move to add, after the words "" pecuniary profit,"" the words "" applied to other than such charitable or educational purpose."" Then, even if the institution is self-supporting in the sense of doing some work and getting paid for it, and the proceeds being applied to the maintenance of the Mr Glynn. institution, but there being no division of profits amongst the members of the institution, it will still be exempt. Our common sense ought to regard such an institution as one that should be exempt from taxing powers exercised under this Bill.",65
507,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [9.30] - I understand that, so far as the word "" public "" before ""charitable"" is concerned, the Attorney-General desires to look into the matter in view of the suggestions which have been made, and I should not like anything to be done when there is some disagreement, because it may subsequently be found that we are unanimous on the point. Under the circumstances, perhaps the honourable member for Angas would be prepared to let the clause pass.",66

509,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"We seem to be fairly unanimous in striking out the word "" public "" before ""educational,"" and we might do that now, leaving the other matter to be considered on recommittal. At present I cannot quite gather what is the exact position.",66

527,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The leases are all for a limited term.,68
528,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Yes . I believe that the Government lays claim to the minerals in any land. In some cases a mineral lease is let to a coal-mining company, and the surface is leased for agricultural or other purposes. The position is the same in the electorate represented by the honourable member for Hunter, and in one or two other constituencies. I should like to know exactly how such companies will be dealt with under the Bill. Some mining companies retain only sufficient of the surface to enable them to carry on screening and coking operations, ancl so forth, the rest of the land being leased for other purposes. The land is sometimes freehold and sometimes leasehold. The surface rights are occasionally sold, while the minincr company retains all miqeral right's.

It is dealt with in paragraph a of clause 26, and if honourable members desire to limit the operation of lhat clause, they will be able to propose amendments when it is before us. Mining companies cannot be included in the general exemption.",68

That is as wide a provision as that which I intend to ask the Committee to accept in this case.

This is an important amendment, but I shall not discuss it at length, because ought to be decided upon the knowledge have of the inconvenience which would sult from our insisting upon annual returns being furnished. We started in South Australia with triennial returns, but those were found to be inconvenient and simply harassing. In 1902 the law. was altered South Australia, so as to require that assessments should made only once in every five years. Undet this clause we provide for an annual return, and at least several persons will be obliged to make returns, subject to the penalties of this Bill, as against only one under South Australian Act. Under that Act first return was made in 1885, and from 47,000 to 50,000 returns were received. On that basis we shall have under this something like 600,000 returns. make allowance for those who, for the purpose of this measure, will have to make returns, there may be more, even though no returns are made by those who own less than Â£5,000 worth. going to insist that annual returns shall be made? Surely, if a valuation made for one year, it ought to inure for three or' four years. It is unnecessary every year to test whether there is a rise fall in values. It requires more than year to accurately determine what has been the addition to the unimproved value of land. If a slight leakage did occur, would be in favour of the owner, and the taxpayer would not suffer very much. the revenue shrank to too great a degree, we could always increase the productive rates under the tax. There would be no harm in providing tfyit a valuation should operate for two or three years.",69
539,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I think it is possible for the Commissioner to demand a return any time. [138],69
540,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I believe the office would not ask for a return, after their honfirst experience of that system in South",69
541,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"How does the honourable member arrive at his estimate of 600,000 returns ?",69
542,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There were from 47,000 to 50,000 returns in South Australia in - . 1885, with a much smaller population. In that State only two classes of persons had make a return-the owner in fee-simple out, or its equivalent, and, if the land was held in trust, the trustee. Under this Bill, not only the owner of the fee-simple, but a lessee, a sub-lessee, beneficial owners, it and others have to make a return. we Making allowance for the difference rein population, I think I am not far out in saying that 500,000 or 600,000 returns will have to be sent in every year; even and we shall have the position which has been arrived at in England, where they, cannot deal with the returns. In it was found that the rebo turns were so erratic, even when sent in by honest men, and that there were such honest differences of opinion, that the Commissioner got no guidance from them as to what he should do; and after his first the experience of returns, he did not seek the the aid of them. They now let the Department make the assessment; notice is given to each taxpayer, and if he thinks the asBill sessment is unfair, he appeals. I do not If we think we require to do more than that. I hope, in the circumstances, the Government will consider the desirableness of not insisting on an annual return. I should like to see one Federal valuation made every Are we three years, and let the States adopt it for their purposes also. It could be made in is concert with the States, on some basis ! which could be agreed upon, so as to save the necessity of harassing people unduly or with our various systems of taxation. I hope, a eventually, that every system, including municipal rates, water rates, and every thing else, will be based on the unimproverj it value of land; and that we shall realise the ideal of having one unimproved assessI f ment right through Australia, which may be used for State as well as Federal purposes. Although we cannot attain that ideal at once, we can do something to bring ourselves into line with the States by having the assessment as near as possible on the dates on which they make theirs. Let us, therefore, start with a triennial assessat ment. Advantage might be taken of the assessment that is now being made in South Australia; and that will; perhaps, be published within the next few weeks. By that means, a good deal of trouble could besaved.",69
543,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [10.15;. - I should like to suggest a medium course. I recognise that the measure will require an enormous number of returns for the whole Commonwealth. If South Australia, some years ago, with a comparatively small population, required from 40,000 to 50,000 returns, we may safely conclude that the number will be 600,000. or 700,000 for the whole Commonwealth. To require these returns to be sent in every year by Statute is rather arbitrary. Very little change may take place over a period of three years in the general value of lands. The Attorney General might accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Angas, while still giving the Commissioner power to have a fresh assessment made at any time within the three years if he thought it desirable. If the Commissioner sees that there is but little fluctuation in the land market, he might allow the assessment to run for another year.",70
544,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,He has a right to do so under this clause.,70
545,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If that is so, I should like the Attorney-General to consider whether it would not be better to make the term three years in the first place, leaving the Commissioner power to makf it less, if necessary. .",70
546,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [10.17] - I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Angas. In South Australia, the three years' periodical assessment was continued for a considerable time; and the change from three to five years was brought about to save money during times of very severe stress. While the change from three to five years might not have been for the better, it would be a distinct advantage to substitute a three-year for an annual period in this Bill. The Minister of External Affairs knows that, when the periodical assessment is made in South Australia, the taxation offices are crowded with extra hands. An annual assessment under this Bill would entail an extra amount of work, and an attendant cost that would not be justified. A big army would be required in the Taxation Department, and a three years' periodical valuation is all that is necessary to catch the fluctuations in the value of land. I am strongly against requiring die individual land-owner to send in his own return. The system is copied from the original New Zealand Act; but I believe it is .being set aside there because it has proved entirely unsatisfactory. Three or"" four years ago, I was told by one of the Ministers who was in charge of that Department in New Zealand that the system was found in practice to be bad. They had more people making an over, than an under, estimate; and the system was so unsatisf actory that they abandoned the principle of every man making his own assessment for a better one under which the Department made it.",70
547,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Lan d tax returns ih South Australia are submitted every year.,70
548,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"No , certainly not. I am a land taxpayer in South Australia, and I do not submit a return every year. I submit one every five years. It is here provided, however, that every year the individual owner shall make his own assessment. It would be infinitely better if the New South Wales and South Australian systems were adopted by the Commonwealth instead of the system of requiring each individual owner to make his own assessment.",70
549,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.21.] - The Government cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Angas. The valuations are to be made by the Commissioner, not every year, but when he pleases. Under the New South Wales Act return's are called for every year. They may include any particulars. They may include, and usually do include-the y have always included within my recollection-the value of land. There is nothing unusual in this. It is the practice followed in New Zealand and in New South Wales. The object is to burst up estates and settle people on the land. It is desired, therefore, to exempt persons who in a previous year were liable to the tax, but who, having subdivided, are no longer liable. We desire to see how the country progresses under a tax of this sort-whether , in point of fact, values are going up or down. It is an excellent thing to take an annual valuation. The amount of trouble to the taxpayer is quite negligible. He will have to furnish an annual return, and the question whether he shall furnish an annual valuation is merely one of putting down a few morefigureson his already voluminous return.",70
550,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [10.23]. - I wish to direct the Attorney-General's attention to the need, in some part of the Bill, for a provision dealing with a class of case in which, after the assessment is made, a sale is made of part of the property. If an assessment is made for this year, and a month or two after a sale is made of a part of the property to another owner, I think there is not any provision in the Bill which will entitle the taxpayer to recover the proportion of the year's tax - to shift it on to the buyer.",71
551,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I do not know of a provision of the Bill that would enable that to' be done. We might very properly consider the point.,71
552,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Will the Attorney-General make a note of the point ?,71
553,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Certainly . Mr Mahon <Coolgardie) [10.25] - . One of the weaknesses of any scheme of land taxation in a country like this must be the cost, not merely to the Government, but to the individual taxpayer. perience has shown that it is very heavy. In his remarks to the Committee - the Attorney-General appears to be utterly indifferent to this aspect-of the matter, and this is the: more regrettable because excessive cost of collection will be - a strong argument against the continuance of land taxation. The honourable gentleman said just now that it was a mere trifle' for a man who was making up his annual return to include also the particulars required in clause. 14. The particulars required in that clause include a full and complete statement of the land owned by theindividual on the 30th June last. Now, there are very few alterations in the ownership of land throughout a year in proportion to the total number of assessments that must be made. I have it on the very best authority-that of a gentleman who has had practical experience in a land tax office in another State-that the cost of these annual assessments will be enormous. He saysTo fumish a return of land in each nnancial year would involve taxpayers in tremendous expense. The preparation of a big land tax return is a formidable affair. Once furnished, it should, after verification, be the basis; and subsidiary returns might be provided for in respect of sales and acquisitions. Then he adds' The necessity fbr these returns could he avoided by providing that the first return should, when dealt with, be regarded as the basis, and thenceforward - as land was acquired or sold, particulars thereof should be promptly fur038J3 nished to the Commissioner, who would add or take from the original return. Take the case of a large bank 01 society or land mortgage company whose own first return would cover many sheets of demy-sized paper; they would have a substantial grievance if compelled to furnish practically the same particulars each year. While it may be comparatively easy to deal with the returns made by new taxpayers, if the Commissioner is obliged to verify each separate return and to compare it with the previous returns of the same taxpayer, he will require a very large staff of officials. As the Attorney-General finds it necessary to indulge in second thoughts in respect of some of theamendments which have been submitted, he may very fairly devote his attention to the proposal of the honourable member for Angas. It seems to be a more workable and less costly arrangement than that proposed in the Bill.",71
554,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [10:31] - I wish to point out that in South Australia a tax at one rate is levied upon land up to Ex- .Â£5,000 value, and a tax at another rate upon land in excess of that value. The same practice is adopted in checking the subdivision of lands. That is accomplished by the Taxation Department being kept informed by the Registrar of Titles of every land transaction which takes place. The fact that an assessment is m'ade every five years does not make the slightest difference to the owners of land. Consequently there is nothing in the objection of the Attorney-General regarding the necessity of effecting an alteration according to the way in which properties have been subdivided. VVe can provide in this Bill for the necessary information being supplied through the State Registrars of Titles Offices. But I object to the whole scheme of the Bill in regard to the assessment of land. I was told in Adelaide last week, by the solicitor of an estate which has a rent roll of about jÂ£is;ooo or ^14,000 a year, that to fumish the Department with the returns contemplated under this measure will cost that estate about jÂ£i,ooo annually. This may be an exaggeration. There is not to be one general valuation made by the Commissioner; therefore, there will be no uniformity in regard to the comparative valuations. These are matters to which I deem it my. duty to call attention. I regret that the Government are not prepared to prevent inconvenience by dispensing with these annua) - returns. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 15 to 17 agreed to. Clause 18 (Assessment in case of default or unsatisfactory return).",71
555,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [10.35] - As a matter of drafting, I think that the Attorney-General might look at this clause in conjunction with clause 40 of the Bill, which deals with appeals. In this provision the words ""taxpayer"" or ""person"" are used, and under it a "" person "" will be' at liberty to appeal, whereas under clause 40 the appeal must be by a "" taxpayer."" Clause agreed to. Clause 19 agreed to. . Clause 20 (Alterations of assessments in certain cases).",72
556,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Darling Downs) [10.37]. - I would call the attention of the Attorney-General to the fact that sub-clause 1 provides a time limit. after the expiration of which no assessment can be altered. Will he consider the advisableness of inserting a similar limitation in sub-clause 2 ? That provision stipulates no period after which the Commissioner may not assess a person upon any land which may not have been included in his return.,72
557,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Jus t now I cannot say why there is a difference between the two sub-clauses,, but I promise to consider the matter. Clause agreed to. Clauses 21 and 22 agreed to. Clause 23 (Notice of assessment).",72
558,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Darling Downs) [10.39]. - I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether the notices provided for under this clause are to be delivered to the taxpayer iii person. There ought to be some guarantee that the taxpayers actually receive them. We do not merely wish a lot of notices to be posted.,72
559,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,That is what is generally done. .,72
560,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There should be some guarantee that the taxpayers receive the notices. . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - That is never provided for. . Mr GROOM - The method proposed is very loose one. It is important, because nan desires to know what his assessment in order to preserve his right of appeal, id I suppose the time will be limited in rfhich he may appeal. There should be some guarantee that the noticewill be served. However, I do not ask the Attorney-General to answer my inquiry on the spur of the moment.",72
561,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"When a man makes a return, I suppose he gives some sort of address, and I am quite willing that the notice should be directed to that address.",72
562,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Is the service to be by post?,72
563,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I have no objection. Clause agreed to. Progress reported. BANK NOTES TAX BILL. Bill returned from the Senate without request. House adjourned at 10.43 P- m,72
