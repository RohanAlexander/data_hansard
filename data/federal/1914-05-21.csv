1,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"When speaking on the censure amendment, I stated that the Prime Minister had acted as paid secretary to the Western miners of New South Wales. I made the statement. In the full belief that I was correct as to the fact, because the Newcastle and the Southern miners have paid secretaries, and I thought that the secretary to the Western miners was also a paid official. Prime Minister assures me that he was not paid, and,' in justice to him, I make this correction. INSPECTI ON OF PRODUCE. , Mr ATKINSON - I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs if he has had 13th under his notice the stringent regulations enforced in Western Australia to prevent the importation of produce, especially of potatoes, and if he has taken any action FREMANTLE . TO in regard to them?",11
2,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"When the matter was mentioned in this House, I think in December last, the Government made representations to the Western Australian Government, asking for certain informatant tion with respect to the fees charged, a reply was given to our communication which did not contain the information needed. We again communicated with the Government of Western Australia, about February, repeating our and received a second reply, which did not give the information for which we asked. ' About three weeks ago, we sent an urgent wire, and again this week another urgent wire, asking for the desired information; but without effect. If we cannot obtain the information directly, we shall have to try to get it the best way we can. Mr Troon - A statement was published last week of the charges made.",11
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We are asking for an explanation with respect to the nature of the fees charged, with a view to considering the matter in the light of the Constitution. Representations on the subject have been made to us by the Government of Tasmania, and we have brought these representations under the notice of the Western Australian Government. W ' shall continue to press our request for information until we have received a satisfactory explanation. TESTIN G OF EXPLOSIVES .",11
4,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister any further information regarding the proposal for erecting a testing station for explosives in Australia!,11
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have in formed the honourable member that I have certain information, this being a matter about which he has repeatedly asked questions. The last memorandum on the sub bridge/ who writesWith reference to thiB office minute of the 22nd ultimo, relative to the question asked by Mr Charlton in the House of Representatives regarding the establishment of a testing station for explosives within the Commonwealth, I beg to inform you that a cablegram, dated instant, has been received from the High Commissioner's office to the effect that the report of the officer of this department, now in England, would be posted on the 15th May. NA RAILWAY: WIDENING OF GAUGE: CONSTRUCTIO N OF LINE.",11
6,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE,"I ask the AssisMinister of Home Affairs if the and arrangement between this Government and that of Western Australia, in connection with the widening of the gauge of the railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie is a binding one, and what is the posirequest, tion at the present time?",11
7,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE,"The Government of Western Australia, in addition to getting legislation passed through the local Parliament, undertook in the course of correspondence with this Government to widen the gauge of the line simultaneously with the construction of our line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. Some time ago it was stated in the press that the Government of Western Australia did not propose to go on with the work, and a statement to that effect was, I think, attributed to the Premier, but he, during a visit subsequently made to Melbourne, 3aid that it was intended to go on with the work, but that the Government of Western Australia was not in a position to do so immediately. The spirit of the promise has not been honored by Western Australia. UNIFORM RAILWAY GAUGE.",11
8,Mr BTJRCHELL,KALGOORLIE,"Wit h reference to the construction of the section of railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, I wish to ask the Assistant Minister of Home A f fairs whether it is not a fact that, when the Government of Western Australia promised that they would construct the section, a definite time-limit was fixed as to when the Commonwealth would construct the portion from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie ?",12
9,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE,"I have been taken rather "" on the hop,"" because I did not anticipate this business being raised at all. ' But, to the best of my memory, the letter to which I referred, and in which the State Government promised simultaneously to construct, had no reference to a time limit. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I wish to know from the Prime Minister when he intends to bring in a Bill to provide for a uniform gauge as agreed to at the Premiers' Conference? Is it the intention of the Commonwealth Government to pay the cost of the change?",12
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE,"I communicated to the Inter-State Commission the wish of the Government that it should undertake the inquiry agreed to at the Premiers' Conference, hut I understand that it will be necessary for Parliament to make a formal reference to the Commission. The matter is being looked into, but I am afraid that we shall not have a proposition to submit to the House just yet. The Inter-State Commission is now very busy on other matters. I hope that by-and-by it will be able to inquire into this important matter. NEW HEBRIDES.",12
11,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE,"I ask the Minister of External Affairs if his attention has been called to a cablegram published in yesterday's dailies, to the effect that it is the intention of the British and French Governments to send an Anglo-French delegation to the New Hebrides to inquire into the position of affairs there before a new convention between the two countries is ratified? I ask the Minister whether, under the circumstances, it would be possible to have Australia represented on that delegation?",12
12,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE,"The honourable member was good enough to call my attention to the cablegram, and I have just read it. We have had no official communication from the Home Government about the appointment of any such Commission. Our last communication was dated, I think, the 3rd February, and mentioned that a Conference would probably take place between representatives of the Governments of Great Britain and France about the end of May, or the beginning of June. The Assistant to the High Commissioner in the Western Pacific, who has personal knowledge of the condition of affairs, has been summoned to Great Britain to give necessary advice on details of administration, and the French Government, I believe, has the advantage of similar official assistance. I expect that the Conference will take place shortly. I believe that Ministers recently discussed one or two matters informally, and that the scope of the Conference has been somewhat widened. We have sent a communication to the Home Government on the subject. If there is a Commission, the representation of Australia will receive careful consideration. - DURATION OF SITTING.",12
13,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE,"In view of the,inconvenience which was caused to honourable members by being compelled to sit up last week all one night without due notice, will the Prime Minister be good enough to say whether it is his intention to ask the House to sit all night?",12
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE,I strongly suggest to my honourable friend that he should address the question to his leader and ask him if he will make it possible for us to rise at a decent hour.,13
15,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has abrogated his functions in this House, because I will take them up as soon as he is prepared to lay them down?",13
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE,"I have only to say that the last remark was quite obvious, and totally unnecessary. NA RAILWAY.",13
17,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the Minister in charge of the Home Affairs Department yet laid upon the table the agreement which, it is stated, contains preference in its most advanced form in connection with the east to west railway ?",13
18,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I informed the honourable member yesterday that I propose to lay a copy of the agreement on the table, and, as he knows, more than one day is usually allowed for preparing a copy.  the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs heard anything to confh-m the report which appeared in the Adelaide newspapers that 200 Government employees had been discharged from the east to west railway?",13
19,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Immediatel y after the statement was made in the House, I saw the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, who assured me that,' to his knowledge, no men had been put off. I do not say that it is a fact, but it is quite possible that the men referred to in the press are Mr. Teesdale Smith's men going off the job at the head of the line. So far as the Government service is concerned, our instructions have been to push ahead with the work,- and not to put anybody off. QUARANTINE STATION, SYDNEY.",13
20,Colonel RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Hav e any steps been taken with the view to finding a suitable site to which the Quarantine Station at Manly might be removed?,13
21,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On Monday last, the Minister of Public Health for New South Wales submitted to us two sites, which are now being reported upon, and will be inspected by the oflicers of the Department at the earliest possible date. COMPULSORY TRAINING.",13
22,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As considerable dislocation is now caused in business, and! also great inconvenience to young cadets, who are apprentices-a . matter about which I have received a number of communications-woul d it not be possible for the Honorary Minister to consult the Minister of Defence with the view to arranging for drills and parades to be held on such a day that would not interfere so much with business as is done at the present time ?",13
23,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"May I suggest through, you, sir, to the House-and I am surethat it will realise the fairness of the proposal-that as I have nothing to do withi the administration of the Defence Department it would really save the time of honourable members and ours if they would put all the questions regarding defence on the notice-paper.",13
24,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I only asked you to consult the Minister.,13
25,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but that was not the? purport of the question. Of course I would be only too happy to do that at any time. If honourable members would put all questions regarding defence on the notice-paper it would save their time, and I am sure that they would be better pleased. GRIEVANCE DAY.",13
26,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I desire to ask you, sir, a question in connection with the business of the House. A fortnight ago last night I understood the Treasurer to move that "" Committee of Supply "" be placed on the notice-paper. As this is the third Thursday since that date, it should, I think, in accordance with standing order 241. be "" grievance day."" I desire to know why "" Supply"" is not the first Government Order of the Day on the notice-paper?",13
27,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This matter has cropped up on a previous occasion. In September, 1908, Mr Speaker Holder had the ""grievance"" .Order of the Day removed from the notice-paper until the House had gone into Committee of Supply or Ways and Means. Again on the 6th June, 1909, he decided that the Order of the Day should appear on the notice paper after either Committee had sat, although want of confidence and Addressin-Reply debates had not concluded. The Committee of Supply is not open until it has actually sat. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). DEFENCE ADMINISTRATIO N.",13
28,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Werriwa) [10.48] beg to move the adjournment of the Europe is doing. House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" t danger of militarism to the youth of tralia, and the expense, conduct, and state of affairs generally in the Department of Defence."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",14
29,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If there is one tion which ought to be above party altoyears is the gether surely it is the question of national defence. I lay it down as a from which there can be no escape, that every citizen in the community is bound to appear in its defence if his assistance is required. I start on this premise, therefore hold that above all things the question of defence should not, be a matter. It is doubly incumbent upon honourable members on either side of the House who accept the premise to call tention to the state of affairs if they bethey deteriorate. lieve that a wrong is being done petuated. In the first place I hold that, inasmuch as Australia is an island, i clear that any attack must come from over the water, and consequently the primary defence of Australia is the naval defence. Equally, therefore, by so as we take to exaggerating militarism by trained in that way. so much do we lessen the powers that can he expended on the Navy, and certainly the amount of money that can be vided in order to give support to the Navy. Therefore, any attention paid to militarnever ism will necessarily weaken our primary line of defence. The only object military defence should be to make vision so that small raids can easily dealt with, and in order to force enemy to put up such a raiding force that escape from our Navy looking for them will be impossible. we spend on militarism is therefore serious mistake, and it is doubly encumcome bent on us to keep full control of these matters. However, we are doing so, and a spirit of militarism vails that is distinctly opposed to all ideas of true, liberty. The history Italy and Spain in regard to their peditions to Abyssinia and Cuba teaches us that it is one thing to get men to field of battle, and quite a different to get them to fight when there. Our system of militarism is absolutely wrong and wicked. In the first place, we are - I doing what no military country i u We have practically a system of conscription of boys between h e fourteen and eighteen years of age, so Ausmuch too young that any country in Europe that has adopted it has absolutely abolished it after a little while. Although in Germany those as young as seventeen years of age can be called on, in no circumstances do those younger than twentythree years of age serve. In most in quesstances in Europe, though, eighteen age of conscription, in no case is a youth under twenty premise years of age called upon to serve. Experience has taught the older countries that the characters of youths are too unformed, that youths are not sufficiently and advanced' in mind to be able to resist the evils that the aggregation of men in large party camps seems frequently to entail, and that, so far from youths being developed physically, they absolutely go back in atstead of going forward in this regardI n Australia we call or perputting boys between fourteen and eighteen years of age into camps defence; t is but no true military men in Australia term it defence; they say that the system does not belong to defence, and that it is of no advantage to the defence of the much country to have youths of that early age In these circumstances, it seems to me that our compulsory system of defence goes by the board. proThe experience of Europe ought to be sufficient for us to realise that we should have initiated a scheme which, because of certain evils that have sprung of our up, has been abolished in older lands. proWhat is happening under our system ? be Instead of our taking boys off the streets, the as I have heard the argument used, we put many boys on the streets at night when returning at 10 o'clock from their Every penny drills, we expose them in the cities to the a solicitations of women, which have never within their ken before, and to the all temptations of drink. If honourable memnot bers think that I am exaggerating, let prethem examine some, of these boys after our they have been dismissed from their drills of at night. I may be said to have some preexjudice upon the matter, but I have made it my business to make many observaa tions, and in every case the result in this thing regard has been unsatisfactory indeed. Long before their time has young boys, who were pure in mind and body before commencing night, or in camps, are likely to be decayed in body and cankered in soul by the vicious training they are given. ask them to mix with the vicious and criminal, with the result that already in the camps that have been held we have seen the lamps lit at night and watches set. One or two honourable members can bear me out that this is no It is a matter that ought to engage the attention of this House at the very first opportunity. I had hoped that now the fever of militarism has passed away saner sense would have come to us, and that the Liberal party to which I belong would have come forward and held that if we were to have defence it should be by men, and not by boys. There must be a shifting of the sense of responsibility. not making some alteration we are doing a big injury. I trust a body of men will arise on both sides of the House, who, while recognising that defence is a national question, and that it should be'dealt with as such, will say exactly money should be allocated in the way of expenditure upon it. We are now contributing £6,000,000 per annum defence, of which £3,300,000 military defence, forgetting .that lia is an island, and that any must be by way of the sea - We have wild statements that the fleet may be decoyed away. Fancy a fleet being decoyed away to a spot where there is no enemy, in these days of wireless, and in these days when a ship cannot go 200 miles without passing another Fancy it being claimed that an enemy's fleet with transports can proceed sands of miles, and escape When the Russian fleet was round, every one knew its In these days of aeroplanes marines, what possible hope is of bringing transports sea without attracting In the circumstances, I say that we are dealing with defence in the wrong way. By drawing these big sums of money from the public to defray, the cost of defence, we are interfering with the prosperity of the country. No matter what is imposed, it must fall, for the most part, on the bulk of the people. £3,300,000 which goes out from Treasury is of no true Mr Conroy. expired,, defence purposes, because, as I have said, we are relying on the second their drills at arm instead of the first. We have in this country a trade of £160,000,000 annually, and does any one imagine We for a moment that, in the event of - an. invasion of Australia, the people in the cities would be content to wait for years whilst a desultory land defence was being carried on? The inhabitants of the cities would compel peace to be made, exaggeration. whether the residents of the country liked it or not. If tens of thousands of men were turned out of employment in the cities as the result of the cessation, of distribution, it is manifest that very great in j u r y must follow to the rest of the community.",14
30,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member mean to say that the people of the cities would desert the people of the By country ?,15
31,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I mean to say that the men in the cities would be so hard up that they would be unable to earn a living at all, and a man might almost as well be shot down as starved to death. what We are frequently told that conscription fosters obedience. It does not teach obedience but enforces it , which is a very towards different thing indeed. It does not tend to goes in the formation of national character that the Austra- individuality of our young people should invasion be crushed out. I have taken the trouble to consult some military men on this question. The opinion that we are calling upon our youths for purposes of defence at too early an age has beer! so generally expressed by the military men to whom I have spoken on the subvessel! ject, that I have been astounded that the system should continue. Most of thou- those whom I have consulted fixed the attention! age at which our youths should be called rushing upon for purposes of defence at eighteen movements. years, and the earliest age suggested by and sub- any of them was seventeen years.

32,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is a very different thing. The honourable member cantaxation not compare ordinary education with military training.  the Mr CONROY - Then it ought to be value for imparted by physical masters in the schools. Training for defence should not be confused with hygienic instruction, and the class of men employed for the one purpose should be a different class from those employed for the other. not be denied that instructors who are accustomed to command men are not, as a rule, suitable for giving instruction to lads.  would have done the honourable member good.",15
33,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member forgets that I went through the Volunteer Forces, and frequently went into camp.  honourable member young enough.",16
34,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was because, in my opinion, the system of militarism we have adopted is not as valuable as it might be, that I have given so much attention to it . There is another aspect of the matter which, so far as I can judge, the feelings of honourable members, should have received more attention. Provision should have been made for a system of military pensions. Such provision . is made in the case of every other military force in the world, and it is made elsewhere only because the necessity for it has been recognised. If we ask men to hazard their lives, in the defence of their country the least we can do is to make some provision for those who are dependent upon them. In considering the adoption of a system of militarism those responsible should have made themselves acquainted with the best features of similar systems in other countries of the world, and when it was found that a system of military pensions was practically .universal provision should have been made for a similar system here. wrong has been done to those who have been called upon to defend this country by our neglect to make this provision. I have no hesitation in saying that it would be better for us to have a small force of regulars-3,00 0 or 4,000 men-becaus e the engineers and artillery must be trained men-and a militia force of, say, 40,000 men similar to the Territorials in England. The militia might be paid £ 1 5 a year, and that would involve an expenditure of £600,000 per annum to secure a forceof 40,000 agile, active men who would take an interest in their work. time of war might be supplemented by an equal number called upon for the purpose. We should then have a body of men on whom we could rely. On the subject of the value of militiamen, I should It can- like to direct the attention of honourable members to an opinion expressed by General Langlois on the Territorials of England. He visited England holding the view that without regular training men were unfit to be classed as soldiers; but after inspecting the Territorial forces he saidMy opinion is modified of the Territorial army, owing to the energy, resolute will, and, above all, the remarkable spirit of initiative which they have acquired in their ordinary occupations. W it h such a tribute to the value of these militia forces we should, I think, be justified in following the example of the Old Country in this respect. It is incumbent upon this House to take some measures to deal with the deadly dangers which, as I have said, are cankering the bodies and souls of the youths of this country. It cannot be pretended that the present system is popular when we know that 20,000 summonses have had to be issued to force youths to d r ill , and at least as many more should have been issued. We have all this trouble for something which is not defence. It leads to the mixing together of the criminal and decent classes, to the deterioration of the latter. The struggle of the poor to keep their children decent is already severe enough. We have in jured the poor in this way. Their difficulties are seriously increased by the system of militarism we have adopted. I may inform honourable members that some of the blankets used at the camp in the Liverpool area were filthy with vermin. In some cases they were covered with excrement, because some of those in camp A distinct were too filthy and lazy to get up to relieve themselves. These blankets were issued afresh to youths coming into the camp, and is it any wonder that there should have been an outcry on their part. ' I am speaking of facts, of which the representatives of the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald were cognisant. The doctors today want money to prepare and clean those blankets, so that dirty blankets shall not be used.  seen a whole army lousy. This force in Mr CONROY - That does not make the condition of affairs in Australia any better, and it does not absolve the M in ister of Defence from responsibility for not seeing to a matter like this. The continuance of such a condition of affairs is a grave reflection on the Minister of Defence, because, having been informed of these conditions, he should have proceeded to at once deal with them.  boys service conditions.",16
35,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then the sooner we get away from service conditions the bett e r; and if the system cannot be conducted on better lines, the sooner we abandon it altogether the better. cannot expect anything better when a lot of the oflicers, under a regulation made by the previous Government, were turned out at practically a moment's notice. Men who had given twenty-five to t h i r t y years' service were suddenly informed that their engagement was terminated, and they are to be turned out of the Force without any recompense or compensation. In England, when an alteration of that kind was made, a pension was given to every one of the men; but in this country they were turned out at a moment's notice, after a record of t h i r t y years' service. Is there any man with a heart or conscience who cannot feel that a big moral offence is being committed by the Government in so acting ? There is a moral obligation on us to do justice to those men, and the neglect of that moral obligation by both the present and the previous Governments is deserving of censure. When we neglect a moral right, we are doing an in j u r y, the full consequences of which we do not understand. We cannot commit a big moral wrong without big public sufferings following ; and I say that it is highly incumbent upon this House to take upon itself the conduct of this matter, and see that provision is made for men who are turned out of the Service, and that the Minister of Defence does not go about making club appointments. I am informed that some of the boys in the college are costing £500"" a year each to teach, taking into consideration the cost of buildings, salaries, and other forms of expenditure. Indeed, we had a recommendation from one officer, who has lately received a high appointment, that we should buy for those boys tea cups and saucers at a cost of 6s. apiece. Defence is a question that is above all considerations of party, and it is incumbent upon this House to take steps to put a Minister in charge of the. 'system who will correct all these abuses; who will see that our military expenditure is limited strictly to defence; who will see that the expenses are cut down; and who will recognise that the expenditure of these enormous sums on militarism is the means of weakening our true first line of defence.",17
36,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not Senator Millen doing all those things?,17
37,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All I can say is that, when I inquired into the absence of public morality in dealing with the appointWe ments of these oflicers, and when I in quired as to whether the appointments they have made are likely to lead to success, I was informed that they blundered nearly as badly as they did in the Teesdale Smith case.",17
38,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Y o u have painted red some of the small things they have done. Will you not now paint red some of the big things?,17
39,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unti l we are united on this question, no true reform can come about. Sound military men say that without compulsory service we could have a good Militar y Force sufficient to meet all possibilities of invasion. They look upon the Navy as our first line of dofence, and military men, who also ! ike an interest in civil government, say that we are fast going to the dogs; that we are not getting true defence; and that we are appropriating from the citizens money which could be better lef t in their own pockets. The taking of that money from them only deteriorates their condition in life, and the burden is heavier on the poor than on any other section of the community. I do trust that the combined intellect of the House will be applied to this matter, and that honourable members will unite to see if we cannot place the whole system on a sound foundation.",17
40,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Boothby) [11.15] The honourable member for Werriwa' has said that it is incumbent upon this House to take the question of defence into serious consideration, and I agree with him that it is one of the most important matters we can discuss. With some of his statements, however, I do not agree. I shall be only too pleased to support him or any other honourable member who will propose to raise the service age of trainees from fourteen to eighteen years, because I consider that fourteen years is too .early an age at which to compel boys to undergo military training. I would even be prepared to cut down the age from the other end, and make the training terminate at twenty-four years or twenty-two years. But I am utterly opposed to a voluntary system of defence in 'Australia. Indeed, I believe the voluntary system of defence is the curse of the United Kingdom. do not think a voluntary system would meet our case; we must have a defence system on which we can rely in time of need. When the honourable member says that a voluntary system would be less costly than the present system I differ from him. In my opinion, the voluntary system would be very much more costly. Is the voluntary system of the United Kingdom and the United States less costly than the conscription systems in other parts of the world ? Not at all. As a matter of fact, in Australia it would be absolutely impossible to have a voluntary system which would be worth anything at all from a defence point of view. Is it conceivable that our Australian youths could be induced to go into barracks for a term of years as they do in the United Kingdom? We could not find young fellows who would go into barracks for six years for a shilling or a little more per day; indeed, we could not get the young men of Australia to go into barracks if we offered them 15s. a day.",17
41,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On the continent they go into barracks for two years, and sometimes for only one year.",18
42,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is under the conscription system, but I am talking about the voluntary system. What has been the experience of Australia? When great public excitement prevailed over the South African war twelve or fifteen years ago,'Irish, Scotch and other regiments Were formed all over Australia, and the young men flocked to them in thousands. But no sooner had the war fever abated, than those regiments became beautifully less every day, and practically disappeared. A voluntary system would be absolutely insufficient for Australia as a guarantee of efficient defence. Further, it would be far more costly for us to adopt a volunteer system of sufficient strength to make our defence a really effective one.",18
43,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Where there is conscription it is impossible to induce a volunteer to serve outside his own country.,18
44,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In Germany no soldier, who is there by conscription, can be compelled to serve outside the Empire, . but, of course, many soldiers volunteer to do so.",18
45,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They do not'.,18
46,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , they do. I Mr CONROY - Jus t about one-fortieth of the number.",18
47,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No difficult y is experienced in inducing quite sufficient conscripts to volunteer for service in other countries, as, for example, against 'the blacks in certain portions of A f r i c a . An other statement made by the honourable member, which is not borne out by facts, is that the volunteer in war will , at all times, prove himself a better fighter than will the man who is serving as the result of a system of conscription. I admit that it may be so in some cases. The honourable member mentioned in support of his statement the case of the Italians who fought in Tripoli. He said that some of the soldiers who served there as conscripts did not exhibit the enthusiasm that was expected of them. However, I feel certain that if Australia should ever be attacked, if there should ever be a number of foreign warships hovering about our coasts, the honourable member would be one of the first to rise up and' say, "" Let us defend our country."" The Citizen Forces of the Commonwealth would be only too eager to defend thiscontinent should the occasion ever arise for them to do so. Did the Italians, when they fought against the Austrian* from 1864 to 1866 as conscription soldiers, exhibit the white feather in anyway ? Not at all.",18
48,Mr BURNS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The British soldiers have never exhibited the white feather under a volunteer system.,18
49,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am answering thestatement of the honourable member for Werriwa that the men who are soldiersby conscription are not as good fightersas axe volunteers. I say that when fighting for their country they are just as= effective as are volunteers. In any case, if war broke out at the present time wewould all have to shoulder a rifle and to defend our country. That being so, isi t not better that we should have menwho are acquainted with military discipline to protect us than that we should have to rely on individuals. who, likemyself, have never fired a shot in their lives? I would have to leant something of military d r ill before I would be of any use in defending Aus„ tralia. I said some time ago that I believed that six months' continuous training would be preferable to the holding of the many short camps which are in favour at the present time. opinion, it would be better to have a continuous training of four or six months than to have a number of short camps, and a lengthened period of service such as we have now- a period extending over fourteen years. I believe that it would make better soldiers of our men.",18
50,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What business of the country?,19
51,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not desire to amongst business men the spirit which was exhibited in an advertisement which was read the other day by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and which a certain f i r m advertised for an aspoint. sistant, stipulating that a military exempt would be preferred. I hate that sort thing. But I say that employers should be treated as they are elsewhere, and absolutely compelled to take back into their employ men who have been tern-, porarily taken from them to undergo m tary training. In some other parts the world an employer cannot get r i d such an employee for at least six weeks after his return. The persons who to undergo military training must not handicapped, so far as their civil and i dustrial life is concerned. I am prepared to support any movement which aims raising the age at which boys shall he pelled to join our Cadet Forces to eighteen years, and at cutting down the term of will always be available. service at the other end. But I do to see a compulsory system of military training continued in Australia, so long serious situation. as things are what they are. Nobody advocates war. Nobody can argue in favour of war any more than he can argue m favour of getting drunk. But, as things are today throughout the world, I should be very sorry indeed to see any system military training in Australia other than a compulsory one. I know that such system imposes hardship on some persons, especially if they have religious objections to war. But we cannot study the objecbe, tions of individuals in any law.",19
52,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member consider that the age at which the defence force. training of a lad should commence should be increased?,19
53,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , to eighteen years.",19
54,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I would make it 100 years.,19
55,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is all very well for some honourable members to get on the high transcendental plane and to say, "" Let In my us do away with war."" It sounds very well, and it is difficult for an opponent to offer a reply. But we must regard things as we find them, and not as we would wish to find them. In conclusion, I shall oppose any attempt to abolish the compulsory system of military training with a view to substituting a voluntary system. about the Colonel RYRIE (North Sydney) [11.30] - I was pleased to hear honourable see members of the Opposition declare that the question of defence was far removed from the arena of party politics. It undoubtedly is, and its discussion should in always be approached from that standA s the mover of the motion has said, our first line of defence is the Navy; of but I fail' to see why it should be sughere gested that because of that we can afford to dispense with our military defence.",19
56,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did not argue that.,19
57,Colonel RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I take it that the i l i - honourable member's contention was that of the money we were spending on military of defence was practically wasted, seeing that we had to depend almost solely on the have Navy for the defence of the country. My be answer to him is that we cannot afford n - to relax the efforts we are making to build up a great Australian citizen army. As at long as we have the protection of the comBritish Fleet we shall be safe, but it is by no means certain that that protection A big Eurowish pean disturbance, with trouble at the same time in India, would give rise to a very No doubt the malcontents in India would take, advantage of a serious European disturbance to cause trouble, with the result that the British Fleet might be so full y occupied in other waters as to be unable to afford us the protection necessary for our safety. of In such circumstances we should have to depend on the Australian Naval U n it . a We have done well in creating a Fleet of our .own, but without the assistance and co-operation of the British Fleet, it must for years to come, wholly inadequate to protect Australia. That being so, .we must endeavour to build up a big land The Australian Fleet, without the assistance of the British Fleet, is quite inadequate to guard our 8,000 or 9,000 miles of coast-line. We must be prepared, therefore, with a land defence capable of resisting an invading army in the event of our first line of defence failing us. Our defence expenditure is really a contribution to a national insurance f u n d , and if it were necessary, I do not think that any of us would object to pay an additional £ 1 or £ 2 by way of taxation for defence purposes. We gladly pay the premiums necessary to insure our houses, our wool sheds, our hay stacks, and so forth , and why should we hesitate to incur the cost of properly insuring the nation against an invasion ? What would happen if we failed to properly insure it ? Can the honourable member for Werriwa allow his mind to dwell for a moment upon what would follow the successful invasion of Australia by a coloured race ?",19
58,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A land force could not prevent an invasion, but an adequate naval force could.",20
59,Colonel RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"O u r naval defence might not always be sufficient to repel an invasion, and in such an emergency, if we had not a sound land defence, we should be in a hopeless position. overrunning of this country by a coloured race is, something that is absolutely unthinkable. No doubt many honourable members have read such books as The Coloured Conquest and the Yellow Wave. If they have, they cannot contemplate with complacency what might happen to our women folk if the country were overrun by coloured races. The cost of our defence system is nothing compared with the outcome of unpreparedness on the part of our land forces to come to our rescue if our first line of defence broke down. We do not want to suggest that any particular race is our enemy; but we cannot help thinking of that race which has suddenly attained to the position of a first-class fighting Power on both land and sea. We do not suggest .that the Japanese are our enemies, but in view of our restrictive immigration laws they can have no love for us. I would not have those laws repealed, for I believe in the policy of a White Australia, but such legislation cannot be viewed with favour by the Japanese. The Japanese are at present allied with Great Britain , but I agree with Senator Millen, who in criticising a recent utterance by the First Lord of-the Admiralty, said that the pages of .history are strewn with the wreckage of shattered alliances. An honourable member of this House has said that that was an insult to the Japanese. It was nothing of the sort, for it is an acknowledged fact that the pages of history are strewn with shattered alliances. We cannot depend for our safety on the alliance between Great Britain and Japan. W it h regard to the position of the boys under our compulsory training system, the honourable member for Werriwa said that, if it were necessary, every one of us would turn out and fight for our country. No doubt we would do so, and there are thousands of brave men in Australia who would shoulder their rifles and be prepared to do or die in the same cause. But without d r ill and discipline, we cannot hope to fight with success: These men individually may be as brave as possible. I do not say that the men in the Forces are any braver than those outside. There may be thousands of them outside brave and determined to do their best, but without d r ill and discipline it is absolutely impossible to put them together in large bodies, and get them to fight. It is not only the actual fighting, but getting the men on to the The spot, that matters. They cannot be moved until they are drilled and disciplined, and they cannot be fed. I defy any one to put 10,000 absolutely undrilled and undisciplined men into camp, feed them and their horses, and move them on to the battle-field. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that these men who are growing up in Australia should have some training while they are young. It is only while they are young that they can be given the necessary training; at any rate, that is the proper time, when their minds are more receptive and their characters more easily moulded than they will be later. If we are going to have an efficient army in Australia we must train our youth. That brings me to the question of whether the age should remain as it is or be raised.' On that matter I have an open mind. There may be something in what the honourable member for Werriwa has said about many hoys of decent parentage, well-conducted and well brought up, having to mix with boys who are, perhaps, of a vicious disposition, or inclined to be of the l a r r i k in class.",20
60,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The best boys in training were the boys of Wooloomooloo.,20
61,Colonel RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will admit that that is so. We have to look at the other side of the question, for may we not be right in supposing that boys who were inclined to be of the. larrikin class would benefit by being put with a majority of better behaved boys? The thing may cut both ways.  pened in the Imperial Service.",21
62,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It does not benefit them according to the experience of the world. Colonel RYRIE"" - There are many boys who have improved considerably since the system was brought in. I can speak positively on that score. Many lads who would otherwise have been found about the streets smoking cigarettes, gambling, have benefited considerably by being put into the ranks and drilled. I do not believe that the system has such a baneful influence upon hoys who have been well brought up. If they have been brought up well it would take a good deal more than association for a few brief hours with boys of bad character to affect them harmfully in their after life.",21
63,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do not you know that they have had to put the lights on the pickets at night?,21
64,Colonel RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If anything wrong was going on it would be much better to have as brilliant lights on the camps and parades as possible, but it does not necessary follow that, because the camps and parades are lighted, anything wrong has been going on.",21
65,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oh , yes, there was.",21
66,Colonel RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At all events, there may be something in the honourable member's contention that the age is too young. I do not say that a hard-andfast age of fourteen should be fixed, but I favour boys being taken in hand young, inasmuch as the training does not then interfere so much with their avocation in after life. Boys are just about leaving public schools at fourteen or fifteen, and nave, perhaps, not entered into any permanent employment then. That is the best time to make them do their drill. If it is left until they have settled occupations it is more likely to be irksome. That is a strong, argument in favour of retaining the age at, say, fourteen or fifteen.",21
67,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [11.46] - I wish first to congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa on having the courage to move the adjournment of the House on this question in a Chamber where the party lines are so strongly marked. It requires courage for a man to stand up against his own side, and there is no doubt that there is, in Australia, a conspiracy of silence on this military question which makes it almost impossible for men like the honourable member and myself to have our say. We can be taxed and exploited, but it must be remembered that it is the working man or who has to pay for everything in the end. It is quite true, as the honourable member said, that we had to retire several officers when we were in power, but the late Minister of Defence was very considerate to them. We found that it would have been necessary to take those officers on stretchers to a war.",21
68,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Did the honourable member say crutches? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No , they had their crutches, and we simply separated them from them. You cannot run a defence organization with men who cannot ride. Mr Roosevelt, when President of the United States of America, issued an order for his officers to ride 50 miles, and discovered that nearly all of them could not ride. They could not even dance, and most of the military officers are dancing masters. If they are not dancing masters, they are tango-pushers, and so Mr Roosevelt had to retire a lot of the American officers. It is of no use co keep men like that in the Service, just to provide them with billets. The Service is not a benevolent association, or a charitable institution, and so I was sorrowfully compelled to vote to retire certain officers in our Forces. I am opposed to taxing the Australian people any further to keep up a system that is not based on economy and efficiency. There is not efficiency, but a sort of chaos. As Minister of Home Affairs, I did a lot of work in connection with the Defence Department; and, speaking from experience, I say that there is not a man in Australia today, however strong he may be, who could, under present conditions, put the Department on a proper basis; at any rate, not before a lot of men there had been "" k ill e d of f . "" Soldiers are not trained to be business men; they spend and "" l e t 'er r i p , "" so long as some one else pays. It is about time that a M i l i tary Committee was appointed in this House to go into the whole question. may say that I have no desire to b^ a member of such a Committee, for the reason that I am prejudiced. The work of the Committee should be to devise, if possible, a system for the defence of Australia, but not for aggression. willing to speud millions for defence, but not a penny for aggression. tion is: A r e we getting anything for the money we are spending? I say that we are not. We on this side, and, in deed,' all of us here, are responsible for the present position; but if we have made a mistake, is that any reason why we should continue the mistake?",21
69,Mr HANNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it a mistake?,22
70,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If we have made a financial mistake,22
71,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Our military system is founded on the advice of one of our greatest soldiers.,22
72,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is just the mistake that we have made: We brought a man out from a little island to create a system of defence for a great continent. We built our railways here on the advice of men from little islands, to which their experience was confined, and the result is that we have a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge, and a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge.",22
73,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member contend that Lord Kitchener's experience is confined to a little island ?,22
74,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was much amused the other day on seeing in an American newspaper that, when Lord Roberts started from A f r i ca for England, Lord Kitchener said, "" Now that the picnic is over, we shall start business."" In my opinion, the wars of the future will not be fought with solid columns, but will be fought with the head from behind the stone fence, and the useful man will be he who brings his rifle down quickly, gets his sight, and "" drops 'er."" not have a lot of men marching up to be murdered. What, then, is the use of all the present marching and counter-marching ? I see a lot of - boys drawn away from their other occupations and made to mar.ch up and down and be drilled, while other fellows yell at them. When I was a clerk in a bank in New York, I am sure that my "" boss "" would not have given me leave under the circumstances; and if he had, some one else would have got I my place.",22
75,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That occurs in Australia now.,22
76,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"An y one engaged, in whatever capacity, in any great national or private undertaking, is I should be one of the spokes of the wheel, and cannot be spared. Thirteen years ago, in ' The ques- this very House, I laid down a plan of defence for Australia, as any honourable member can see if he refers to my first speech as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. However, the ideas I then expressed were scouted, and I was told that what was required was some brassbuttoned and braided man from Europe, whose name was in everybody's mouth, to tell us what to do. When Thomas Edison began his career as a peanut "" butcher "" on American trains, and he talked to the people he met, they .regarded him as a fool; and I can remember that, when I went to New Jersey on insurance business, I was regarded as at lunatic for endeavouring to issue a premium to a certain man in the neighbourhood. When Marconi first mooted theidea of wireless telegraphy, it was suggested that he should be examined for lunacy; and it was much the same when Bell introduced his telephone.",22
77,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Chaunce y Depew ordered Bell out of his office.,22
78,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so. When Morse brought forward his telegraphic invention, it was scouted; and, inevitably, we find that the man with a new idea is regarded as a fool u n t i l the world rises to the idea. When I proposed"" that there should be a Commonwealth building in London, there wasderisive laughter in this House. Even my friend, "" Bill y "" Wilks, who was then member for Dalley, inquired whether I proposed to place George Reid on the top of the building; and when I inquired why I should do such a thing, Wilks replied, "" To show which way the wind We shall blows."" However, that building is now going up, and "" G e o r g e "" will soon be inside it . There is another matter with which I would like to deal. Yesterday, I endeavoured to "" get this in "" on the Prime Minister; but, being shut off, I shall avail myself of the present opportunity. This is an extract from the ArgusA daring feat by an aviator is a feature of the news from Mexico; Hanging like a hawk over the Federal gunboat Morelos a determined rebel in an aeroplane drove the vessel out to sea. Tho story comes from Durango that when the gunboat approached the shore the aeronaut set out from land. When the vessel moved he steadily pursued, keeping high to avoid the bullets from below. Apparently his object was to drop a bomb into the funnel and blow up the vessel. This was not accomplished, but one of the bombs plaint. struck the steamer and caused great damage.' The bridge was ripped away, several riflemen were killed, and the gunners were silenced. Finally the Morelos. was obliged to steam away to sea to escape. This is a new science. In 1908, Senator Findley and myself tried to get the Brisbane Conference to recommend submarines and airships for the defence of Australia. I wanted to have the currents of the air studied, but I was in advance of the times, and there was great laughing. Now, no nation thinks of any other kind of defence. In this morning's Age is a sub-leader which I advise every one to read.",22
79,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member's time has expired,  sorry that the honourable member for Darwin could not continue his speech, because some of his remarks were very in structive. In reply to what the honourable member for Werriwa has said about the training of our youths, I say, as I would say at all times, that a country worth livin g in is worth defending. This country has been good to me and mine, and had I for t y sons, I would expect every one of them to defend, not only their own hearths and homes, but the country in which they live. As instancing the popularity of our Defence system, I might mention that when it was first brought into operation nearly every mai l from my electorate brought letters and petitions from schools, signed by 95 per cent, of the scholars, asking me to get non-commissioned officers sent to train them in the art of defence. The honourable member for Werriwa wishes to raise the age of trainees. He should recognise that war today is a science. . What would be thought of an artisan who refused to allow his boy to commence to learn a trade u n t i l he had reached the age of eighteen years? The training of the mind cannot be begun too soon. WASHINGTON, May 16. I have been in the service, and I have seen war. War is hell; there is no doubt about that. The honourable member complains that boys have been subjected to indignities at a camp. If he had been on active service, he would know more of the inconveniences that men in the fighting line have to put up with, and these last, not for two or three weeks, but for years, yet I have never heard-a com",23
80,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member is referring to men who voluntaril y enlisted.  of a standing army, but are doing the next best thing for our defence, by insuring that every man of twenty-one years of age shall be trained to carry a rifle, and to use it effectively.

I recommend the honourable member to read Colonel Hamilton's life of Stonewall Jackson, one of the most interesting books. If he had read it , he would not have said what he did. The rebels of America, although willin g fighters, and made of the best stuff, did not know how to fight u n t i l after the battle of Gettysburg. The whole brunt of the fighting on their side was borne by Stonewall Jackson's brigade. Stonewall Jackson kept his men at work day and night, drillin g and marching, always under discipline, and when a rush came, his brigade was always there to stop it.",23

The boys he speaks of are lucky if they have nothing more to complain of. Their parents can aff o r d to provide them with good food for their stomachs, but many children in older countries are out in the mud and slush, and their parents cannot do anyt h i ng for them. Under the German system the men who go into the A r m y have to dril l continuously for two years, and live in barracks. It does not matter what a man's occupation may be, he must leave his home and his trade or calling to serve continuously with the colours. That causes an economic waste which we do not have in Australia. never been a scheme whose inventors, as the honourable member for Darwin said, have not been called knaves or fools, but when a scheme turns out trumps other persons take the credit. the honourable member for Werriwa prefer, that there should be an armed rabble or an armed disciplined force to defend our shores? One cannot have his salt and eat it . To get efficiency, we must have preparation, and preparation means cost. The people of Australia are not growling about the cost of our defence - scheme.",23
83,Mr ARTHUR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , they are. '  heard growling are members of the Peace Society, who want to go out with a white flag and a Bible, to settle differences by prayer.",24
84,Mr ARTHUR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Sir I a n Hamilton says that it is going to cost us £6,000,000 a year to get an efficient force.  Australia is more to me, and to every man in it . The honourable member for North Sydney drew a harrowing picture of what might happen if this country were overridden by persons of a coloured race. How should we like to see our wives, daughters, or mothers governed by niggers? That is how the question presents itself to me. Even though defence may cost £6,000,000 or £26,000,000 a year, we should rather pay that price than allow the country to run the risk' of being overrun by a coloured race. It , may be said that this is piffle. we know that what I speak of is possible, and we are arming ourselves against it . As to the two gentleman whom we have had as Ministers of Defence, Senators Pearce and Millen, although they are civilians, and know nothing about military matters, they have done marvellous things.",24
85,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They have done everything that the military authorities have asked them to do.  in which they have not followed the advice of the military authorities. H ad they done so in all cases, they would have got into very peculiar positions. Our defence system is yet in its infancy. Rome was not built in .a day. But we are doing very well indeed.",24

If our defence system is dropsical, the Australian people must be dropsical, and - I resent that anyway. There is not a more virile race on the face of the earth than the Australians. The Australian is full of initiative; he knows what to do at a critical time; he knows how to get into a mess, and very often he gets out of it without any assistance, so that there is not much dropsy about him. That is my experience of the young Australian. The honourable member for Werriwa also spoke about pensions. In a sense I am averse to pensions, although I think that if a man gives up his lif e to the service of his countrysomething should be done for him when he becomes disabled or unfit for further service. We should not cast him out on the road like a disused as. If the honourable member had l e ft the matter at that it would have been all right, but he did not. He mentioned that there were three officers who had been provided for.",24
88,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I did not mention any number; I said that the Labour Party provided for them.  But said that three officers had been provided for. These three men were retired on account of their age, but there were no pensions available for them, and rather than throw them out on the streets to get their living for the rest of their days as best they could they were provided with positions carrying £30 0 a year and expenses.",24

Of course, it must be understood that in the early stages of the system matters of finance are likely to get a bit mixed, and that it takes some time for the best class of economic administration to be brought into play, but there can be only one opinion entertained on the question of the need for the defence of Australia. Of what value is it to us to possess a continent, to declare a White Australia policy, and to have good laws, if the permanent safety of the lives and the homes of the people is not the first consideration of those who take seats here as their representatives?",25

108,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; but it is well that a halt should be called now with regard to this feeling that we are beating a retreat from our defence system. There has been circulated in this Chamber a flaring red pamphlet, coming from the Peace Society, and quoting statements by certain members of the House in regard to the system. On all occasions I have admired the attitude adopted by the Leader of the Opposition and the ex-Minister of Defence, who have been steady factors in their fealty to the system. Of course, the sincerity of the present Ministry on the question is beyond doubt. There will be from time to time odd members on both sides ready to take advantage of too many opportunities, as I think, to weaken the general feeling of allegiance to the defence system.",25

112,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe that at present we have not too much material with which to recruit an effective Defence Eorce.,26
113,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I expect you to call upon women next, upon my word I do.",26
114,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are in direct conflict on this question.,26

116,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is well to put on record our separate views on this question. When we glance abroad, what do we find? We find that every nation on the face of the globe taxes its people up to the hilt to provide armaments.",26
117,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a disgrace to «ivilization.,26
118,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Our position is rather unique. Rightly or wrongly, in Australia we have declared for a "" white "" policy. We have practically thrown down the gage of battle to the coloured nations.",26
119,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And they are accepting it.,26
120,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How can we maintain our position unless everybody in Australia, young or old, is prepared to acknowledge that he is willing, whenever the time comes, to take his place in the - defence of the nation ? My desire in speaking is not to go into the defence system from A to Z. That there is need for economy in the administration, and need for effective control over the Defence officials', I am quite prepared to admit. I am quite prepared to admit that there should be business methods in such a great Department, in order to prevent reckless expenditure, and to prevent the military experts from running us into too costly a system; but I do hope that Defence [21 MAT , 1914.] Administration. 1239 no honourable member will attempt to weaken the feeling of the nation towards its effective defence.",26
121,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,You are fighting a bugbear; no one is attempting to deal with that point.,26
122,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know that there is going through the country too much of a feeling-engendere d in this House-that we were wrong in going so far in the matter of defence; but I consider that Australia took a step in the right direction, though I admit that the present is the time when we must give very serious consideration to the developments of the system. When speaking recently, I mentioned the confident hope that shortly there would be an Imperial Conference. The advent of aerial craft into the defence of the' nations is a great factor. I hope that Australia will take a prominent part in aerial defence, for, having perfected ourselves in that direction, we shall find that our geographical situation, so far removed from other shores, in stead of being a menace, will be a security to us. The strengthening of the aerial system should relieve us to a great extent of expenditure on defence within our shores. I have no desire to discount the remarks of honourable members with regard to the value of naval defence-it is an important matter-bu t I hope that, in the discussion of defence questions, no honourable member will be guilty of weakening the great determination of the people of Australia at all costs'to defend themselves as a nation against the worse that may happen.",26
123,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Newcastle) [12.22]. - I quite approve of the fact that Australia requires, and is worth, defending; but I believe that the existing scheme of defence has been tried and found wanting in many respects. That there is room for improvement and amendment, every honourable member must see. I do not agree with the honourable member for Werriwa as to the age at which boys should commence training. I would rather see the age fifteen years, but I would put a stop to the compulsory training of those over twenty-one years of age, and I would resort to the old partially paid or militia system to form our first line of land defence. It may be a hardship on parents to have to let their boys undergo this training, but it is twice as hard for a man over twenty-one years of age to have to give up his time and lose his work in order to do so. By training boys fourteen or fifteen years of age, there could be much more drilling by day than we have at the present time, when we train men to the age of twentysix.",26
124,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We should not allow night drills for young boys.,27
125,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I agree with the honourable member; but night drills are unavoidable. Where youths, and practically men, are trained, they have to work during the day. Many of. these trainees are married, and when they have to go into camp twice a year, run the risk of losing their employment, and they give up the wages they earn on which to support their families, and get from the nation in return 4s. a day. That seems to me to be the greatest hardship from which trainees are suffering. I am not particular as to a year or two in regard to the age at which the training should commence, but I certainly do think that the Australian youths can learn all the rudiments of drilling in five years. A f t e r a five years' course of training, we would have plenty of volunteers over twenty-one years of age infused by the military feeling, and with sufficient knowledge of military matters to volunteer and be members of a partially-paid force, such as the militia system we formerly had. It would be sufficient to make that force stronger than it has ever been in Australia. Every one should take' his share in the defence of the country. Those of us who have escaped compulsory training are imposing it on others; but I maintain that those who are compelled to learn the trade of warfare for the purpose' of defending the country should be well paid by those who have not the duty to perform. Therefore, I contend that the money that was set aside to pay the militia force of the past - should again be set aside to pay a similar force. It would not be more than out-of-pocket expenses to the men for the losses they would sustain in carrying out military work. We have not abolished our technical branch of the defence system, that is, in regard to manning our forts.",27
126,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We must have regular Forces.,27
127,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"C e r t a in l y ; but as we cannot afford to maintain a standing Army, the next best thing to do is to train our youths under the compulsory system for four or five years, and follow that up by a partially-paid militia. There is considerable objection to our present scheme. Every one, of course, must take his part in the defence of Australia, but employers and property-owners are those who have most at stake, and, therefore,, they should be called upon to make good what the trainees lose when they go into these camps twice a year, and learn to defend, not only their own hearths and homes, but also the property of their employers.

128,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Dalley) [12.30] - When , by courtesy of the Leader of the House, I was given permission last night to continue my speech' today, the argument I was seeking to develop was somewhat strained. I have attempted, in the course of my remarks, to show thajs some of the contentions of the Attorney General were without any real foundation. If the honourable gentleman's knowledge of the facts upon which the Government have founded this Bill is not more extensive than his literary in formation, we have a very easy case to meet. In the course of his opening address the Attorney-General referred to Aladdin carrying the Old Man of the Sea upon his shoulders. As a matter of fact, it was not Aladdin who carried on his shoulders the Old Man of the Sea. Aladdin was the possessor of the wonderful lamp, and I may be allowed to say that the Labour party have the wonderful lamp of truth. They represent a modern Aladdin carrying the lamp of truth for the enlightenment of the community, and to assist to a better understanding of what social and industrial development ought to be. The Old Man of the Sea was carried upon the shoulders of Sindbad. Sindbad, in the person of the Attorney-General, is the man who has sinned so badly. The Old Man of the Sea is represented by the old Conservative ideas which cling round the neck of the Attorney-General so closely that if he is not drowned by them he is likely soon to be politically strangled. I think we have the honourable gentleman fairly in the grip, and that the effect of the measure now under our consideration will be to hasten his political death. The honourable gentleman has spoken of "" spoils to the victors,"" and has charged the Australian Labour party with indulging in Tammany Hall practices. In what way have we done so ? It is claimed that we have done so by demanding preference for unionists * and by giving preference to ourown people. Who are our own people? Will any honourable member on - the other side contend that every trade unionist is a pledged man, and supports the Labour party? If they make such a contention they do not know what trade unionism is, and do not understand the feelings of the members of trade unions. It cannot be said that trade unionists in any State of this Commonwealth are pledged and tied down to the Labour party. While the Attorney-General was speaking the other night, and charging us with giving the spoils to the victors, a meeting of trade unionists was being lield in Sydney, the newspaper report of which was headed, ""The Union Party: Symptoms of Revolt."" Revolt against what? Apparently it was against the Labour party because they were given no spoils. It was contended that the Labour party failed to give effect to their promises, that instead of giving the spoils to the victors by assisting to forward the Labour platform, they had failed to do anything. At the very time the Attorney General was making his charge against this party there was a revolt on the part of trade unionists on the ground that we had done nothing for them. Who knows best where the spoils have gone? Is it the Attorney-General, or these people who are said to be in revolt? people who receive the spoils of victory are not a discontented people. They are satisfied to utilize the spoils, and look ward to more. Our people are not looking for spoils, but for something quite different. They are asking for justice, and are demanding from the members of the Labour party that they shall give effect to the promises they have made. I know how difficult it is to do this. We build up our ideals as high as heaven itself. We sincerely desire to attain those ideals, but the dross and dregs of the world hold us back, and we cannot in a day, or, it may even be, in many years, realise our highest aspirations. But [47] our ideals are ever there, and our purpose is to be ever striving upward towards a greater measure of social and industrial reform. In spite of this, we are charged by the Attorney-General with degrading ourselves and seeking to give the spoils to the victors, because we say that preference shall be given to unionists in the Public Service of this country. If that course were followed, only a few thousand people would be affected; still we are charged with' giving the spoils to the victors. From organized effort, everything good comes to the individual and to the organization, whether it be a party organization or the wider organization of society itself. The workers organize in their own interests, in the hope that they may be able to meet in that way the organized efforts of employers. From the two organizations it might be expected that a common understanding would be arrived at which must tend to the general good. This House should be prepared to foster organization of every kind."" Our friends opposite apparently desire that the Public Service should be a disorganized mob dominated by the Public Service Commissioner, or by the petty heads of the various Government Departments. They are afraid that the moment the public servants are organized they will be strong enough to meet the heads of the Departments upon an equal footing. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is what they are afraid of.",27
129,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is what they are afraid of. The Attorney-General asked if we could point to any one case of victimization by the Government, any case in which the Government' had dismissed a man because he was a unionist. That The is the difficulty. The Government as a Government, or Ministers as individual Ministers, have not dismissed men, but formen have been dismissed through officials and Departments, because they were unionists and had taken a prominent part in the trade union movement.",28
130,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Where was that?,28
131,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot mention names.,28
132,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not think the honourable member could give an instance.,28
133,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the gentlemen to whom I am going to refer will permit me to do so, I will give the names. I know a gentleman who is now in the Newcastle Savings Bank, and who was ordered to leave a political Labour league, or the result would be detrimental to his interests; if he did not leave, he knew what the reBult would be.",28
134,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Was that in the State Savings Bank?,29
135,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes .,29
136,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member referred to Federal Ministers.,29
137,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I will give another illustration. In the Land Tax Department in Sydney, one of the best temporary hands-h e was so good that his time was extended-wa s dismissed from the service as soon as it was known that he was a member of the Clerks Union, and had commenced to help his fellows in the Department to an understanding of their position. He was not ' ' You are a member of the Clerks wrong thing. Union, and must g o . "" Oh, no! When he asked for a reason, no reason was given to him. But the Department was quite prepared to continue his engagement while he kept his mouth shut. know of other cases. this House some years ago, I was told by heads of Departments, "" We like you, Howe, you are a capable servant; but don't go on in that way, because as sure as you do, you will be booted."" on in that way, but they did not boot me. So I say that preference to ists is a reasonable and legitimate claim to make. In the Public Service if there is not the organized effort of trade ists, there is a disorganized mob of indisettlement viduals who may be ruled by the heads of the various Departments. is better to have an organized body of war. men in the employ of the Government. Honourable members object to preference, but if all the men in the service joined the unions tliere could be no preference. In any case, preference does not mean robbing any other man of the right to work ; it means only that if there is one matic negotiations have failed. billet and two applicants, the organized individual shall have preference over the - disorganized individual. Is that wrong ?",29
138,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,If he is competo tent he gets the preference.,29
139,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General has ridiculed the qualification "" all things being equal."" But the honourable member is putting himself in opposition to his own party.

150,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then you have no need for au Arbitration Act at all.,29
151,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member l was ought to get a brush and clean his brains. is unable to perceive a clear argument. I wish to know what attitude the Government intend to adopt in regard to this matter - Are they prepared, to follow in the footsteps of the leader of their party, the Attorney-General? Are they prepared to go even further than is outlined in this Bill, because I fear that if he succeeds in pushing this measure through he will afterwards seek to repeal our. Conciliation and Arbitration Acts He does not believe in granting preference to unionists, either in the case of Government servants, who are outside the Act, or in the case of persons who come within the terms of the Act which was passed at the instance of his own party. The honourable gentleman has appealed to us to pass this measure, so that it may be transmitted to the Senate. He has asked whether we are game to fight. My answer is that we are game to fight, and that the Bill will not pass this Chamber if we can prevent it. We throw down the gage of battle to him here, and we shall do the same thing if necessary in the Senate. Before he can whip us he must take us to the country, and we do not fear the consequences. Preference to unionists is a principle in which we believe, and we shall fight it to the bitter end, no matter what may be the result. The Attorney-General paid the honourable member for Boothby and myself the compliment of saying that we were the only two members upon this side of the House who are prepared to support the idea of compulsory unionism. The honourable gentleman holds that certain rights and privileges must be given up by unions, otherwise no such thing as compulsory unionism could come into existence. May I remind him that this Government have pi'omised to bring forward a system of national insurance. Is not that to be compulsory? Certainly it is. Prom a health aspect its provisions will be compulsory upon the whole nation. But what rights will the nation give up because the principle of compulsion is to operate? Do we not know that compulsion is at our very door ? We are surrounded with it. Our cadet system is compulsory. Why, then, should it be urged that some rights which unions claim for themselves should be given up? It has been argued that the books of all unions should be open to examination. But only last night I quoted from a document published in New South Wales, in which all expenditure by unions in that State is [47]_ 2 clearly set out. What more is required! Our unions spend their money as they choose, but the majority of them do not expend their funds for political purposes. They have not the funds to spend. Seeing that unionists contribute only about 4d. or 6d. per week, and have to fight - costly cases before the Arbitration Court, it is obvious that there can be very little money left to put into a political fund to fight the gentlemen who can hire #motor-cars by the hundred.",29
152,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Labour party hired hundreds of motor-cars at the last elections. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We are the poor of the earth.,30
153,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I know who have the motor-cars. It is not the Labour party.' I know who placed them in the hands of my opponent at the last election, when I had to get round my constituency aa best I could. On that occasion money was freely spent, not by the Labour party, but by the Liberal party, and by all the forces of capitalism throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I do not know that it is necessary for me to say more. The Attorney-General has refused the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the value of this Bill. He is prepared to fight the matter to the bitter end. So are we. The honourable gentleman has instituted a comparison between the wages paid in Canada and those paid in Australia. He has pointed out that, higher rates of wages obtain in the Dominion, and that those higher rates have been obtained without resort to conciliation and arbitration. I say, at once, that nobody can read that utterance without recognising how far-fetched it is. One cannot look through the list which he quoted without seeing that those higher rates of wages relate exclusively to workmen engaged in the building trade-to bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, &c. . Now honourable members know perfectly well that, in Canada, for four or five months in the year, outside employment is absolutely impossible. Naturally, therefore, the wages paid in the building trade there are higher than they are here. But the crucial test is: What is the purchasing value of the wages which are paid ? We must learn what prices obtain in Canada before we can institute a fair comparison. In Australia we have established nominal rates of wages. As a Labour party we do not desire to institute comparisons between countries whose conditions are utterly dissimilar. The success of our efforts must be determined by asking whether under the conditions which we have established here, as compared with the conditions which formerly obtained, an improvement has been effected. That is the position which the Government will have to face when an appeal is made to the country - the",30

I understand, Mr Speaker, that, before leaving the chair at 1 p.m., you announced that the House would resume at 2.15 p.m., but that you were good enough, later on, to send word to honourable members that we should not resume until 2.30 p.m. I presume that you were acting within your rights in doing so ?",31

I inadvertently announced, when leaving the chair, that the sittings were suspended until 2.15 p.m.; but was reminded subsequently by one of the officers that it was the custom during all-day sittings to meet after lunch at 2.30 p.m. I therefore instructed the officer to advise honourable members accordingly, through the Whips and personally, as far as practicable, believing that, in such circumstances, the adjournment until the usual hour would better suit their convenience.",31
157,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The only point is that a message might be sent to members, in your name, giving the wrong time of meeting.",31

161,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When we adjourned for lunch, I was dealing with the question of preference to unionists. I propose now to make a quotation from a speech made by the Attorney-General at Sandringham a few days ago, in the. course of which he saidTo him had fallen the task of putting on anti-preference collar, and his, therefore, was the hand that was bitten. Let me tell the honourable gentleman that he has not put on the anti-preference collar, and that not only his hand, but his throat, will be bitten before he succeeds in doing so. We are here with a de- strong determination to fight him. The anti-preference collar is not yet on the union dog. The Labour bullpup is ready to fight him to the end.

163,Colonel RYKIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What is the honourable member's weight?,31
164,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is enough to meet that of the honourable member at any time. The Attorney-General went on to say thatIf any one could wipe out the now notorious preference proclamation of Mr O'Malley, and the somewhat reluctant consent given to it by Mr Fisher, no one would be so glad as the members of the Labour Party. It hung like a cloud around their necks. I do nob know that clouds hang round our necks any more than round the necks of the Liberal party. Clouds do not usually hang round any one's neck, so that the honourable gentleman's metaphor is not one upon which he can be complimented. If the Attorney-General, however, has a cloud about him, how does he propose to rid himself of it? We are prepared to meet him in every way, and I trust that he will not try to cloud the real issue to a greater extent than he has hitherto attempted to do. I observe that the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister are now in consultation. Are they very much alarmed? Some serious proposition is evidently engaging their consideration. I should like their attention. Seemingly the courtesy of the House is not to be extended to me. It is evident that honourable members may discuss between themselves any matter they please.",31

170,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General, in the course of the speech to which I was referring when interrupted, went on to say of preference to unionists in GovernAttorney-General's ment employment thatIt had not even been demanded by Labour supporters. Only yesterday I showed that absolute preference to unionists had been claimed by organizations throughout New South Wales and by political labour parties in respect of, not only Government, but private employment. The Attorneysion General, therefore, has been fighting what out of them? has been termed "" the shadow of a sham."" The shadow of a sham is displayed in the attitude which he has taken up. He went on to sayBefore the State could consent to compulsory unionism the unions would have to give up the right to say who should be members who should not. He proceeded to demand that there should be numerous concessions before the grantbacking ing of absolute preference to unionists. Why should we give up anything that we possess today, and in what way are we expected to give up that which we have? Preference exists in this community toHouse day in a thousand and one ways. is no aspect of our social life in respect of which there is not compulsion. Why, then, should the Attorney-General take this attitude in 'regard to compulsory unionism? Is there anything connected with our trade unions that is not plain and open to the world? Is there any this aspect of our industrial methods that is not open to his investigation? Is it not open to him to find out for himself whether trade unions and trade union practices are or are not beneficial to the community? I placed before the honourable gentleman yesterday a document issued by the Registrar of Trade Unions in New South Wales.",32

Even when placed in possesof all the facts, what can he make Can he show that trade union funds are utilized for political rather than for industrial purposes, and even if they are utilized to some extent for political purposes, is that a crime ? Why may they not be so utilized ? Where do the Attorney-General and those behind and rather than for industrial purposes, and great organizations of capital, which stand behind him and his party, used in him up? Are they not utilized for political purposes ?

The preference by law that many unionists are now asking for would, I contend, be fatal on two grounds. The first, and most important, is that it would be fatal to the best interests of the community, and the second is that it would he fatal to the very organizations themselves. Those honourable members who prattle in favour of compulsory unionism and of preference forget that if it were realized every person would immediately be forced into a union.  all the lawyers are in the union?",33

I think I have, time and again, heard the honourable member denounce lawyers and their union; and honourable members opposite have gone so far as to prevent them, appearing in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I point out, however, that the legal profession is open to every citizen who is not a criminal, and who passes the necessary examination; under the circumstances, therefore, the argument by analogy fails. I truly believe that I am now speaking in the interests of the unionists themselves. Voluntary organization should not be interfered with when, by its means, citizens are struggling to exact the best they can from the conditions of life, because by so much as such struggles raise the general tone so is the community as a whole benefited. Honourable members opposite, however, wish to go back to the rusty, musty, fusty past, and are catching up with the legislation of a little over 4,000 years ago.",33
185,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That was the Golden Age.,33
186,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Was it the Golden Age for the workers? They then had to belong to an organization whether they liked it or not; there was practically no escape. If we go back to the first code of which we have any record, namely, that of Hammourabi, of 4,300 years ago, we find that a man could carry on The one trade only, and that his wages and conditions were fixed by law. At the dawn of the Roman Empire, 700 years B.C., in the days of Numa Pompilius, guilds were recognised. We must remember, of course, that industry was not then carried on as it is now, but was much simpler, and fewer artisans and craftsmen were employed. Fortunately for themselves, the bulk were protected only by custom, which had the force of law, and it was not for a long period that they sought the sanction of the law itself. After a lapse of 700 or 800 years, we find a good many instances of workmen being, as it were, controlled by law,, and forced into unions, because thereby better supervision could be exercised over them by the authorities, and then decay began. ' In the year 226 A.D. we find an instance of the very porters engaged in carrying goods to and from the quays obtaining an. edict which, declared as a blackleg, and forbade to work, any one not a member of the fraternity. It will be seen that compulsion is a very old idea indeed.",33
187,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It belongs to theStone Age.,33
188,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is interesting to hear troglodytes talking of the Stone Age.,33
189,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Who are the troglodytes? Honourable members opposite desire to revert to a condition of things-which we find near the dawn of historya condition of things which men, as soon as they began to progress, sought to alter. However, as I was saying, I draw a great distinction between voluntary and compulsory organization. Voluntary organization is flexible and capable of adapting itself to. the needs of the times?and the seasons, and it can readily be modified almost at will. On the other <hand, an organization which is fixed and - controlled by legal authority is not flexible. What would have happened, i o r instance, supposing that in 1902 a law of preference had been passed, and - every worker forced into a union? The agricultural workers, for instance, if banded together, would represent a body over 400,000 strong; and such large bodies in all the industries would show all the defects of the compulsory principle, for they would inevitably become antagonistic one to the other.",33
190,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The little unions fight - each other.,34
191,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so. What I - am showing now is that, if all are compelled to join unions, and these large unions become antagonistic, the battle will be continued with an utter disregard of the public interest, as has frequently happened. Many of the advantages now enjoyed by some of the unions could never have been gained 9iad unionism applied to the whole people. Will any one say that the large body of - agricultural workers would have permitted the railway servants, for instance, to obtain the advantages that they did, seeing that these meant additional freight o n produce ?",34
192,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is an argument for complete organization right through.,34
193,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Voluntar y and sectional unionism can obtain their fullest - desires compatible with the carrying on of a business, but this advantage would disappear, as I have shown, under compulsion'. Again, when the wharf - lumpers struck for better terms, can we imagine that with compulsory unionism the farmers and others engaged in agriculture would have conceded their demand, seeing how it would affect their pockets 1 There is the other fact, that if unionism becomes - compulsory under the' law, it becomes hereditary. In every case, unions which liave been able to obtain the co-operation of the masters or the Government have shown this tendency. . I need scarcely refer to the fact that in India the great castes have practically sprung from indust r i a l associations of the kind, so far as we can judge, though the evidence on the point is not complete. Under such a system, a man is all right whilst his particular industry flourishes, but if adversity comes he cannot go into another; and no better illustration of that fact can be found than that if a man, at the present time, is out of employment, he finds it impossible to get into another union under a couple of months.",34
194,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is not correct.,34
195,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not think I am exaggerating.,34
196,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The unions take the fees as quickly as they can get them.,34
197,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In many cases, even money will not induce unions to admit other citizens. Under the circumstances, one can easily see the great evil that might be entailed on unionists themselves by the policy suggested by honourable members opposite.",34
198,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,JJoe s the honourable member say that preference should be given if the unions can enforce it by their strength J,34
199,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; provided they are voluntary and are not infringing on the rights of others. W it h that condition, a man should have the full benefit of his energy and industry, and he can best obtain that by voluntary association.",34
200,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Arbitration Acts, both Commonwealth and State, prevent'men from obtaining tlieir objects in that way.",34
201,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not agree with the Arbitration Acts, .as I have frequently pointed out. In my opinion, if the dictates of the Courts are absolutely enforced, they tend to make serfs or slaves of the men belonging to the unions; and it is because we on this side stand for liberty and order that we are so strongly opposed to the principle of compulsion.",34
202,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then the honourable member favours strikes?,34
203,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I undoubtedly favour strikes, because the only alternative to strikes is slavery; and the risk of strikes is the price the people pay for liberty. It is better that there should be this risk than that we should live as slaves; and it is because we wish to see the people of Australia free to conduct their business as. they choose, without infringing the rights of others, that we are so much opposed to compulsion. In my heart of hearts I am certain that the true friends of voluntary unionism are on this side of the chamber, and that the action that honourable members opposite would take if they had the power, would be a*i absolutely wrong one. They propose the wrong remedy, and do not know that their political strychnine is a poison. Compulsion would destroy the value of the unionism that they seek to foster. There should be no such thing as fostering by parliamentary enactment the interests of either individuals or sections of the community. Every decent, honest citizen, rich or poor, occupying a proud or a humble position, is entitled to the protection of Parliament, but neither favour should be shown nor preference given to any one in the community. The more fully we recognise that, the better it will be for the country.",34
204,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We want to give preference to our men, because you give preference to yours. """,35
205,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is the honourable member complaining of the law which obtains preference for any citizen by reason of his possession of a better brain or better health than his fellows ? If . so, his quarrel is with the Almighty, who decreed men unequal. He is complaining of something which it is beyond human power to regulate. Parliament should make no laws for the giving of preference; its first object should be to destroy privileges of every kind. Whenever a citizen is found appropriating gains that, do not belong to him, Parliament should try* to alter the laws which allow that to be done.",35
206,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is what we wish to do.,35
207,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No ; you are seeking to create fresh privileges. Is it not manifest that the type of trade unionism which will not allow those outside a union to work, is not in the interests of labour as a whole? The attitude of honourable members towards free labourers proves that. True unionism admits the right of every one in the community to work. Every free man could enter the old English unions. We seem to be departing from that principle. This so-called Labour party evidently cannot speak in the name of labour as a whole. What is its object in compelling every one to become a unionist? The special advantages of being in unions will disappear when all are unionists. No preference could be shown to unionists as against other unionists. If an organization is to continue to exist, it must observe the ordinary rules of justice. The enemies of trade unionism are those who seek unwittingly to destroy the advantages of voluntary association. They would enslave the community. A body of men who are not at liberty to work or to settle matters as may seem best to them cannot be said to be free. Strikes are declaimed against, but are they so dreadful ? They were never heard of in the Southern States of America. Why? Because all the workers there were slaves. In the Northern States there were free men and many strikes, the strikes being evidence of freedom.",35
208,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Would the honourable member say that on the platform at election time?,35
209,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . I have been saying it for years past. Every man has the right to refuse to work. I honour the man who says, "" I will not work for any one under compulsion."" I am prepared to fight on the side of such a man. I am prepared to take the part of the down-trodden citizen who is oppressed at the will of a slave-master, or at the dictate of a Judge calling himself a Court. The name may be changed, but the man who dictates to another, saying that he shall work when he does not wish to work, is a slave-driver, and the man who obeys him is a slave. The experience of the ages, if properly studied, shows that the worker has nothing to gain from being directed in every way, and that he will do most for his own advancement and that of the country when free to use. the intelligence with which the Almighty has gifted him. There are two systems by which the world can be ruled; one is the system of status, under which a man lives, marries,, and dies in the status into which he was born, there being no escape from it . What contributed largely to the decay of the Roman Empire was the creation of castes. Laws were made forcing bakers, sailors, and others to continue perpetually in the condition of life into which they were born. The accumulation of property in the hands of the Government in the early centuries of the Roman Empire tended to accelerate the enslavement of the people, and many recognising that this meant slavery fled away to escape the thraldom. The same thing will happen if honourable members opposite have their desires. .But consider the injury and harm that will be done to the country. Honourable members opposite wish to obtain the control of the political funds of a large body of the people. If they stated that openly, instead of speaking of wishing to consult the interests of the people, they would be more honest. Each unionist pays from 10s. to £ 2 12s. a year in contributions of one kind and another, the payments being compulsory, and recoverable at law. Parliament acted stupidly in allowing this. present funds, which may amount to £700,000 or £800,000 a year, could be increased to £2,700,000, especially if the women were forced to join unions, by doing what honourable members wish to do.",35
210,Mr AKTHUB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The fees and conditions of the unions must be reasonable. If they are not, the union may be de-registered, and cannot sue for recovery.",36
211,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I know that the fees are not reasonable. They might be reasonable for men in the position of the honourable member or myself, but it is not reasonable to ask workmen to pay £ 1 or £ 2 a year. Some of the shearers who are employed for only a few months in the year pay even more in proportion, as they are employed only during part of the year,  gone up 10s.",36
212,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member for Werriwa knows more about other subjects.,36
213,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member feels that I know too much about this subject. If honourable members opposite did what they want to do, they would have a political f u n d amounting to something like £2,700,000 a year. A r e they venturesome enough to tell the public that that is their object? Will they say to the people, "" We wish to compel every one of you to be unionists, and to contribute to union funds. Our intention is that a man shall not enjoy the rights of citizenship unless he be a unionist. The Trades H all Council is to be your real Parliament."" When this Parliament permitted union secretaries to recover their fees at law, we should have safeguarded the union funds, which are contributed by poor men. It is estimated that the levies and fees paid by unionists throughout Australia amount to something like £750,000 a year. calculation is made on of the New South Wales figures. In that State the contributions exceed £300,000, and the unionists amount to about 36 per cent, of the workers. H a d honourable members opposite really desired the welfare of the workers, what would have been done with these funds? At the end of twenty years a sum of over £20,000,000 would have been accumulated, and any body of capitalists would have lent another £20,000,000 The on it being shown to them that the money would be used properly. That would have given £40,000,000 for investment, and would have allowed those who have contributed to unions to build their own cottages, to buy their own farms, to start business on the share system, and to obtain many more advantages. This may come about in the future. W h at big results might be accomplished by effort in that direction! The accumulation of savings with a view to their application for the benefit of the contributors would be a fine example of voluntary t h r if t , which is worth more t h a n , the compulsory t h r if t exercised through membership of compulsory State insurance societies and in other ways. The practice of t h r if t raises the dignity of a man, tending to the formation of character, and the strengthening of the nation. pay has In this way, therefore, honourable members opposite, if they had understood their business, might perhaps have taken a big part in the movement, and deserved the support, not only of every member of . voluntary unions, but of every citizen of Australia, because of the betterment that would have come to the large class of workers they profess to represent. In the near future it will be our duty to safeguard by law the funds of the workers just as they have been by law collected; and when we find that the hard-fisted grasping concerns, which the Labour party declare the large corporations to be, can carry on their businesses at the rate of 2s. in the pound, surely men in the Labour party, overflowing with, the milk of human kindness, can well undertake the management of the funds of unions at a cost of 4s. in the pound. If we allow that sum for management, and safeguard the funds of the unions above that amount, we shall confer on. the workers of Australia a greater benefit than has ever been brought about That by the party opposite. Of course, while the basis these associations were voluntary they could not be interfered with, and could spend their money in their own way, b ut the moment they became compulsory bodies and asked to be brought under the law the Legislature had the right to insist that the funds they were able to collect by law should be safeguarded by law, and in omitting to do so Parliament committed a big wrong to the' members of the community. Some people urge that unions have increased the remuneration of labour, but as a matter of fact the remuneration of labour is not increased until the u t i l it y of labour is increased, which is a very different thing indeed. Honourable members may be surprised when I say that the advance in wages throughout Australia has not been as great as it would have been had there been no interference from the various Arbitration Courts. The continual hindrance of business by the necessity to observe, fresh awards of the Arbitration Court-on e employer works under 43 different awards, secured by what I may term entrepreneurs of labour disputesevery one of which tends to detract the attention of valuable commercial men from their business, and to lessen their profits, and undermine their health, has been a distinct in j u r y to the community. It may seem ridiculous to honourable members opposite to assert that wages are not always increased by the Courts, but the coal miners got all they could obtain long before Parliament took a hand in trying to manage these things.",36
214,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No .,37
215,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Clearl y that is the case. The Federal Arbitration Court did not come into existence u n t i l 1903, and the State Act was not in force in New South Wales until 1902, but the coal miners of that State had their wages fixed by mutual agreement long before then, and anything the Courts have done since in raising the wages in other unions has only tended to lower their wages by increasing the cost of the articles they purchase, thus in effect not increasing their wages, but reducing them.",37
216,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do you apply statement to the miners in Victoria 1,37
217,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not so sure of them, but the honourable member can see that the matter depends very little on unions. When wages for miners in K a l goorlie were £ 4 , miners in Victoria were being paid £ 2 . The question really rests on the natural law of supply and demand, which nothing honourable members may say can'overcome. Let me take the case of domestic servants, 140,000 in number, a3 an instance of wages being increased without the aid of any unions. The> domestic servants form the second largest body in the community.",37
218,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And they are the poorest paid.,37
219,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They are certainly not the poorest paid today. Their wageshave increased by 100 per cent., allowing for extra cost of keep.",37
220,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Because most of thegirls prefer to work in factories.,37
221,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If a girl is to do her duty to the nation, a factory is the last place to which she should be put. A factory is no training ground for the rearing of children. The union of man and woman is natural. There can be no departure fro m the big law of following the great dictates of nature; and I ask any man of sense whether he would rather choose for his companion in life a g i r l who has been in domestic service, who can make his home comfortable and his l if e bappy, as against a g i r l who is employed in a factory, and has had no training in domestic work. An y man of sense would say that the g i r l with domestic trainin g is infinitely better fitted to take on the duties of motherhood and of attending toa home. That is common sense. I quotedomestic servants to show that the greatrise in wages they have secured has been purely without the efforts of a union. Next take the case of the rural workersi n pastoral and agricultural pursuits, numbering over 435,000. Taking into consideration the increased cost of living, the increase of wages in their case has been from 50 to 60 per cent.",37
222,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What is your authority for saying that?,37
223,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have seen the booksof scores and scores of men, showing the rates of wages paid previously and those paid now.",37
224,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What were the wages that previously ?,37
225,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In the rural districts they were extremely low. The honourable member for Grey recollects the time when sturdy men worked for 10s. a week. Yoir could not get those men to work for that wage now. The cost of living is full y 5s. or 6s. a week more; but you would notget those men under 25s. a week at the present time. The big increase in wageshas been dependent on something utterly without and beyond the control of Parliaments. It has been dependent on thebig increase in the price' of our products the world over. Thirteen years ago I told honourable members who were then in Parliament that the development of our export in meat would cause a rise of wages utterly beyond the power 'of any one to anticipate; that if , through the agency of cold storage, we could land our meat and our other products in the Old Country in the same condition as they reached the consumers in Australia, Australia would rise in the scale of nations; but that the increase in wages would be enormous. I challenge any honourable member to say that this was not a perfectly correct prophecy. I pointed out, however, at the time, as I point out today, that by our Tariff we do, and we are about to still further, deprive the workers of the Commonwealth of a large proportion of that increase that would otherwise be theirs. We now contribute about £16,000,000 a year through the Customs.",37
226,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And I reckon that the workers pay about £13,000,000 of that amount.",38
227,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does that not bear out what I have said-that there is no way of imposing taxation so as to avoid its falling more heavily on the poor man than on the rich 1 As the poor man always seems to have to bear the burden of taxation, even though we attempt to put it on the rich man, let honourable members agree with me when I say that we should make the taxation light on the rich man, so that when he passes it on to the poor .man, it will also be light upon the latter. That is the trueprinciple on which Governments should act. If coercion and intimidation are necessary to maintain trade unionism, it would be better for the State and for the people that unions should utterly perish; but I deny that coercion is necessary for true voluntary unionism. Tyranny, violence, and compulsion all bring their punishment sooner or later. They are merely symptoms of decay, or of such gross ignorance on the part of Legislatures as to bring down in the scale of comfort the people for whom these acts are done. Therefore, it behoves us to regard all these encroachments with a jealous eye; and if honourable members opposite thoroughly understood the history of the past, and thoroughly understood their duty to unions, they would have been the very first years ago to safeguard the funds of unions. There was natural hesitation on the part of the Liberals to interfere with them. The Liberals said that surely these men should know what they were doing, and they delayed dealing with the matter. Honourable members assert that in the past legislation has always been on the side of the employer.",38
228,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hear , hear !",38
229,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member will be surprised when I point out that Henry I . , in a law concerning the weavers of London, said that no one but themselves should introduce themselves into their creed; while in 1363 it was decreed that all artisan craftsmen should be joined in one trade only. Again, as far back as 1305, in the reign of Edward I . , it was enactedl t shall He a conspiracy for employers to combine together to lower wages or increase the hours of work or alter the hours of work to the detriment of the poor man. It is utterly forgotten that a great deal of the legislation that was passed in early times aimed at the fixing of prices. In fact, the legislation in the past mainly consisted of fixing the labourer to the place in which he was born, and it was enacted that no man, unless he was receiving a certain amount per annum, could be allowed to apprentice his children to artificers. Fortunately for progress; with the free spirit that seemed to come over England for a time, a big body of men were able to throw themselves into everything without interference by the Government. It is only 120 years since the last of those restrictive Acts was passed in Great Britain . Over 200 various Acts had been passed regulating the conditions of life, and the very word "" outlaw "" originally referred to a man who was outside the union, craft, or guild law.",38
230,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How were the workers regulated ?,38
231,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They were regulated in the direction of fixing men in. the mode of life in which they were born. Trouble arose as soon as the unions called Parliament to help them. Immediately they become compulsory bodies instead of voluntary bodies, that moment trouble arises.",38
232,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The system of those days is absolutely different from the system of today.,38
233,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member thinks so', but in each case when the unions sought the aid of the law these evils resulted. In the days of King Otto of Germany, about a thousand years ago, a number of men were outside the union laws because they were annoyed that the unions were charging them such heavy fees for interest, and they called upon the King, and said that they wanted to start work outside the unions. Otto said,'"" Certainly not; the unions were ordained by our fathers for the purpose that every man, by and them, should get his living."" Otto honestly believed that to be a fact. He did not realise that those free men were initiating the system of competition which was ultimately to be the power to lead to the progress of today. It is only during the last 120 years that competition has really begun. Before that time it was almost impossible for even a transcendental genius to rise. man belonged to a noble class he could get along, but, if not, it was extremely difficult for him to do so. True progress has been made only by sweeping those old laws and customs; it has consisted in breaking down those old laws of compulsion which members on the Opposition side wish us to revert to. They forget that if we went back to those laws we would go back to the same conditions of slavery as then We could not escape from that Competition may bring about evils, and it unquestionably has done so, and it is the duty of Parliament to see how far it can control what one may call the evils of the competitive and yet allow of a full development of the initiative of the people. members opposite seek, in the of humanity, as they say, to put down competition, because regulating man in a union means regulating regulating his dress, his food, the hour he shall rise, and the hours he shall work; but let honourable members not forget that all that has been done before. It has been tried so many scores of times in so many different ages, amongst so many different nations, that, if there had been any way out of the morass which tliey had plunged surely the ability of some man would have enabled them to find that But they never found a way out, and in the last 120 years more has been done for the development of the worker competition than by anything Thanks to the gospel of competition, Mr Conroy. he, at last, can walk the streets without bowing down, cap in hand, to the nobleman who passes-him by. Thanks to the gospel of competition, he can go abroad in the country as a free man, stay where he likes, and work where he likes, and when he likes. And yet borjorable memKing bers, professing to be on the side of the worker, would bring him back to that slavery from which his soul has only rethrough cently escaped. Even Watt, the great King inventor of the steam-engine, who, by developing mechanical pursuits, did more for human progress than any other man, was not allowed by the Guild of Glasgow to sell his invention there, because it was feared that it would displace men from their employment. So it is today; if the unions became compulsory bodies they would stop the march of progress, and If a everybody would sink back to the conditions of past ages. Can any honourable member point to an instance of progress having been made until the compulsory away laws were broken down ? Has it happened in England, Franoe, Germany, or even in older civilizations, such as India, Egypt, Babylonia, and Syria? .Surely the characters of people have not changed so much; their fears, hates, and loves, all their passions and emotions, were much existed. the same then as they are now, and if result. through all their histories advancement certain only came when they broke away from the trammels of the compulsory law, let us at least allow the voluntary system some chance of showing whether it can be system, operated successfully or not. I say that voluntary association does promote order Honourable and foster liberty. interests Mr ABTHUK - And ends in Syndicalism. every Mr CONROY - Honourable members prices, do not understand that, after all, there is only a certain wealth f u n d annually created, but by our system of confidence and credit one with another, we can make use of the wealth we have to a fuller and greater .extent every day, according as that confidence increases. Honourable members who try into to stimulate class hatreds are doing the themselves, most in j u r y to the great masses of the people; they are, in effect, killing the way. goose that lays the golden eggs. And a proverb like that would . never have sprung up except after misery untold had by been experienced, not once or twice, but else. thousands of times, so that it became so notorious as to pass into aproverb. If honourable members want another illustration, I can quote from the old 'Biff Veda the advice given to a king of India, "" Take care, Oh King, not to oppress thy merchants with too heavy taxes, but, above all, drive not the tillers of the soil off the land by thy oppression. Them thou canst not restore."" By seeking, as some do, to develop the industrial trades at the expense of the great agricultural trades, honourable members are, in effect, seeking to do an injury that cannot be overcome. They do not show understanding of the fact that, until there is a development of all trades, there can be no true development a't all, but honourable members must learn that, because, if they do not, they are not studying what is the best lining in the interests of the country. How easy it would be for members on this side to say, "" We, as a Parliament, can lighten your lot in life; return us, and there will be a haven of happiness for all . """,38
234,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You do say that.,40
235,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We say nothing of the sort. We say, "" Beware of Parliaments; they are a curse, and are swallowing up your substance. Unless you people do the work first, there can be no funds for us to take."" I say to them, "" Guard yourselves against Parliament. In times past tyrants and kings robbed you."" liament is robbing the people by taxes today, and we have to appeal to the intelligence of this country to prevent it. The whole force of the legislation of honourable members opposite seems to be directed towards increasing the burden of taxes on the people. After all, if the advancement of the country could come about through Parliament, what a foolish thing it is not to have three Parliaments in existence, working three eight-hour shifts. What a happy home Australia would be! We should have three Parliaments-Labou r Parliaments, of courseworking eight-hour shifts, grinding out laws from day to day, regulating conditions, wages, and everything else, and, in the end, calling upon the worker to pay for them. That is the big injury Parliaments are doing to Australia. We are taking away the money of the people, and so surely as we spend it , so surely do we rob and deprive the man who has earned it of the right to spend it in his own way. I hold it as a cardinal principle that any man who earns money by the sweat of his brow, the use of his brains, or by the expenditure of capital, is entitled to every penny so earned. When Parliament deprives him of that right, it is taking away from him a large part of hia freedom; it is injuring the community as a whole, and destroying that confidence and credit which should belong to all sections of the community. If we depart from that principle, we tend to bring the nation to ruin. "" Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods "" ; it is an eternal principle and a Divine commandment. Some honourable members on the Opposition side say, "" Let us stir up class hatred so that we may get into Parliament; punish the people; but allow us to have a parliamentary majority."" Is that the way to do away with all those feelings and class prejudices that have tended to keep down nations in times past? It is only by the observance of the eternal principles I have enunciated that there can be any true advancement in the life of a nation. As long as I and other members on this side are associated, we will always bear in mind that there is one law to hold fast to, and that is to preserve to every man his liberty of speech, his liberty of conscience, and the liberty to utilize his earnings. His liberty to utilize his earnings is at present being threatened. Unfortunately, in Par- times past, the Liberal party have been up against the Tories of Labour. What are honourable members op-' posite but Tories ? In the matter of militarism what are they doing but following the Tories in England ? Is there anything they can do in the way of legislative or administrative oppression that they have not attempted to do? They are the Tory party, and the fight of the people of Australia today is against the Tory party masquerading under the sacred name of Labour. That name should have been reserved for those who have fought and are fighting for the interests of Labour. I , and many others on this side of the House, are proud to dub ourselves ""The Labour-Liberals of Australia,"" because we know that we are fighting for the real interests of Labour. I can understand the loud guffaws of honourable members opposite. It is really absurd to speak to them of Labour having any rights. They talk of the rights of Labour, but invariably vote against them. In a thousand ways the Labour party have lost the right to the use of such a sacred name. The whole of their legislation has been contrary to the interests of Labour. We on this side must carry on the fight for liberty, whether it be against militarism- I refer not to the proper defence of the country, but to militant militarism --o r legislation such as was abandoned ages ago by wise men as being calculated to do injury to the working classes. We shall do well on this side of the House to remember what the name "" Liberal"" Bieans. It means that we are a free party --- a body of men united to fight for the freedom of every citizen.",40
236,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It may mean that, but it is not actually so.",41
237,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is; and as long as we keep that goal in view we are likely to attain success. Our principle must be to ""hitch our waggon to a star."" Parliaments, after all, are only big Committees of management, and where they attempt to correct the mistakes made as between one body of men and another, they often do injury. When Parliaments, by taxation, by interference of any sort, seek to regulate the worker, then, to that extent, they make him a slave. When they bind him down in the Courts they un'doubtedly do so. We object to the use of the Courts in this respect. We are ""fighting for the free man-for the unionist .who wants to be a free. citizen, able to combine with-others in voluntary association, and seeking not the support of the law, because he knows that in the long run it will do injury not only to himself, but to the rest of the community.",41
238,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Brisbane) [3.48]. --Whateve r may happen to unionism as the direct result of this Bill, or any other legislation, the honourable member for Werriwa, who has just resumed his seat, will be able to say that he warned us sufficiently, aud that he "" told us so."" He has prophesied nun. He has cajoled the unionists. He has invited them to consider their operations and their methods. He has spoken in denunciation of the whole gamut of unionism, and he .will be able to say, in the days to come,. whether the unions meet with disaster or success, "" I prophesied in Parliament .what Would happen."" One statement made by him was interesting to me, because of its contradictoriness. He said, for instance, that all his advice, all the formation he was supplying and the illustrations he was giving from history, were designed to he in the interests of the unions themselves. The unionists of Australia will be pleased to know that the honourable member has taken so much interest in them. Unfortunately, however, unionists for centuries have been accustomed to be told that some one knows better than they themselves do what is good for them. We have a clear recollection of the good old times when, the worker was told to fear God, honour the King, and be content with the sphere in which it had pleased the Almighty to place him. He was patted on the back, and told that he was a jolly good fellow as long as he tipped his hat to the squire and was content with the wages he received and the hours that he was asked to work. The honourable member for Werriwa indulged in a perfervid speech designed to show unionists that he is their friend, and that he knows better than they do what is good for them. He certainly used some remarkable arguments. In the first place, he said that Parliament should protect every man, and secure to him the full results of his labour. He went on to quote from ancient history to prove that unionists had been so protected. He quoted comparatively modern laws declaring that employers should not combine or conspire to lower the wages or lengthen the hours of the workers. But almost immediately afterwards he proceeded to denounce appeals to Parliament, declaring that the workers would do better to depend upon voluntary associations rather than upon the law to protect them. He urged that interference by Parliament in this respect was wrong, leading only to disaster, and that every attempt to rely upon the parliamentary institution to effect this purpose was altogether immoral.",41
239,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I should have said that unemployment amongst the workers was never so great as in those days.,41
240,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Her e is yet another argument coming in. The honourable member at the outset declared his emphatic approval of the use of the parliamentary machine to protect the workers in the matter of wages and hours of employment. But in closing his speech he appealed to them to be,free citizens, acting independently of Parliament, and depending entirely upon voluntary associaintion. One of the - inost peculiar and interesting parts of his speech was that in which he referred to compulsory unionism. He evidently overlooked the fact that if unionism were compulsory it would be ridiculous to ask for preference to unionists. The honourable member must recognise how idle it is for him to suggest that we are in favour of compulsory unionism when we declare for preference to unionists. The quotations which he made from ancient history told more against than in his favour. clared that ancient history dealt with periods during which compulsory unionism was in active and effective operation - whe n men had no freedom to decide whether they would join a union or to which union they would belong. Does he not see that our position today is the exact antithesis of that-that so far from being in favour of compulsory unionism, we advocate preference to unionists, and that the two things are in no wise corelated ? Does he not recognise that they are really antagonistic? If every man belonged to a union no question of preference could arise. We say that there should be no compulsion on a man to join a union. We make no attempt to compel a man to join one. The doors of trade unions stand wide open to all who choose to enter. But we claim most emphatically that those who voluntarily join these unions shall have preference of employment.",41
241,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,If every man were in a union what would the honourable member do?,42
242,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then this question would no longer be acute, because the very strength of that union would compel preference.",42
243,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There would be no advance in wages.,42
244,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Q u it e recently we have had in Australia a refusal on the part of certain unions to ask for preference. They have declared that by the strength of their own organization they will secure preference. And yet these unions are in no sense compulsory organizations. All the facts of ancient, as well as modern, history are opposed to the honourable member's contention. The waterside workers today do not ask for preference at the hands of the Court. I do not know but what they would refuse to accept it from the Court. They say, in effect, "" By the strength of our own voluntary association we can secure preference."" And they do so. The whole purpose of this Bill , however, is to attack the very existence of the unions themselves. The honourable member for Werriwa, who has just interjected in regard to the matter of wages, told us a few minutes ago that the increase of wages that had taken place was not as great as it would have been without the unions.; It requires a tremendously vivid imagination to lead one. to believe that there is He de- anything in that argument. The honourable member is asking too much of the workers when he calls upon them to believe that if they had not agitated and combined to secure betterment for themselves they would have been treated better than they have been. It requires, indeed, a tremendous stretching of one's intelligence to make such, a suggestion. The honourable gentleman illustrated his contention by referring to the position of domestic servants and agricultural labourers. It is a satisfactory fact that great improvements - have been made in both those avenues of employment; b ut those improvements are due to the fact thab other avenues of employment have been made more attractive by reason of the advantages secured by the unions relating to them. Agricultura l labourers and domes-: tic servants have been induced, in this way, to leave their original callings for other avenues of employment. Another reason for the improvement is the scarcity of labour. If there is anything in the law of supply and demand, then the rise in the wages of domestic servants and agricultural labourers is due to the supply of labour not being up to the demand.",42
245,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And to unionism in other quarters.,42
246,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Q u it e so. The honourable member for Werriwa suggested that the increase in the wages of domestio servants and agricultural workers was beyond the control of unions or Parliaments; that it was due really to an in crease in the values of food products throughout the world. I am quite unable to follow the honourable member's argument when I remember his contradictory statements in regard to the power of Parliament to increase wages, and the interference of Parliament to protect the workers. He told us that 120 years ago a man, unless he belonged to the noble class, had no hope of improvement. The increase in the wages of those engaged in' ordinary avenues of employmentthe ignoble classes, if I may use that term without offence-is because, and solely because those people have realized that we have no business to be content with the sphere in which, it is said, God has placed us, but that we have an equal right, in the name of God, to demand a place in the sun with those who consider themselves above us. There we have the secret of the whole workers' agitation and the principle on which we hase our right to demand, not only through the unions and through Parliament, but by the use of every means the country affords, our right to the sunshine, to life and health, and the good things of the world, without any regard to whether we belong to one class or another.",42
247,Colonel RYRIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The only "" r i g h t "" there is the "" r i g h t "" of the man who has nothing.",43
248,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is absolutely correct, and he gives expression to a greater truth than he himself, perhaps, would be willing to admit. It is the man who has nothing who wants something; and is it not a fact that there are people in the world today who have nothing, and who cannot be denied the right equally with others to have a share of the'good things of life? I deny the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney that there is a class in the community that is entitled to have everything, and one entitled to nothing.",43
249,Colonel RYETE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I did not say that.,43
250,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is the sug; gestion.,43
251,Colonel RYKIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No ; the honourable member is a champion twister of words!,43
252,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have given considerable attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa; but we have had from him so much denunciation of anything and everything-of our party and of his own party-in the most free and unfettered way, that one may be excused for giving him special notice. I desire to congratulate the honourable member on having the courage to declare the policy of his party in regard to unionism. He told us that he does not agree with the Arbitration Acts, that he is in favour of strikes, and that he is no believer in political unionism. We on this side have repeatedly claimed that we are the party of peace in industrial matters, and we have charged honourable members opposite, quite openly, with being the true Syndicalists. At last an honourable member opposite has had the courage to admit the true position; and I suppose that the truth, as it very often does, proves very inconvenient for some of his colleagues.",43
253,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We have had a lot of peace lately, with strikes everywhere!",43
254,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Werriwa has given the answer to that; he has said he is in favour of strikes, because where there are no strikes slavery is the alternative. The honourable member for Dampier is sufficiently well read to know that where there is a cessation of agitation-wher e there is a weakening of the demand for the bettering and improving of things-ther e is an absolute and irresistible declension. Scientifically we can only advance or retrograde. There is no possibility of standing still, balancing is impracticable; and where there is a cessation or weakening in the demand for betterment there must of necessity be a going back. I am delighted to hear from the honourable member for Werriwa a most candid admission that he favours strikes, as a sign of progress, the alternative being, as he calls it, slavery. It is very satisfactory to hear an honourable member, who calls himself a Liberal, declaring himself against the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, because it tends to make unionists slaves, and that he is in favour of strikes because of the alternative. I confess that to me there seems much contradiction in the honourable member's attitude; but there it is; and he is quite willing to make those statements and to stand by them. I should also like to congratulate the honourable member on his application to himself of the word "" Liberal."" Personally, I am quite willing to give honourable members opposite any rights they may claim to the use of the word. I further congratulate them on the fact that, in the early stages, when they first adopted this name-whic h is the latest of a string of names by which they have been known, and which may, in its turn, give place to another more or less popular-it was always printed in inverted commas. In the election of 1910, at any rate, the word was always so printed, notifying as clearly as possible that it was a quotation, an imported word, which did not belong to them, but to somebody else. I play second to no one in my admiration of the old Liberal party in the Imperial Parliament; and I wonder what possible association in opinions or methods there can be found between such men as John Bright, Richard Cobden, or W . E . Gladstone, and those who now occupy the Treasury bench in this House. The suggestion that the word "" Liberal,"" which represents such men as I have mentioned, can be identified with the Government and their supporters, has only to be mentioned to prove its absurdity.",43
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot connect these remarks with the question before the Chair.,44
256,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is the easiest thing in the world to connect my remarks with the question. I do not agree with everything that Mr Gladstone said, and I have several grudges against him myself; but he was the honoured and unrivalled leader of a great party, and he declared that trade unions were the salvation of the country-were the one thing that stood by the workers, and could be depended on to elevate and improve their positions. Honourable members opposite not only utterly deny that fact, but their whole methods and operations, and the whole purpose of this Bill , is to deny unions the right to exist. The measure is intended to prohibit preference to unionists; but, before dealing with preference, I should like to say a word or two about unionists and unionism. All over the world today there is, undoubtedly, an attack being made on trade unionism, so that the Government of the Commonwealth are not alone in their attitude. In every country where unions are in operation there is a determined and active attempt to break them up. strikes that are taking place in most parts of the world, and the strikes that have taken place within the last ten or twenty years-the industrial unrest that is, unfortunately, so prominent in the world today-revolve s around this question. In 1911, I think, there was a great strike in the Old Country amongst the seamen, who claimed the recognition of their union, higher wages, and a conciliation board to settle disputes. The transport workers also had a strike, their grievances being low wages, long hours, and the refusal of the employers to recognise the union - The railway men struck, and their principal claim was for the recognition of their union as a means to a more effective and speedy betterment of conditions of labour. The Melbourne Herald of 25th August, 1913, stated that there were 5,000 painters on strike in London for l £ d . per hour increase and a recognition of their union; and the same paper of the 26th of the same month contained the news that the electrical fitters and assistants in the employment of the A d miralty had struck as a protest against the employment of non-union painters. The Brisbane strike had the same basis. In the last speech I made on this subject. I pointed out that it was the determination of the Tramway Company not to recognise the union that caused - the trouble. If Mr Badger, the tramway manager, had used the five words, "" I recognise the men's union,"" the strike would never have taken place. It is the denial of the right of the unions to exist - no t only the voluntary, but the legal right-that is causing the trouble in the world today. As I have said, there is an active and determined combination and agitation-whethe r due to an understanding amongst employers of labour I am unable to say-to break up the unions. Let me prove this by one or two illustrations. I have here a copy of the speech delivered by Mr Blackwood, the President of the Victorian Employers Federation, before the British Constitution Association in England, in December, 1912. Referring to the Free Workers Union, which the Employers Federation have formed in Victoria, he said. . . the rules of these new unions are framed and maintained so as to guarantee that the original object is carried out-namely , to build up once more non-political trades unionism, also that the unions when created will not go over in a body to the socialistic poliThe tical unions. One rule you will find gives a guarantee on this point, as it states that the independent unions shall not join or affiliate with the Trades Hall (the body with which all the socialistic unions affiliate), or any other body having political objects; and, further, that this rule can only be altered by the unanimous vote of those attending a properly convened meeting. Honourable members must not overlook the fact that, in connection with such unions the names of respectable men are entered on the books, and employment is found for them as soon as possible; b ut before taking up a job they must become members by paying Is., and promising ttf contribute 6d. per week per man. Here is an extract from the balance-sheet of a company in Queensland, w h i c h shows that as i m i l a r idea is in operation there, with a view to b r e a k in g up the men's unionsHampden-Cloncurry Copper Mines L t d . , Friezland, via Cloncurry.

We h a d a remarkable e x h i b it i on of t h is in D u b l in l at e l y . May I read parts of a n article that appeared in the Brisbane S t and a r d on the 5 t h of t h is m o n t h , and consists of extracts from a l e t t e r received by Mr L . E n g l is h , the b r a n c h secretary of the A m a l g a m at e d Society of Carpenters and JoinersFor several months public attention centred on Dublin, where the Federated ""Employers conceived the idea that to ri d themselves of the inconvenience occasioned by strikes amongst members of the Irish Transport Workers Union it could be broken up by insisting as a condition of employment that members of that union should sign a document practically severing their connection with it , whilst members of other organizations who catered for a similar class of labour were required to sign a pledge not to support the aforesaid union, either morally or financially, and to refrain from all and every Kind of militant action in respect to objectionable workmen or questionable material. The seat of operation is now transferred to London, where, as far back as 1859, an attempt was made in the building trades to break up trade unions by the introduction of a document which men were required to sign, pledging themselves not to belong to any society that in any way, directly or indirectly, interfered with the rate of remuneration, hours of work, or any other arrangement between employer and the employed, no less than 225 firms joining in the lock-out to enforce the above conditions. . . . History repeats itself by a similar attempt on the part of the London builders to enforce the signing of a document as a condition of employment, which, _ if not in the same terms as the one of 1859, its effect would be the same had the men agreed to give the pledge required therein; and, in their refusal, they are certain of having the wholehearted approval of all trades unionists in this and every other country. . . . Owing to a threatened strike for improved conditions of labour on the railways The reference is to the recent South A f r i can t r o u b l e supported by other organized bodies of workmen, martial law was declared, trade union meetings prohibited, and books and documents confiscated, many of the officials being_ sent to prison, and nine of them (of which are included Mr Finlayson. two of our own members) deported out of the country and sent as prisoners to England, where they have safely landed and received a hearty welcome from trade unionists and friends of labour generally. That is one side of the p i c t u r e . There has been a deliberate at t e m p t in D u b l in and in So u t h A f r i c a q u it e recently to repeat the coercion of 1859, with a view to compellin g men to leave trade unions, andi to create opposition by the for m at i o n of Chairman. antagonistic societies. He r e is the o the r side of the p i c t u r e - the q u o t at i o n is from the C h r is t i a n Commonwealth of 12th No vember of last year. It is headed, "" E r o m bad to worse "" The Daily Citizen rendered the Labour cause a signal service last week by publishing the text of a circular sent by the Shipping Federation to the various employers' associations, inviting them to contribute towards a fund of £50,000 in support of the Dublin employers. Secrecy was an essential condition of this appeal, and Mr Cuthbert Laws, the general manager of the Shipping Federation, who signed the circular, did not exaggerate when he remarked that publicity for the proposals, unless and until they were adopted, would result in injury rather than benefit to the employers in Dublin. A more open and flagrant exposure of the employers' gain could not well be made. Hereare thousands of women, children, and men starving in the Irish capital, notwithstanding the generous support of their British trades unions comrades, and all that the employers are concerned to do was to raise sufficient money to carry on a campaign of starvation agaiust them. To fight their battle at the expense of other people is what the Irish employers have been doing for a generation in Dublin, and it is time that other considerations were forced upon their attention by a superior authority. C o m in g n o w to So u t h A f r i c a , let me read something that appeared in the A d e l a i d e He r a l d of the 13th J a n u a r y last)The Commission appointed to inquire into the riots on the Band last summer issued its report last month. After expressing regret that the miners' organizations boycotted the inquiry, the Commissioners explained that 200 witnesses-representative of all classes-were examined. They dealt separately with the differences between the New Kleinfontein Gold Company and its employee's, and observed, "" It was due almost entirely to the refusal of the mine management to meet the representatives of the men that the solution as regards the dismissal of the five men became impossible, and that this led to the further complications, which eventually culminated in a general strike."" The evidence proves that by every possible means the employers have t r i e d to prevent the i r employees from for m in g unions, and , where unions have been for m e d , to break the m up , even by the encouragement of antagonistic unions. I shall not quote extensively again from the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins in the .Tramway case, hut I should like to read a paragraph of that judgment;I have no difficulty in finding they have granted indulgencies,. privileges, benefits, attractions of all sorts to men to retire from the union, and that they have encouraged and bolstered up rival unions-wha t the men call the "" company's union""-in order to injure the men's union. From the point of view of the companies, the endeavours to stifle unionism may seem justifiable, but from the point of view of this Court the endeavours cannot be treated as legitimate or reasonable. At the time of the Brisbane strike, the wearing of a badge was a matter greatly in dispute, and Mr Badger, the manager of the Brisbane Tramways Company, rewhat fused to allow the tramway men to wear the union badge, stating that cause action by the public which might result in h a r m f u l treatment of the non-unionists; that the public might be so dissatisfied with those who did not wear the badge that they would pay them untion pleasant attentions. Mr Justice Higgins, referring to this matter in his judgment, saysWhat causes the abusive language is antipathy between unionists and non-unionists - a n antipathy which would exist whether there is a badge in use or not. What causes the antipathy is mainly the favouritism shown by the companies to the non-unionists, as well the aid which the non-unionists afford to the companies in their efforts to paralyze the It is a remarkable fact, and somewhat amusing, that the man who refused to legislation allow the Brisbane tramway employees to going wear the union badge, on the ground that National it would cause unfair discrimination, perMulhall, mitted the drivers and conductors to wear the colours of a certain political party at the following State election. unionists made no objection to this, thinkposed ing that if the public chose to take notice of it , well and good. Mr Badger self had his car decorated with blue ribrequisite bons, the colours of the Liberal party, and spent the day in driving voters to from the poll.",44
257,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What success had he?,46
258,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Liberal didate won in the electorate in which Mr of Badger worked; but the ten metropolitan constituencies which had formerly rethe turned only two Labour representatives returned six Labour representatives, M Badger's unfair discrimination ing the union vote against him, although his action in allowing tramway employees to wear the Liberal colours gained no vantage for him. Ministers and their supporters may denounce unions and preference, the political use of union funds, the rules for the admission of members, and the methods, aims, and operations of unionism, but they can no more break up trade unions, or put a stop to unionism, or prevent unionists from using Parliament, the Arbitration Court, and other institutions to further their ends, than they can prevent the sun from rising tomorrow morning. In further support of my statement that the endeavour of the employers to break up trade unions is world-wide, let me give an American illustration, which, perhaps, is the strongest of all. This is the Age of the 25th August of last year published, as received from its San it would Francisco correspondentAustralia and New Zealand have been spared a biased and one-sided investigation of the relations existing between capital and labour in those countries, due to the timely publicaof serious allegations of corruption against the National - Association of Manufacturers. That orgauization is composed of men whose chief wish in life is to destroy the labour unions. With the undisguised purpose of seekthe ing to gather information showing that the activity of the union in Australasia has been detrimental to ex-presidents of the Association, David M. Parry and John Kirby, junior, were on' the point of taking boat from San Francisco as last Thursday when they were stopped by a telegraphed subpoena, requiring them to proceed union. at once to Washington and testify regarding charges that the Association has expended hundreds of thousands of dollars in influencing and elections. The charges they are back to endeavour to refute are contained in the confession of a former employs of the Association of Manufacturers, M. M. who told in detail of spending large sums of money on behalf of the Association to influence legislation and the election of ConThe gressmen. Probably it is an excellent thing for Australia and New Zealand that the pro""investigation"" by these extreme antiLabourites has been nipped in the bud. They himwere going on their quest with none of the open-mind attitude that should be the chief of an investigation, and .almost avowedly with the purpose of picking holes in sysand tems in vogue in the Commonwealth and the Dominion for settling industrial quarrels. Their conclusions could not have been anything but misleading, and possibly harmful. That Messrs. canParry and Kirby have prejudged the case , against organized labour, and are therefore out court as investigators, is shown by their reference to the chief labour organization in country, as "" the greatest criminal trust this country has ever known."" r . It is stated that the story of Mulhal l consolidatdirectly involvesKirby and Parry and their activity during their terms as president of the National Asadsociation of Manufacturers. This Association consists essentially of a club of millionaires, who have always fought for the ""open shop,"" but not always with clean hands, if Mulhall is to be believed. From 1903 to 1912 Mulhall was what was known as the ""field agent"" of the Association, and its chief lobbyist. During that time he states he expended more than £40,000 of the Association's money in lobbying work and in electoral campaigns, all with the object of breaking up the unions. That is verified by the statement of Mr . Samuel Gompers, the President of the American Federation of Labour, and the strongest figure in the American Labour movement. He says thatA man named Broughton Brandenburg, the autlior of several books, who is now a convict in Sing Sing, came to him and represented himself as in charge of a bureau of the National Association of Manufacturers, organized to "" expose the dishonesty and immorality of the leaders in the Labour movement."" He wanted Gompers to issue an "" exposure "" of the Labour leaders and then retire from the presidency. "" My object in coming to you is to say I want to save you,"" Brandenburg is quoted as saying to Gompers, "" I want to save you, and while I do not want to say in specific financial terms what the National Association of Manufacturers is willing to do, yet I can guarantee that you will be financially safe for the rest of your life.""",46
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have been endeavouring for some little time to connect the honourable member's observations with the motion beforethe Chair, but, although the debate has proceeded on very broad lines, I think that he is somewhat wide of the question, and I ask him to direct his remarks more closely to the motion for the second reading of the Bill .",47
260,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My remarks may have been somewhat wide of the question of preference to unionists in Government employ, but the Government have stated that the Bill is really to cover the whole position of unionism and the right of unionists to preference. The B i ll is certainly a covert attack on unionism, and an open attack on the principle of preference to unionists, which comes well from the Attorney-General, who is an active member of the Bar Association, whose rules, methods and operations not only secure a very strong and rigid form of unionism, but insist on a very specific and well-guarded system of entry, which provides absolute monopoly, as well as preference, to the members of the Association. The Bill , while professing to deal only with casual employment in the Service of the Commonwealth and unionists in the Commonwealth employ, really opens up the whole question of the right of unionists to claim preference and o i any person to prohibit them in the exercise of that demand. Some say the measure is a hollow sham; others advise us that it is a waste of time to discuss the measure-w e are told""so in the columns of the press-bu t I refuse to accept that advice, because I give the Government some credit for putting forward the Bill as an important measure. In their opinion, the measure is of sufficient importance to warrant the Governor General's dissolving both Houses of Parliament. As to whether the Governor General will deem the measure, or the question of what class of men shall be employed in Government activities, suffi-. ciently important to warrant that course remains to be seen; but we have this fact before us, that the At torney-General, well secured behind a rigid form of unionism, which not only altogether removes the matter of preference from the sphere of questioning, but also absolutely guarantees-the members of the union a monopoly of work, has the courage to bring down to the House a Bil l which seeks to interfere with the work of men employed on casual work in the Commonwealth Service. If it is the in tention of the Government that the measure shall deal only with Commonwealth employees, I might be content with sayingthat it will not accomplish what it is in tended to do, because Ministers have already, by administrative act, done a certain measure of which it proposes to do; but here is where it must utterly fail. In the future the Commonwealth must employ men to carry out its works, and by any law they choose to put into operation Ministers will not be able to prohibit the employment of unionists in the carrying out of those works. Indeed, they will be unable to prevent preference to unionists being given-becaus e there are certain callings, trades, crafts and industries to which Ministers must give their attention, in which the unions will be so strong that they will be in the position to demand preference-and why should Ministers handicap themselves by carrying this Bill , which will prevent them from employing these men ? Otherwise they will need to form organizations fco break up the trade unions and prevent! preference to unionists being given. A r e the Government prepared to take on that job""? Are they prepared to say straight out thai, if necessity arises, they will create an agitation against trade unions, and try to break them up, or that they will form other organizations to break up trade unions and take the place of trade unionists in Government employ ? That is the only alternative. The attitude of Ministers is a reflection on the unions. I have in my possession a report of the annual conference of the dried fruits in dustries, held at Adelaide early in e> this year. Referring to political unionism, the report saysI t was felt by the growers that, in view of the fairly large expenditure of money which was willingly subscribed by the association growers each year for the carrying on of this association in their interests, the outside growers were reaping an unfair advantage in refusing to share in these burdens, and steps will be taken during the year to explain the methods of the working of this association more fully to some of the outside districts, with the hope that they may be induced to throw in their lot with their fellow growers in the association, whose interests were identical with theirs. That would he something in the nature of a reasonable invitation to those side this association to join, but the dividual members of the association were not so careful in their statements. For mining factor. instance, Mr R. Atkinson, who directs the frui t interests of Frazer, Ramsay prietary Limited, statedI t is imperative that all dried ducers who are at present outside the association should be compelled to join. A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of visiting Mildura. I would, like to show the Government that the employers and years ago. employees engaged in the fruit industry at Mildura are decidedly in favour of past the principle of preference. Giving eviany, dence before the Fruit Commission, C. J. de Garis, a packer in that district, was askedDo you think a wholesale fruit distributing association should stick to your association, and give preference over those who go back on the conditions?-Undoubtedly . Then you. believe in preference to unionists? - I have never said anything against preferand ence to unionists. Where unionism is aniit. mated by the desire to protect industry, free from political motive, I am with it, hand and glove. Does the principle of preference to unionists appeal to you as a unionist?-As a non-polimen tical unionist. It is most important to notice how caresiders fully those opposed to preference to unionists try to protect themselves hiding behind the wall of non-political unions. This witness was also askedYou say that you are non-political, but you asked us this afternoon to recommend the passing of an Act of Parliament to fix prices?Yes, but in the interests of the fruit industry. The honourable member for Werriwa was very enthusiastic in his denunciation of appeals to Acts of Parliament, but in the next breath the honourable member said that there was only one way in which the men could protect themselves. So it will he found that in every industry, prominently in the dried fruit industry, the employers and employees favour preference, "" and are consistent in also believing in preference to unionists. It is a subject of common complaint among those who have to employ union labour - the honourable member for Werriwa referred to it-that they do not get the same results as from non-union labour. They say that the Government are full y justified in securing the best labour they can. They claim that if the non-union outlabour is better than union labour the innon-unionist is entitled to some preference, because ability must be the deterMr Thomas Charles Rawlings, fruit-grower, and chairman of Prothe Irrigation Trust at Mildura, in giving evidence before the Fruit Commisfruit prosion, said, in reply to questionsYou stated that the cost of harvesting and drying fruit was £6 per ton. How many years has the price been £6 per ton?- I have contracted at that price for twelve or fourteen Then really the labour cost of harvesting and drying fruit has not increased during the decade?-It has increased very little, if because we have better methods of doing Mr the work tban we had then. So that, in spite of the fact that your wages - have gone up 33 per cent., the cost of harvesting and drying your fruit has not increased?-It has not increased to any extent. As I have said, wo have better methods of doing the work, and I also think we have a better class of men to do our work, taking them on the whole. It pays a good man to come along to do the work; he is well paid for doing ' Has your experience been that higher wages means higher efficiency?-In that respect there is no doubt it is so. There is one trouble, and that is if we have a gang of ten as packers tliere might be nine good men and one bad one amongst them, usually called a "" magpie""; that is, a man who coni t is his destiny to talk and not to work; such a man will spoil a gang unless by you can get rid of him quickly. A good deal of platform oratory is expended by honourable members opposite in regard to the rura l workers' log. They claim the agricultural workers should by every possible means be prevented from approaching the Arbitratio n Court in order to get awards dealing with their conditions of labour. If the Government mean to l i m it the operations of . unionism they had an honest, honourable, and upright course to take instead of trying-wha t they must fail to do by the very - circumstances of the case-to prevent the employment of unionists or the giving of preference to them in Government employment. That honest course they could have taken was to seek to alter the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which gives the Court the power to award preference to unionists. It may be of interest to know how the awards of Mr Justice Higgins have operated in the case of the dried f r u it s industries. Mr Rawlings, in giving evidence, was askedHave you had any complaints against tration award of Mr Justice Higgins?-No ; if the men arc willing to work they can earn that money. Generally speaking, have you any complaints against the men?-Non e at all. We have a better class of men now than we have ever had. Have your profits increased the past ten years?-No , they have de'ereased. Have your net returns for fruit decreased during the past ten years?-In the early stages, before we had a combination among ourselves, we were being ruined. In 1894 was the first year we had anything worth putting on the market, and we had no combination amongst the growers. Every man hawked his own fruit or sent to Dick, Tom, or Harry in Melbourne. The consequence was the fruit was brought down to l j d . per lb. He was further askedArc the whole of the growers in your co-. operative association?-No ; I am sorry to say there are one or two "" scabs,"" who seek to gain the advantages without taking any of the liabilities, which they have successfully done up to the present. There are only one or two of them, but if the number increased 1 to any extent it would mean that the whole concern would collapse, and in seeking their own interest they would cause the fall of us all. This gentleman and every other grower who gave evidence almost an intense desire for to protect them in their Those are the gentlemen who decry political unionism, and yet the whole tendency today is to ask Parliament to give Mr Finlayson. them protection. For instance, I have here, in the evidence Of Mr de Garis, question 32,949When you mentioned an Act of Farliament to fix the retail prices, you evidently have faith that an Act of Parliament could fix the retail prices. What provisions would be in the Act so far as the retailer is concerned?That the fruit should be Australian fruit; that the price at which the buyer should buy should be the price at which he could buy imported fruit from the distributor. Those would be the two main conditions. and then question 32,953 to the same witnessYou have faith in an Act of Parliament . being able to effectively fix the prices?-That is correct. And so on. I have not time to further quote from this evidence, but I may be excused for referring to one or two matters which, I think, are of some importance. I have pointed out proof that not only can the Arbitration Court make an award that is satisfactory to the growers themselves, but that preference to unionthe arbi- ists, not only amongst workers, but amongst employers also, leads to the very best results. Tliere is better work from the men and better results to the employers. Although wages have risen, the introduction of better methods and the effect of increased wages in securing better employees and more satisfactory work, has resulted in a gratifying increase all round. And so far from the award of the Arbitration Court having caused any difficulty or created any disturbance, there have been peace and satisfaction and a better spirit prevailing between employees and employers as a result of that award. I remember that when an award was announced it was stated in the press, almost in tears that one could see, that the award would ruin the industry, just as honourable members on the Government side are saying now that any award in the rural industry would ruin it . The facts of the case are against' that statement, and if the Government were sincere in this matter, and really meant business, they would make an honest effort to attack the Arbitration Act , and, not by a side issue attempt to do what they are afraid to fruitdo honestly and openly. In regard to expressed preference to unionists, one thing of which Parliament we are sure, is that the employers during operations. the whole history of the trade union movement have never hesitated to give preference to non-unionists as a means of . breaking up trie unions. I have referred to the fact that they have on occasions demanded, before they would give employment, the signing of documents in which the man undertook not to join a recognised trade union or affiliate himself with any political body. I read last week, from The Church in the New Age, by the Rev. Henry Carter, a document which was used in 1851. I desire to extend that quotation by this further passage by the same authorUnion after union collapsed as withdrawal from its membership became the sine qua non of employment. Leave the union or starve, was a virtual but crushing alternative. Nor was the arm of the law left un invoked. Public opinion would not permit repeal of the Acts of 1824-1825, but legal subtlety found another way of repression. The classic instance is the trial of the Dorchester labourers in 1834. Hunger, and despair of better times, led the agricultural labourers of the Southern counties to organize and claim higher wages. At first successful, they secured an advance to 10s. a week, but, a year after, the farmers in the neighbourhood of Tolpuddle, a village near Dorchester, reduced the rate of hire shilling by shilling t ill their unhappy serfs were receiving only 7s. weekly. In distress, the labourers inquired about the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union, and obtained a visit of two of its delegates to their village. A "" Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers"" was formed under their guidance, and arrangements made for the initiatory rites of its "" Grand Lodge."" The farmers placarded the village with warnings that any who joined the union were liable to transportation. Events proved the threat to be no empty one. George Loveless and five other labourers were arrested. No charge was brought other than taking the initiatory oath of their "" Lodge,"" an act held to be illegal under an obscure and almost forgotten Statute. The men were of good character, two of them Methodist local preachers. Yet, after a brief trial, they were actually sentenced to seven years' transportation, and the next month sailed as convicts to Botany Bay!  prieved afterwards, some of them never heard of the result.",47
261,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We have evidence, in Tasmania particularly, of men deported as convicts because they had been impertinent enough to gather a few of their fellows in their homes in order to discuss matters relating to their employment. In 1867, it is stated by the Rev. Henry Carter, during the great strike of London tailors, the masters posted up a notice, "" Good hands wanted; no unionists need apply."" L et me repeat that all the facts of history go to prove that it is because of the fact that not only by individual acts, but by combinations supported by Acts of Parliament, the law has been used against trade unionists in every age of industrial history, that the workers have been driven into combinations, secret or otherwise-secre t when they were compelled to be so, but open and honest when they were not harassed by the law. All along they have' had to fight, not only the employers, but also the use made of the law against them. To be a unionist a few years ago was to be branded as a criminal, and to ask for preference to unionists was to demand a privilege unreasonable and unthinkable in a free country. But events move rapidly in this world. An agreeable change has come over the spirit of the dream within the last few years. People are realizing today, as men have realized and honestly expressed in this House, that the only hope of industrial peace, and the only satisfactory way out of the industrial unrest at present existing in the world, is by recognising the right of men to have their unions, and all the advantages that result from those unions, and by recognising the further fact that the men who refuse to associate themselves with their fellows, and stand aside in a selfish attit tude, neglecting and refusing the responsibilities and obligations of association, have no rights to the benefits that result from such association.",50
262,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member's time has expired.,50
263,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Maribyrnong) [ 4 . 5 5 ] I happen to be one of those members who do not care to make any distinction, in a community like ours, between those engaged in the Government service and those employed outside that service. ""Unlike some honourable members on the opposite side, I fail to see how, because a member of the community engages in casual employment under the Government, he is a different kind of being from those engaged in work under a contractor or in other private employment. I see no difference at all between employing workers directly under the Government, and employing them under a contractor or some other person, and paying them Government money indirectly. Those who are engaged under the Government are taxpayers and citizens, and are called upon to obey the laws of the country just the same as those outside the Government employ. I have always failed to see-and , perhaps, this comes home to me more than to other honourable members, because I was for seven years a Government employee-wh y people can argue that because a man belongs to the Government Service he should be deprived of certain privileges. I am glad that this Parliament has decreed by regulation that those engaged in the Public Service of the Commonwealth are entitled, equally with their fellow-citizens, to take a part in political affairs. I am proud to belong to a Parliament that allows that privilege to the Public Service. Unfortunately , to employees under the State Governments that privilege is not accorded.  tralia a circular was sent out instructing Government employees that they were not to take any part in politics, either State or Federal.",50
264,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think that sort thing emanates from the Premiers' ference, because in this State we haye had the Premier posting up notices i every Department, notices that bore signature, that any public servant engiving gaging in political concerns would be liable to a fine or to be degraded or missed. In the Federal Service we got beyond the narrow limits which States seem to have adopted.",51
265,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Thei r attitude is quite conthose days. sistent.,51
266,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is quite consistent with Conservatism, but it is confining the opposite side of the House political capabilities of men and women in the service within very narrow, limits. today. I believe that the honour of introducing that principle into the Commonwealth Service belongs to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who, as a Minister of a the world. previous Administration, issued a to his Department that every man in service was entitled to take a full of political responsibility and an interest in political affairs. I am one of those who believe in putting the man inside the Government Service on the same footploying ing as the man outside, because he is a citizen, and worthy to be intrusted with those privileges. I referred to my own connection with the Public Service, remember that, after coming direct from the country, where I had served my aption prenticeship, my first employment in bourne was in the Government Printin Office. I was hardly fairly settled down since it at my frame before the steward approached me and asked me if I was a member of the Melbourne Typographical Society. I told him that I had lodged with the secretary my papers, showing that I had served my apprenticeship, and had qualified to become a journeyman printer, and I had paid my entrance fee. He said that he had no evidence that I was a member; but at lunch time he went to the Trades H all , and on returning said, "" It is all r i g h t ; you were made a member at a Board meeting last week."" Nothing more was said; but the significant way in which the question was put to me gave me to understand, as a youngster just green from the country, that, unless I had become a member of the society, there was likely to be trouble in the Government Printin g Office. That happened in a Government Department long before there was a Federal Parliaof ment in existence, and a considerable Contime before any Labour member had found his way into the State Parliament. n So that honourable members wil l see ihat no what we are blamed for now, viz., the of preference to unionists, and in sisting on a man becoming a unionist, was disin operation long before a Labour memhave' ber came into Parliament. I am glad the to know that those members who nave since entered Parliament are prepared to take action similar to what was taken in Very much has been said on the about the inefficiency of the workmen of I have had it on the best of authority that the Australian workman stands head and shoulders above any workman in any other part of And that statement has been minute made by men who have had experithe ence of workmen all over the world. share In reply to those who complain sometimes of lack of efficiency on the part of the workers, I would say that such a thing occurs more often among the emthan among the employed class. If - we could investigate various business concerns in Australia we should find that there are more inefficient employers than and I inefficient workmen. I do not propose to read the definiof the term "" preference to Melunionists in Government employment,"" g as laid down by the Fisher Ministry, has already been quoted many times. I would remind honourable members, however, of the carefully prepared series of questions which was submitted by Mr Deakin, then Leader of the Opposition, to the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Fisher- a list which had probably been drawn up by the honoiable gentleman, in conjunction with other lawyers. To those questions the right honourable member for Wide Bay replied to the effect that "" other things being equal,"" preference would be given to unionists in casual Government employment. Later on the honourable member for Darwin, who was then Minister of Home Affairs, stated in this House during the discussion of the New Works and Buildings Estimates on 9th August, 1912, that he was carrying out the principle as defined by his leader. He read the answers given by the present Leader of the Opposition to the questions put by Mr Deakin, and said that he was observing them. It is recognised in most Parliaments that the policy of a Government can be announced only by its leader, and a policy statement so made is invariably accepted, not only in the British House of Commons, but in the Legislatures of other countries. A minute or a regulation framed by an individual Minister cannot be construed as representing the policy of a Government if it be contrary to its policy as declared by the leader. As I have said, the right honourable member for Wide Bay informed Mr Deakin that, other things being equal, preference to unionists would be given in respect of casual employment in the Government service.",51
267,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That statement was pudiated later by the then Minister of Home Affairs.,52
268,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The announcement Minister, was made by the honourable member for Wide Bay in August, 1912.",52
269,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And the repudiation was made, I think, in September, 1912.",52
270,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The question arose, if 1 remember rightly, as the result of placing on the table of the House a convariation ? tract to which was attached an intimation that absolute preference was to given to unionists. The contract volved an expenditure of £2,000 or £3,000. The then Minister of Home fairs, Mr K i ng O'Malley, having read the questions addressed to the Prime Minister by Mr Deakin, and the replies thereto, went on to sayl am absolutely carrying out that system. When I first gave preference to unionists, other things being equal, my* instructions were not complied with. Then I issued the order that there was to be absolute preference to unionists, which meant that the first order must be carried out. Absolute preference to unionists means exactly what it says-othe r things being equal. But there is not to be preference to non-unionists, and they are not to refuse to carry out my absolute orders.",52
271,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"How could "" absolute"" preference to unionists mean "" other things being equal?""",52
272,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I admit that Gilbert and Sullivan might have founded a comio opera on these words. Mr G»OOM - Is not the word "" absolute "" used in the Labour programme?",52
273,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No ; we have adopted the words inserted in *the Conciliation and Arbitration Act by the Liberal Government- "" preference shall be given to unionists, other things being equal.""",52
274,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Thos e words do not occur in the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act.,52
275,Mr EILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The President of the Court has power under the Act to grant preference.,52
276,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is so.,52
277,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He has power to grant preference to unionists, other things being equal.",52
278,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think that the present Minister of Trade and Customs helped to frame the clause in question.,52
279,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so. Politics were then far more mixed than they are reto-day. The present Prime Minister took part in the discussion to^which I was referring when interrupted. He saidDoes the policy, as declared by the Prime still obtain? The reference was to the policy of preference to unionists, other things being equal, and the Hansard report of the debate proceeds as follows: ",52
280,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes . the. Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There has been uo,52
281,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No . be Later on in the same debate the right in - honourable member for Wide Bay interjected whilst the honourable member for A f - Parramatta was speakingThe policy of the Government is preference to unionists, other things being equal.",52
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then f hope that the language which has been referred to will be taken out of the terms of contract at the earliest possible moment, since it misrepresents the Government.policy.",53
283,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And the Minister Home Affairs said that he took his in structions from no one-that he ran his own circus.,53
284,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I believe that that statement was made at an earlier date. The honourable member for Laanecoorie, Dr Carty Salmon, followed the present Prime Minister in the debate, and pointed out that State Governments had taken the wise precaution of providing in all contracts for the recognition of the union log trade. Even Conservative State Governments have recognised that the trade union log should - be observed in connection with Government contracts. The Labour party went a stepand a natural step-furthe r by declaring that there should be preference to unionists, other things being equal. The honourable member for West Sydney quoted yesterday the drastic rules of the Bar Association. They are now recorded in the pages of Hansard, and the people of the Commonwealth will have an opportunity for the first time of reading them for themselves. The Attorney-General, who is a member of this Association, has gone further than I think some of his colleagues would go in declaring that he would wipe out altogether the granting of - even a legal preference to unionists. On the 14th August, 1913, speaking on the - debate upon the Address-in-Reply in this House, he saidIf I had my own way I would say that Parliament should wipe off the statute-book as the ugliest blot ever put upon it a provision which enables a legal tribunal to grant a legal preference to unionists in any shape.",53
285,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"-And he, as a legal man, grants preference to himself?",53
286,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Quite so. The At torney-General belongs to one of the most - exclusive unions in the world.,53
287,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And one of the 'beneficent.,53
288,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall not say that. The members of the Bar Association know - exactly what to charge the public, and have hedged themselves about with various safeguards. They may charge their - clients certain fees, and may do practi-cally as they like in the conduct of any «ase with which they are intrusted. If n barrister who belongs to the Bar Association mishandles a case, there is no redress for the aggrieved client. A mem^ ber of the Bar Association has practically a free hand, and his client has no redress of if he "" mulls "" his case. No court would entertain a charge made against a barrister that he had so badly handled a case intrusted to him as to do injury to his client. On the other hand, if a working man carries out his duties in a slovenly way, then, whether preference has been granted to him or not, he can be sent about his business, and in some cases even damages may be recovered against him for neglect. Our legal friends of the Bar Association, however, are perfectly safe. They may almost take away with impunity the character of not only the party whom they are opposing, but other individuals. And the Attorney-General, who says that he would be glad to wipe away preference to unionists-eve n the legal preference under the Conciliation and Arbitration Acti-is a member of the Bar Association. There are two strong unions in Australia today, members of which are employed by the Government from time to time. These unions are, first, the legal profession or Bar Association; aud, second, the British Medical Association; and we ought to see exactly how the members of these bodies stand in relation to the general community. Yesterday morning I asked the Minister of External Affairs a question in regard to the Marconi case, which has been hanging fire for some time, and he informed me that, so far as he knows, the Crown Solicitor is engaging counsel. Now, I venture to say that neither the Attorney-General nor the Minister of External Affairs would dare, in this connection, to give a brief to any member of the legal profession who is not also a member of the Bar Association; and, therefore, at the present time, this Government are actually giving preference to unionists. The Attorney-General is not only a member of the Bar Association, but is also a member of the Council most of the Association, which has the duty of dealing with any mernber who may commit an offence, and who may, in consequence thereof, be pul; out of the profession. There are similar rules in the legal profession in every other part of the world. In Victoria, barristers and solicitors are amalgamated, but in England barristers have the exclusive right to appear in the superior Courts, and he must be a member of the Inns of Court, the Inner and Middle Temples, Gray's In n , and, in Ireland, the King's In n . These rules date back to the 13th century, so that it will be seen that the union is very old, with firmly planted roots, and of great strength. We are toldThe benchers of the different Inns of Court have the right of rejecting any applicant for membership with or without cause assigned and for sufficient reasons, subject to an appeal to the Common Law Judges as visitors to the Inns. They may refuse to call a student to the Bar, or may expel from their society or from the profession even barristers or benchers. As to King's Counsel, we are informed, on good authorityA King's Counsel may not, unless by special licence, take a brief against the Crown, but such a licence is never refused unless the Crown desires his services in the case. I hold that when we have, as a prominent member of this House, and of the Government, a member of the legal profession, and the country requires his services, all the other briefs he holds should be dropped, and he should devote himself to safeguarding the interests of the Crown.",53
289,Mr ARTHTJB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But supposing been engaged in the other cases for years 1,54
290,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I understand that a .retainer can be dropped at any time; at any rate, I hold that the Crown should have the first call on the service of a King's Counsel.",54
291,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Crown does not use any call of the kind ,54
292,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am speaking, not so much of an ordinary King's Counsel, but of one who happens to be Attorney-General, and who ought, in mv opinion, to give the Crown a prior right to his services. Section 10 of the Legal Professions Amalgamation Act of Victoria, which was assented to on the 23rd November, 1891, is as followsAfter the passing of this Act no person shall be admitted to practise as a barrister or a solicitor solely, but every person admitted by the Supreme Court shall be admitted both as a barrister and solicitor. There is, of course, no such law in the Old Country, where the professions are not amalgamated. I point out that here, in Victoria, a barrister and solicitor gets his license to practice as such from the Supreme Court; but if a client desired that his solicitor should also appear as his counsel in the higher CoUrt, it would be found that, although he is full y qualified by law, no member of the Bar Association would appear with him ; indeed, such refusals to act occurred. I know of a Doctor of Law in Victoria, who practises here as a barrister and solicitor, and who desired to get on the barristers' list for New South Wales. He asked a barrister friend to advise him how to proceed, but the friend expressed his sorrow that he could not give him any advice on the subject, being bound, as he was, by the rules of the Bar Association. I can understand the honourable member for Bendigo, and honourable member for Batman, both of whom are barristers, being opposed to the proposal contained in this Bill , but the position taken up by the Attorney-General, who is a member of the most exclusive union that we have, is, in my opinion, neither fair , logical, nor charitable. To use a phrase often used in legal circles he is. as a member of that strong union, entirely "" out of court,"" particularly when we remember that the Bar Association of Victoria, in view of the provision in the Act of 1891, has been breaking the law for over twenty years.",54
293,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is not breaking the he _has law.,54
294,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Bar Association does not break the law it connives at the breaking of the law. I feel quite sure that if the Attorney-General had been instrumental in passing a law which applied to ordinary people, and they persisted in ignoring it to such extent as to constitute practically a violation, he would ' have those people charged - and duly punished.",54
295,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,If there is a violation of the law any one is entitled to prosecute. W hy is there no prosecution?,54
296,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We cannot get anybody to undertake the prosecution.,54

302,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So the honourable member says. The point is mentioned! have over and over again. The attitude of our opponents' journals sometimes gives us a glimpse of what is passing through the minds of the politicians they support, and I have here an extract from the Sydney Morning Herald, of 6th February, 1913, which I should like to read. In a leading article we find the following: We are, of course, not living in any Oceana or other imaginary Commonwealth, and"" it is perhaps to be expected that whatever party is in power, other things being equal, men> who belong to that party, are known to members of the Government and appreciated by them, should in some cases receive appointments in preference to supporters of the other political party. I say, without hesitation, that this Bill means neither more nor less than preference to non-unionists; and of this, I think I can give some little evidence. In January last, Mr W at t, the Premier of Victoria, on accepting office, had to submit himself for re-election to the State Parliament, and a very strenuous fight ensued. Some years ago when the Commonwealth Attorney-General Premier of the State, and the late Sir Thomas Bent was Minister of Railways, there fras a strike amongst the railway servants, and a number of non-union men came forward as strike-breakers, and acted as engine-drivers, and so forth . These men were given by the Railways Commissioners the high-sounding title of ""loyalists,"" because they had offered to undertake the work of the railways in the time of strike and trouble. A number of these "" l o y a l is t s "" live in stituency which Mr W at t now represents, and they did what they could to secure his return. A f t e r the election, a letter was sent by these men to Mr . Watt, complimenting him on his victory, and in response the honourable gentleman sent a note of thanks. It is peculiar how fate occasionally plays into our hands, and somehow or other this letter of thanks found its way to the secretary of the Railways Union. I have here a facsimile of the envelope and note, and they are as follows: The President, Loyalist Engine-drivers, Firemen, and Cleaners' Association, Head Branch, Melbourne. Melbourne, 24th January, 1914. With compliments and sincere thanks for congratulations on result of recent election from W. A. WATT. As I said before, this Bill means neither more nor less than preference Mr Fenton. unionists. I believe that tliere are men in high Ministerial positions who, if they had the chance, would give preference to non-unionists. A man of the stamp of the Premier of this State is always likely to get the support of non-unionists of the kind to which the letter of thanks of which I have read was sent. I should like to analyze a little further the figures in the last report of the Public Service Commissioner, giving the numbers of persons employed under the Commonwealth Government. Every one knows that the politician who tries to influence the Public Service Commissioner to obtain either temporary or permanent employment for a man is likely to do that man harm, because the Public Service Commissioner will probably run his pen through his name, and quite rightly. If there is one thing that he does right, it is that. If he acted otherwise, it might be said when he appointed men who had been recommended, that he had allowed himself to yield to was political influence. He is jealous of his independence, and has shown himself to be a strong-minded man.",54
303,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,An obstinate fool.,55
304,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have met him only once; but he impressed me as a very determined* man, .and one whom, once he had taken a stand, it would be difficult to shift. It needed only one interview to convince me that he was prepared to stick to the letter of the Public Service Act , the con- and that any one who attempted to in fluence him on behalf of an applicant for - employment would rather injure than advance that applicant's chance. ",55
305,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , though I do not agree with all that the Public Service Commissioner does. The total number of . persons employed by the Commonwealth Government is 39,828, of whom 34,696 are permanent and temporary employees subject to the Public Service Commissioner. As to the balance, most of them are employed in the Commonwealth factories. I believe that there is only one man south of the line who knows anything of the manufacture of cordite', and it was necessary to give him absolute Premier's Office, power in dealing with applicants for employment in the factory. The managers of the clothing, saddlery, and other factories were similarly left at liberty to choose their own hands. So far as the to non- saddlery factory is concerned, it was found impossible to obtain first-class saddlers who did not belong to the Saddlers Union, but the manager is a good man, and the returns show the enterprise to be well on the right side of the ledger. The persons employed in the Government factories number 3,162, and there are 739 ersons employed in connection with the 8 ommonwealth railways. The ex-Engineer-in-Chief had almost absolute power in the making of appointments, and I suppose that his successor is in the same position. Therefore, it is only to about 1,200 persons that the provisions of this Bill would apply. If the Government obtains a dissolution in connection with such a measure, I shall be very much mistaken. Let me quote some words by Mr . Justice Higgins, which form part of a judgment printed in the Registrar's report, which has been in the hands of honourable members for some daysParliament, recognising that an , employer who has tremendous power of giving or refusing bread, can often force an applicant for work to accept less than is just in order to get bread, prescribes-o r allows this Court to prescribe- a minimum below which the employer must not go. It still leaves him to dispense with the services of any worker who does not come up to his standard, and to give higher wages to exceptionally good workers whose services he desires to secure. . . . The reason seems to be that the employer usually needs no Court to enable him to reduce wages-h e has simply to refuse to give employment at wages which he thinks, to be too high. ought to be frankly admitted that, as a rule, the economic position of the individual employee is too weak for him to hold his own in the unequal contest. He is unable to insist on the "" fair thing."" The power of the employer to withhold bread is a much more effective weapon than the power of the employee to refuse to labour. Freedom of contract, under such circumstances, is surely misnamed; it should rather be called despotism in contract; and the Court is empowered to fix a minimum wage as a check on the despotic power. Mr Justice Higgins believed in giving the workers a fair deal, and his utterances prove that conclusively. The State and Commonwealth Governments, are large employers of labour, and must act as the private employers of labour act. ference to unionists has been long accepted by many of the principal contractors in Australia, who never think of employing other than union carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, plumbers and other tradesmen. They have made it a rule to do so to secure the peaceful and efficient performance of their contracts. I belong to the Printers' Society, and although it may happen, that ""if a unionist calls at a printing office at which there is a vacancy, that he may be put on, but the master printers, when they need a man, usually ring up the union secretary, his office being a registry for master printers and workmen. The Attorney-General thinks that in this Bill he has plainly a trump card, but at the last election the question of preference to unionists was given great prominence. A friend of mine, who is a large contractor, related to me a conversation he had with a very important canvasser, which is of interest in this connection. The canvasser said, "" I have come to have a chat with you, as a large employer of labour. You employ a good number of men."" "" Yes , "" he replied, ""week in , ' and week out, I pay wages to about eighty men, and have a lot of work on hand."" "" In that, case,"" said the canvasser, ""you will be very much interested in the question of preference to unionists."" "" Yes , "" answered the contractor, "" but if you think that I shall vote for the opponent of Mr Fenton, you never made a greater mistake in your life. Whenever I need a man, I send to a union secretary, because I believe in preference to unionists."" He told me that he belongs to the Contractors and Builders Association, and that several of the principal conIt tractors in the State recognise preference to unionists. The Commonwealth, as a large employer of labour, must do the same. Under certain conditions, the Arbitration Court can compel employers 4 to give preference to unionists. The honourable member for Wide Bay last session spoke of the difficulties that would be created if during the construction of a Commonwealth railway a contractor employing large numbers of men recognised the principle of preference to unionists, and the Commonwealth, employing other men, did not. The contractors are wise in recognising preference to unionists, because they desire to have their work done efficiently and expeditiously. Pre",55
306,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Government has nothing to fear fro m the recognition of the principle.,56
307,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No . Whenever I . meet a man who is not a member of any organization, I say to him, "" It may be plain speaking, but you are a fool not to join an association which would back you up in time of stress. All who are opposed to you, and all the employers, are organized."" I believe in organization. The honourable member for Riverina knows that the graziers organized.",56
308,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Not for political poses. Y o u cannot get a political subscription from them.,57
309,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Seeing that the honourable member pays £11,500 in land tax, he would spurn the idea of any one sending him a subscription; he would return the cheque, and say, "" I have money to burn in my own contest."" But he cannot lead honourable members to believe that men like Mr Blackwood are not big contributors to the funds of honourable members opposite.",57
310,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The pastoralists do E ay anything like the sum contributed y the Australian Workers Union.  toralists are levied at per hundred sheep. I have had their cheques sent to me in mistake.,57
311,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is only some who pay. Others will not pay.,57
312,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We know what squatters do at election time. The two strongest unions in Australia are comAssociation posed of those in the legal and medical professions. Let me direct attention resolution which was carried unanimously at a meeting held in Syd?iey, ings of which were reported in the press of the 14th November, 1913. The report is headed, ""Doctors and Lodges. The Fight in New South Wales. Attitude of Protestant Alliance,"" and the resolution him. adopted wasThat the council, having considered question of the differences that have arisen between the friendly societies and their officers, trusts that it 'will be possible to arrange a fair and reasonable agreement tween the societies and their doctors, and continue the mutual kindly feeling, hitherto existing between our lodges and the medical officers, but failing conciliatory efforts being successful, the Government bo asked to introunionists duce legislation, so .as to provide for tion similar to the existing system relating industrial arbitration. I believe that a conference of the whole of the friendly societies in regard present dispute with the medical profession would unanimously agree that the malter should be submitted for the sideration of the Arbitratio n Court. More and more in the future shall we need to employ members of the medical profession. The London correspondent of the Age has told us that the leading barristers and Judges of Great Britain are now are well drawing up rules and regulations, under the instruction of the British Governpur- ment, to provide a means by which the poorer portion of the community may obtain legal advice free of charge. No doubt, if this is done in Great Britain , where we say the people are very conservative, it will not be long before we shall have to make a similar provision in Australia. Under the insurance' scheme that is being talked about, medical men will need to be employed as we now employ them in connection, with the old age pension and maternity allowance schemes, but no member of the Ministry would dream of going outside the British not Medical Association in order to obtain the services of. a doctor. Absolute preference to unionists exists today in regard to pasthe legal and medical professions. The British Medical Association is so strong that it is putting up one of the strongest fights ever known in New South Wales.",57
313,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , but the members of the Association do not have to vote all about always in the one way.",57
314,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The British Medical would not, even to save a l if e , attend a case with one of the cleverest to a medical men we have in Melbourne today, because that man does not happen to the proceedbelong to the Association.",57
315,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When a man joins a trade union you make him vote as you direct, and if he does not do so, you send along 'an organizer and threaten to expel That was done in Riverina.",57
316,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable memtlie ber is quite wrong. During the last political contest, one gentleman wrote to me medical and told me that, although he was a bemember of the union to which I belong, thus he intended to vote and do all he could against me. The same remarks apply to hundreds of cases. Why , if the trade of Australia were united in the arbitraway the honourable member suggests, there to would never be anything but a Labour Government. In fact, the Bill before us will do more to solidify the unions than to their anything else that I know of.",57
317,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then why worry?,57
318,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Neve r mind. We wish conto talk so long upon it that the unions will never forget it . This is the finest bib - of organizing work that has ever been - done. Let me read the report of that meeting in Sydney to which I referredAt the sixteenth biennial session of the Federal Council of the Protestant Alliance Friendly Societies' of Australasia reference was made to the fight with the British Medical Association. The discussion indicated that the - society was preparing to fight to the bitter - end. Besides the instance of Casino, where - the local lodge built a separate hospital and has now two doctors specially engaged who ;nrc not members of the British Medical Association, cases were quoted from Queensland, where a similar course of action had been 'taken. "" Attendance upon members of friendly - societies by doctors is not a matter of charity, as is too often implied,"" stated Bro. G. H. 'Stillito, P.M.G. (Queensland). ""Many doctors .assume that they are giving charity, but I take exception to any such statement, and - deny the imputation. The arrangement be'tween a lodge and a doctor is purely a matter - of business, 'and tliere is no need for him to .accept it unless he likes. In many instances in Queensland we are in the doctors' hands :as far as starting new lodges is concerned, for if the local doctor does not want to attend - our members then we cannot form another ilodge. Even as far as the matter of charity iis concerned, I would like to say that there are hundreds of young doctors who have «lhnbed from poverty to affluence by the aid of the friendly societies. There is no semblance <of charity in this."" Bro. J. Salmon, grand secretary for 'South Wales, gave several concrete instances regarding the fight between the doctors and - the societies. "" 1 heard of one case,"" in which a member of the British Medical Association came to the lodge and made proposal that he should; be paid £1 6s. liead, as asked by the British Medical - ciation, and that he would refund the difference between that and the 18s. offered friendly society. I am glad to say that ilodge turned him down, because a man would throw down his own society like that would throw us down also."" They realized that a man who would renetion gade on his union was one who could not well be trusted. Another instance that came to my notice was in a small town in New South Wales, when; the local doctor, who belonged to Australian Medical Association, was offered £300 to walk out of his practice. He refused. In another instance, however, where an offer was made to an Australian Medical Association man, he accepted, and a British Medical Association man was put in his place. present executive of. the British Medical ciation is composed of men who have built their large private practices by means of lodges. I do not blame them for their practice, but they arc now turning round and tating as to what fee should be paid by the lodges to the men who are going through same stage. The British Medical Association has a special man, Mr Barr Johnson, whose duty it is to travel all the time. He gets men who have not already joined the British Medical Association to join, and sees that branch societies are formed in every available place. The British Medical Association at the present time is the best formed union in existence."" Bro. Phipps, W.G.M. (Queensland), stated that several lodge hospitals and medical institutions had been formed in Queensland, but that it was in the countrywhere they were feeling the pinch, and where the doctors had them at their mercy. During the discussion the suggestion was made that should the fight continue the only apparent way out of it was to pay doctors for every individual call, and to amalgamate the medicinal fund, as some lodges had very heavy calls, while others only had light calls. By this method they might be able to get over some of the difficulties, and arrive at some settlement of the trouble, which was at the present time affecting every friendly society in Australia. I make this extensive quotation in order to have it placed in Hansard, and to show how the members of friendly societies regard the British Medical Association. More and more the members of this Association will be employed by our various Departments. It cannot be avoided. I am not averse to it . I believe in preference to unionists in the legal profession New and in the medical profession, but I do appeal to members of the legal profession, he said, who are mostly opposed to the Labour party in politics, to be a little logical and the fair-minded, and to bring a little comper mon sense to bear upou a question such as Assothat now before the House. In a few by the days the Attorney-General may have to the send for a barrister, and he must send who for a member of the Bar Association. In other words, Ministers must give preference to unionists so far as that Associais concerned. Again, in regard to the appointments of medical officers, they cannot go outside the British Medical Association. . There also they give preference to unionists. If they require a civil the engineer, they must employ a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers. And so it is right through the professions. There is no chance of Ministers appointing a professional man unless he is a memThe ber of a union. Seeing that the GovernAssoment now give preference to those drawup ing high salaries and occupying high the positions, why should they deny it to the dicordinary worker, who has to fight hard to get a crust for his wife and family ? It the is a hard thing to keep a home going or 9s. or 10s. a day with irregular employment. Men in the legal and medical professions can manage well without Government employment, but right throughout the piece preference is given to the most privileged ^lass, and it will continue to be given. If these professional men are entitled to preference, I claim that the poor unfortunate working man, who gets irregular employment, is certainly en. titled to preference at the hands of the Government.",57
319,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yarra) [5.58] - Unfortu nately, so far I have not ""had an opportunity of speaking on the question of preference to unionists during this ParliaI ment. It is assumed by some honourable educate them. members that those on this side of the torney-General chamber are taking turn and turn in speaking, but I have searched in vain Victoria. to see whether I made any remarks on the matter last year, and last week, when motion for leave to introduce the B i l closured, I was shut out. Therefore am entitled to make a few remarks upon the question. I have not had the experitold by the honourable member for ence in trade union circles that can claimed by the honourable member for Darling and the honourable member for are the Conservatives. Maranoa and others; but since' I was seventeen years of age I have been a this financial member of the union to which was entitled to belong, and have held office in it , not only here, but also England and America. Therefore I should possess a little knowledge of trade unions. I know that the Attorney-General will say that this measure only prevents unionThat has been repealed. ists from obtaining preference in ment employment. During the'last elecState tion campaign, at my first meeting, which a man is supposed to put forward any policy he has or to account for those things he has done, I was asked only one question, and that was whebut ther I was in favour of preference to unionists in Government employment. And I said, "" Yes , I a m . "" I pointed out then that this could only apply the few persons who are temporarily ployed in the Government service, and are exempt from the Public Service A c",59
320,Sir JOHN FOKBEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Were you taking a great risk when you said that?,59
321,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was not; but if had been taking a great risk, the answer would have been the same. That was not one of the burning questions in my electorate; it had been alleged that I fallen short in regard to other things, and I was a ""goner.""",59
322,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You r electors think only the one way.,59
323,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No , they do not. If they had all thought the one way there would have been fewer Liberal representatives in the Senate, because the few votes that Senator MCColl got in that electorate enabled him to attain second place on the poll. That the majority of my electors think the one way, how- ever, is greatly to their credit. Mr W . H . IRVINE - To your credit.",59
324,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not say that, but admit that I have done my best to I believe that the At has been the best about organizer the Labour party ever had in He has done more to consolidate the Labour party and 'the Labour the vote than any other person, notwithl was standing that he has always been doing I his best to crush them, and prevent them obtaining what is their right. We were m be Werriwa this afternoon that history repeats itself, and that the Labour party If history does repeat itself, it will not matter whether Bill is carried or not, because everyI thing the Attorney-General did against the workers in the Victorian State Pari n liament had to be repealed. It was his Government In the State Legislature who enacted that a decision of a Wages Board should require a seven to three majority. The honourable Governmember for Bourke, who was in the Parliament at that time, will be at able to recount the various Acts passed by the honourable member for Flinders. The Attorney-General appears to be very anxious that this measure should pass, I am not sure that a great number of the Government supporters are so anxious to have the Bill become law. If honourable members thought that the to rejection of this Bill would have the emeffect of bringing about a double dissolution, as the Attorney-General says, t . they would be quite inclined to, if possible, reverse the decision they have arrived at to push on this Bill at all hazards. It was precisely the same with I the Loan Bill of last session. When the "" g a g "" was applied it was thought by honourable members that the Bill would be disposed of in ten or fifteen minutes, had but once they had put their hand to the plough! they had to continue moving the "" g a g "" to get that Bill through all its stages; and it took hours when it was thought it would take only minutes; and they have - to do so now, notwithstanding that they know there is no likelihood of getting a double dissolution. The At tornev-General admitted that at Sandringham a few nights ago. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I absolutely pudiate that statement.",59
325,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then the Attorneyof. General thinks there is a likelihood of getting a double dissolution if this Bil fails to pass ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - We will see.,60
326,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then the Bill is only a gamble. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not follow the honourable, member for West Sydney and yourself in expressing any opinion on a question that has to be decided by the Governor General.",60
327,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,This Bill is only a gambler's throw-the Government may the get a double dissolution or they may not.,60
328,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is the whole object of the Bill .,60
329,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The sole purpose of the Bill is to bring about a dead-lock between the two Houses. We were told by the honourable member for Parkes, in the course of his speech on the amendment to the Address-in-Reply, that the Senateto would accept the Bill , so as to avoid danger of a double dissolution. Does any Parliament. member 'on the Government side think that now? Surely their eyes have been opened during the last fortnight . moving the second reading, the Attorneyyesterday, General said that the Labour party put him in mind of a man who, when conAttorney-General's victed of stealing ducks, said he wished he had never seen the ducks. The hon the orable member stated that if the Labour party had the opportunity to deal with ing his own case. this matter again they would never give preference to unionists as they have done. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear!",60
330,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Attorney-General believes that, there is absolutely no portant. need for this Bill at all. The Government have wiped out, by administrative act, all that was done by their predecesthey sors in the way of giving preference unionists, and they say that they give preference to unionists or anybody else today. [48]",60
331,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On l y to contractors.,60
332,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They say that they do not give it to any one; but I could show how they give preference to contractors, to lawyers, and to other people who could do without it . But the class in the community who should have the most assistance, the Government are prepared to shut out. Doctors, lawyers, contractors, remen who are organized well, are the only people the Government take any notice They get preference without asking for it . But the Government say that the l workers shall have no preference - If the Government have abolished preference to unionists in their Departments, and if , as the Attorney-General says, the Labour party are. sorry that the principle was ever introduced, what is the necessity for this Bill ? Of course, this is only a political placard, and the Government might be called a Government of professional bill-stickers. This . Bill and the Bill for the restoration of the postal - vote are merely two measures to be placed - before people if there should be an election. These comprise the Government's whole programme, and the Attorney-Geueral has referred to that in much better terms than T could hope to use. There could be no greater denunciation of the Government's programme than that by .the At torney-General, nor could there have been anything-more' emphatic than the words of the present Prime Minister in regard the Coercion Bill introduced by the the Attorney-General in the Victorian State",60
333,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Hav e you got it?,60
334,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I understand that the In honourable member . for Barrier. read it and I do not desire to repeat what is already in Hansard; buti f the duck tale is all right, there is no need for the Bill that is before House today. Surely the honourable member protests too much, and is destroy",60
335,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then why fight it?,60
336,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So far as I am concerned, this involves a principle.",60
337,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Apparentl y it is im,60
338,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am pointing out the position of the Ministerial party, because must hang together, or else they to will hang separately at the hands of the no electors. Although many of them know that, this is not a measure upon which to appeal to the country-: ",60
339,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You are wrong.,61
340,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not so far wrong as the honourable member was in the statement that he made at Koonwarra, as reported in the Leongatha Sun of 9th May, that the only question put to applicants for employment in the Government service when the Labour party were in power was, Are you a unionist?""",61
341,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do you deny that?,61
342,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Absolutely . The honourable member was no nearer the truth than he was when he made the statement about contingencies.,61
343,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When you wanted cinematograph operator for the Northern Territory, did you not ask him to join a union? ",61
344,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That appointment was not made in the Department I controlled, and I am not sure whether that question was asked or not. But the honourable member said that the only question asked of an applicant for Government employment was "" Are you a unionist?""",61
345,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I said that that was the main question asked.,61
346,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member deny the report?,61
347,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"T cannot answer for what was in the report, but I said "" main question.""",61
348,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Apparentl y the honorr able member, like the Prime Minister, is so often misreported that it is difficult to pin him down to a definite statement. * The Government desire to make use of this Bill on the hustings, because they will not tell the electors that preference to unionists applies to only a few persons in the Government service. It will be said that the principle will apply to every avocation; and if honourable members are confronted with their statements they will say, like the honourable member for Gippsland, that they were misreported, just as we have had them explaining statements on other occasions. How many men are there to whom this Bill could apply ? Honourable members will find in the annual reports of the Public Service Commissioner a statement showing the number of temporary and exempt employees in the Commonwealth Service, and they will see that from 1910 to 1913the three years during which the Labour Government held office-comparativel y few people were affected by the decision in regard to preference to unionists in Government employment. It should not be imagined that employment in the Public Service as a temporary or exempt hand paves the way to a permanent position. A temporary employee can be engaged for only-six months, but if it be desired to retain his services for a further period, an extension of three months may be granted. At the end of the nine months' period the temporary employee must be dismissed Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does the honourable member say that the temporary employees are always dismissed at the end of nine months' service? a Mr TUDOR - They must either be dismissed, or an Order in Council must be passed providing for their further employment, and there must be published in the Government Gazette the names of these whose services are so retained, together with the reasons for their retention. Will the Attorney-General say that of the 39,000 or 40,000 Commonwealth servants in Australia today there are 200 temporary employees who have been kept on for more than nine months without the publication of their names in the Government Gazette, together with a statement showing the reasons why their services have not been dispensed with ? For the most part, the cases in which temporary hands are employed for more than nine months occur in the Postal Department. In the Telephone branch of the service, for instance, there is always a shortage of skilled labour, and there are employed there many temporary hands who can carry out the technical work required of them, although in some cases they cannot pass the prescribed examination, while in others they are debarred, because of their age and other reasons, from submitting themselves for examination. They have a thorough practical knowledge of the work, although they are not able to pass the examinations. I doubt whether outside the Postal Department there are fifty temporary employees in the whole of the Commonwealth Service whose 'services have been retained for more than nine months. There are also some exempt officers. These for the most part consist of women who are employed in cleaning the public offices, and who receive today 25s. per week, and others who do labouring work. Among the exempt officers are also some casual watchmen and mailmen, as well as those who are in charge of small allowance post-offices. All these are exempt from the provisions of the Act . But there was no great increase in the number of temporary and exempt employees in the Commonwealth Service during the regime of the Fisher Government. In December, 1910, according to the Public Service Commissioner's report, there were 15,472 exempt employees in all Departments in the Service, and the average wage received by them was £ 1 9 14s. each during the twelve months. No one. wil l suggest that amount-representin g the average wage earned by these employees-lef t much room for the application of the policy of "" spoils to the victors."" Of these 15,472 exempt employees no less than 14,954 were employed in the Postal Department, and the average amount earned by them was £ 1 8 16s. Then again, at the same date in all the Departments of the Commonwealth Service there were 3,867 temporary hands, whose average earnings were £ 2 8 16s. Of thai; number, 3,308 were employed in the Postal Department, their average remuneration being £ 2 8 3s. Honourable members opposite go into the country and declare that the aim of the Labour party is to give preference to all unionists and to swell the ranks of the Commonwealth Service. The country is their stronghold. In the cities and towns, where we have a chance of overtaking their misstatements, they do not do so well. At the last general election they set up a candidate to oppose me. He was a champion at making misstatements, and it was not difficult to overtake some that he uttered. people, however, did not believe him , nor did they believe what the daily press said about me. In the country honourable members opposite say that our aim is to give preference to unionists",61
349,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And they talk about the marriage tie.,62
350,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall have something to say to the Attorney-General, when the opportunity offers, in regard to a statement concerning the sanctity of marriage which he made at a meeting where he spoke of "" L a b o u r 's ugly brother."" Grievance Day, perhaps, I shall be able to bring, forward statistics showing that the birth rate is higher in the working class suburbs than elsewhere.",62
351,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is highest in agricultural districts. [48]- 2 Mr W. H. IBVINE - How does the honourable member connect this with preference to unionists?  ence to the union just spoken of.,62
352,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is a preference, in the shape of the maternity allowance, for which the Fisher Government provided. The Fusion party declared that they would do away with that allowance. Why do they not bring down, as a test that measure, a Bill to do away with the maternity allowance, or one to repeal the Federal land'tax? They prefer, however, to go to the country on something on which they think they will be able to score.",62
353,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is not that reasonable?,62
354,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And by means of misrepresentation,62
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Oh , no.",62
356,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes ; by means of political misrepresentation on the public platforms of the country honourable members opposite hope to score..,62
357,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What about the long loans to farmers, at low rates of interest, which were to be made by the Commonwealth Bank?",62
358,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I should not be in order in dealing with that matter on the present occasion. The Government and their supporters, when addressing meetings in the country, talk of the enormous growth «f the Commonwealth Public Service, and say that preference to unionists in Government employment would cause a The greater rush than ever to get into the service of the Commonwealth. May I ask the Attorney-General with which section of the Public Service he intends to do away if he has the chance?",62
359,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is not in order to ask questions at this stage.,62
360,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so; but the At - torney-General puts questions to us in the same circumstances, and we are not permitted to answer them, with .the result that people reading Hansard may conclude that we cannot reply to them. I have a right to put questions to the AttorOn ney-General in the same way. Some of my supporters, reading my speech, may say, "" There you are. Irvin e could not answer those questions."" Mr W . H . IBVINE - I should be sorry to be responsible for what some of the the honourable member's supporters might say of me.",62
361,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"At all events, will the Attorney-General tell us what section of the Public Service he intends to curtail or abolish, if he has the chance? Does he propose to hand over the Postal Department to private enterprise ? The present Postmaster-General talks of placing it under the control of Commissioners. He is attempting to popularize it , and, by means of an improved parcels post system, to bring the town and country into closer touch. Do the Attorney-General and his colleagues propose to cut down the Postal Service, or to hand over t'o private enterprise the collection of Customs duties, the control of the Treasury, or the Crown Law Department? Which of these Departments would they hand over to private enterprise if they got the chance, in view of their expressed belief that private enterprise is better than State control? They say that the Public Service is growing, and it will undoubtedly grow, for the people, as time goes on, will do more and more for themselves. The Government quite recently handed over certain work to a contractor, and they are sorry now that they did so.",63
362,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They are not.,63
363,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Not one honourable member opposite defended the action of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs in handing over the work in question to a private contractor, if men employed on railway construction works were working under an arbitration award, a Wages Board decision, or an agreement registered in the Arbitration Court, surely they would be entitled to receive the prescribed wages; and if the Government were carrying out some public work by day labour they would desire to obtain the services of men as efficient as those employed by contractors. Unionists are at least as good as those outside the unions. My experience in my own trade is that they are better. In the industry in which I was employed all the men were in the union, and we were able to enforce preference.",63
364,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There were two of you, I suppose-yoursel f and another:",63
365,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is trying to be sarcastic. I belonged to a branch of the union in England in which there were over 4,000 men, and to another branch in the United States which numbered 14,000 members.",63
366,Mr FALKINES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I thought that the honourable member was an Australian.,63
367,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So I am, but I have travelled. Surely, it is open to an Australian to travel and to seek employment in other countries? Travel broadens a man's knowledge and widens his experience. The honourable member for Gippsland was sneering at the workers, as he is always doing.",63
368,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Rubbish !,63
369,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When he said, "" I suppose there were two of you,"" he was undoubtedly sneering at the workers, but I dare say that if he had had my experience he would not be ashamed to acknowledge it . Sitting suspended from. 6-80 to 8 p.m.",63
370,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General and others have declared that preference to unionists means the introduction of ""Tammany"" methods and of the principle of "" spoils to the victors "" into the Commonwealth of Australia. 'As a matter of fact, ""Tammany"" flourishes in the United States, where there is no Labour party, but where both political sections of the community, if they were here, would be found supporting the present Government. In my opinion, the absence of a Labour party in America accounts for the presence and strength of "" Tammany"" in the United States; and when the Labour party does emerge there, it will, as elsewhere, make for purity of public life, and sweep ""Tammany "" out of existence.",63
371,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There was no "" Tammany "" in Australia'before the Labour party came into being.",63
372,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is no ""Tammany ' ' in Australia today, except that which is evidenced by the acceptance of contracts without calling for tenders.",63
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the honourable member referring to the powellising contract ?,63
374,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No , I am referring to the Teesdale Smith contract, entered into by the Department presided over by the Prime Minister.",63
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course, the honourable member forgets all about the powellising contract!",63
376,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not forget the powellised timber that was ordered by the Prime Minister when he was Minister of Defence in 1910.,63
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What is that?,63
378,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That was before the Labour party came into power. The fact came out i u evidence before the Powellising Commission yesterday, and no doubt the honourable member for Dampier, who is the chairman of that body, will be able to tell the Prime Minister all about it .",63
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I know nothing of it.,64
380,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am glad to be the means of giving the Prime Minister some information.,64
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I hope the honourable member will tell the House all he knows about the matter.,64
382,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Dampier is now in the House, and I ask him to come down to the front bench, and _ tell the Prime Minister about the powellised timber ordered in 1910.",64
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member for Yarra ought to hold his impertinent tongue. Mr Speaker ought not to allow the honourable member to talk like that.,64
384,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If honourable members were "" pulled up "" for every unruly thing they said, the Prime Minister would be the first affected. I was about to say that in 1912 the Public Service Commissioner made his report dealing with a period which terminated at the same time as the financial year, namely, on the 30th June, so that the figures in the report are for eighteen months. The wages, it is shown, are a little higher than they were in the previous twelve months. The total number of exempt and temporary employees in all the Departments was 12,238 in that year, less than in the previous twelve months, showing that fewer, instead of more, temporary and exempt employees had °been appointed by the Labour party. The average wages in all the Departments averaged only £ 5 5 per year. The exempt employees in all Departments numbered 10,705, at ah average wage of £ 5 0 . In the Post Office alone there were 10,138 exempt employees, at an average wage of £46 per year. There were 1/535 temporary employees in all the Departments, as against 3,000 for the previous year, with an average wage of £ 9 7 per annum. A number of these latter were in the professional branches. In the Post Office alone there' were 1,325 temporary employees at an average wage of £ 8 3 . The total number of exempt and temporary hands in the Post Office only was 11,463, at an average wage of £ 5 0 . On 30th June, 1913, the exempt employee's numbered 14,614, with an average wage of £66, so that there was not much "" spoils"" even if every one had received the full amount. Of these 14,614, some 10,655 were in the Post Office, owing to the undergrounding of the telephone wires, the construction of country telephone lines, and other works. There w i ll not be so many shown in the report of the Commissioner for this year, for the temporary and the exempt men will be largely diminished. As a matter of fact, seeing' that the Government are going to do away with day labour, and employ contractors, there can be no necessity for the Bill before us, and, therefore, no realization of the prophecy of the Attorney-General that, if the Labour party were returned to power again, they would not re-introduce the principle of preference. The Bill is simply a political placard with a view to a single or double dissolution, though I do not know that the Government are so anxious for either. A r e the Government in favour of preference to non-unionists? The Prime Minister is, I think, the only honourable member on the Government side who has ever been a member of an industrial union, and he knows the position better than does any of his colleagues.",64
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I hope the honourable member will tell the House all about the powellised timber he said I ordered!,64
386,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What I say is correct. The Prime Minister, as Minister of Defence, ordered some powellised timber.",64
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I never paid for it , and I turned down the proposal.",64
388,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This has nothing to do with the question before the Chair. Mr TUDOR , - I leave the members of the Powellising Commission to lay the facts before the House. What I am asking now is whether it is the intention of the Government to give preference to non-unionists.",64
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I hope not.,64
390,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Las t year the elec- ' tricians obtained an award in the Arbitration Court, and the members of the union individually had to contribute towards the costs of the case. When Mr . Justice Higgins gave his decision ' he directed it should apply to members of the union only; so that if the Government pay non-unionists at the rates decided by the Judge they, will give preference to non-unionists. In 1904 the Prime Minister, speaking in this House, saidWhen I was secretary to a union we always insisted on preference to unionists; if I were in that position again I would adopt the same attitude. If the Government came down with a proposal to repeal the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which gives public servants the right to go to the Court, I could understand theirposition; but if they propose to extend to non-unionists the benefits of the awards in favour of unionists, then I say they are giving preference to the former. On the 17th December last year, Senator Russell, in another place, asked the Honorary M in ister, Senator Clemons, whether it was the intention of the Government to pay the award rates to those employees who were not members of the union, Mr . Justice Higgins having directed that it should be applicable only to the organization which had taken the case to Court. The Prime Minister, in his speech, said that those men who "" skulked,"" and were not prepared to do their share in the fight for improved conditions, had no right to their enjoyment; and I think we all agree with that view. If non-unionists are allowed to participate it is breaking away from the decision of the Judge. In the A ge of the 2nd instant there appears the award in the case of the telegraph linesmen, which was the last given by Mr . Justice Higgins before he went away, and which contained the following: The minimum wage to be paid per annum to employees who are linemen of various grades in the Electrical Engineer's Branch of the Post Office Department, if they are members of the claimant organization, shall be as follows :Thereafter follow the rates as laid down; and I ask what the Government are going to do in view of the direction by the Judge. I knew there would be silence when I asked this question, because the Prime Minister dare not answer. I saw what was going on, when the ""boss"" of the Government said, "" Do not reply to t l i is . "" The Prime Minister was-prepared to .say what the Government were - going to do, but the Attorney-General practically told him that he was not to answer; and other honourable members as well as myself saw what happened. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is only another effort of the honourable member's imagination I",64
391,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"At any rate, I saw the Attorney-General speak to the Prime Minister when I asked the question. A r e the Government prepared to say what they will do with what the Prime Minister calls the ""skulkers""-the men who are not prepared to pay for the advantage they receive.",65
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is a perky, impudent little man.",65
393,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What delightful language from the beautiful Prime M in ister.,65
394,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I must ask that these personalities cease.,65
395,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The reproof is quite deserved so far as the Prime Minister is concerned. Of course, the honourable gentleman is naturally annoyed at the question I have asked.",65
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,May I speak to the Attorney-General ?,65
397,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister may please himself, and he may please himself about answering the question that I have asked. Notwithstanding all his interjections, some of them insulting, he has not dared to say what he is going to do with the men who are outside the unions in these cases, where the Judge has given a decision. There are no two men whom the Opposition would sooner see filling the places of Prime Minister and Attorney-General than the present occupants of those offices if the present party are to retain possession of the Ministerial benches. The Attorney General has done more to consolidate the forces of Labour in this State than any other man.",65
398,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is why you are all so pleasant to me.,65
399,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"More legislation brought in by the honourable gentleman has ""been repealed than has been introduced by any other honourable member. The number of persons that would be affected by the Bill if passed is so small that it would not be worthwhile to appeal to the Governor General for a double - dissolution were the measure rejected by the Senate. The honourable gentleman said last week that the Labour party would never have in troduced preference to unionists had they known the effect of their action, and that if they could get rid of it they would be glad to do so. If that is his belief, what is the need for the Bill? This Government by administrative action has put an end to preference to unionists in Commonwealth employment. Let me read the .4176 report of what the At torney-General said at Sandringham recentlyThe anti-preference Bill had been described with almost sickening reiteration as an empty sham, because the Government had already settled the matter by reversing in administration the policy of its predecessors. The reply to that assertion was continued in his unanswered challenge to Mr Fisher, and which he now repeated. Was Mr Fisher prepared to pledge his party and himself that if returned to power again they would not resort to this practice ? If so, he, for one, would be prepared to withdraw this Bill. (Cheers.) The framing of the Bill would prevent a Labour Government giving preference in future behind the back of Parliament. The Bill was chosen as a test measure because it represented a clean-cut difference between the two parties. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is a fair lenge. What is the answer to it ?",65
400,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member would not have issued the challenge had he expected to get a double dissolution by means of the Bill . I shall fight the Bill . The honourable member for Parkes said that the Labour party would accept it and pass it through the Senate, but the minds of honourable members opposite tion must now have been disabused as to our action.",66
401,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Labour party is known watering down its opposition.,66
402,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not so. More tender opposition has been shown to the Bill on this occasion, because we have not yet tion, been ""gagged."" On the last occasion I who had not an opportuuity of speaking, all intends discussion being closured after a debate should of three or four hours. . Let me now rates. say a word or two about the recognition immediate of preference by many who are in favour of the Bill . The Attorney-General has association been shown to be a member of an organirates zation which compels preference to its tractor. members, who will not work with others who are not members. Cartage Contractors Association of Melassociated carrier. bourne, a section of the Victorian ployers Federation, acknowledges preContractors ference. The Federation is the organiright zation which employed a secretary to into the country to preach that marriage is a luxury for the workers. Mr Walnot pole went to Lilydale, and made a stateArgus, ment to that effect when the Federation was opposing the factory legislation. Members opposite profess now to be i favour of that legislation. Of course, the the Cash Agents Association. present Liberal party is formed of a ber of parties. It was well described Mr Deakin as the wreckage of all parties, although he himself afterwards joined the wreckage. It is made up, as he said, of the wreckage of the Free I m porting party, of the Anti-Socialistic party, of the Black Labour party, and of others. The only thing which honourable members opposite have in common is their hatred of the Labour party. If the Labour party ceased to exist the various sections of the Liberal party would disunite. The honourable members for Calare and Werriwa, with others, would form themselves into a Free Trade party. ",66
403,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Othe r members would announce themselves as Protectionists, chalothers as Conservatives, and others as Liberals. The opponents of factory legislation in this State, and the opponents of the Commonwealth Arbitration laws, are to be found supporting the Government. But to return to the Cartage Contractors Association. These are some of its rules1. Members must give preference to associamembers wherever possible when requiring teams to assist them in their work. 2. Mem-bers must also refrain from assisting or employing non-associated carriers who are to be working adversely to the interests of the association. 3. In the event of members being asked to for cartage (such cartage at that time being done by another member of the associathey must refer to the present contractor, must acquaint them with the net rates he quoting); they are then at liberty to quote the same rates, but not lower, even such rates be lower than the association But if, when asked for a quotation, an answer is required, and there is not time to refer to the existing contractor, then rates must be given. i . Members are at liberty to quote association without reference to any existing con5. Members are not tied to association rates Then the when competing for business done by a nonEmOf course the members of the Cartage Association have as much to associate as have any body of go employees; but they have no right to ask for things for themselves which they are prepared to allow others to have. The the newspaper which chiefly opposes preference in this State, supplies members of the Authorized Agents Asson ciation two hours before the members of But the numAge is just as bad in this matter. Both by newspapers have the right to give preference; but when they do so, they ought not to denounce others for advocating preference. In every country town the newspapers have an authorized agent, and they will not supply any other person there. In thickly-populated districts like my own' constituency it is of great advantage to be an authorized agent. At the Richmond railway station the authorized agent is supplied a little after 5 o'clock in the morning, and the cash agents do not receive their papers until nearly 7 o'clock.",66
404,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member has already told us all this.,67
405,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am merely showing that preference is given by the very persons who blame us for supporting the principle. The preference given to authorized news agents has made a news agency business worth much more than it should cost. In moving the second reading, the Attorney-General. quoted from the Book of Revelations. I think that no other honourable member has quoted Scripture in this Parliament.",67
406,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for West Sydney, did so, and did not quote correctly.",67
407,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He quoted from the Prayer Book, which is not the Scriptures, and the honourable member, being a good Anglican, corrected, him. I would suggest to the Attorney-General that he should read the fourth chapter of the Epistle of St. James, which denounces the rich who have-robbed the workers of their earnings. It is said that a certain person quotes Scripture for his own purposes. I would not say that the Attorney-General does that, or that he is the person referred to.",67
408,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That would not be worse than what has been said of me.,67
409,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Honourable members opposite say that they believe in freedom; but we know that the Employers Federation, which backs them up, has called into existence in this State a bogus union, to break up a strike in connection with the agricultural implement making industry - It was said that that strike-breaking organization was so strong that it would beat the legitimate unions; but what are the facts? Recently there was an election for positions on a Wages Board. The daily papers did not publish the result of the election or state who were returned ; but; as a matter' of fact, the representatives of the union were returned, and the five Packerites, as I may call them, we're at the bottom of the poll. The genuine unionists received from 825 to 836 votes, and the Packerites from 168 to 189 votes. The bogus unionists were wiped out. Honourable members know that these bogus unionists are fostered by employers. If , as they say, Ministers are opposed to preference to unionists,, why does not the Attorney-General bring in a Bill to deal with preference to unionists generally, and to wipe out the preference provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? Why should Ministers by a side-wind try to attack the smallest section they could possibly attack by a Bill that can have no effect, because we have learned from them that they have already done by administrative act that which is how sought to be done by Statute. I trust the Bill will not be read a second time.",67
410,Mr RILE Y,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"South Sydney) [8.31] I desire to offer my opposition to the second reading of the Bill on altogether different grounds. I look upon the measure as a direct challenge to organized labour from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and as I am a representative of organized labour, I shall do all I possibly can to prevent the passage of this Bill at every stage. The Bill has for its aim and object the striking of a death-blow at organized labour. On several occasions the Attorney-General has said that whenever the opportunity is presented he will bring in a Bill to prohibit the Federal Arbitration Court giving preference to unionists. I commend him for his straightforward intentions. I look upon the Attorney-General as a direct enemy of organized labour. But what, has organized labour done that the Attorney-General and those who support him should be prepared to take the first opportunity to annihilate those organizations which have done so much to build up the civilization of the world? That which has brought the workers of the world from a system of serfdom to their present stage has been the establishment of trade unions. The organization of labour has benefited the workers in every country, and has been the forerunner of civilization. Nothing has had a more beneficial effect on the workers of the world than combinations with a view to five getting more for their labour. The history of Great Britain shows that even io the nineteenth century women were compelled to work in shops and factories, and in their homes, for twelve hours a day, for the small pittance of 4s. 6d. per week. That wa3 because they were not organized. Being unorganized, they were the free prey of the employing class, and the sweating class, and the class whose .cause is championed by our honourable friends opposite. But since the great strikes that took place in Great Britain towards the end of the nineteenth century the condition of these women has improved, because men and women have gone out and organized their fellow-workers, and in common sense they have said, "" Let us reason together to benefit ourselves."" However, I defy any one to say that trade unions are selfish. Every reform they have secured for their own uplifting has not been brought about alone for those engaged in the struggle, or for those in the unions; the unionists have endeavoured to make it embrace every one in the industry concerned. Unionists are prepared to spend their time, their weeks, and their years, in endeavouring to bring about better social conditions for those with whom they mix, and for the benefit of the whole community. Every award brought about is a benefit, not only to the trade union concerned, but also to all in a particular industry. I am afraid the Attorney-General and his friends supporting him do not know what they are doing. They are playing with fire. If organized labour is challenged as the Government are challenging it , and if it should take the course of fighting the Government, what will be the result? We know what took place in Russia. When Labour. demanded its rights, and the military were called out, the workers were shot down on that Sunday in hundreds; but that fact did not stop the onward march of those Russian workmen, for today there is a complete change in the government of Russia, and the workers have representation in the Russian Parliament, while also they have gained shorter hours of labour, and the standard of living has been improved. Now, contrast the conditions of people in Ireland. Unfortunately for the Irish people they have been split up for nearly half a century by a great political issue, and while they have been fighting that issue, they have neglected the industrial side of affairs, with the result that the men and women of Ireland have been compelled to leave the country, because the wages they were receiving were so small. When the Irish have gone to America, England, Scotland, or Wales, they have been found in the forefront fighfiug for their rights and for better wages; but in their own country, where there were no industrial organizations, the wages paid were less than those received by workers in other countries. There has been no increase in wages in Ireland among the general body of workers for t h i r t y years. There have been small increases in Belfast and in other places, but the rural population has remained in a state of drudgery. We have also seen what took' place during the recent strike in Dublin . Mr Larkin, who had had some experience in organizing work in the United States of America, returned to Ireland and determined to organize his fellow countrymen. He was successful. His efforts secured for the workers in Dublin a 30 per cent, increase in wages, while in the rural districts surrounding the city the workers improved their wages to the extent of Is. a day. These increases would' not have been gained had it not been for the organization of trade unions. Because Mr . Larkin was successful in his efforts, the employing classes retaliated by the lockout and the boycott, and provided that unless a man seeking employment signed a form stating that he did not belong to the Larkin organization, he would not be employed. Thereupon we had one of the most loyal and successful strikes that has taken place in Ireland, and I am sure that the Irish will no longer neglect the industrial side of their life. Show me the country where Labour is not organized, and I will show you a country where there is poverty, misery, crime, and stagnation. I glory in the fact that people ask for more wages and better conditions. It is my wish to see the people in every country getting a better proportion of the wealth they produce. In these times wealth can be produced more rapidly by the aid of science and machinery, and workers should no longer be asked to work the long hours they formerly worked, or for the small pittance some of them are still receiving. Our intelligence and cooperation should be employed to secure more of the wealth that is produced. The pivot on which organized Labour revolves is that more justice should be gained for the workers, and it can be obtained. A challenge was thrown out to the railway workers of Great Britain . It was a for unionism. What took place? When - the railway workers ceased work the coalgive ininers stood by them loyally, and waterside workers stopped work. When organized Labour stopped work there uo smoke issuing from the chimney stacks, machinery ceased to revolve, way engines were not running, and steamers remained idle in the harbors, ff the organized workers of Australia challenged, as the Bill before us seeks challenge them, a similar result might brought about. Labour has the power. by preference. The workers have their labour to sell, union and if they do not sell their labour, all ployers to the wheels and machinery of industry must remain in the one position; and they cannot be moved. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u have power; but why do you want a prividence against my employer. lege? "" Mr Riley - I hope to be able to show the honourable member that we seek no privilege. I do not anticipate that the full .details of the business. I can convert him to my way of thinking. The honourable member has good points, but they are overshadowed by his environprompting ment. He is a creature of environment. If I happened to be born a member of wealthy family, and if I had had univerbefore sity training, and had studied for the and obtained my living at the Bar from wealthy clients, I might look at things through the spectacles of the Attorneyhelp General; but I believe that I would still be a man with humane instincts. I tell Ministers that if they challenge dustrial workers they are incurring a great risk ; it may end in chaos. Through a large industrial strike ploying class lose hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the industrial class receive a set-back, because, when a man is employment, he gets into debt, and wife and f a m i l y starve. It is reason that we, on this side of the ber, do not wish to see strikes, and are advocates of peace, and stand for ciliation and arbitration. That, however, cannot be brought about until people organized. The law of this country profor vides that no people can go before the benefit to the whole community. Arbitration Court u n t i l they are organwant ized. It is because they are organized that the Court will give people a hearing. They have to assure the Court, before they get a hearing, that they w i l guided by the award of the Court, and will give up the right to strike. Therefight fore we have endowed the Arbitration Court with the power to say that it will preference to any. industrial union the under certain terms, other things being equal. We ask the employees to go to the was Arbitration Court, and give up the right to strike; and, in return for giving up railthe right to strike, the employees ask for preference to unionists. Those who incur the expense of carrying their claims to are the Arbitration Court ask for preference. to It may seem a selfish request; but let be me explain what organized workers mean If the members of a decide to bring their, emthe Arbitration Court, they have, first of all, to obtain evidence. Suppose the Attorney-General happens to be an employer and I am in his service. the I am cited before the Court to give eviI attend and give that evidence, and perhaps I sit behind iny solicitor and instruct him in his cross-questioning, because I know The employer may have to answer questions that are awkward, and because I am the solicitor, the employer looks upon me with suspicion. That goes a on day after day. Other"" employers come the Court and are cross-questioned. Bar, The result is that the leading members of the union, who have had the courage .to go into Court to give evidence and forward the case of their fellowemployes, are marked men, and after the case is concluded they are told that their the inservices are not wanted any more.",67
411,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course, not because the emthey have appeared in Court.",69
412,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Oh , no; because of something that has turned up in the out of meantime, and because they ho longer his suited the employer. The only means by for that which we can protect the rights of men chamwho have the courage to fight for the rights of their fellows in the Court is to conallow the Court to give preference. By that means we can protect the men who are have stood in the forefront and fought rights, which, when conceded, are of We preference, not for selfish reasons, not for the sake of getting more continuous employment for unionists, but in order to protect the men whom we elect l be to do our fighting. That preference is absolutely necessary. I had the privilege of sitting in the Arbitration Court in New South Wales for three years as the representative of the employees. Mr W . H . IRVINE - How does your argument apply to the employees in the Public Service?",69
413,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I understand that this Bill deals only with the casual labourers. If it dealt with public servants who are in the Government employ for life my argument would not hold good. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Do you victimization by any Government?,70
414,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes . Mr W . H . IRVINE - What evidence have you?,70
415,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"1 can give an instance out of my own experience. At one time. I was President of the Sydney Labour Council, and the Council was successful in having an inquiry held into a joinery contract in connection with the Prince Alfre d Hospital. That inquiry reflected on the Government Architect of the clay, and although I had no part in it , but simply because I happened to be head of the Council that caused the inquiry to be held, I was told to go. As a matter of ' fact, my dismissal did me no harm, because I was able to get other employment. But there are hundreds of cases of that sort. The high officials in the Public Service are only human, and when they are cross-questioned in a Court by the employees in their Departments they are not inclined to look upon those employees with the most kindly eyes. Mr W . H . IRVINE - All o w me to you another question. If a bad Government on some occasions such as you suggest victimized men, is that a reason why a good Government should give preference to all unionists in Government employment ?",70
416,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"B y Act of Parliament we gave the Judge of the Arbitratio n Court the right to award preference to unionists in any industry, and, having given that power, we, as employers of labour, are not consistent if we deny that preference to our own employees. Mr W : H . IRVINE - Then there is no distinction between a judicial order and an arbitrary order by a Government.",70
417,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If this House says that preference shall be given to all unionists, that is a judicial finding and should be the law of the country.",70
418,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But you say that because a Court, after a quiry, may give preference to one union, the Government, without judicial inquiry, should give preference to all unions.",70
419,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I take it that a M i nister's order is equal to a judgment of the Arbitration Court. He is an employer, and is responsible to the people. The honourable member asks why the Government should be compelled to give preference to unionists in casual employsuggest ment. The Commonwealth Government have in their employment at the present time something like 2,000 men engaged in constructing war vessels at the Fitzroy Dock. They are temporary hands, but I venture to say that the Government must give preference on that work whether this Bill is passed or not. Let two boilermakers, one a unionist and one a non-unionist, go to Fitzroy Dock for a job; if the manager gives the job to the non-unionist all the others will cease work. The Government know that, and yet they bring forward this Bill . Let me give another instance. There is an Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and the Government employ hundreds of men in the trade. Every one is a casual employee and a unionist, and the Government are obliged to give preference to unionists. The Government have a Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, and every man employed must be a member of either the Amalgamated Society of Engineers or another union, otherwise the others would not work with him. There is also a saddle and harness factory in ask this State belonging to the Commonwealth, but every casual employee there is a member of a union. Still we have the farce of the Government proceeding with this Bill , which cannot give effect to the will of Parliament, because the unions outside have more power than the Attorney-General has, or would have, even if he had this measure behind him. The Government are obliged to give preference to unionists when the unionists present themselves. If the Government succeed in carrying this measure, and attempt to put it into operation, and not to give preference at Fitzroy Dock, the Small Arms Factory, or the Saddle and Harness Factory, there will be trouble. This is merely a means of inflaming the minds of the people, and bringing about industrial chaos, instead of harmony amongst the workers. We are justified in tryin g to prevent any great industrial judicial in upheaval. All over the world unions today are recognised and respected. The day was when the individual dominated society, and his will was the law of the country. That state of things obtained for generations-. Then there came another period at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the doctrine of the survival of the fittest obtained, when the old and the weak were hustled to the wall to make way for the strong. That was Herbert Spencer's idea of liberty. The man who could work cheapest and work hardest was employed in preference to the man who was physically weaker, notwithstanding that the latter might be a married man with children, and a good citizen. Free competition was the rule. What was the result? We have only to look through the pages of history to find that thousands of people were unemployed, that the work-houses were overcrowded, and that the asylums were filled with unfortunate men and women who had lost their reason in the trouble; the whole race had deteriorated. Now the trade union has stepped in, and said that such competition is bad for the human race, that the hours of labour must be reduced, that the weak must be protected from the strong, that we must have a standard of wages, so that men and women shall not have to struggle with and undercut each other for the right to work. The trade unions have swept away that competition to a great extent, and I hail with pleasure the introduction of a system that'will regulate the hours and conditions of labour and succour the weak and distressed. Labour movement is the cause of humanity, and stands for the uplifting and protection of those who need assistance in any direction. I am sorry to think that we have a Government on the Treasury bench of the Commonwealth today who have launched a B ll ; that is a direct challenge to the organized workers of this country, and who say, "" Come along. We are prepared to fight you, first of all, on this question of preference to unionists, and afterwards we will bring in a Bill to vent a Judge of the Arbitration Court awarding preference in any of his awards."" We on this side are making our position clear, and we say tEat the Government have no mandate to undo the good work of the Fisher Administration - The Fisher Government went a Ur. Biley. little further, perhaps, than other Governments, and said that the civil servants have a right to justice; and they passed a Bill to extend the operations of the Arbitration Act, so as to enable the public servants to avail themselves of its provisions. Some employees in the Government service have gone to the Court, and they have obtained better conditions from the Judge than they could have obtained from the Public Service Commissioner. They are freer men, because they know their wages and conditions, and there is not so much bowing and scraping to members of Parliament and interviewing in the Queen's Hall in order to get increases and mere justice. The Fisher Government widened the scope of the Act, and allowed the public servants of the Commonwealth to have their grievances sifted to the bottom, and the Judge of the Arbitration Court to award them justice. - Mr Fenton - Hav e not the teachers in New South Wales joined the Trades Hall?",70
420,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , and I hope that they will soon get an award. In every State we have what are called clerical workers. If there is a class in the community who have my sympathy it is the clerical workers, because they have not backbone enough to fight for themselves.",71
421,Mr BUBCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They are beginning to wake up.,71
422,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They are. I remember a case coming before the State' ArbitraThe tion Court of New South Wales in which we had to deal with the soft-goods trade. For six weeks we took evidence with regard to the position of the employees. Every employer who entered the box said, "" We have done the best we can for our employees; we have even provided them with chairs on which to sit."" We discovered, however, that if any of the employees were found sitting on one of these chairs, he was promptly dismissed. Their provision was a mere blind. We found that the profits of the industry were suffipre- cient to justify the payment of good wages and the provision of comfortable working conditions for the employees. These, however, they had not received. I remember one man coming into Court looking very clean, but very shabby. His examination ran something after this fashion: ""Where do you work?"" "" M a r k Foy's."" "" What do you do?"" "" I am a clerk in the office."" "" How long have you been there?"" years."" "" A r e you married?"" and have a family of four. I live at Randwick, .pay 10s. a week rent, and have to walk in to the office and out every day, as I receive only 30s. per week."" There was no trade union to take him in and help him. The clerical workers of New South Wales-and I suppose the position is the same in other States-ar e afraid to join a union, because they are - constantly under the eye of the employer, and if they talk union or Labour they - are dismissed. We say to these people, "" We want to enable you to breathe more freely, and to give you an opportunity to enjoy some of the good things of life. We therefore ask you to come into the .Arbitration Court and' have justice done to y o u . "" The Labour party hold that, in this Bill , there is something more than a direct challenge. The Government are preparing a case on which they desire to go before the country. What do they propose? Their object is to pass the Bill through this House and to send it on to the Senate, where, as is well known, there is a majority opposed te it . The Bill .will be rejected by the Senate, and the Government will then ask for a double dissolution. What does it all mean ? The Government and the Opposition in this House are equal in numbers. The Government know, therefore, that in this House there is no salvation for them, and that when they go to the country Mr KING O'MALLEY - There will less.",71
423,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The r e will be less. They therefore make the excuse, "" We shall not go to the country until we have made provision for a double dissolution by the rejection of two test Bills by the Senate."" The Senate, however, has a perfect right to reject the two test measures. It is elected by the adult citizens' of the Commonwealth. At the last general election, the Fusion party went to the country with fourteen senators, and came back with seven. Seven of their number lost their preference to a seat in the Senate.",72
424,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Labour party lost a dozen in this House.,72
425,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And yet we have as many as there are on the Government side of the House - The Government are trying to bring about a crisis. Although I .am not a lawyer, I think that I have ""Five a little common sense, and I am con""Yes, fident that the provisions of the Constitution in regard to a dead-lock were never designed to allow one party to bring forward Bills merely with the object of creating a crisis. They were inserted really to overcome a crisis; but the whole strength of the Government is directed to an effort by means of this measure to bring about one. If the Bill be rejected they will say, "" We cannot carry on, because the Senate has rejected, this measure."" That is all very well, but we : ask the Government to submit measures likely to be beneficial to the people. The recent conference of State Premiers agreed that the locking of the M u r r ay would be a great national undertaking, giving employment to thousands, and that the storing up of nature's waste waters in that way would convert the banks of the Murray into an Eden. The Government are not prepared to submit a Bill to carry out that undertaking, although we should be ready to assist them in passing such useful legislation. Then there is another great questionthat of the break of gauge-wit h which the Government could deal in a non-party measure. AB ill providing for a uniform gauge of railways which would link up all the States is one that all parties would be glad to assist in passing. Instead of submitting such measures, however, the Government have introduced - two paltry Bills in which they hold out be a direct challenge to the Opposition and seek to bring about a dispute - in the Senate. Such measures are unworthy of the Ministry. When the Fisher Government were in power they issued a minute declaring that preference should be given to unionists in Government employment. The present Government on taking office issued another minute directing that no preference should be given. In that way they undid that which their predecessors had done. Preference to unionists J n Government employment no longer exists. If this Bill became law tomorrow it would not affect one individual in the Public Service of the Commonwealth.",72
426,Mr KENDELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then why not let it become law?,72
427,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We desire to place our views before the country, and when we have done so I do not think that the verdict of the people will be pleasing to the honourable member and his party. The Bill is merely a political placard. Ministers and their supporters wish to go to the country and to say to the farmers and others, who may have sons desirous of obtaining employment in our cities, ""Our desire in submitting this. Bill was that your sons should not be required to join a union in order to obtain employment in any city of the Commonwealth. We are standing up for your rights. We ask you to vote for the Liberal party, which seeks to give you and your sons the right to secure employment without joining a union. "" But preference to unionists in Government employment has already been abolished, so that the Government are trying to pass a B i ll which means nothing aud can really do nothing. There is very good reason to believe that when an appeal is made to the people the Labour party will come back to power. If they do, then we shall be able to repeal this Bill if it has become law. The Government, therefore, are merely bringing it forward with a view of furnishing material on which they may work with the object of blinding the people to the real position. When the Fisher Administration came into power it promptly repealed the Loan Bill passed by its predecessors in office, and which authorized the raising of £3,500,000. We did not believe in a loan policy, and we therefore repealed that Act. In the same way, in the event of this Bill becoming law tomorrow, we should be able, if returned in sufficient numbers, to repeal it . We believe in the principle of unionism, and in granting preference to those who are prepared to give up the right to strike. It is all moonshine for the Liberal Government to say that from their point of view there is a great national principle at stake. The Attorney-General is merely showing, by his introduction of this Bill , that he is determined to be true to his pledges, and that he is, as he always has been, a solid Conservative, working in the interests of the Conservative class. I question, however, whether it is to the advantage of the employers that industrial discontent should prevail.",72
428,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The decent employers do not want it .,73
429,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A large number of employers in New South Wales believe in preference to unionists. All their employees are unionists, and if any dispute arises it can be referred at once to the unions concerned for settlement. In the absence of such an organization there would be no one to act as the mouthpiece of the employees, and industrial chaos would prevail. Y o u ' remember, Mr Speaker, what took place recently in South Africa . The unionists asked the mine managers for an eight hours day., and for the observance of certain working conditions. Their request was refused, and the Government of the day thought that they would be able to stamp out the whole movement by taking strong measures. The military were called out, and the leaders of the movement were deported, but that did not put an end to it . The principle of unionism is not only observed in South A f r i c a ; it prevails in Australia, America, Germany, France, and, in short, all over the civilized world. Unionists all the world over sympathized with the labour leaders in South A f r i ca who had been deported in this way, and the result was that the demonstration held in Hyde Park, London, to express sympathy with these men was the largest gathering ever known. Hyde Park could not accommodate all who wished to attend the meeting. The proceedings were over, and night had fallen, before the end of the first procession had reached the park. Since then there has been an election in South Africa . There were thirty-six to be elected, and I think that only four",73
430,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! I am afraid that the honourable member is going far beyond the question before the Chair.,73
431,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I merely desire to show the danger attaching to any legislation the object of which is to cause irritation on the part of trade unionists. As the result of such legislation, we may have here a reflex of what has taken place in South Africa . As the result of the great demonstration in London, trade unionism and the whole labour movement has been strengthened there, as - well as in South Africa . Those who opposed trade unionism in South Africa were wiped out at the recent election. I am neither a prophet, nor the son of a prophet; but I venture to predict that if this Bill becomes law, and an attempt is made by the Government to victimize unionists, as no doubt they desire to do, the Labour movement will be materially strengthened. We have nothing to fear because of our opposition to such legislation. Coercion Acts, and all measures having for their object the crushing of the people, have invariably failed. This young country of ours, with its population of 5,000,000, is the very home of unionism. country is more organized than we are, and in no part of the world are there to be found 5,000,000 people so well off as are the people of Australia. The social conditions of the workers of Australia are far ahead of those of other countries. They enjoy shorter hours of labour, better wages, a higher standard of living, brighter homes, and a broader franchise. All this prevails in Australia, where unionism predominates. If unionism is such a bad thing as the Government would have the people' believe, how is it that the conditions of the country have so i mproved under the dominance of unionism ? Unionism guided rightly aims ever in the one direction, and strives to bring about better social conditions. When a disaster occurs in any part of the country the hearts of the workers go out to the injured, and to those dependent upon them. If an accident occurs in a coal mine, who are the men who go to the rescue at the risk of their lives? Unionist workers recognise no danger where human life is to be saved. The same applies to the workers at sea. When the Titanic, one of the finest ships that ever sailed the Atlantic, met with disaster, who was it that stood by to render assistance ? Do we not know that the musicians on board, who were members of a union in London, bravely played the hymn, "" Nearer my God to Thee "" to the last, until the vessel went down.",73
432,Colonel RYBIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How does the honourable member know that they were unionists?,74
433,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do know that they were unionists.  ists allow people to drown ?,74
434,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member does not see the point I wish to make. Some of our honourable friends opposite sneer at unionists because they ask for preference. They say that the unionist wants spoon-feeding, and that we have too much union domination, and I am trying to make the point that today unionists take the foremost step in all reform, and that they are never afraid to take their lives in their hands to go to the assistance of those in distress.  unionists would do the same.",74
435,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I believe that the honourable member would do so.  "" Let non-unionists b u r n . """,74
436,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am surprised to hear that remark, but I am glad that the honourable member for Echuca has had the courage to say something. I hope that he will get up and make a speech. It is strange that honourable members sitting behind the Government are afraid to stand up and champion this Bill . It is strange that the Prime Minister himself has not had the courage to defend it . He has been a trade unionist, and knows the working of trade unions, and I feel sure that in his heart he does not believe in this measure. I do not know how it is that the Attorney-General has been given charge of the Bill , as it deals with a matter that is not in his Department. It should be in the hands of the Prime M in ister, since it is considered the all-important measure of the Government party. The honourable gentleman sits here touight, and says, "" When are you going to let this thing through ?"" But why does he not get up and champion the Bill? Our honourable friends are afraid to speak in favour of the Bill , because they feel that it is likely to prove a two-edged sword. I personally hope that the measure will be a test measure between the parties when we go to the country. I had a majority of over 8,000 at the last election, and I may expect a majority of 18,000 if this B i ll is made the test question at the next election. The workers of this country will be aroused when they learn that an attack is to be made on them by the present Government. The Attorney-General has said that if the Government had the power they would prevent a Judge of the Arbitratio n Court from granting an award of preference. Some honourable members opposite have advocated free competition amongst the workers, and have said that they do not believe in unionism. They ask why a man should not be allowed to work for any wages he may be able to arrange with an employer. But the day when that k in d of thing was done has gone by, and we now have organizations of employers and employees and the system of collective bargaining. That is the only salvation of those who are not strong enough to fight for themselves. It is only by organization that the workers have been able to demand increased wages and improved conditions from their employers. Honourable members will have noticed upon the windows of the premises of a certain insurance company the picture of a strong man trying to bend a bundle of twigs across his knee. He is clearly unable to do so, because they are united by a cord. The united bundle of twigs is a fair representation of the unionists of day. If the bundle were untied, the man could take each twig by itself and snap it across, and that may be said to fairly represent the position of an individual employee asking an employer for work. He may ask for a wage of 25s., but if another man, having a larger family to provide for, and, therefore,' in greater need of employment, is prepared to take the work for £1 per week, he would be given the employment. That cursed system of competition for their labour went oh amongst the workers for half a century. I am surprised that some honourable members have not made themselves familiar with the industrial conditions of the Old Country. Any unbiased person who will read The People of the Abyss, a book by Jack London, recently issued, must be convinced of the great need for organization amongst the workers, and of legislation in every country to uplift the Unfortunates at the bottom rung of the social ladder - As members of the Labour party, we are proud to be the representatives of the industrial classes, and we may be trusted to leave no stone unturned in our efforts to resist any attack upon industrial organizations. Some of our friends opposite say that they have no objection t > trade unions, but that what they do object to is that unionists should enter the political arena. unionists had nob done so, we should not have the factory legislation which is on our statute-book today. It was only after many years of agitation that the unionists succeeded in placing upon the statute-book of the Old Land,- of this Commonwealth, and of other countries, the legislation which has been passed for the protection of the lives and limbs of the workers in factories. If trade unionists had not taken a deep interest in navigation, we should not have been able to pass the great measure which was passed by the Fisher Government for the protecMr Riley. tion of seamen and of the public travelling by sea.",74
437,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Would the honourable member mind saying what has become of the Navigation Act?,75
438,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is a subject which will probably be dealt with later on. The Act referred to is a monumental measure, and surpasses any legislation of the kind in any other part of the world in the provision it makes for the protection of to- seamen and the public travelling by sea.",75
439,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,75
440,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I referred to the Navigation Act only to show that the better protection for which it makes provision for seamen and the travelling public is due to the influence of trade unions. Trade unionists have gone further. Invalid and old-age pensions have had no stronger supporters than the trade unionists of the country, who are always prepared to give their funds freely for the support of the widows and orphans of their members.. In every part of the civilized world trade unionists have used their political power, not for their own exclusive benefit, but for the benefit of all in need. In a country where trade unions have not been organized, the social conditions of the people will be found to be bad, wages will be low, and the hours of - labour long. Trade unionists start out to annihilate poverty, to prevent crime, and to bring about better and happier conditions for the people. By the introduction of this Bill the party on the other side have issued a direct challenge to the unionists of - the Commonwealth. All the minerals produced in this country are produced by unionists, yet there are men in this House who sneer at unionists. Let me remind them thatIf It's coming yet for a' that When man to man the world o'er Shall brithers be, and a' that. I wish,.in conclusion, to refer to the great benefits which trade unionism has conferred on business people. If I start a draper's shop, and the honourable member for Darwin opens a shop next door, and sells linen at 8£d. a yard, while I sell it at 6£d., because I give 30 inches instead of 36 inches to the yard, the law steps in and refuses to permit that kind of competition. The law says to me, "" You must give 36 inches to each yard."" The laws of the country protect the honest trader, and prevent him from being undercut by the unscrupulous trader. If I am dealing in groceries the law says I must give 16 ounces to the 1 lb. If another trader competing with me gives only 12 or 14 ounces to the 1 lb., the law deals with him. As members of a trade union party we say that the law should protect in the same way the man who has hia labour to sell. We ask the Government of the country to make laws which will prevent one man from undercutting another in the sale of his labour, and by doing so we should protect the employer as well as the employee. No honest trader can keep his market if he is obliged to compete with an unscrupulous man who pays less wages to his employees and works them longer hours. Thus the trade union movement all over the world has a levelling-up tendency. All the strikes which are experienced tend in that direction. If we level up one class of society our action must tend to level up another class. The Labour party are anxious to realise that grand ideal which was foreshadowed by the Great Reformer of the universe when He preached peace on earth and good will towards men. That is our object. We are out to obtain justice, and the best way to obtain it is by encouraging the growth of industrial organizations, and by preventing men who take a leading part in them from being victimized as a consequence.",75
441,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Preferentia l justice.,76
442,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My honourable friend comes from a dairying district, I think.",76
443,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is wrong.,76
444,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then I suppose that he comes from a farming district. I know of the case of a man in Sydney, who is engaged in the manufacture of grain bags. He had women working in cellars for a miserable wage and under filthy conditions, and he was thus able to undersell the honest trader who was paying decent wages and observing fair conditions of labour. Would my honourable friend patronize the former?",76
445,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Every time.,76
446,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,If the honourable member would only confine himself to the subject of preference to unionists in the Commonwealth Public Service he would be all right.,76
447,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My honourable friend has been here nearly a year now, but the [49] only thing he knows is that he has been told that he came here to make two blades of grass grow where only one grew previously. I ask him to take a broad national view of this question. I trust that the Bill will be fully debated, and that the supporters of the Government will have the courage to explain what they mean when they say that no preference shall be extended to unionists. If the measure becomes law, and the Government attempt to carry it to its logical conclusion-seein g that the employees engaged at the Fitzroy Dock are unionists and will not work with non-unionists, that the men employed at the Small Arms Factory are unionists and will not work with non-unionists, and that the employees on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway are unionists, who will not work with non-unionists-w e shall witness a great strike. We shall have the experience of England, Africa, and America repeated, and I know what will be the result when the electors are afforded an opportunity of dealing with honourable members opposite.  desire to - remind the honourable member for South Sydney that this is not a Bill by which it is proposed to put unionists out of employment. It is rather a measure to give every man equality of opportunity.",76
448,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Excep t the unionist.  for Government employment will not be asked whether they are-unionists or non-unionists. The only question put to them will he, ""Are you a man who is capable of doing the work for which you desire to be engaged ?"" There is one very solid reason why this Bill should be received with a great deal of favour by all sections of the House. Of recent years we have heard a good deal of complaint that the power of Parliament is passing to the Executive, and that there is a growing disposition to deal with matters by regulation an'd by Executive act. In regard to this matter of preference to unionists, that is exactly what has been done. The Fisher Government while they were in office took a course of action which practically embarked them on a new policy. They decided for the first time in our Commonwealth history that a man who desired to obtain Government employment should be asked, "" Are you a unionist?"" They went further than that, because is on record that a certain officer appointed to a position subject to his ing a unionist, or to his becoming unionist. Such a course of lead to disastrous results, and one of the first results which we witnessed was a prominent Government official in Northern Territory, who was in receipt of a high, salary, went upon picket for the purpose of preventing Commoncould wealth employees from pursuing their legiinformation-tha timate avocation. This was one of direct results of the policy of granting preference' to unionists - The honourable member for Darwin, I believe, was greatest offender in this respect. He further than did any other Minister, directing that in his Department only the Hatters Union. unionists should be employed. By an Executive act this policy has now been reversed. It remained for the present Government to determine that the order day? issued by the Fisher Government should be discontinued. Once more, therefore, we have restored the normal condition things, under which every person has equal opportunity of enjoying all that country can give. No amount of sophistry will persuade the right-thinking vidual that that is only a reasonfling able condition. It has been said that because preference to unionists was granted by the Fisher Government Executive act, and abolished by the Cook Government by Executive act, there is what it is. no need for this Bill. That is one of the virtues of the measure, in my judgment. It confers upon this Parliament the right to say whether or not preference to unionists shall be the policy of the try. The Liberal party are in a majority in this Chamber today, and we exercise the power of the majority to do what we true, that consider to be right. Therefore, we are about to legislate on this matter. We satisfied that we will do so in this ChamI ber. What may be the fate of the Bill of that statement. in another place nobody can tell. It has been urged that the measure is merely the shadow of a sham, because it takes to do by legislation what ready been done by Executive act. But I would point out that Parliament has never had an opportunity of determining this question. The honourable member for South Sydney, during the course of his speech, said that he would defy anybody to prove that unionists are a selfish I intend to prove it. The unionists  it the strong, active working men of the was community. They are up against those bewho are unable to protect themselves. a, Mr ABTHUR - A lot the honourable action must member cares for them.  that to judge the honourable member than he the has to judge me. During the course of the speech of an honourable member oppoduty site, he said he had been informed-h e not vouch for the accuracy of his t a certain union, before the it would admit any new member to its ranks, had demanded an entrance fee of £20. I can vouch for the accuracy, of the that statement. The union which made went this charge was the union to which the by honourable member for Yarra belongs",76
449,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does the honourable member say that that is the position in connection with the Hatters Union to and I believe that it is so still. Now of the men who are required to pay this fee an are good, honest tradesmen, who are the capable workmen in every way, bu6 who have wives and families to support. They indiare not men who usually have £20 to away. Yet, according to the rules of that union, unless a man were able to pay a premium of £20', he was not to be as an allowed to earn his bread.",77
450,Colonel RYRIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is a ring. That is  such as honourable members opposite condemn, formed in the interests of those who have against the interests of those counwho have not. The honourable member went on to say that he had been told, but did not know whether or not it was the Fremantle Wharf Labourers Union, before it would admit are a new member, demanded a fee of £50. am not prepared to vouch for the truth",77
451,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Why does the honourable member make a statement for the undertruth of which he cannot vouch ?  statement made, I Wrote to the Commonwealth Statistician, in order to ascertain at first hand what were the facts in regard to the fees charged by the unions, and the answer I received was that he had not been able to obtain the informabody. tion from the various secretaries. We are have the assertion made by honourable members opposite that unions charge certain fees; and we are led to infer that they may or may not be demanding considerable sums before they will admit persons to membership. The honourable member went further, and said that some members of the Port Adelaide Workers Union had paid hundreds of pounds into the funds of the organization, which he described as comparatively wealthy. would appear that these unions have established vested interests and the rule of property; and. it is perfectly right that, having done so, they should enjoy all the advantages; but it is the last thing we should expect from our friends opposite. I am agreeably surprised that the members of the Labour party are like ourselves on this side in their view of the right to the enjoyment of the advantages of vested interests. The honourable member for Boothby applauds* the position taken up by the unions, and says that if they did not charge those fees, they would be doing wrong. Do we not see to what this leads? It shows the inherent selfishness of the unionists. They have built up unions with great powers, and, before they will allow any one else to participate, they demand large sums of money. The evil is that our friends opposite proclaim loudly, from hundreds of platforms, that they are out in the in terests of the workers and of the poor of the community.   platforms; but it is not in the interests of the community to establish a close combine, and then charge entrance fees which, to the majority of the workers, are simply impossible. I justify the Bill on the ground that it is intended, so far as Government employees are concerned, to "" knock o u t "" a close combine, which is a great evil, and which has disastrous effects on the community generally.",77
452,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Bendigo) [9.50] - The Attorney-General in introducing this Bill waxed very fierce, more fierce than one is accustomed to see or hear him. Apparently the honourable gentleman has been reading of, and is now endeavouring to emulate, President Wilson, who said that he had been described as an iceberg, b ut that he was really a volcano. The Attorney-General evidently desires to be considered, to some extent, as a volcano, contrary to the reputation he has already achieved in this House. The ""ethics of quoting the Scriptures in this House has been canvassed to some extent, some honourable members regarding it as an unheard-of thing. The Attorney-General, however, has quoted the Scriptures, and it has been said that men "" may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves."" I propose to look for a It moment at what the Attorney-General quoted, and see how it applies. I may point out that the interpretation that the Attorney-General put on the portion of Holy W r it that he quoted is absolutely heretical, and in other times he would have been burned to save his sou. 1 alive. The Attorney-General has placed the stigma on the Labour party that we are the "" be as t "" of the Apocalypsethat we have branded men with the "" mark of the beast,"" and that we will not buy from them, nor sell to them, nor treat with them unless they have the "" m a r k of the beast"" upon them. That is a very strange thing to say, and you, Mr Speaker, might regard it as unparliamentary; but when we look at the whole chapter from which the Attorney General quoted, we see that the interpretation is quite otherwise. In that chapter we find that there are two beasts, one of which is the beast that the At torney-General said we were. I am not going to say who the other beast is; but of the other beast we read in the beginning of the. chapterAnd I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns. . . . There are seven representatives of the Government in this House, and they are the seven heads; while there are ten members of the Ministry in both Houses, and thus we have the ten horns. Wo have, further, this which points the ap plication most emphatically. . . and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority The "" dragon "" is, I suppose, the Liberal party which returned the Government to powerAnd I saw one of his heads, as it were, wounded to death;- and his deadly wound was healed; and all the world wondered after the beast. One of those "" h e a d s "" was badly wounded in connection with the TeesdaleSmith contract. The wound was severe and caused dissension, but, by some manner of means, it was "" healed,"" and "" all the world wondered."" The Prime Minister stated at a public meeting that if he had the opportunity he would have a Government which would be the wonder of the world for wisdom and for sanity. Well, we have seen his Government, and we have heard it to some extent described in Holy W r it . second beast, which, according to the Attorney-General, ""the Labour party is, but really the beast which keeps the first beast in authority, is thus spoken ofAnd he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. It is this "" be as t "" that puts the "" m a r k "" on the people of the community; it is this "" be as t "" which, as the trust, combine, and vested interests of every kind, puts its "" mark "" on the people, and says, "" You shall not buy unless from us, and we will not sell except to certain persons."" Have we not known the Typothetaa, the Stonemasons Association, the Millers Association, and other combinations . in this country? It is that "" be as t "" which has raised the cost of living-the most effective cause of that industrial discontent which it is the purpose of this Bill to foster and encourage. One might liken the Attorney-General to the great mountain which laboured grievously with many groanings and outpourings of spirit; and what has he brought forth? We all know that the , mountain which laboured brought forth something ; and the Attorney-General has brought forth this ridiculous mouse of a Bill . The scope I prescribe for myself this evening is to examine what* this Bill is, what it purports to be, and what its ulterior object is. First of all, the Bill is ridiculous in its form, and ridiculous in its grammar; it is not even English. One is surprised that this learned gentleman, the Attorney-General, should venture to draft for the consideration of this House a Bill in this language. The whole Bill consists really of about four lines, and we should have expected it to be without flaw or faultA gem of purest ray serene. Yet in the four or five lines we have an example of this kindNo preference or discrimination shall be for or against auy person Who ever heard of a phrase of that, kind - no ""preference"" shall be for"" any person? Is it English? Mr Arthur. any one here ever see the like? Evidently the words "" discrimination "" and "" preference "" have been brought together, and there have been placed after them words that do not apply to either. The language only makes an absurd B i ll more absurd. The This is not an important point in itself; but such drafting from the learned At torney-General is almost an insult to Trinity College, Dublin .  member is hard up for argument if he has to attack the grammar.",78
453,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have heard from honourable members opposite, who have had the advantage of education, some sneers at small errors made by honourable members on my own side; and when we find an error of this kind, made by a man who pretends so much, and for whom so much is claimed, we may be permitted in revenge-becaus e I believe revenge is not unknown on the floor of this House to say something in return. Another reason why I consider the Bill is absurd, looked at as a legislative measure,Is that it has no substance. We have been asked, Why are you fighting this "" shadow of a sham""? as it has been called. We are fighting the Bill , not as a legislative measure, but as a party declaration, under which members opposite propose to go to the country. We are opposing a wrong use of legislation. If the Bill is intended to become an Act which will do something, it is worthless and absurd. The honourable member for Echuca said that it was intended to provide equality of opportunity, and to prevent preference of any kind being given anywhere; but it does not, and cannot, do that. It is simply a declaration that certain things shall not be done. What is the use of such a declaration if there is no penalty provided for an offence against it , and no means for enforcing its provisions?",79
454,Mr ORCHARD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Would the honourable member insert a provision making the penalty decapitation, or some punishment like that?",79
455,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Government regarded this as a legislative measure, a penalty would have been provided. It made is not for me to say whether the penalty should be decapitation, boiling in o i l , or a fine of £ 5 . To introduce a Bill making ""made a prohibition, and to attach no penalty Did for a breach of its provisions, is absurd.",79
456,Mr GLYNN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There are a great many directory provisions in Acts of Parliawhat is prohibited. ment to which no penalty is attached.,80
457,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That may be, but ment. what ""is the good of them?",80
458,Mr GLYNN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is challenging the correctness of proposing declaration without attaching a penalty, and I am pointing out that there are Acts tions. of Parliament containing such declarations. Municipal Council and District Council Acts do so.",80
459,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill prohibits preference or discrimination; it does not contain a mere directory provision, such as may be found in Acts which contain Minister. also a number of other provisions, the directory provisions indicating the policy to be pursued by the bodies constituted under the Acts. The prohibition in the Bill stands by itself, like the Ten mandments, and I suppose will be plation of the kind nOw proposed? carded over the country by the Liberal party as the Eleventh Commandment, and greater than them all.",80
460,Mr AHBKN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is there a penalty for obeying the Ten Commandments?,80
461,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , for some; beTherefore, cause they are embodied in our law. W i out the legal sanction, there would merely the moral penalty, which I hope my honourable friend will never incur. wish to convict honourable members oppopunish site of insincerity in supporting the B i I believe that Ministers are insincere in their alleged motives for its introduction, and have brought it in merely to manucrime facture a party cry. Going beyond M in isters, I wish to convict their supporters of insincerity. Such legislation as this was beyond the imagination or wildest dreams of any former Ministry.",80
462,Mr ORCHARD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why does not Opposition move to insert a penalty?,80
463,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This is not the stage. My honourable friend will learn later amendments are to be moved, and may show his sincerity by supporting such may commend themselves to his judgas ment. The provision of a penalty would, I am sure, do that, because he is a able person. To make merely the bald declaration, "" Thou shalt not k ill "" Thou shalt not smoke,"" "" Thou shalt not d r in k , "" and to attach no penalty a breach of the prohibition, is the last word in legislative absurdity.  honourable member impose penalties?",80
464,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On those who do ,80
465,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My honourable friend has not read the Bill ; and, until he has a done so-and it will not take him longhe should desist from asking absurd ques",80
466,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Would the honourable member impose a penalty on a Minister for breaking the law ?,80
467,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Certainly ; if there were a prohibition against its breach by a,80
468,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will the honourable member quote one precedent for that? His position is quite unheard of.,80
469,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will my honourable Comfriend quote me a precedent for legislaWhen he does so, I shall quote him plenty of precedents for what I am contending. I am asked on whom would penalties be disimposed. The Bill is general in its prohibition ; "" no preference shall be made."" the person who gives a prefert h - ence is the person to be punished, whebe ther he be a Judge, a Minister, or an officer. Honourable members opposite, I I gather from their observations, would officers, but regard Ministers as l l . sacrosanct, and above the law. If a penalty is attached to the prohibition, it must be applied to every one guilty of the of giving preference to unionists. - But what the Bill prohibits has already been prohibited. Although this has been said again and again with most "" damnable iteration,"" it cannot be too often repeated. People ought to know that the the legislative proposal which the Government are solemnly bringing forward with all possible ceremonial, including the phewhat nomena produced by all-night sittings, prohibits something that it has already as been provided no one shall do. As soon Ministers came .into power, they abolished preference to unionists in Goreasonvernment employment. Why propose to k i ll what is already dead? The speeches , "" of the Attorney-General and his friends remind me of Galvani's experiments on for dead frogs. By the application of electricity to the muscles of dead frogs, Galvani caused the bodies to take upon themselves the grotesque semblance of life. That is what the Attorney-General and his friends are doing in regard to the Bill . It is a spectacle that I hope never to look upon again.",80
470,Mr AHERN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is preference to unionists dead, or only moribund ?",81
471,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This Bill has been dead many months, and now offends the nostrils of the community. The Attorney-General said that the Bill would prevent a Court from giving preference to unionists in Government employment. That, he said, was part of its value. I pointed out to him that the contention was moonshine, because the Court now has no power to give preference to men in Government employment only in circumstances which are too remote to be considered, that is, should the Commonwealth, together with other employers, be engaged in a general dispute extending beyond the borders of one State. The Public Service Arbitration Act does not give the Court power to grant preference to unionists; therefore, why pass a Bill to prevent the Court from granting preference ? The only preference that can be granted is preference by Ministers or by their officials; and that sort of preference has gone. The Ministers who said that it should be, are not, and those who have said that it shall not be, are. The Bill , therefore, thing but a party declaration, a misuse of the solemn forms of the House for party ends. I do not want to flog this dead thing. Most of those who support the measure are already ashamed of it , and will find it hard to explain to the people why they attempted to misuse the forms of Parliament, and to abuse the Constitution to serve a selfish party end.",81
472,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is it not more than a party end ? Is not every one in the country concerned ?,81
473,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think not; but I shall not digress by dealing with that matter. I have tried to show that this Bill is a ridiculous thing in regard to what it purports to do. It purports to do a thing that is already done; and it cannot in any way affect the future, because, as has been pointed out before, suppose some one did this thing which is prohibited, there is no punishment provided. Are human beings deterred from doing things which are prohibited by mere general prohibitions without any penalties? We know that the Ten Commandments, against which penalties are prescribed, but not by the strong arm of the law, are broken. Even in some cases where a penalty is provided under the law, people, if they think they will not be found out, break them.",81
474,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,""" Be sure your sins will find you out.""",81
475,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The finding out of the sin is nothing in this particular case, because the punishment does not come until after the death of the offender, and it is too long to wait until then. People are not deterred by idle prohibitions of a general character. It is absurd to expect it . I wish to point out the fallacy that exists in the mind of the Attorney General in regard to the Arbitration Court. That Court is given power to prescribe preference to unionists; and the Attorney-General, by way of an interjection, to-night has said, "" You want to give these men preference without any judicial intervention."" That is the gravamen of the charge of the Attorney General against the Opposition.. But the hollowness of that charge is thatpreference in this case is not possible with judicial intervention. Judicial intervention cannot apply in regard to Government employees unless we pass a measure giving the Arbitration Court power to deal with them; so that in saying, "" You is no- want to leave out the Court, and leave it a matter for the Minister alone,"" the Attorney-General is implying that there is a Court to which the Government employees can go, and that we desire to give the go-by to the Court and to rely on the mere declaration of a Minister. That is not so. There is no Court to go to. The only way in which preference can be given to unionists in Government employment, the only way in which we can do that which we impose on any employer, is to grant it by Ministerial act. That is why we believe in preference by Ministerial act. Because there is no other means of doing it . Surely to goodness the Minister in charge of a Government Department can set an intelligent example to other employers in the matter of the regulation and organization of labour. He is as fit as a Judge to do it , if he exercises his functions properly, and we must give a Minister of the Crown the credit that he tries to do so. He is in a position to consider the matter, and see whether preference should be given or not. He is in a better position than a Judge, especially in this case, where a Judge cannot deal with the matter. I have submitted that, as a legislative act, the Bill is an utter shadow of a sham, as has been said so often; but it is not as a legislative act that the Government intend to use it . They intend to take it to the people, and to accuse the Opposition of indulging in a policy of spoils to the victors, and of binding about the clean limbs of Australia, as the Attorney General said, the broken fetters of Tammany, which means accusing us of buying votes by giving navvies and casual employees Government jobs. In regard to this charge, the want of intelligence of the doings of Tammany;would be admirable if it were not so disgusting. It is a colossal assumption to think that any Government imagines that it can keep itself in power by giving preference to unionists. It is all very well to make these cries for party purposes, but when we know the conditions of things we realise the utter absurdity of them. If the Labour Government, which gained such a large majority at the elections preceding the last, and in giving preference to ' unionists after getting that majority, was buying votes, why did it not have that effect at the last election? To think that any Government with any pretension to intelligence would attempt to do openly that which Tammany does secretly in regard to spoils to the victors, or buying votes, is absurd. What was done by the late Government was done by Ministerial decree, which was known to every one at the time.",81
476,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It was discovered by the then Opposition. ',82
477,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It was published to the world. I saw it in the papers soon as it was done. As for this Tamto many business, its roots, its tree, and fruits are all in the dark of secrecy. There has been nothing of the kind here. When we hear these accusations we can retort that we do not believe preference is Tammany, or that i is spoils to the victors, or that we using it for such purposes. We say we use this policy because we think it is an. aid in industrial organization, which is a preliminary essential to industhe trial peace; we think that we, as vernment employers, should set an exlieve, ample to other employers to bring their men into organizations, so that the will take hold of them and bring about that condition of inditstrial peace which only organization can bring about.",82
478,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then you believe in Ministerial preference ?,82
479,Mr AKTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I believe in Ministerial preference in a case like this, where no Court, can give preference. I believe that any Government that believes in organization and industrial peace which is brought about by organization",82
480,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That may be the aim, ' but it is not the desire.",82
481,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We may be ignorant, as the honourable member thinks;. we maybe below common intelligence, as the honourable member thinks; but we wish the honourable member to give us credit for honesty of purpose. We believe in Ministerial preference because it is an essential aid to organization, because no Court can give it, because the Minister alone ean give it , and because organization brings about that condition of industrial peace that no other means can establish.",82
482,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do you think that the Minister is entitled to abuse the public purse to that end?,82
483,Mr AKTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not believe that a Minister is entitled to abuse the public purse. I do not believe that any Minister who is attempting to bring about industrial organization is abusing the public purse. I believe that he is fulfilling to the utmost his public trust. Why we resist this Bill is not in respect to its efficacy as a legislative effort. We are fighting it because it is an attack on a principle, an attack which will be carried through the country if the success which is wished for by some honourable members as on the other side-no t by all, I am glad say-that of bringing about a double its dissolution, is obtained. It will be saidi against us if we let the Bill go through that we were against the principle of preference to unionists, and if we oppose the measure it will be said that we are for t it, and therefore are for Tammany, and are spoils to the victors, and all sorts of that horrible things too numerous and too that terrible to mention. It is because of such cries as these that we are fighting Bill on the floor of the House to the Gobest of our ability. Then, too, we be that this is the first instalment of an attack on a great principle, the first law instalment of an attack upon unionism, upon industrial regulation by law, upon industrial organization, and upon what we believe to be the only effective means of gaining industrial peace. We believe it is the first step, a small step and an absurd, but still a step, as the Attorney-General has outlined again and again, the real attack. In the debate year, when I interjected, not dare to reinstate the old section ""-that is, the old section made political unions outside the scope of the Arbitration Act^-the Trade and Customs replied, "" Our opposition to the present position is just as keen as ever ""; whereupon I said, "" Why do you not repeal that part of the present lAct?"" and the Attorney-General immediately said, "" We intend -""So."" And the Attorney-General - again said that the provision of prefer>ence to unionists in any shape or form, or 'of any kind whatever, is a blot on the statute-book, and that he will try to remove it. That is why honourable bers are opposing the Rill. It is the first step, this thin edge of the wedge, towards removing that which we are honest in believing-though some honourable think we are deceived-is the means to industrial peace that we oppose. to point out that the question preference generally is in jeopardy, under this Bill, but through which is attempted to be made of this Bill. That is why we shall oppose it all we can here until we go down, and we intend to oppose it to the utmost outside. People say that we are foolish to oppose shams, but we do so because they are a misuse of the Legislature. is not so much the sham that is the trouble. If this Bill were all, we could let the thing go, and give it our blessing, as being worth nothing; but it is not the Bill itself that is the trouble; it is the use and misuse that will be made of the measure in the country that we shall have to fight. It is our logical and we stand by it. It is the root of the whole matter. Honourable members opposite preach freedom and liberty. sacred name of liberty they are ready to slay liberty in their own interests. preach Liberalism, which means We have heard it so many times we are utterly tired of hearing it, as no doubt honourable members are tired of hearing many things we say. The liberty they preach in this direction means, and must mean, a condition of anarchy. Liberty is all right if it can be obtained, but it is impossible to obtain Mr Arthur. it . The old legal maxim is that one is at liberty to act as he pleases so long as he does not injure his neighbour, towards but that is not complete liberty. last The whole point is the question of in j u ry "" You do to the neighbour. "" Liberty as long as one does not injure one's neighbour."" which The point we differ on is not liberty or no liberty, but the in j u r y to the neighMinister of bour. We see in j u r y to our neighbour, but honourable members on the Government side see profit to themselves, and it is because of the in j u r y to our neighbour that we want to restrict the efforts of honourable members opposite to do what to do they wish in regard to industrial mathas ters. We hear honourable members supporting the Government say that it was they who uplifted the working man, but that statement is too utterly ridiculous for serious consideration. I know that mem- some of my honourable friends are serious, and desire to do their best, with an idea to the hereafter, but it is absurd for them to say that they .have uplifted the workmembers ing man.",82
484,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not pose as a hypoI wish crite. of not Mr ARTHUR - I am not posing as the use having done anything, but I do object to honourable members opposite posing as the friends of the working man, whereas, as history shows, they are his bitterest enemies, and are supported by his bitdegree terest enemies in the community. I desire to show why we believe in preference generally, and in preference to GovernIt ment employees in particular. 'We believe that organization is the only hope of in dustrial peace. We have heard from the Syndicalists on the Government side. The honourable member for Werriwa is a Syndicalist, and thinks that these industrial questions should be fought out by men like rats in a pit, and that the position, strongest should survive. In America, that system exists. There is ample liberty in America, so far as labour matIn the ters are concerned. In that country there is no regulation by law of any kind, They and there is complete liberty, not only to liberty. the workmen, but to employers. They that have used that liberty, but have they not done it to the injury of their neighbour?",83
485,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Unionist s will not work themselves, and they want to stop other men from working. industrial",83
486,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire to show that the liberty which is the god of the honourable member for Werriwa obtains in America, and the condition of the working man in America, where there is no industrial regulation, is too horrible to contemplate. If the honourable member could be dragged back from the Big Veda and the code of Hammourabi-histor y of 4,000 years ago-and shown the picture of the industrial position in America today, which is the result of unregulated labour, he would not think that we are so utterly misguided as at present he believes us to be. The removal of the non-unionist trouble is the solution of the problem of industrial strife, because the non-unionist is at the root of industrial trouble today. Honourable members opposite are shutting their eyes to the fact that if there is one trouble that is more serious than another it is the 'refusal of the unionist to work with the non-unionist, and if we give no authority to deal with that question we are leaving untouched more than half the field of industrial disturbance. Let me indicate to honourable members, and the honourable member for Werriwa in particular, what have been the results in America of the non-regulation of labour. I have here the figures from 1881 to 1905, and they show that the Bureau of Labour tabulated 36,757 strikes-that is, in twenty-five years. The writer saysIn 1003 there were 3,494 strikes-a n average of nearly ten per day. Some of those strikes lasted for months, even years. In 1894, the of the Pullman strike, 610,425 men were out of work. The number of strikes for recognition of union has multiplied fivefold in twenty-five years. That is the great trouble before those who are honestly attempting to settle the industrial question today. The Prime Minister, who sits there so peacefully, can hear echoing in his ears the sound of industrial strife in the old days. He knows that the question of non-unionism is at the root of the industrial trouble; that it is the wood-borer that will bring down the tree of industrial regulation if it be allowed to continue. The honourable member knows that, and for that reason he did not introduce this Bill, and does not speak in support of ib. He has expressed so many times his absolute faith in the principle to which this Bill is opposed.",83
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Since you have got politics into your ""unions strikes have multiplied indefinitely.",84
488,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And they will. [50],84
489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,In the same ratio as you put politics into your unions does unrest increase.,84
490,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The schoolmaster is abroad.,84
491,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , that is the cause of the whole thing. Did the honourable member believe as he does now when he wrote the letter claiming political representation for his union? The honourable member will know to what I refer.",84
492,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not object to political representation.,84
493,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am desirous of indicating the state of things in America, where there is no preference to unionists by law. The writer I have already quoted says The worse feature of American strikes, however, is not their number, but their bitterness, and the weapons with which on both sides they are fought. The Labour war is fought with dynamite and gunpowder, exactly like any other variety of war. But American unions use a yet more deadly weapon, the boycott. And he gives a terrible picture of the results of the boycott, with which I will not trouble honourable members. I want to emphasize the point that this question of non-unionism must be seized hold of and dealt with by any intelligent Government, because, for obvious reasons, it is at the root of industrial trouble. If a body year pretending to be a Government does not seize hold of this question and break industrial strife by regulation, industrial strife will ultimately break it, and deservedly so. I am not one of those who condemn the Syndicalists altogether. Their militant movement has a value in the community, the value of keeping U9 in fighting trim. But I dp think this' method of regulation goes hand and hand with it. The Arbitration Act encourages men to come within the law, and when men consent to do that, to give up their strike weapons and to be regulated for the benefit of the community, we say they deserve preference, because they are law abiding, as against the non-unionist, who does not observe the law.",84
494,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You do not win your cases on arguments of that kind.,84
495,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I can afford to pass by with the contempt it deserves an utterance of that kind from the honourable member for Henty. The honourable member is not innocent of strike matters or strike breaking. He does not believe in preference because he thinks he is strong enough to break any strike that occurred. In that respect he believes in liberty. To continue my quotation from the American writerThe employer relies on a new trade to fight his battle, the trade of ""strike breaking."" There are large detective agencies which make it. a business, to furnish ""union and non-union men and women of all trades for secret-service work for locating ' disturbers,' "" as one of them advertises. These concerns have reduced strike breaking to a science. One firm advertises guards for protecting property and life during strikes and lock-outs. "" These men are all above 6 feet in height, and are selected for their ability to handle this class of work""; and again, "" secret men attend all meetings and report, proceedings. The service possesses _ the necessary equipment, such as Winchester rifles; police clubs, cots, blankets, &c, to handle any sized trouble."" Fancy the callousness of advertisements of that k in d ! That is what they have in the great free country of America, where there is unregulated labour, and the same thing would happen here today if the law were not active, if the people were not encouraged to come under the law, and if there were not a deterrent to those who would keep the workers outside the law^ so that the masters could wreak their will upon them. Let me continue my quotation' ""Where do you get your strike breakersT"" I asked one of these experts. , "" They are a wandering class. Some have a. past, some are ex-union men who went to work contrary to instructions and were ostracized, moved away from their old homes, and are doing this as a sort of way of getting even with the unions. Most of them love adventure, and, when the danger is over, get restive. They get their fun out of the danger, are used tb guns and clubs, and can hit hard when necessary. They have a sense of loyalty that is remarkable. They obey orders like soldiers, and you can't tell me they do this just for the money that is in it. I have had men clubbed, stabbed, and shot, and their orders are to return the compliment. It is war and excitement, aud when a bunch of infuriated men are after you, you use the weapon and don't shed fears."" That is the millennium looked forward to by the honourable member for Werriwa.",84
496,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is better than slavery.,85
497,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We do not think it is better than wage regulation by law. While we are a party we are out to prevent that class of thing sullying Australia.. We believe in the law, and we are' out to encourage the law to do its work. That we poor ignorant men on, this side are not alone in this regard is shown by the attitude of Sir James Mills, ever the managing director of the Union Steamship Company towards the necessity for organization. He had to do with the strike in Wellington, where a certain section of the unionists who called themselves the "" Red Feds."" broke away from the Arbitration Act, The employers did not like that. They wanted them to remain under the Arbitration Court. That was a casewhere they wanted, preference to arbitration unionists, so that the "" R e d F e d s "" should be beaten. When preference is to their benefit, they support it. I suppose that is the law of human conduct. When it is to their interests to come with in the law they support arbitration withtheir utmost strength. Sir James - Mills says The statement that an attempt, is beingmade to crush unionism is absurd. It is merely the revival of an old cry. As a matter of fact, all large employers recognise that their interests are best served by the workers being organized so that the conditions of labour may be pro1 perly regulated; that there may be some assurance that all employers may be placed on the same footing. It is only those employers who think their interests are served by being able to get hold of non-unionists who are against preference. The large employers recognise that regulation is. absolutely necessary.",85
498,Mr CONROY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,So that you are working for the big employer whom you so much condemn.,85
499,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are working for all employers and all employees. My honourable friends opposite think they are working for the employers' interests, but as. a matter of fact they are not, and the large employers recognise that that is so. It has been recognised for years that the organization of labour is the most essential thing in the world. Carlyle said it was the most vital problem in the universe. His wordsThis that they call organizing of labour is, if well understood, the problem of the whole future for all who will in future pretend to govern men. Pastoral members know how much better it is for them today to have their in dustry regulated by law than when it was regulated by the burning of boats and sheds, and the throwing of waggons into rivers. It is desirable to bring these men where they can be controlled by law, and preference is necessary to bring about that organization.",85
500,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You waut to give preference to them only if they will vote for you.,86
501,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is unworthy of the honourable member. It is an utterly false position, which brings shame on those who insinuate it . The Archbishop of Canterbury may also be quoted in this House .to show the importance of organization. He recently said- Could any clear-headed observer doubt that the real power and governance of the country in the years that were not far off would rest, indirectly at least, with the organized industrial forces of English manhood-or , possibly, manhood and womanhood together? It was a force capable, 'he unhesitatingly believed, of carrying into practical effect the very noblest ideals. In that authority we have somebody - on our side who cannot be accused even by the honourable member for Werriwa of complete ignorance. It was never in tended that a Bill should be put forward to excite dead-locks, as the Attorney-General knows. The dead-lock provisions of the Constitution were inserted - to deal with matters of serious import. Every Constitutionalist knows that it is constitutionally unthinkable to use a party Bill for the purpose - of exciting another House .to anger, 'and deliberately creating .a situation to gain a party advantage. Such a use of this Bild would be a fraud upon the Constitution. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Would you mind telling us exactly what that means ?",86
502,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is using the Constitution for a purpose which the users know to be utterly foreign to the intention and objects of the Constitution. Mr W . H . IRVINE - And what does that mean?,86
503,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A fraudulent use of the provisions of the Constitution, devised for a purpose well known to the persons using it to be contrary to the intentions of the Constitution. This provision was put in to solve a dead-lock when it had arisen; not to create dead-locks. Chief Justice of the High Court, dealing with another constitutional provision, saidUnfortunately, attempts have sometimes been made to take advantage of this provision of the Constitution for the purpose of creating so-called disputes, not for the real purpose or preserving industrial peace, but for the purose of taking the - control of industry out of the ands of employers. In my opinion, such attempts are a fraud upon the Constitution, and ought to be so treated. [50]- 2",86
504,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do you agree with that?,86
505,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , with the principle. I say that this Bill is a f r a u d upon the Constitution, and I hope it will be treated as such.",86
506,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Fawkner) [10.56].-4 Before giving reasons why we, as a party, are justified in opposing the Bill , I should like to reply to some of the statements of the honourable member for Echuca. He said one particular trade union charged an entrance fee of £ 2 0 , meaning his hearers to draw the inference that what applied .to that union applied to many others. He was reminded that that entrance fee was not now in operation.",86
507,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What is the entrance fee to the Hatters Union now ?,86
508,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I can tell the honourable member. An y one who has been .apprenticed in Australia gets in for nothing, and always has.",86
509,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is evident that the - entrance fee has been .considerably reduced. The honourable member for Echuca referred also to the Waterside Workers Union. I do not know who has given him his information, but if his other statements are as accurate as his remarks regarding that union, very little dependence can be placed on them. He said - that .the entrance fee to the Waterside Workers Union of Western Australia was £50. One could hardly credit that a man who has been so long in the Federal Parliament, where industrial matters 'have been ;so prominent, could make such a statement, but he did. I understand that both the Felt Hatters and the Waterside Workers Unions are registered organiza-. tions under the 'Conciliation and A r b it r ation Act . When a union applies for registration, it has .to submit to the Regis-i trar a copy of its rules, and if the Regis-' traT considers that any rule is unreasonable, he has the righ t to call on the union to make it reasonable; The and, if they fail to frame their rules in as cordance with the Act , the Registrar has the power to refuse registration. The two organizations referred to by the honourable member for Echuca are registered under the Commonwealth Act. The waterside workers are now working under an award from the Court, and the case of the felt hatters, I believe, is now before the Court. We on this side make no apology for requesting the righ t of preference to unionists when seeking employment. We say, on the other hand, that when the whole case is summed up trade unionists are not asking for preference because unionists cannot seek employment except in trades where union conditions are recognised. Only in such trades can unionists apply for employment. When a unionist applies to a firm in connection with his trade, he is asking for work under conditions which he, as a member of the organization, has assisted to bring about, and therefore he is asking for no preference. But when we take the case of the non-unionist, the question of preference comes into operation. The non-unionist does not believe in trade unions or in organization of any description, but he certainly believes in asking for the rights and privileges which trade unionists have fought for and won. That is the position in which the non-unionist is today. The State Government, municipal bodies, and even the Federal Government in the past have in almost every instance inserted in their contracts conditions of labour which specify that the recognised trade union conditions for the district in which a work is to be carried out shall operate during the performance of the contract. Practically in every State the Government recognise to that extent the usefulness of trade unions. What is the position that confronts us? During the riyime of the Labour Government a great deal of construction work was being carried out. The ex-Minister of Home Affairs, Mr King O'Malley, issued an instruction that in the case of casual ployment preference should be given to the unionist. Prior to issuing that instruction, as the result of a deputation from trade unionists with a request to that effect, the honourable gentleman brought into operation for the first time the recognised union conditions in Victoria and other States. His act meant that any non-unionist applying for employment immediately after his instruction was issued must get the benefit of |the work done by trade unionists. Of course, some persons may say that it is an easy matter for the representatives of the unions to wait upon a Government and get them to agree to comply with certain union conditions. The unionist makes no sacrifice in making such a request to the representatives of the Government-that I am prepared to admit. But the unionists have made sacrifices to Mr Hannan. obtain the very conditions which they request the Government to observe. Considerable sacrifices were made in the early stages of the Builders Labourers Union and the General Labourers Union in Victoria, the organizations which were principally responsible for making the request to the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. A great deal of exception was taken to his decision by a particular section of the community who do not believe in trade unionism in any shape or form. During the present debate a number of honourable members have said that they are in favour of the trade unionism which they knew in the years gone by, but are totally opposed to the trade unionism which is operating in Australia today. Amongst these honourable members. I have failed so far to recognise one man who in the days gone by had the courage to go upon the public platform and endorse the action of the trade unions and their officials who were then fighting to better the conditions of the people of this State. Honourable members on the other side come along with the plea that, while they are opposed to the present system of trade unionism, they are wholehearted supporters of that form of trade unionismwhich practically exists no more. They oppose the present system of trade unionism because it has political tendencies-that is the ground of their opposition. They are quite in favour of trade unions which are simply mutual admiration societies. But immediately a trade unionist becomes militant, and tries, by em- means of organization, to better the conditions of the people who are dependent upon its success, they have no further use for him. Political action, I am prepared to admit, is interwoven with the system of trade unionism as it exists in Australia today. I go so far as to say that a trade union that is not political today is not fulfilling its highest duties. In my opinion, a trade union that does not devote a portion of its funds to political purposes is not fully carrying out its functions. That, too, is the opinion of the great majority of the people in our movement today. There would have been no objection from the other side to political unionism if it had failed. It is only because political unionism has been so successful that it arouses the bitter opposition which is expressed by honourable members sitting opposite, and by their supporters outside. In public life in Australia today we have a Conservative party, which is known as the Liberal party. If political unionism continues to gather strength at the rate it has done for the last twenty years, it means that in ten years the great Conservative party will have been practically wiped out of existence. That is where our honourable friends perceive the danger; they do not approve of political unionism. They approve of the unionism that existed in the days gone by. Before the leaders of trade unions thought of taking political action, what was the attitude of our honourable friends towards the leaders and the members of those organizations? latter were persecuted; they were victimized whenever an opportunity was given to their opponents. In England, Ireland, and Scotland, particularly in England and Scotland, union leaders were sentenced to transportation to this land because they had the courage to rise and demand rights on behalf of the men and the women whom they represented. When the agitation for the inauguration of the eight-hour principle was started in Victoria, the leaders of the movement were Chartists from the Old Country who had been leaders in the industrial movement; many of them were sent here, as some persons expressed it , "" for the good of their country,"" but as other people express it today, these men were transported for no other reason than that they were officials of industrial organizations. The men who bore the brunt of the fight for the eight-hour principle in Victoria in 1852, 1854, and 1856, were men who had been connected with the great industrial movement at Home. At that time in the Old Country trade unionists, in addition to struggling for improved industrial conditions, were agitating for the right to say who should represent them in Parliament. The honourable member for Werriwa stated here today that, on investigation, he had found that the leaders of the Labour movement in Australia were simply going back and copying legislation passed in England 400 or 500 years ago. He quoted how wages and hours of labour were regulated by law 400 or 500 years ago, and he said that, in doing what he considered to be in the interests of the workers, we were simply returning to the form of slavedom that then existed in England. He said that in our movement there was nothing for the betterment of the people.. I do not contradict his statement that England did have industrial laws fixing the conditions of labour; but I point out to him that there is a great distinction between the form of industrial legislation operating in England at that time and the form of legislation which we are advocating and placing on the statute-book in Australia today. I find that, under the legislation to which the honourable member referred, a maximum wage and the hours of labour were fixed by law. No man could work less than the hours fixed; no man could reThe ceive a penny more than the wages for which that law provided. No employer could give a penny more; and if a worker refused to accept the wages so fixed, he was liable to suffer a term of imprisonment. Then, again, if he removed from one district to another to seek employment, he also committed an offence under that legislation, and was liable to be imprisoned. The honourable member for Werriwa, having investigated the form of industrial legislation operating in those days, now declares that that which the Labour movement is seeking to place on the statute-book of Australia is but a copy of it . I hold that the two forms of legislation are entirely different. The men who were legislated for in those days were not consulted as to the conditions which should be fixed; the men who were to be affected by the conditions to be imposed were not consulted by those who had the power to fix them. The very legislation for which we have been fighting, and which is in operation in the Commonwealth today, makes it necessary that the workers shall organize in order to reap the benefit of it . The Conciliation and Arbitration Act passed by this Parliament declares that there shall be organization. Parliament itself, therefore, has approved of organization on the part of the workers, as well as on the part of the employers. Then, again, the workers are afforded an opportunity to place their claims before the Court. The employers are likewise given an opportunity to put their case before it , and the President of the Court, having heard the facts, is then to give his decision. I recognise the good accomplished in the past by trade unions in older countries. I recognise the good that has been accomplished by trade unions in Australia, but I recognise also that the industrial movement has made more real progress since the workers exercised the right of political action than it did before. Those of us who recommended political action have no reason to regret our advice, and I believe that if it is consistently followed up we shall never have cause to regret it . We have heard a great deal of what trade unionism has done, and of what it stands for. In this connection I desire to read a letter which was addressed by Lady Dilke to the Treasurer of the Women's Trade Union, London, and was read by her at a public meeting held at Rye Hill Chapel, Newcastle, presided over by the Rev. Walter Walsh, and called by the members of a Trade Union Congress, then sitting in Newcastle, representing practically the industrial workers of Great Britain. The subject under discussion was "" How trade unionism raises the social, as well as the industrial, position of women."" The letter is as follows: PjTford, by Maybury, near Woking, I shall be glad if you will express to Mr. Walsh and to the friends who may attend his meeting, my deep sympathy with its object and my regret at my inability to be present. Tell them that I do not base the claims of this movement on industrial grounds alone. The cause of trades unionism amongst our women is inextricably bound up with all that makes for their moral as well as physical well-being. Membership in a trades union does not only educate our working sisters and develop their powers of mind and character; it gives them social protection and support in the bitter hours of sickness and out of work. The principles which make the strength of trades unionism are those of the gospel of Christ. There is no more potent force than this for the salvation of souls enslaved by the machinery of modern labour. Therefore I would urge the claims of the work on all who hold sacred the ties of our common womanhood. Yours affectionately, In the discussion which took place at this congress there was a difference of opinion as to whether political action ought to be taken by trade unions in the older countries. That difference of opinion exists even today amongst prominent unionists in Great Britain. fident, however, that as soon as the unionists there are as solid for political action as are the unionists of Australia, will dawn a better era for the workmen of the Old Country. But for the difference of opinion prevailing amongst non-unionists in this regard, they would have made more progress than they Mr Hannan. During this debate we have heard some references to Syndicalism. We have always been told that Syndicalism is a new thing. I believe that it means neither more nor less than the general strike, and I find, in a report of the address delivered by the president of a congress held at Bradford, as far back as 1888, to deal with industrial condiiEions, the following statement: The miners have set a splendid organizing example to their brethren of other industries; yet, while they may have powerful associations in various parts of the country, it is found well nigh impossible to obtain concerted action either for a reduction of the output or an advance of wages; and when a strike occurs in Northumberland, in South Wales, or in Yorkshire, the men practically stand alone-or , what is worse, the members of other miners' associations are practically made the unconscious instrument of defeating their brethren. Thus the coal which cannot be obtained from the strike district is procured from other fields. So long as this course of isolation is pursued, the miners will not succeed in materially raising their wages, or universally obtain an Eight Hours' day. September 4th, 181)1. Even as far back as 1888, the president of that congress went so far as to advocate the genera] strike as the only means by which the miners of the Old Country could better their 'conditions. I believe that the form of Syndicalism referred tr> by the Attorney-General is neither more nor less than the general strike. The officials of the unions in Australia have at all times strongly objected to the principle of the general strike, and have succeeded, so far, in preventing a genera} strike taking place in the Commonwealth. It must be admitted that the Trades, and Labour Councils of all the States, as well as the Labour party in the Federal'and State Parliaments, have at no time advocated industrial strife. We have, at EMILIE P. S. DILKE. times, endorsed a strike when those participating in it have had no other means of bettering their conditions, and I , for one, am not yet prepared to vote in this House for the prohibition of strikes. In their time, strikes have done a great deal to better the conditions of the people of trade Australia, as well as the workers in other I feel con- countries. The workers in this community today are enjoying many benefits for which they have made, perhaps, but there few sacrifices. The sacrifices have beer* made by those who have gone before. But we, as a party, do not stand for the principle of a general strike. We believe that the conditions of the workers can b» have. materially improved by political action, and that through the ballot-box we can - obtain better conditions for those whom we represent than by asking them to cease work and to make the sacrifices that are usually associated with an industrial upheaval. In a little work dealing with the eight-hours movement, I find the followingThe war of '66-70, and the long peace following, had done for Germany what the great - civil war accomplished for American workmen - it turned soldiers into Socialists. Bismarck infused, a spark of enthusiasm into the hopes of the German Socialists by a speech in the Reichstag on old-age pensions. "" If,"" cried the great Chancellor, ""you will give the labourer the right to labour as long as he is in health, secure to him care when he is sick, provide for his support when he is old-if you will do that, and not cry out about State Socialism whenever the support of the aged is spoken of; if the State shows some Christian - solicitude for the working people, working men will respect and champion the Government."" That is the attitude which the trade unionists of Australia have adopted. We are absolutely constitutional in our methods. When we relied upon the strike alone as a means of remedying (since the evils under which the workers following laboured, we had no representation in Parliament. We had not taken the trouble to secure it . But since we have secured it we have obtained better results. No person can over-estimate the good that has been done to the people of this country, and, indeed, to those of countries, by the trade union movement. We see its influence and effect on every hand. Where organization has taken place in any trade or calling, its effect is manifest. Where there is no organizastarted tion in any trade or calling, the effect clearly apparent, and is ofttimes of a destill plorable character. I have another one or two interesting quotations to make reference to political parties as we knew them in the Old Country, and as we know them in Australia today. In the older countries, political parties were never eager to assist the workers to better their conditions until public opinion practically compelled them to do so. It frequently happened that the party responsible for passing the Act under which industrial - conditions were improved received all the credit for so doing. Personally, think that the credit should be given to tralian Workers Union. those connected with the industrial moveof ment, seeing that it was that movement in almost every instance which carried the agitation. Mr Thorold Rogers, in referring to that matter, saysI t is no wonder that working men have no great trust in government by party, for the two great historical parties have fleeced and ground them down with impartial persistence - according , we may add, as their interests are alternately affected. That has been the experience of the workers of the Old Country, and it was the experience of the workers here until they took on themselves the responsibility of direct political action. In a book which I hold in my hand relating to the agitation which was carried on in Victoria",86
510,Mr BEENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who is the author of it?,90
511,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Mr W . E . Murphy, who for many years was secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in Victoria, and of the eight hours movement in this State. The title of the book is The History of the Eight Hours Movement. The passage which I wish to quote readsOn the 5th of the same month a conference of the masons' delegates was held at the St. Lawrence Hotel, Gertrude-street, Fitzroy demolished), and subsequently at the Belvidere Hotel, on the Eastern Hill, where the resolutions were passed- 1st. "" That in the opinion of this meeting a reduction of the hours of labour would be greatly beneficial to the trade, and also tend to improve our social and moral condition, and that this meeting pledges itself to use every lawful endeavour to bring about so desirable a result."" all That resolution was carried as far back as 1856, and from that time the agitation in favour of the eight hours principle has been carried on in this State. Notwithstanding, however, that it was so long ago, I regret to say that in is many trades the eight hours principle is not recognised. It is not recognised principally in those trades in which there in are no unions. In the trades in which there is effective organization, the principle is in operation. Unfortunately, I repeat, there are many workers who do too not enjoy the blessings which flow from a recognition of that principle. I have no hesitation in saying that amongst the majority of rural workers today the most deplorable conditions exist. Of course I am not referring to the men who are connected with the pastoral industry. They I have been well looked after by the AusThe influence that union is clearly discernible in the conditions which its members enjoy. B ut on in the majority of cases the condition of the rural workers in Australia is positively deplorable. Yet we find that honourable members opposite, who are never tired of proclaiming their interest in. trade unionism, are quite prepared to deprive these workers of their just rights.",90

They are absolutely the worse fed, and, in many instances, the manner in which they are housed is a disgrace to any civilized community. Yet in almost every Parliament-Stat e and Federal-the country representatives have dominated the position of the Government.",91
514,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On what authority does the honourable member make that statement 1,91
515,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My authority is that when men are sent to the country to employment, they cannot be kept there because of the prevailing conditions.",91
516,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When one of Labour members in the New South Wales Parliament introduced a Bill to improve the conditions of the rural workers, not one of the country Labour members was there to vote in favour of it .",91
517,Mr HAINAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Riverina must recognise the fact that the men in the shearing sheds are now properly housed, as the result, first, of the Act passed by this Parliament, and, secondly, of the efforts of the organization, which spent thousands of pounds in taking their grievances to Court. Even after an award was obtained it was necessary to have certain prosecutions to compel individuals to comply with the law. Shearers are now well housed, because the pastoralists of Australia are compelled to comply with certain conditions. I am prepared to admit that many farmers treat their servants like human beings, but there are others who do not so treat eve7i their own children. A gentleman who recently returned to England, after a tour through the rural districts of Australia, expressed his astonishment at finding that in this sunny land child slavery is in operation. In the manufacturing districts the young are protected by law, but there is no protection for them in the country, where boys and girls from seven to ten years of age have to rise at 5 o'clock in the morning, milk for three or four hours, walk, perhaps, 3. miles to school, and do more milking again in the evening. The farmers have ruled the State Houses in Victoria and New South Wales for a number of years, and, while they are prepared to vote for factory legislation, they always stipulate that it shall be confined to the manufacturing They industries. Child slavery exists today, and it has always existed in Australia and elsewhere where there are no trade unions to take the necessary action. At every Labour Congress in the Old Country child labour is discussed, as it was in the early stages of our movement in Australia. The unions, whenever they have had the power, have regulated child labour, and the conditions of work generally, and they recognise that it is necessary to have behind them the power of the law. From this idea has sprung the agitation for that political unionism to which our friends opposite are so bitterly opposed.  unions charge high fees for admission to membership ? Mr HANNAN/ - I am sorry the honourable member was not in the chamber when I replied to his stupid statement made to-night in that connection. It is monstrous that an honourable member should here state that a wharf labourer, who is looking for employment, has to pay an entrance fee of £50 to join a union.  able member for Boothby.",91
518,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Boothby said nothing of the kind. The honourable member for Echuca went on to say that workmen at Port Adelaide had paid hundreds of pounds to obtain the conditions under which they work today, whereas the fact is that it was the union, and not the men individually, who paid. When the men in the rural industries have subscribed an amount equal to that subscribed by the waterside workers, they will obtain much better conditions than they have today. It is not any wonder that our friends opposite object to the rural workers obtaining any rights or privileges, seeing that the representatives of their party in the Stat© Houses have always worked against any effective legislation with that end in view. An instance of this was given in the early history of this Parliament, when rural workers were expressly excluded from the benefits of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. There is a great cry today for immigration, with no ready response from the Old Country. The reason is found in the fact that many men who have come here are bitterly disappointed with the conditions of employment in the country, and they so tell their friends in the letters they write home. ",91
519,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member must know that, except for the shearing, decent men cannot be induced to go to the country to work. When the Wages Board system was becoming somewhat effective in Victoria, there was an agitation for country Wages Boards, so that lower rates might be fixed for employment outside the cities. Honourable members are opposed to trade unionism, and the honourable member for Echuca has at all times been a bitter opponent of the system in every shape and form.  correct, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",92

522,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is customary to withdraw a statement that is regarded as objectionable by an honourable member.,92
523,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I withdraw the statement, but the honourable member for Echuca when speaking said he was bitterly opposed to political unionism, and as I have always been a wholehearted supporter of that policy, I have as much right as he has to feel resentment. Honourable members opposite are opposed to political trade unionism, because they know that if the Labour movement progresses as it has in the past it means the wiping out practically of their political party. In the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provision is made for preference to unionists, but there is no provision for extending preference so far as the Publio Service is concerned. Even under the law as it stands there is a certain form of preference to the non-unionist and to the unfair employer, because only the employer of unionists can be cited to the Court, and only members of a trade union can legally claim the rates fixed in an award.",92

526,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Melbourne) [12.31 a.m.] - The Bill, the second reading of which we are now engaged in discussing, has been described by the most powerful newspaper that we have as trumpery, and of little importance. It is stated that a gentleman who has recently come from the Home Land to take up the duties of a high position, could not possibly be induced to grant a dissolution of both Houses of the Parliament upon the rejection by the Senate of such a measure. That may appear to be harsh criticism, and it may be wondered why we are opposing the measure. But behind the Bill is the deadly intent of the second-in-command in this Ministry, the Attorney-General. Ten years ago he was engaged in an almost similar cause. I venture to prophesy that, should this measure be carried through both Houses, it will, ten years hence, be ""bumped out"" as severely as another measure passed at his instigation was ""bumped out"" by the Victorian Parliament. I have before me a cutting from the Review of Reviews, copying a Bulletin cartoon, which depicts in an artistic manner which you, Mr. Speaker, would appreciate, a figure, covered with tar and feathers being borne on the shoulders of a man representing the Legislative Council, and of the late Sir Thomas Bent, representing the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. Sir Thomas Bent is made to say, "" We are removing our old frieud Irvine oft the premises for good."" Then follows this letterpressBoth Houses of the Victorian Parliament have passed the Separate Representation Repeal Bill. . . . This practically abolishes the last of Irvine's legislation. The cartoon was among the best that has been done by that splendid black-andwhite artist who signs himself "" H o p , "" and the occurrence reminds one of the f u t i l it y of the legislation which was repealed. The .union of railway employees - in Victoria is today ten times stronger than it was ten years ago. should it not be? The highest economic authorities in the world are of the opinion that men must combine for the preservation and advancement of their interests. I am about to quote now a passage that I quoted in that terrible time, ten years ago, when our present Attorney-General, who was then Premier, Attorney-General, and Sc-licitor-General of Victoria, would not listen to the men. But Professor J . Ashley, of the Harvard University, writing on the railroad strike of 1894, i u quoting perhaps greatest mind, in some regards, that England has ever produced, John Stuart Mill, saysIt is the opinion of almost every economist of repute, of whatever school, that Labour combinations, with a power to appeal in the last resort to the joint refusal to work, i.e., to Strike, are, under the present system of competition, the indispensable means of enabling the sellers of labour to take care of their own interests - (J. S. Mill, Principles of Political Economy, book V., chap, x., second half.) With these words of Mill may be compared the language of Fawcett, Walker, and Marshall. These are not writers particularly sympathetic towards trade union policy, or particularly hopeful of good results from such action. They merely state that, even though, in very many cases, strikes may have been unwise, the right to strike is in itself a necessary safeguard of working men's interests. In the Victorian era the trade unionists had to practise secrecy in their attempts than to benefit themselves. In one case, three men asked for an increase of wages when they were getting a little over 7s. 6d., headed men and were transported for a term of seven years; but the term was shortened cause of the indignation expressed by { niblic, and after two years they were eased.",92
527,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There should quorum. [Quorum formed.-\,93
528,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I propose to give all another quotation, but before doing",93
529,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that a quorum is not present. [Quorum formed.]",93
530,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Honourable members are aware that Mr Ford, the American employer, has given a large sum of money, some «ay £4,000,000, and others £2,000,000, to his workers, and itmay be thought that he is opposed totrades unionism. As he is paying a - minimum wage of £ 1 a day, I do not blame the workers for not pressing matters. But every man working for him, I am And why credibly informed, is a contributor tounion funds, knowing that it is only by the strength given by association that they can keep up their wages. I might, tell the Prime Minister that I dislike the work in which I am now engaged as much, as I believe he used to dislike it when on. this side. But one must play the game. I have before me a picture - showing him as the hero of the piece in connection with a parliamentary struggle of some year* ago. A stone is shown inscribed ' ' To the the memory of the martyred members wholost their sleep-the word ' lives ' iscrossed out-in the glorious stone-wall of 1905."" Below is printed"" I know not what 'twas for,"" quoth he, "" But 'twas a famous victory."" The Prime Minister will appreciate the humour of the picture, with the memorial pile of Hansards that is shown. I labourunder a disadvantage by which he was not then handicapped, inasmuch as I cannot speak for more than sixty-five minutes-thoug h for that I am not ungrateful j he and those assisting him had no l i m it placed on their speaking time. Another quotation I wish to read is reported to have saidFor ten years I made as desperate a fight against organized labour as was ever made by mortal man. It cost me considerably more1,000,000 dollars to learn that there is nolabour so skilled, so intelligent, so faithful, asthat which is governed by an organization whose officials are well-balanced, levelI now employ no debut organized labour, and never, have the least, trouble, each believing that the one has no beright to oppress the other. the Thoughts crystallized, perhaps, by therepoet and handed down, bear f r u it , and frequently these seeds of truth blossom be a for t h and benefit the world. We know that in the past the workers were first of crucified, and, later, hanged for the only ciime of being poor. We know that the beggars were branded on the cheek,. and were hanged for the third offence. We know the old prayer called the beggars' prayer, "" From Hell, Hull, and Halifax, Good Lord deliver us."" having work to go to through lack of combination, the workers had to beg or steal, and they were punished when convicted of either offence. There would be no Labour party today had it not been for trade unions, and this Bill today, which attacks them, is such a trumpery affair that even its father would look back upon it - with as much pride as he feels for two infamous Bills he passed in the Victorian Legislature that have now been relegated to the limbo of oblivion. No other Bills were repealed with such unanimity. Gladstone once said that the principle of Liberalism was trust in the people qualified by prudence, and that the principle of Conservatism was mistrust of the people qualified by fear. I hold that the principle of the Labour party is trust in the people all the time. Therefore I hope that this Bill will not be allowed to go on the statute-book until it has been voted upon by a referendum. The honourable member for Gippsland, if he is true to the ideals of the initiative and referendum, will support me if an amendment is brought down with that object in view.",93
531,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You r party are doing their best to stave off the initiative and referendum.,94
532,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill before us has one purpose, and that is to twist matters so that there will be a double dissoluall tion. I do not blame the Government. Their party went out of the Senate fourteen strong, and returned reduced by 50 per cent. They have everything to gain; they may win, but if they do not bring in the initiative and referendum the finger will be pointed unerringly at them, that they fear to trust the people, and they will have applied to them the description that Gladstone applied to the Conservatives. I spoke of the Victorian Statutes that were sent to the limbo of oblivion, though they were enacted by a Ministry supported by the strongest majority I know of in modern times, and were intended to crush trade unionism. At the time the men pleaded with the head of the Government to have the dispute arbitrated upon by any Judge of the Supreme Court he cared to name, though they knew that Judges were culled from the.ranks of those who were not workers. I do not know of any Judge who has sprung from Not the workers. The Attorney-General should be one of the very first to believe that unionism benefits the welfare of the community. No crime in the code punishable by imprisonment could have been condemned in more scathing terms than those in which the Age and the Argus of the 5th December, 1891, spoke regarding the constitution of the proposed Bar those Association. I have accused the At torney-General of belonging to an unregistered, illegal union formed to defy and destroy the Legal Practitioners' Practice Act, and I consider that it was his duty, as an honourable man, when he was Premier of Victoria, and with a powerful majority behind him, to have torn the Act from the statute-book if he considered it wrong. This measure, unfortunately, contained no penalties, otherwise had he, as chairman of an unregistered illegal union, continued doing what he is doing today, defying an Act of Parliament which he was sworn as Minister to carry out, he would have been haled before a Court, and the Barristers Union would not have been allowed to carry on as it has. Here are some remarks that the honourable member has madeOne thing felt by everybody in all parts of the world was an appreciation of liberty, and everybody should have the benefit of being able to stand equal to others in the law. Equal to others in the law in Victoria of places, where, as everybody knows, money commands the best brains, and, unfortunately, the best brains will always take the retaining fees! To quote the Bible is rather dangerous, but the Attorney-General quoted from Revelations the description of the beast of the ApocalypseAnd it had power to cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. "" B y a strange coincidence,"" said the Attorney-General, "" the number of the beast was 666."" It is an astonishing thing that the letters in the name of the Attorney-General give the same result. William has seven letters-on e too many; Henry has five, hut if you add the extra letter from William you get six; and Irvine, of course, counts six. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Where did you get Henry from?",94
533,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am sorry if I have made a mistake. What is the honourable gentleman's second name?,95
534,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Hill .,95
535,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Well, evidently there are only seventeen letters in the name instead of eighteen, as I thought, so the honours will remain with the honourable gentleman. I desire to quote from the Age newspaper Mr FAT.KINER - I thought you were going to quote Scripture.",95

537,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think we are entitled to a quorum. [Quorum formed.],95
538,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The argument used against trade unionists is that they do not allow others to join the union, and charge a big entrance fee. Those statements, of course, are absurd, and I challenge any honourable member to go amongst the largest contractors who are erecting buildings round Melbourne, and ask them if they want any men but unionists, or if they want any man from Packer's union. Let them ask David Mitchell if he would employ any more men such as he had from Packer.",95
539,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He should have been prosecuted.,95
540,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That gentleman left the party I belong to, but he won his spurs with the other party, and I regret that any man should fall through a vaulting ambition. However, reverting to statement that trade unionists prevent do with this matter. other men from earning a livelihood, I would like to ask what the Attorneyquotation from the AgeGeneral does? Will he even meet in Court the honourable member for Angas, that than whom no man is held in more kindly regard by every member in this House, and who, when he joined a former Ministry, opposite was cheered by members of both sides of the House? If the Attorney-General dared to meet his colleague, the honourable - action."" member for Angas, except on a constituI tional question, he would break the rules of the Barristers Union. The Age, of office. the 10th September, 1913, speaking of the Attorney-General, saidThe offence charged against the Ministry :s that it has collectively violated its public obligations, owing to Mr Irvine having declined to> relinquish a ""general retainer"" from the Marconi Company, now in litigation with the Commonwealth. Labour claims that the Attorney-General's first duty should be to the country that pays him. No matter whether it be the Beef Trust, the Kerosene Trust, the Sugar Trust, or any other combine, such a body has only to brief the Attorney-General and his lips are silent, and his brain must not give assistance to his country.",95
541,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think the honourable member is introducing matters that are not relevant to the Bill.,95
542,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am showing that the honourable member is a member of an illegal union, formed for the purpose of defying an Act of the State of Victoria, in which he resides, and which he has sworn, as a Minister, to carry into effect. I am quoting from the Age newspaper to show that the Attorney-General will not meet certain other men in his own profession, and so, applying the argument that had been used by honourable members opposite in regard to the attitude of unionists towards non-unionists, is depriving those other men of their living.",95
543,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do you not think that retainer was a preference?,95
544,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,All retainers should cease as soon as a man accepts the honourable position of Attorney-General.,95
545,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Ye t you object to the Marconi Company having a preferent right to the Attorney-General's services.,95
546,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I fail to the see what the Marconi Company has to,95
547,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Le t me continue my The significance of this is clear. It means Mr Irvine can always be prevented from acting for the Commonwealth-althoug h he is Attorney-General-in any suit in which the party should be a person or corporation, from whom he has accepted "" a general retainer""; for such a party would only need to give Mr Irvine a brief to put him "" out of have known Attorneys-General who gave up everything as soon as they took",95
548,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think the honourable member is out of order in these utterances. I am unable to connect them with the matter before the House.,96

550,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The reference to trade unions is in order, but I think the honourable member is going rather too far in stressing the question of the Attorney-General's retainer.",96
551,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What I wanted to show was that the Attorney-General will not meet a solicitor, who is honourably carrying out the law which does not allow a man to be merely a barrister or merely a solicitor. However, I will pass along. I have to again thank the Age newspaper, because in its splendid articles it has shown clearly how illogical, unjust, and wrong was the action of the Attorney-General. Even a Judge of the High Court Bench, whom an honourable member has insulted more than any other Judge in this country, but who, I think, is a just Judge, fel l into a mistake, and the Age showed clearly that in section 10- , "" The Legislature had given to members of the Bar exclusive right to practise in the Courts, and the Bar should do its best to command the confidence of the Legislature and the public."" Mr Morley feebly objected that "" there is nothing to compel counsel to charge in every case in which he appears."" But his Honour was inexorable.

553,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"To prevent him from earning his livelihood because he was man enough to go into the Court and refuse a big fee. . Then the Age continuedSuch persons might point out that the Victorian Parliament passed a law some years ago with the avowed object of amalgamating the two branches of the legal profession; that this law abrogated the exclusive right to "" members of the Bar"" to practise in the Courts, and that it sought to simplify procedure and to reduce the expenses of litigants by permitting solicitors to practise in the Courts as well as barristers. The law, in fact, made every solicitor a barrister, and its central intention was, in opening the Courts to solicitors, to abolish the necessity of either making or marking briefs, by allowing any solicitor who pleased both to prepare the case in his office, and to plead it in the Courts. Judge Hodges was wrong, and the A g « further statedIt shows how successful the legal profession has been in setting the will of Parliament at nought, and in keeping the people in helpless subjection to the Bill of Costs. I have accused the honourable member of being a man who is guilty of keeping up that nefarious practice against the law, of the country. It has been said that when the drum throbs alarm, and the trumpet gives its clarion note, none but the base remain behind and neglect the defence of their country. And what do we think of those craven creatures who skulk below in cellars in the hour of need, and come for t h in the hour of victory to reap all the benefits? The position of such men is exactly the position of those who will not help the unions to up lift themselves and to benefit humanity, but take all the benefits other men have won. The advancement of the world is merely the history of unionism. It is within the memory of living men that, in England, not more than three men could meet together without being liable to deportation. * Mr JENSEN - I draw attention to the state of the House.

554,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill is avowedly introduced by the Government to overawe the Senate and twist a portion of the Constitution to secure a double dissolution, on the gambler's chance that they cannot lose, aud may possibly win a few more than seven seats in another place. If I were in their position, I would have the same desire; but I think I would introduce a more important measure to gain my ends. The progress of the Labour movement in Australia is simply wonderf u l . There are 157 Labour members in the State Assemblies, as against 190 on the other side. Adding the Senate and the House of Representatives, we have 223 Labour members, as against 235 on the other side. Seeing that in 1890 there was not a single Labour member, the advance has been marvellous. The number increased in Victoria from four in 1891 to twenty in 1914; in Queensland, fro m none in 1891 to twenty-four in 1914; in South Australia, from none in 1891 to sixteen in 1914; in Western Australia, from none in 1900 to thirty-three in 1914; and in Tasmania, from none in 1902 to fifteen this year. I have not counted the Upper Houses, but if a referendum of the people were taken, those Houses of fossils would be all swept into Including Labour members in the Legislative Councils, there are altogether 248 Labour members in Australia against none in 1890.

If I thought the Bill would destroy unionism in any way, I organized should be prepared to go to any lengths to defeat it .

Mr . twice, Benjamin, once a councillor in North voting Melbourne, and now in a big way in cities. America, has sent to this country full particulars of the operations of the The American Meat Trust. To show how America, they are operating in Australia, I was told by two farmers at a place at which I stopped in Brisbane that the trust are securing a four years' supply of meat by bribing every farmer to keep his calves for them. Every farmer who has a cow in calf can get a sovereign, which he can of trade keep even if the calf dies; but if the calf 'lives it must be delivered in four years' time at the full market price. The Government should stop the export of ewe lambs, for no one who wants to see this country well stocked with sheep would allow a single ewe lamb to be destroyed. They are being exported, in thousands. Under a Liberal Ministry in South Auscommunity tralia the hated name of Armour is In South branded on the meat that is exported voters from the Government Department. If the Government of the Commonwealth In honestly want to do something of a remedial character, let them give to the exposure people the referendum and the initiative, and afford to them the opportunity to emstatute-book. power this Parliament to control and dethat stroy trusts and combines. The Emperor Napoleon, with that prescience which distinguished his great brain, made it impossible for combines to exist as they exist here today. Section 419 of the Code Napoleon, which he made in 1810, readsand All those who by deliberately spreading abroad false or slanderous facts, by offering a higher price than that asked by the various in Mel- vendors themselves, by association or coalition, anything between the principal holders of the same merchandise or foodstuffs, whether with the view to'withholding them from sale or with a view to selling them only at a certain price, and all union those who by any fraudulent means shall effect a rise or diminution in the price of foodstuffs, or in the sale of .public securities, .above or 'below the price determined by free and natural commercial competition, shall be punished by an imprisonment of one month to one year, and by a fine of from 500 to 1,000 francs. Not a fine or imprisonment, but both fine and imprisonment. Section 420 readsThe penalty for - the foregoing shall be an imprisonment of from two months to two years, and a fine of from 1,000 to 20,000 francs, if .these manoeuvres have been practised on grain, flour, bread, wine, or any other drink. W it h his great brain' Napoleon was able to foresee the present position 100 years ago. Yet the Government of the Commonwealth are playing with fire by bringing in a measure for which no words of mine can express sufficient contempt. A Liberal Minister in Queensland, Mr . White, has expressed the wish that meat will get dearer and .dearer. The honourable member for Franklin, when he recollects that the number of stock is decreasing in the various States, and is less this year than it has been in preceding years, will surely agree that a law like the one in Russia today, that no cows shall be destroyed for meat, would add to our herds. In fact, in some of the dairying districts in Siberia they have gone so far that they will not allow a calf to be destroyed, ana provide that it must be allowed two of the mother's teats to get natural fluid.",96

Labour has acknowledged that without trade unionism the world would not be as civilized as it is, and that men and women would not be able to stand up.

560,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Bass) [1.35 a.m] -^This Bill to prohibit preference to unionists casually employed by the Commonwealth has been practically brought about by an act of the Fisher Administration. I contend that they were only meting out justice to citizens who were prepared to fight for the interests of themselves, their wives, and their children, and in the interests of peace and good will to everybody in the community. Lot us glance at the conditions which existed in Australia a few years ago. What caused the creation of trade unions? There must have been some reason for their formation. The men and the women who have contributed to the unions have a right to some sort of recognition from the people and the Parliament for bringing about better conditions. I intend to confine my remarks chiefly to Tasmania, as I am well acquainted with its indust r i a l conditions. Many years ago its workers were livin g - under most terrible and monstrous conditions, brought about and insisted upon by the capitalists. I hope that you, sir, will bear with me while I read certain evidence taken by a Royal Commission, which was appointed in 1906 to inquire into the conditions of the wage-earners. Prior to that year, there were not three recognised trade or labour ""unions in the State, and it was because of that fact that deplorable conditions existed there. It was not u n t i l some Labour men were returned to the House of Assembly that the conditions of the workers were denounced. I was a member of the Assembly for nearly eight years. In 1903 four Labour men were returned, including myself and the honourable member for Illawarra. We made it our business to attack the Government of the day because of the terrible conditions that confronted almost every wage earner. We made certain statements which we verified. We kept hammering away in this direction from 1903 to 1906, when we were granted a Royal Commission to inquire into the industrial conditions. I. think, sir, that after this explanation you will bear with me while I read its report. It was the terrible treatment which was meted out to unfortunate people who could not help themselves that brought about the formation of trade and labour unions in Tasmania. The members of the Australian Labour party would not be worth their salt if they did not stand up here and speak on behalf of trade unionists. What is the object of the Bill before the House? It is simply designed to try to create an artificial dead-lock, to try to wrest from the Labour party the representation that we have in the Senate. The Government are not bothering a bit about this House, because they have possession of it. By this anti-preference Bill they are attempting to bring about an election in order to get control of another place. They are not troubling about preference at all; their only motive is to try to get charge of the Senate. I challenge any honourable member on the other side to say that that is not the motive. Our opponents know in their hearts that the preference granted to casual labourers by the Fisher Administration does not affect the position of Australia one iota. It has nothing to do with the financial position, and it has nothing to do practically with the industrial position. This Bill has been introduced with the desire to secure something which was never intended by the framers of the Constitution. The Prime Minister has admitted that the Bill has been brought in for a specific purpose, and that being so, we on this side are quite justified in putting up a fight against its passage. If the Labour party were opposing some great financial scheme introduced by the Government, and absolutely necessary to the advancement of Australia, I could understand the attitude of honourable members opposite; but no one can say that this Bill is of any importance, or will serve any good purpose. The Government complain because preference has been given to unionists in Government employment. Are not the unionists enMr Jensen. titled to some recognition? They have brought about better conditions for themselves, as well as for those who do not belong to a union, and they are entitled to some recognition at the hands of the Government of the Commonwealth. This Parliament has passed a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, giving power to the President of the Court to grant preference to trade unionists under certain conditions; and surely it is not wrong for a Ministry to observe a principle which it has enforced upon others! Our opponents urge that the Labour Government appointed men to certain positions in the Commonwealth Service in return for political support. I understand, however, that the unionists who did receive preference, other things being equal, were not known personally to any member of the Ministry. They had not met them, nor had they even heard of them before. The principle of preference to unionists was one that we had long advocated, and for which we had fought, so that it was the duty of the Labour Government to put it into operation. I make no apology for it ; I never have, and never shall, so that the prospect of an appeal to the people on such an issue does not frighten me. I have spoken in support of the principle many times in the course of an election campaign, and shall not hesitate to do so again. Trade unions improve the lot of the workers, and make for industrial peace. That being so, their members, other things being equal, ought to be entitled to preference. I propose to make some quotations from a report presented to the Tasmanian Parliament by the Royal Commission on Wages and Wage Earners in that State, which was appointed by the Evans Administration in 1906. Members of the State Government had practically declined to accept statements made by members of the Labour party in the State Parliament concerning the position of the workers in many callings, and it was only because of our repeated requests for an inquiry that the Royal Commission was eventually appointed. It discovered that the conditions of the workers in Tasmania were in many instances revolting, and that some of the blue-blooded aristocrats, Conservatives, and financial magnates, who were looked upon as the ladies and gentlemen of the State, and who occupied high places in society, were implicated. The report of the Commission, and the evidence taken before it, was such that the Government refused to allow it to be placed on the table unless the names of the persons who were mentioned as having treated their employees very badly were deleted. There had been no trade unions to fight for the rights of the workers, and these aristocrats-thes e society people who appeared in so unfavorable a light-receive d the protection of the Premier of the State, who determined that their names should not be made' public. For many days in the House of Assembly points of order were raised, and the question of whether or not the names of the employers should be deleted from the report was discussed at length. The question finally went to a vote, and every member of the State House outside the Labour party voted for the deletion of the names before the report, together with the evidence, was laid on the table and printed. The motion was carried, and so the good old employers won. I was a member of the State House of Assembly at the time, so that I know of what I am talking. I shall ask honourable members opposite whether, after listening to the quotations which I shall make from the report, they do not think it reasonable that, other things being equal, preference should be given to those who contribute to the funds of a union to secure better conditions, not only for themselves, but for those who work alongside of them, whether unionists or non-unionists?",98
561,Colonel RYRIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Rea d the whole report. Mr JENSEN"" - I should like to be able to do so. It would occupy at least dered three hours.",100
562,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do not give us eight three hours of it.,100
563,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable mem20s. ber for Franklin, with whom I am on best of terms, will admit that what I have said concerning this report, and the circumstances leading up to the appointment of the Commission, is absolutely correct. The Commission consisted of three members. The chairman was Mr Christopher O'Reilly, M.H.A., who sat on the cross benches, and neither associated himself with the Labour party nor the Government of the day; the second member was a strong Government supporter, whilst the third was Senator Long, a member of the Labour party. Two members of the Commission were not associated with Labour, so that it cannot be said that it was prejudiced in favour of Labour. It travelled over Tasmania, taking evidence concerning practically every trade and calling in the State. It visited the two chief cities, Hobart'and Launceston, and I think that Hobart came out of the investigation less favourably than did the Northern city. The Commission reported in relation to biscuit factories as follows: There were two biscuit factories visited iii Hobart, and from the pay-sheets it was found that the wages for biscuit makers and cake makers and pastry cooks varied from 30s. per week to £2 10s.; the next branch, lis. to 30s.; and juniors from 5s. to 15s. The men worked fifty-three hours weekly. A shop is opened in conjunction with one of the establishments, the female employees in which work on an average fifty-three hours weekly, their pay ranging from 8s. to 12s. per week; they are also allowed 9 meals during the week. The clerks (females) work fifty-one hours, and receive 15s. and 16s. per week, and seven meals weekly. A male clerk, with four and a half years' service in the other establishment, is paid 25s. weekly for forty-seven hours' work per week. Holidays are allowed and paid for in one factory; but the employees lose time if they fire away sick. In the other establishment the evidence as regards payment for any holidays and sickness is conflicting. At Launceston, the Commission visited one factory, and found that, in addition to the foreman, there are assistants, whose wages are 14s. and 32s. 6d., whilst boys are paid 6s. to 8s. per week. Several girls, employed as packers, receive 6s. to 10s. per week, and the forewoman £1 Is. The juniors commence at 5s. and 6s. per week. The females work 47} hours, and the males 50} hours per week. Sick leave and holidays ore both paid for. The clerk is in receipt of £2 per week. In this industry we find the following rates of payment made to the undermentioned employees are inadequate for the services ren:-Clerk , aged 25 years, 4} years' service, 25s. per week; biscuit baker, aged 22 years, years' service, 30s. per week; general hand, aged 26 years, two years' service, lis . per week; packer, aged 22, in his fifth year of service, a week; general hand, almost 18, just cn the three years' service, 9s. per week. There was no system under which these persons could better their conditions. There was nobody to talk unionism to them. In those days if any man or woman had dared to talk trade unionism in Hobart his presence would not have been wanted. The Commission reportedIn the boot-making trade we find the rates of payment made to several of those employed are very low, a finisher with eight years' experience receiving only 22s. 6d. per week, whilst a bootmaker engaged on children's boots receives 24s. Gd. per week; putter-up, nine years' experience, 30s. per week; bootmaker, twelve years at the trade, 32s. 6d.; another, thirteen years at the trade, 29s. A packer, 28 years of age, receives 22s. 6d. per week. Female machinists, two years' experience, 4s. per aged 19 years. f a n c y young women in the State of Tascharacter. mania in 19QjS with two years of service receiving only 4s. per week. The report continuesFour years at the trade, 9s. a week, age 20. Piece-work prices are as follow :-Ki p shooties, Is. 3d.; Boston, Is. 4d.; watertights, Is. light work, Is. 3d.; youths' kip and lace, boys' kip and lace, 9Jd. I come now to the Government contract for clothing. I learn from the report thatA female operative that was who was employed in the manufacture of clothing by the Government contractor, is paid the following rates for the various classes ments she turns out:-Trousers , of a bluey material, 7i<3. per pair; cadet 9d. per pair.",100

We are carrying on our debates in a peaceful manner, Parwhen we read in the Argus that Mr . soWatt has described this Parliament as think "" a venomous debating society."" Perbar sonally, I think that it is a mutual made admiration society. The one disturbing honourable element in this chamber is the Prime Minister, who is occasionally supported that by a cynical remark from the Attorneyf o r General.

574,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I rise to a point of order. I submit that the honourable member for of Capricornia has concluded his speech.,101
575,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"B y way of personal exa planation, I wish to say that as the honhe orable member for Bass desires to make a few further remarks, I will treat Mr . or Watt's observations with contempt.",101
576,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When the point of privilege was. raised by the honourable member for Capricornia, I was dealing with the Government clothing contract in Tasmania, and was endeavouring to show that in the old days the employers and Government of that State were prepared to grant a preference to those who were being sweated. I had been illustrating some of the conditions which prevailed there. The females engaged on the Government clothing contracts in Tasmania averaged a wage of only from 10s. to l is . per week. In one of the workrooms girls were taken on as learners and worked up to six months without pay. That is an admission which has been extracted from the employers in Tasmania. Some of these girls have made clothing which has been worn by the Commonwealth public servants in that State, including postal employees and cadets. Girls have been sweated by these financial monsters. What has the Prime Minister to say about that? What has he to say about employers granting a preference, when these persons were being sweated? As to the corporation employ6s in Hobart, the Commission found that the wages paid were very low, ranging from 5s. to 5s. 3d., 5s. 6d., and 5s. 9d. per day, which, in the opinion of the Commission, were insufficient to decently house and maintain a family. This was a Commission created by the Evans Conservative Government in 1906-'?, and on that Commission there was only one Labour member as compared with two members from the opposite side. It was such conditions as those that gave rise to trade unionism; and surely those men who brought about the improvements that we see are entitled to some recognition and consideration at the hands of employers, even though the employers be a Government or Ministers of the Crown. The report goes on to say that the low rate at which the Hobart corporation contracts were let rendered it impossible for the contractors, who received 6s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per day for horse, cart, and driver, to pay a fair wage to those engaged as drivers. The married men with families, we are told, received from 20s. to 23s. a week. This was in the good old days when there was no Labour party; and these are the conditions to which honourable members opposite would like to return. The Bill we are now discussing has two objects, one to create an artificial dead-lock, and the other to drive a stiletto in the back of every trade unionist.",102
577,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I thought the Bill was the "" shadow of a sham ?""",102
578,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And so it is, so far as concerns the pretences which honourable members opposite lay before their supporters.",102
579,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But it is a stiletto in regard to honourable members of the Opposition?,102
580,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is no doubt that if the Bill could be used as a stiletto it would be so used. The report of the Commission goes on to say that in Launceston there were five establishments visited at which dressmaking was an adjunct of the business; that in one it was found that apprentices were paid 2s. 6d. a week at the beginning of the employment, and that in others the period of service for which no payment was made varied from a fortnight to six months. I suppose that the employers, at the end of the six months, dismissed the girls who had been working for nothing, and took on others on the same terms. This was good old freedom of contract-goo d old preference! I take it that if ever preference is given and insisted on, it is by the sweater, who extracts labour for nothing out of his neighbour's children. It is terrible to think that such conditions could exist in beautiful Australia. We hear our country described as the richest and best known, capable of producing almost anything of use to man, and yet in our midst there are the conditions which have made trade unionism necessary for the protection of the people. At the present time there is a Conciliation and Arbitration Act passed by this very Parliament, under which a Judge has the right to grant preference to unionists; and it is, indeed, hard to see why a Minister of the Crown should not mete out the same justice to Government employees. If it is right to give preference in the case of private employment, it is right in the case of Government employment; if it is wrong to give preference to Government employees, it must be wrong to give it to private employees. If preference makes for peace and goodwill in the one instance, it must make for peace and goodwill in the other. In regard to the flour-milling industry in Tasmania, the report of the Commission states that the system of dividing the twenty-four hours into two shifts of twelve for engine-drivers appeared unnecessary and objectionable, considering the nature and responsibility of the work, and the Commissioners expressed the opinion that there should be three shifts of eight hours.",102
581,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am afraid the honourable member is going beyond what can be allowed in this debate.,103
582,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am endeavouring to point out that, because of the terrible conditions that prevailed",103
583,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not think that the debate all night has been anywhere near the subject.,103
584,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have referred in my argument to the employment of casual labourers by the Commonwealth Government, and have contended that, in view of the preference that may be given under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it is only right that preference should be given by the Government. At present I am describing such conditions as gave rise to trade unionism; and, of course, if were no trade unionism there would be no necessity for preference. We contend that trade unionists are entitled to some recognition because of the better conditions they have been instrumental in bringing about, and for their services in establishing peace instead of strife, deadlocks, degradation, starvation, and misery. Surely organizations with such objects are entitled to recognition. We do not believe that this Bill is a proper one for the Government to introduce, and surely I have a right to show the justification for trade unionism, and the reason why trade unionists are entitled to preference?",103
585,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member will be in order in doing that.,103
586,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We are told in the report of the Royal Commission that the conditions prevailing in regard to employment on river steamers in Tasmania were something awful.,103
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As a point of order, I should like to know what employment on river steamers in any State has to do with Federal Government employment, with which this Bill deals. I submit that all this discussion on trade unionism in general has nothing to do with the Bill ; and, in my opinion, the whole debate, to which we have listened throughout this dreary day, has been altogether away from the subject. It is time that speakers were confined to the question whether preference shall be given in Government employment, for everything outside that is, I hold, entirely out' of order.",103
588,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Honourable membersclaim that they used arguments of the kind in order to show that trade unionists, because of the position they have won in the industrial world, should receive consideration in the way of preference in Government employment. As to the river steamers, I understood the honourable member for Bass to say that he proposed to show what was done in connection with employment on them; and as there are, I believe, steamers already owned by the Commonwealth, on which people are, and others may be employed, his remarks have some relation to the question before the. House.",103
589,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall quote no more from the report of the Royal Commission, but reserve that phase of the question there until some other time, when, perhaps, I shall be a little more in order. At the same time, I submit that every quotation I made from the report led up to trade unionism and preference to unionists.'",103
590,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must clearly understand that the mere leading up to trade unionism and preference to unionists is not sufficient; his remarks must have relation to preference in the Government Service.,103
591,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is charged against the Labour ex-Ministers that they determined that when a number of men applied for casual employment, and there was not room for all of them, preference should be given by the officers in charge of the works to unionists, other things being equal. That is to say, after all the usual tests had been applied to applicants to ascertain experience, skill, whether married or single, the number of dependents, and so on, and there was no other remaining method of ascertaining which among equal applicants were best entitled to the job, membership in a union of his calling should be a reason for giving a man preference. Seeing that the Commonwealth Arbitration law, which was passed by the Reid-MCLean Government, is based on a complete recognition of unionism, and embodies the principle of preference to unionists, and that that law takes no cognisance of persons who are not unionists, it would be difficult to imagine the Federal authorities flouting the spirit of the Statute by giving preference to an applicant because he was a non-unionist. Without entering into the question of the propriety of His Majesty's Ministers taking upon themselves the granting of preference to unionists or non-unionists without a special Act of Parliament authorizing them to do so, there can be no doubt that the general principle of preference to trade unionists is sound. Arbitration can be effective only when dealing with organizations, and it is therefore in the interests of industrial peace that encouragement should be given to the formation of unions. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, speaking in this Chamber in 1911, saidPreference to industrial unionists is provided for in our legislation to encourage the formation of unions for the purpose of bringing about industrial peace. It is recognised in the Statute that the existence of men outside such organizations makes the securing of industrial peace by a Court more difficult. The law provides, other things being equal, that preference shall be given to the members of industrial organizations registered under the Act.",103
592,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,""" May be given.""",104
593,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Minister said "" shall."" Mr Deakin, in introducing the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in 1904, saidThe issues ns we put them are : Preference ? Yes! Unionism t Yes! Encouragement to unionism besides preference ? Yes ! For what purpose ? For the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. The Right Honourable Sir George Reid has said that "" trade unions are the evolution of intelligence,"" and, speaking recently at a great gathering in London, he saidWhen he was politically opposed to the Labour party in Australia he was, nevertheless, compelled to recognise its character, intelligence, and public spirit. Some people are so accustomed to see capitalists combine to fight for their own interests that they are unable to reconcile a similar development on the part of the workers. His Lordship Bishop Mercer, speaking in Tasmania on the 28th July of last year, said thatHe was an ardent trade unionist. He was one right down to the ground. There was a lot of talk about union tyranny, but it could not be taken much notice of. He looked at it in this light: that while they had the same conflicting forces as at present there would he strife. The workers were bound to do things in a wholesale way until they got what they deserved, and recognition of their rights. He did not look upon the present system as the ultimate way or arriving at the value of services. The trade unionists were bound to continue, in spite of temporary injustice, until they were able to bring delicacy of manipulation into the organizations. Bishop Mercer recognises the good qualities of trade unionism.",104
594,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is there anything about trade unionism in the Bill ?,104
595,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I should like to know what it is that the Government is striking at, if not trade unionism?",104
596,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I , too, should like to know that. This party has been charged with having given preference to unionists. The unions, we have been told, are our supporters; and if this is not a Bill to put an end to preference to unionists, I do not know what it means. The Prime Minister says that he is not attacking the unions, but I say that he is. He is striking at the root and foundation of unionism. Both he and the Attorney General know that. Eor him to suggest that he is not endeavouring to interfere with unionism is to put a false position before the people.",104
597,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Look at the Bill .,104
598,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I know what is in the Bill . It has been drafted by the legal minds on the Government side, and M in isters are endeavouring to stifle debate upon it . But you, Mr Speaker, recognise what it is hitting at, and have allowed reasonable debate. If the Prime Minister will say on the public platform that the Bill has no application to unions, we shall understand him better; but when he meets farmers, squatters, and employers generally, he sings a different tune. He has accused us of being supported by unionists, and of giving preference to our supporters.",104
599,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member's time has expired.,104
600,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have only to add that it is unthinkable that the Bill should be allowed to bring about a dead-lock, or that it will cause His Excellency the Governor General to interfere under our beautiful, great and grand Constitution.",104
601,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"East Sydney) [2.41 a.m.]. - The last speaker has referred to the sufferings of employees in Tasmania through want of organization. Although some of the statements made are startling, and reveal conditions that are not to be expected in a civilized community, honourable members on this side know that they are as nothing compared with what could be said about the position of labour in older parts of the world. Some of us are well acquainted with the conditions of those employed in various industries in Great Britain. We know what both men and women have had .to undergo in the iron works and coal-mines of that country. It is hardly to be wondered at that we are using every means to block this Bill.",104
602,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I call attention to the State of the House. [Quorum formed.],105
603,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is not so much the Bill itself that concerns me, but it is what derlies it-the ulterior motives of honourable members opposite",105
604,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in imputing unworthy motives to other honourable members.,105
605,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"At any rate, there are reasons other than appear on the surface for the introduction of the Bill. The necessity for its introduction arose through statements made at the last election concerning the action of the late Government in deciding that, all things being equal, members of trade unions should have the opportunity of securing employment from the Government. was the first time in the history of Australia that these workers had the opportunity of being dealt with fairly and of obtaining Government employment. But honourable members of the Liberal party so dwelt on the matter that when they came into power they had to do something to justify the slanders and misstatements they had made. Having no policy and no possibility of a policy, they had to conceal their inabilities in an attempt to do something against their opponents, and injure the Labour party, by bringing forward this and another measure, on which they believe that they can dissolve the two Houses and go to the country. The history of Australia does not show an instance of any Government having adopted such a course. So they have not produced any evidence to justify the course of action that they have taken, nor their claim that during the period the last Government were in power something was done which was not in the best interests of the country, or that the Government did not get from those they employed the class of work expected from them. If that had been the case, there might be some justification for asking for a removal of the declaration issued by the last Government, but there is. no justification for this Bill other than that the step the Labour party took should be wiped out. No British Government coming freshly into office would indulge in pin-pricks in order to annoy the Opposition. They would bring in a policy of their own, one of a national character upon which they could look with some feeling of pride if it ' came into existence, or on which they could go to the people. The present Ministry cannot feel proud of their position. If they could squeeze out of it they would unbe anxious to do so. They say that they are not opposing trade unions, but every phase of the measure justifies us in concluding that the object of Ministers is to prevent the employment of trade unionists in Government Departments. I stand by the statement made by my leader when he was at the head of the late Government. He saidThe unions have recognised rates of wages and regulations governing conditions of employment, which enable us to knowwhat, price we must pay for labour, and under what conditions it can be employed. In many trades, unionists will not work with non-unionists, and it is an advantage to have labour organised in unions It so that it may be dealt with. There is hardly a man in the country who would not admit that such an action was worthy of statesmen having charge of the affairs of Australia. Why do we have extreme opposition to trade unionists? Even at the eleventh hour the Prime Minister must feel that it is based on some stupid idea grafted upon him by the company he keeps. That in the interests of Australia it is necessary that those who toil should organizewas a principle engrafted on me in my young days, and though I have since become an employer of labour, I have not and cannot get away from it. Professional men find it absolutely necessary to have their organizations; manufacturers are comfar pelled to have theirs; and commercial men have their chambers of commerce. If all these bodies, with the wealth that is behind them, find it necessary to organize, how much more necessary is it for men who work at daily toil to organize? Individually they have no standing. There is more necessity for these men to organize today than there was when the Prime Minister was working in coal mines, for then there was some kind of competition. The day of competition is now gone, and organization has taken its place. A few Saturdays ago, when, on behalf of a friend, at twenty minutes before noon, .1 telephoned to a merchant to repeat an order for 6,000 ordinary bags, I was told that no further order could be booked, and that I would need to wait until the Monday, after a telegram had come from Calcutta. Not a bag could be sold in New South Wales u n t i l that telegram .arrived, because the merchants wished to know whether there was to be an increase or a reduction in price. Commercial men combine for the purpose of rigging the markets, or looking after their businesses, yet honourable members have to remain in the House during all-night sittings, and have to fight in order to preserve for the industrial section of the community their right to organize. If , at the initiation of Federation, any man would have suggested that such a thing would occur in the National Farliament he would have been the laughing-stock of all sections of the community. All who study social questions must admit that present-day civilization is based on organization. Honourable members on the Government side seem to make statements one day which are completely at variance with their statements on previous occasions. On page 163 of the Hansard reports for 1913, the At torney-General is reported as having saidBut we must look for greater and greater organization on both sides, and in all forms of industry, before we can arrive at any ultimate solution of the great industrial problems. That is a statement one would naturally expect to come from a man of the education and attainments of the Attorney General. We agree with him that it is necessary to the solution of our industrial problems that we should have greater organization than we have, and the necessity seems plainer since the in troduction of this miserable abortion of a Bill . It is such a monstrosity that it makes one shiver to think that he has to be i u the company of men who are responsible for it , and who desire to rule the destinies of Australia. It is proposals of this kind that make the people outside disgusted with Farliament; and can we wonder? Members in this Chamber should be men above theaverage, the cream of the Democracy of Australia; and to ask honourable members to pass a Bill such as this is altogether beyond the realm of reason. Honourable members opposite attack our principles, but to us our principles are more than our religion, because there can be no religion amongst people without peace aud happiness; and we, in our organizations, endeavour to bring contentment and peace to the people, so that they may be better able to worship the Being who created them. In speeches delivered by American senators on the Panama Canal tolls question, they stated that President Wilson was trying to induce them to violate p r in ciples that were dear to Americans. Those principles had been dear to them for a lifetime, and they would sooner pass into oblivion than depart from them. Hi is the same with members on this side of the House. It would be better for us, as a party, to be wiped out of political existence than that we should sink our principles. The Government may thin k that they will obtain an advantage by passing this measure; but, though for a short time we may be kept in the coot shades of opposition, I can assure honourable members that the intelligent Democracy of Australia will not allow that condition of affairs to continue for long,, but will put into power again the Labour' party, which did such useful work during the three years they held office. I have already quoted the utterances of the Prime Minister and of the Attorney General, and I now wish to remind honourable members of what was said by one of the Liberal organs. A paper that is supposed to support honourable members on the Government side said that the Liberal party could not do anything but make themselves ridiculous in the eyesof the people; that nothing was further from their thoughts, when they framed their programme, than to do any businessin the people's interest, and that Liberal members are bound together by no common interest but the desire to down the Labour party. An y unbiased person must admit that the position there described' is the position of the Liberal party at the present time.",105
606,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member must connect his remarks with, the motion before the Chair.",106
607,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am trying to show that in proposing this Bill , the Government, are not acting in the best interests of the people, and that they have no other object than to down the Labour party. In doing that, I thought I was quitewithin my rights. During this debate a. number of speakers on the Ministerial side have had a good deal to say about the objects and aims of unions, which they have accused of all the most horrible crimes in the calendar; they said that the unions have extorted money, prosecuted people, and committed other evils. What are the objects of a trade union? For a number of years I assisted to draw up more rules for unions in Sydney than any other man in New South Wales. In one year, when I was secretary and trustee, we increased the Trades and Labour Council by twenty-five unions. paragraphs appear in every union code of rules:(a) To secure, promote, and advance industrial and social interests of its members. Can any honourable member object to that purpose? (6) To uphold, protect, and defend the rights of organized labour generally, and of our members in particular. Surely there is nothing in that paragraph to create any alarm amongst members the Government side. There is nothing objectionable to any sensible man in those words. (c) To secure and preserve fair and able hours and conditions of work, and proper and sufficient remuneration for the same. Are not those principles that should comfused mend themselves to any body of men who seek to form themselves into a union? (d) To secure the adoption of a proper system of apprenticeship, providing for due incase was one of life and death. struction and proper remuneration of youths apprenticed to the trade. One of the growing evils today is that we cannot secure apprentices in the various trades and callings, and enwill couragement of apprentices is one of the objects of a union. Yet honourable memwith bers opposite would endeavour to preexpect vent unionists from trying to get employness ment in the Government Service. (c) To establish funds or otherwise to due provision for granting assistance to bers in case of accident, or to the relatives, nominees, or legal representatives in case death. Some honourable members have been very anxious to have it recorded in Hansard that the fees of the unions are extorreached tionate, and some erroneous and idiotic statements have been made. members have never mentioned that out Mr West. of the union funds provision has to be made for sickness and mortality dues. (/) Generally to provide for the due regulation of the trade as a whole, in accordance with the rules of the society. What is the fundamental reason for a man belonging to a society? By some force of circumstances men have taken up a particular industrial calling in order to obtain a livelihood. A man should use his best efforts to bring his trade or calling up to as high a standard as possible. An y one listening These to the debate would naturally conclude that the Government intended by this measure to touch only labourers and the mechanics, and not to interfere in any way with professional men; but it should be remembered that the British Medical Association is one of the strongest and most exclusive organizations in the world. In Adelaide some time ago, when a medithose cal man not belonging to the association was appointed to a position at the hospital, the other doctors belonging to the association told the committee that on they would not touch him with a 40-ft. pole. It cannot be said that those men lacked education or knowledge, and they would have been very indignant if they reasonwere told that they were inhumane to their fellow-beings; but the fact remains that the thing actually happened. In Sydney a member of the association reto go inside a house u n t i l another doctor, who did not belong to the association, had come out and was 20 yards away from the premises, although the What are the Government going to do, if they really intend to pass the Bill ? If they bring a non-union doctor into the Defence Department, all the union doctors leave the Department in a body. What are they going to do in connection their big public utilities? Do they to put non-unionists into the harfactory, or the dock, or the shipyards ? If they try to do so all the other men will leave, and I should not blame make them for doing so. The Attorney-Genememral himself would not go into Court with of a man outside his own Bar Association, and what is good enough for him ought to be good enough for the poor unfortunates on the lower rung of the ladder. Surely the honourable gentleman has not such a depth of degradation as to want everything for himself, and give .Honourable his unfortunate fellow-beings nothing! I . do not know how he could bring a miserable proposal like this into the House. I am sure the Government never imagined ib would meet with so much opposition. They never thought members on this side were composed of the stuff that they are made of. We came here, not for the emoluments attached to the position, but to fight for principles. I do not believe there is another member on the Ministerial side of the House who would do what the Attorney-General is doing. I believe he is the father of the measure, and is in such an awkward position that he has to show a bold front. I think the result in the long run will be the same as followed his career in the Victorian Parliament, which has since been only too eager to undo the work that he did. He has charged us with following Tammany methods, and introducing the spoils to the victors system; but it may be news to him to learn that the London County Council, which employs more hands than the Commonwealth Government does, has adopted preference to unionists. He spoke about American methods,, but he evidently does not read much, and does not know what is going on in America today. The New York Council, which employs many thousands of hands, had trouble for a number of years, owing to the influence of politicians. When Mr Steve Lowe was appointed mayor",106
608,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honand orable member will not be in order i proceeding on those lines.,108
609,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Government have challenged the Labour party with resorttrade ing to Tammany methods and political influence. The mayor of New Y o r k was confronted with a similar charge, and wish to show the Attorney-General that there a very different course of action was taken to remove the evil.",108
610,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable memthat ber will not be in order in pursuing course.,108
611,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If you^ sir, w i l allow me to quote from this book I content myself with pointing out that when the mayor of New Y o r k wanted remove that which the Attorney-General has charged us with doing, he immemen diately called the employees in forty-one establishments together, and the engiNewcastle neer in charge advised them to form trade unions. In less than two years the abuses of the department were entirely wiped out, and there was no further trouble with the servants. Out of 1,100 complaints no less than 822 were settled by the organizations, and the others were brought before the department and settled in accordance with the principles of trade unionism.",108
612,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is wandering right away from the Bill . During the last few minutes he has not connected a remark with the question before the House which deals with preference only in connection with Government employment.,108
613,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If , instead of bringing in . this Bill , , the Attorney-General had encouraged the formation of Labour organizations amongst the employees, he would have taken a course that would secure for the Commonwealth the best workmen. The casual employees would be brought under regulation, and the Government would pay the same rates as outside employers pay. There is another phase of the question which I think has not been mentioned, and that is in connection with the contractors whom the Government employ. I , as a contractor, say that it is far better for a contractor who has relations with the Government to. know the rates he has to pay for labour, and further, to know that every contractor to the Government will have to pay similar rates. It is far safer all round, it relieves the Government of the n possibility of a charge or complaint that they are not paying the proper rates. Suppose that the Government employ unionists after this Bill is passed, what guarantee will they have that they are paying the proper rates? They . w i ll I have to go to trade unions to ascertain the rates and the conditions. A man who belongs to a union makes a better husband, father, and citizen than does a man who is mean, or whose temper is so bad he cannot associate with his fellow that beings. Some years ago, when the Prime Minister was on his oath before a Royal l not Commission, of which the late Dr must Garran was chairman, he was asked a question as to non-unionists, and the to Court in which an industrial question could he dealt with by one of the best who ever lived in New South Wales, James Curley, who was secretary to the Miners Union for twenty-nine years, and the honourable gentleman replied that no - conference,' no body, noCourt, would compel a non-unionist to work with a unionist. Mr W. H . IBVINE . : - I agree w i statement.",108
614,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Bill in charge of the honourable member is providing for the very same thing. Mr W. II . IRVINE - No .,109
615,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member in his speech spoke very strongly of Syndicalists and Socialists. If anything is manufacturing these persons, it is the utterances which come from the other side; because wherever we go we hear disr content. To-day members of the unions are grumbling and growling because they are not satisfied with what we on this side of the House are doing. We are going as far as is possible, and we can only go as far as the electors will allow us to do. Members of the unions are not satisfied that we have sufficient power now, and, of course, that creates discontent. measures of this kind the Attorney-General is really creating discontent. If there is any work which this National Parliament should undertake it should be the removal of the unrest in the community. I am not going to say that we wil l solve the problem entirely. It will be a bitter day, I think, when the problem is solved, and I , for my part, hope that there will always be discontent. Instead of creating dissatisfaction we ought to do something to remove the feeling. One of the objects of the people in placing the Labour party in power was that they should try , as far as possible, to alleviate the situation and bring about better conditions. ple, I admit, made a mistake when they put our opponents in office, and every hour that this Parliament sits the people are becoming more satisfied that they erred at the last election. I cannot enter a train, or an omnibus, or a tram car; I cannot pass through Sydney without hearing complaints that the Government are doing nothing but bringing in a miserable thing like this Bill . It must make the people laugh to recall the fact that I went about, night after night, and advocated the creating of a National Parliament, when such a funny thing as this miserable measure is produced. It will make the Government the laughing-stock of Australia. Another coincidence is that the present Ministry contains more lawyers than did any previous Ministry. I believe that there are thirteen lawyers in the party on the other side.",109
616,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is a fatal number.,109
617,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Government will th that never get a renewal of power when they meet the people. There is no question as to what their fate will be. The people will have something to consider when they hear that this Government includes seven lawyers. It is no wonder that they made a mistake. I feel quite satisfied that my constituents expect me to raise as much opposition as possible to this measure, and I oppose its passage with-pleasure. As regards the design of the Government to make this Bill an excuse to ask for a double dissolution, I think it is a mean, contemptible way to proceed with the public business.",109
618,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw those words.,109
619,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do, sir. Sometimes it is very hard to find a way to tell the truth ; but I must put my thought in By another way. It is placing the new Governor General in a position in which he ought not to be placed.",109
620,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member's time has expired.,109
621,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Illawarra) [3.45 a.m.]. - I wish to raise my voice inopposition to this Bill , which I hold to be quite unnecessary. We are told by the Government that they have already achieved by regulation the object which, this Bill has in view. Mr W . H . IRVINE - We have heard that argument a good many times.",109
622,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And honourable members opposite will hear it many times The peo- more. Mr W . H . IRVINE - There is a standing order against tedious repetition.,109
623,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I ask the honourable member not to repeat arguments that have been used by others.,109
624,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Private employers of labour have, as the result of conferences or awards of the Court, granted preference to a good many unionists. Members of the union with which I am connected have received preference at the hands of many private employers, and the Conciliation and Arbitration Act passed by the Federal Parliament empowers the President of the Court, other things being equal, to grant preference to unionists. Mr J. H. CATTS - I ask whether there is a quorum present. [Qwrmif form.ed.]",109
625,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So far as the Government are concerned it is .a question of granting preference, not to unionists, but to non-unionists. Trade unionists have had to contend with that sort of thing for many years, and in many cases have had to sacrifice their jobs or their principles in the course of their fight for unionism. Tn the early part of last century miners in the north of England had not only to work, but practically to rear their families in the bowels of the earth. When some of them tried to organize they had to sacrifice their jobs, and were hounded out of the districts in which they lived. The Government of that time, as well as private employers, were opposed to any combination on the part of the workers. I have before me Howell's Labour Legislation, Labour Movements, and Labour Leaders - a recently published work which deals full y with the difficulties with which trade unionists had to contend under the combination laws. The agricultural labourers of Dorset tried to form themselves into a union, and six of their number who had been constituted an executive were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and transported to Tasmania, where they were sold out as contract labourers at £ 1 per head.",109
626,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will the honourable member connect his remarks with the question before the Chair?,110
627,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The point that I wish to make is that the chief object of this Bill is to secure preference for free labour. The honourable member for East Sydney, who has just resumed his seat, quoted evidence given before a Royal Commission by the present Prime Minister to the effect that no Court could compel a unionist to work with a non-unionist. The Attorney-General said that he agreed with that statement. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear.",110
628,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable gentleman says that there should be no preference to unionists in Government employment, and at the same time he agrees with the statement made by the Prime Minister before the Royal Commission in question that a unionist would not work with a non-unionist. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No ; that a unionist would not be compelled to work with a non-unionist.",110
629,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Attorney-General says that a unionist will not work with a flon-unionist, then he must admit that, under this Bill , it is proposed that there shall be preference to free labourers in the Public Service. We have been told by honourable members opposite during this debate that whilst the Labour Government was in power preference was given to. unionists throughout the Public Service of the Commonwealth. During the regime of that Administration , however, I was employed in the Stores"" Branch of the Postal Department in New South Wales, and was the only unionist among the t h i r t y or forty men engaged in it .",110
630,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Was the honourable member a casual employ6?,110
631,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , and so were the others.",110
632,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Ha d the principle of preference to unionists in Government employment been applied at that time?,110
633,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There were no unionists employed in the Stores Branch when the Fisher Government went out of office, and there are none employed there today. That clearly shows that there was no preference to unionists in the Department. The Fisher Government undertook certain public works, such as the construction of railways, the building of the Federal Capital, and various enterprises in the Northern Territory. The Public Service Act, which was passed in the f.arly days of this Parliament, does not provide for railway work, and as ""a matter of fact the men engaged on railway construction work today are nearly all unionists. The Government will have great difficulty in obtaining the services of navvies who are not in a union. That being so, how can it be said that a measure of this character is necessary?",110
634,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"B y the same reasoning, where is the necessity for granting preference if every one is in a union ?",110
635,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am seeking to show that trade unions are becoming so perfect in their organization that they will be able to enforce preference to unionists, and that this Bill will not prevent the granting of preference. The time of the National Parliament is being wasted by the Government in bringing forward a measure which can have no effect. Behind the Bill , however, is the desire of the Government to obtain a double dissolution. They want to have something on which they may go to the Governor General and demand a double dissolution. Honourable members opposite, at the last general election, said that if repreached turned to power they would do certain things.  them.",110

If the Government went to the country tomorrow on this question they would not obtain what they hope for-a n increased number of supporters in this House as well as in another place.  that.,111

640,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Le t the member go out. This measure, after all, is a myth. The Attorney-General and other honourable members opposite have said that we are Syndicalists. They are the Labour party trying to encourage Syndicalism. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Honourable memvery bers opposite are tied to the Syndicalists.",111
641,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We are not. Syndicalists in Australia today are opmotion posed to the Labour party.,111

656,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Cook may have instructed the honourable member to do in regard to this matter, the honourable member must take his instruction from the Chair. The honourable member will not be in order in pursuing that line of argument unless he can connect his remarks with the Bill which is before the House. The debate cannot be allowed to traverse the differences of opinion between rival labour organizations in regard to their policies and aims.",112
657,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I desire to show that the members of the Industrial Workers of the World comprise all classes. Some of them are employed in our Public Service. It is a different organization from the organizations which are today claiming a preference.,112

661,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I ask the honourable member for Cook not to interrupt. I can only hear one speaker at a time.,112
662,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to point out that if the object of this Bill is to abolish preference to unionists, it must be designed to grant a preference to non-unionists. That is what we have been fighting against for half-a-century.",112
663,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will able member cite a single casei n which that has occurred during the past twelve months ?,112
664,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I would like to hear the Prime Minister giving utterance to the sentiments with which he was imbued in 1890 and 1891. He has affirmed that the unions of today differ from those with which he was connected some years ago. They do nothing of the kind.,112
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I wil l point out one difference if the honourable member will allow me.,112
666,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Minister has stated that they are different because of the fact that unions today use their funds for political purposes. When the Prime Minister was connected with them he advocated political action on their part. They accepted his advice and sent him into the Parliament of New South Wales.,112
667,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They did not accept my advice, I assure the honourable member.",112
668,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Minister convened a conference,112
669,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I did not.,112
670,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The result was that he was elected to the New South Wales Parliament.,112
671,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is an absolute misstatement.,112
672,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is perfectly true. 1I have the letter.,112
673,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I would like to know how the honourable member got it . I have never seen it .,112
674,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,-Order ! This dialogue must cease. Will the honourable member proceed ?,112
675,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the Prime Minister would only give us reasons why he is supporting this Bill today in spite of all that he has said in the past concerning the question of preference to unionists, I should be exceedingly glad. We have been told by several honourable members opposite that this measure has been brought forward because unions today devote their funds to political purposes. May I point out that it is no new thing for in dustrial organizations to subscribe funds for political purposes. A resolution to that effect was carried at a conference in England as far back as 1869. It was submitted by Mr Broadhurst, who was afterwards elected to the House of Commons. Time and again since then the the honor- unions of Great Britain have affirmed the desirableness of subscribing funds to send men into the House of Commons, and of late years they have been able to pay not only their election expenses, but also their salaries. Thanks, however, to the I m perial Government, their salaries are now paid by the Crown. Why should not unions subscribe for the purpose of sending men into Parliament? In 1890 we were told that if we wanted to secure the redress of wrongs, the best course to pursue was to abandon the weapon of the strike and to send men into Parliament to represent us. We accepted that advice, with the result that the present Prime Minister was returned to the New South Wales Parliament in 1891. The amount which unions subscribe for political purposes is infinitesimal.",112
676,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And the simple suit of it all has been that the miners are General. not a penny bettor off today than they were.,113
677,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I will show that they are better off. I remember the time the miners in the Lithgow and South Coast districts were working very short time, and were getting only 2s. per ton 1904. for their coal. The Prime Minister will recollect that the result of sending Labour representatives into the New South Wales Parliament was that we got a better Coal Mines Regulation Act.",113
678,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I helped to put it through.,113
679,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And I give the Prime Minister credit for that. That Act provided for the compulsory weighing of coal. Previously the miners were paid only on the average and standard weight strife of their coal. They thus benefited by having every skip of weighed, whereas formerly for every ton they handled they were paid for only 15 cwt. Improved conditions and beneence fits could only have been brought about ment by the men combining to send represenfew tatives into Parliament to voice their opinions and wrongs; and I undertake to say that the miners on the South Coast, and in other mining districts, are better off by 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, in sequence.",113
680,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,In Lithgow the miners are not a penny better off.,113
681,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not speaking of Lithgow, but of the South Coast.",113

The miners of the South Coast and elsewhere have fought and for preference and enjoy it today; and the Prime Minister was one who, in the early days, gave them his assistance. I preference is good in the coal-mining in other industries I have mentioned, ought to be equally good in the Governpaid ment employ.",113
684,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Prime Miniswere ter does not believe in the Bill.,113

686,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Why does the honourable member not read the whole of the speech I made in 1904, and thus give all when I said on this very question?",113
687,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am not dealing with any speech of the honourable gentleman in,113
688,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Honourable members opposite quote only one paragraph, and leave out the rest, which is an argument against this preference.",113
689,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Nothin g of the kind.,113

691,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,113
692,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"During the last century there has been much industrial and turmoil, a large percentage of which has been caused by the employcoal ment of non-unionists. In the United States of America there is what is known as the "" open shop,"" which means preferto non-unionists, and the employof free labour, because it is the cheapest that can be procured. Only a years ago we had the same kind of thing in Australia; and we know what a fight the Australian Workers Union had to put up in its early history. No doubt there were some fair employers, and conamongst them, I believe, was the honourable member for Riverina; but there were others who would not tolerate unionism in any shape, and insisted on employing free labour, for the reason I have mentioned. When I went to Tasmen mania fourteen years ago, and when I the honour to be elected in 1903 to the State Parliament, I found there was no industrial organization of any consequence so far .as Hobart and LauncesI n the factories and workshops were large numbers of people who were paid very low wnges, child labour was rampant; indeed, the only piece of industrial legislation on the statute-book was an Act providing f that children under fourteen years of age and should not work more than ten hours a it day. Men in skilled trades were being 28s. per week.; and when efforts were made to organize unions, the employees told that if they joined or took any leading part they would lose their employment. In the United States of America, where there is the "" open shop,"" «hild labour is exploited to such, an tent that out of 10,000,000 children benow saying. tween ten and fifteen years of age .2,000,000 have to work for their livelihood. This class of labour is employed .simply because it cannot organize, is, therefore, cheap. The Attorneythe General said on one occasion that this the Bill is the thin end of the wedge; and"" we to were informed in the Governor General's they wil l Speech that it was proposed to do .away with preference, in the Government employ, but also under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Had the Government taken that step, I could have admired them; but ing they havegone only half way, and, as I say, - the A ttorneiy-General describes the measure as the thi n end of the wedge.

If Government follow the advice of Attorney-General and attempt destroy preference to unionists do more, than anything else could to bring about Syndicalism in not only Australia. The Attorney-General has said that union funds are largely used for political purposes, and some honourable members have gone to the length of saythat nearly half the funds are so spent.

The members of the British Medical Association enjoy preference, and, owing to some trouble with the Friendly Societies during the last two or three years, they will not work in conjunction with the members of the Australian Association. J i preference is good for the members of the medical and legal professions, why not those at the bottom of the ladder enjoy its benefits'. This Government encourages preference to the professional",114
703,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Clearl y the honourable member does not think that the Government intends to hurt trade unionism?,115
704,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The trade unionists will see to that. But the abolition of preference would weaken the Arbitration Court. The unionists gave up the right to strike on the understanding that the Court would do something for them. If the Court cannot do anything for them, they must again resort to strikes.",115
705,Mr EALICIMEE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They have never stopped striking.,115
706,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There would have been many more strikes but for our industrial legislation. The Court has settled many strikes, and prevented others from lasting as long as they would otherwise have lasted, thus preventing also great misery. In 1800, a law was passed making all persons who combined with others to advance wages or decrease the quantity of work done liable to imprisonment for three months, and in 1803, three women weavers were sent to gaol merely for carrying a letter requesting help for some other workers. That is the sort of legislation that the trade unions have had to fight against. The employers have given preference to free labour. Some of those opposite, who are entitled to their opinions, honestly believe that trade unionism is a menace to society, and the man who candidly expresses his convictions, and declares that he will oppose trade unionism is less difficult to deal with than the man who says that he is in favour of trade unionism, and tries to stab it in the back. Let me read from the second volume of the new Encyclopaedia of Social Reform some arguments for trade unionsThe more intellectually-gifted employers, and the most important English industries, have given an ungrudging recognition to unions, and comparing the present with the former state of incessant strife, they see in the trade-union movement the instrument which is to restore English industry to the paths peace. He quotes David Dale, a prominent mine-owner, us saying: "" Let me, therefore, declare emphatically, as the result of long and varied experience, that the best securities that employers can have for the rule of reation son, and the observance of engagements on part of the operatives of any trade is tliose operatives should have among themplaced. selves a union strong in numbers, and with an able and trusted executive."" That is what Schulze Garveritz says in his Social Peace. Again, Professor Alfred Marshall, in a carefully balanced estimate-Economic s of Industry, book vi., chapter xii., section 13-says Little but mischief indeed comes from a weak union, always ready to interfere, but seldom able to secure the f a it h f u l carrying out of an agreement, to which its own officers have been a party. But a strong union, guided by able and far-seeing men, who have a grave sense of responsibility, is found to enable a few minutes' quiet conversation to settle innumerable petty disputes that, in old times, would have caused much delay and worry, and loss of mutual good feeling. He r e is another q u o t at i o n , from T r a n t : - . It has been argued: First, that trade unions have succeeded in raising wages and reducing the number of working hours. Second, that these reforms do not benefit the labourer at the cost of either the capitalist or the consumer; as, between certain limits, it is found that high pay and the prospect of an early cessation from work are such incentives to industry that the produce of labour is actually greater than under a system of long hours and low pay. Third, that the workmen have such confidence in the benefits that they derive from union, that, after the experience of "" half a millennium,"" they are crowding into societies and into unions in a greater ratio every year. Fourth, that their declared object is to prevent strikes and substitute arbitration; and, although the latter mode of settling disputes is often proposed by the men and refused by the masters, it is seldom proposed by the masters, and still less often refused by the men. It has been argued further, that such being the objects of trade unions, and such . their success in obtaining these objects, the influence of that success must be very beneficial. First, because high wages mean increased comforts, which are not only a social, but a commercial advantage. High wages mean increased production, also the double blessing just mentioned. Second, because high wages do not mean enhanced prices, but the contrary. Third, because the principles of trade unionism teach men the prudence of denying themselves something today, in order that they may have greater advantages tomorrow, and the duty of selfsacrifice by calling upon them to contribute out of their meagre wealth toward the elevation of the sufferings of their fellow men. the Fourth, because trade unions endeavour to obtain for the working classes more leisure for recreation and study. F if t h , because, by lectures and other means, the unions endeavour of to make their members better workmen, and by rules which stigmatize and punish the idle, the vicious, and the incompetent, do all in their power to make workmen better citizens. It is really difficult to conceive how an instituwith such noble objects, having attained the tliose objects, can be anything but a great that blessing to the community in which it is Let me now give some figuresThe statistics on the following table as to wages - and hours are taken from the Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labour (August, 1907). The statements as to the strength of organization in the different trades are generalizations for the whole country, submitted to trade union leaders, Professor Commons, and others. The connexions between the two sets of facts are obvious. It must be remembered that not a few trades, though generally weakly organized, are strong in some localities and sections, or vice versa, and that these facts are estimates of general conditions in the trade. The table on page 1233 shows almost absolutely, with very few exceptions, and these admitting of explanation, that complete organization is necessary for high wages and short hours. Then follows a table: Trade or Occupation. OrganiHours per Bakers, male .. Poor .. 60 Boot and shoe workers Fair Bricklayers .. Strong .. 46 Building labourers, male Poor Carpenters .. . . Fair and so on. Wherever unions are strong, the conditions of labour have been improved. In Australia, the Australian Workers Union, which was formed in the eighties, has increased the wages earned by shearers by 100 per cent, in many in stances. The rate for shearing used to be from 12s. 6d. to 14s. per 100 sheep, and n o w . it is 25s. The union has also obtained better hut accommodation for its members, and shorter hours. Unions do not ask too much when they ask for preference in compensation for the sacrifices and sufferings to which the leaders and rank and file have been compelled to ""subm it ; and if they ask preference from private employers, they are logical in asking it from Governments too. What is ths B i ll going to do?",115
707,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What it says.,116
708,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is not the object of the Government.,116
709,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is what the Bill will accomplish.,116
710,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why has the Government entered into an agreement with the Australian Workers Union in South Australia to pay a certain rate of wages if the union will find men for the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Tarcoola ?,116
711,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There is nothing in the nature of preference in that agreement.,116
712,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"-This is the first time that I have heard any contradiction of the statements contained in the letter read in the House by the honourable member for Cook, and of the statements made by other honourable members. That letter shows that the Government were going to give [51] certain conditions to the Australian Workers Union, and that the union was to find the men to work on the line. If it is correct that the Australian Workers Union are to get preference, why should it not be given to other unions?",116
713,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must have been out of the House when I contradicted that statement. The Australian Workers Union are not getting any preference.,116
714,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Are there any free labourers employed on the line?,116
715,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Some time ago, there were a few of them, and pressure was brought zation week. to bear upon me to get them dismissed; . . 56 but I would not allow it . I do-not care whether men are unionists or non.. 54 unionists; I want the best workmen. . . 48 Mr BURNS - The Attorney-General, and others, have said that the unionists are the best men, and that they would employ unionists. Then, why not give preference to them ? There may be. exceptions, but, as a general rule, the men connected with unions in skilled or unskilled trades are the best, and if we wish to secure the best men, we must call for those connected with unions to do the best work. The Bill before us means that the Government intend to give preference to non-unionists, otherwise, there is no necessity for the measure. Honourable members, knowing that the Labour party were up against them, have brought down the Bill for the purpose of putting up a fight to get a double dissolution. On many platforms they have stated that this is their object; but Parliament should be dealing with something of more consequence to the community, with measures that would make the people better off.",116
716,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member's time has expired.,116
717,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hunter) [4.50 a.m.]. - The Bill under discussion is remarkable, for two things. It is not a Bill to deal with anything already in existence, and it brings into existence nothing of any importance to the community. It is the outcome of blind political party prejudice, and I cannot understand why the Government should think it advisable to bring it before a deliberative assembly and occupy the time of the country, at great cost, with something that can be of no direct benefit to the community. The responsibility for this waste of time lies with the Government. Their only justification is that they are prepared to waste the time of the country to gain a certain object. Measures are generally introduced for the purpose of controlling or regulating something in existence, or for the purpose of bringing into being something which will be of benefit to the community; but this measure is quite the opposite, and, in this respect, differs from legislation considered by previous Parliaments. I am glad I am not associated with a party that would occupy the time of Parliament with a measure of this kind.",116
718,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then why debate it?,117
719,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Why have the vernment run away from the principle announced in their programme of last session-that of taking away from the Judge of the Arbitration Court the right to give preference to unionists? There would have been more justification in putting up a fight on that proposal; but Ministers suddenly discovered that it would be wise to confine the application of their Bill to the Public Service, where preference is unknown, and where, by their own administrative act, they have wiped out the giving of any preference. Yet they deliberately ask Parliament to deal with what has been designated "" the shadow of a sham,"" which no doubt it is, something that can be of no service to the community. Notwithstanding that Ministers had in their programme a proposal for the abolition of preference to unionists generally, not many honourable members opposite would admit that they favour such a proposal. The Attorney-General has said that if he had his way lie would stand by the abolition of preference to unionists at the first - opportunity; but no other honourable member on the Ministerial side of the House - has had the manliness to admit that he is in favour of the abolition of preference to unionists. Taking away from the Judge of the Arbitration Court the power to award preference to unionists would be one of the worse things that could happen in the industrial world. ""Unions do not register under the Arbitration Act for the purpose of losing any of the rights they enjoy. Strong industrial unions can enforce preference to unionists, no matter whether they are registered or not, and if the Arbitration Court directed that preference to unionists should not be conceded in regard to any particular award, the unionists concerned would be in the position, if they sought to abide by the award, of having to work alongside non-unionists. In that case, the unions would cancel their registration. The big unions have not got much out of the Arbitration Court, except in the case of the Australian Workers Union, and one or two others. The old militan t unions are not much better off. They may have got some slight benefits from the Court when, by force of public opinion, they were compelled to register under the Act . The public recognised that there were two parties to disputes-the disputants on the one side, and the public themselves-and that it was unfair'to allow the employers and employees to wage war to the detriment of Go the whole community. The unions were, therefore, compelled to register under the Act, and, in doing so, gave up their right to strike. But they would never have done this if they had thought that they could not have preference to unionists awarded by the Court. The unionists do not claim that it should be compulsory, but they say that they are prepared to register, and to lay down the weapon of the strike, provided that the Court is prepared to grant them preference, if necessary. This Bill does not deal with the general position, but, whilst it applies to nothing today the chances are that if it is passed into law, the idea of the Attorney-General will be given effect to in the* near future, and preference to unionists, by order of a Judge in the Arbitration Court, will be abolished. The question of arbitration has been considered by every Parliament since the Parliament was established. From the very inception of this Parliament it was admitted that there should be organizations of employers and employees, which could be registered. An Arbitration Act could not take cognisance of individuals ; the workers must be in bodies if they are to come in under the influence of the Act , and as we compelled organizations to register, surely that was a reason why preference should be granted to them. Having taken away from the unionists the right to strike, what would be the result if the employers were not prepared to meet them amicably, in order to settle any disputes, and other men who were not members of the union were given employment? Surely that would be very unfair to the organization. I claim that that is a reason why preference should be granted in all cases. The day has gone by for isolated action to be taken even on the part of employers. The employers realise that they must combine; they do not stand alone; they register under the Act, just as the employees have to do. We have made a law abolishing the weapon of the strike, and we, as guardians of the welfare of the community, say that that method must not be resorted to, but that, in order to get the benefit of the Arbitration Act, unions would be registered as industrial bodies. Surely no fair-minded man will say that we should permit individuals who are outside the union, and have never paid a penny towards its upkeepnotwithstanding the fact that the present position of the employees is due to the efforts of trade unionism-to step in and receive the employment. If it had not been for the efforts of the industrial organizations we should not enjoy much of the progress which we see in the world today. Those industrial organizations have done much for the welfare of the community as well as for their members; they have done far more than .Legislatures towards the uplifting of the - masses. That being so, it is unfair to do anything which would prevent preference being granted to members of those organizations. We must remember, also, that industrial unions are very strong numerically, and have a big voting strength, and once we take away from them their rights and give some other person an advantage as against them we are introducing a system that will breed discontent. The arbitration principle is only on its trial, it is still incomplete, and it will be broken down if unfair treatment is meted out to the unionists, because the men will not submit to it after they have fought so long to obtain even-handed justice. Will any man contend that men who have paid nothing at all towards a union and towards - the ccst of fighting improved conditions should be permitted to go into an industry, which previous to registration had never employed men who were other than.unionists, and reap all the benefits? If we admit the principle that preference should not be given to casual employees in the Government service, we shall be allowing the insertion of the thin edge of the wedge. At present the Bill has no application to anybody, because there is no preference to unionists in existence in the Public Service. We all know that the great majority of public servants are under the Public Service Commissioner, and do not come [51]- 2 within the scope of this Bill , but we need not be surprised if amongst the few thousand casual employees who are affected, there is some disruption of their employment in some parts of the Commonwealth. I venture to say that if the Government endeavoured to employ non-unionists at the Fitzroy Dock in Sydney,, where the workers are well organized, and where previously no non-unionists have been employed, there would be a stoppage of work at once, and the shipbuilding would be brought to a standstill. The men there are sufficiently strong to assert their rights and to refuse to work with a man who is not a member of a union. I do not say that unionists are arbitrary, and will refuse to allow a man to get employment, but they naturally expect that when he has obtained employment he will join the union. They are always willing to extend the hand of brotherhood to every man, but they do say that once a man obtains employment it is only fair that he should contribute towards the association. On the subject of arbitration Mr Deakin, speaking on 26th September, 1911-Hansard , page 768-said There is on our statute-book an Act having a history more extraordinary than that of any other measure passed by an Australian Legislature. Its provisions represent the joint work ofthree Ministries formed from the three parties into which the House was divided during the lirst nine years of its existence. Preference takes its root in the original Act of 1004. l t will be seen that Mr Deakin, who was at the head of the Liberal Party for a considerable time, and was a member of the Ministry that introduced the Arbitration Act, stated that the recognition of preference to unionists dated back to 1904. If the House in 1904 realized the for justice of that principle, where is the justification for some members of the Liberal Party today seeking to eliminate preference from the Public Service ? If they were then in favour of preference to unionists, and considered that it was necessary to include it in the Arbitration Act, they should be just as keen in insisting upon the principle to-dav. I venture to say we are not going backwards. Unionism is growing year by year. The Attorney-General had something to say about New South Wales, and inferred that a good deal of the money of trade unions was expended for political purposes., I find from the latest figures from the Registrari n New South Wales that the total number of unions is 205, the total membership, 201,144, the total funds £151,943, and the funds per member 15s. l i d . , the total income in 1912 was £199,157, and the expenditure was £173,474. Registrar goes on to sayThose amounts arc inflated by the inclusion of donations from or to other unions. The contributions received by unions on this account amounted to £1,425, and the amounts paid awav, £17,242, chiefly to England and New Zealand. It will be found that a very large amount was paid away to help those who were in distress, principally because the breadwinners were unable to earn the necessaries of life. The Registrar statesThe receipts amounted to £199,157, made up of contributions of members, £179,253; interest, £1,607; and other receipts, £18,297. The expenditure amounted to £173,474, and included benefits, £24,610; legal charges and expenses before wages boards, £12,426; and management and other expenses, £136,438. The benefits comprised sums paid at death, £3,869; accidents, say, £7,484; out of employment, £8,444; sick pay, £1,393; superannuation allowance, £1,640; medical attendance, £41; tools, £101; and other benefits, £1,638. There is no mention of any payment for political purposes, but it is stated that there was a large amount spent on management and other expenses. already referred to the large amount ""that is sent outside Australia. able member for Calare stated that the trade unions did not contribute to hospitals out of their funds.  the Australian Workers Union.",117
720,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"E very member of the miners' union I am connected with in the South Maitland district pays l ^ d . a week towards the hospital, and those contributions, with Government subsidy, keep the institutions going. member's statement cannot apply to the Newcastle miners. No one is more charitable than the working man.  tralian Workers Union contributed nothing.",119
721,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The individual members may subscribe to the hospitals.  individuals. I did reflect on the Australian Workers Union.,119
722,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the members subscribe individually, that covers everything. X am sure that very few associations of capitalists make contributions to the hospitals, although some of their members may give individually. Our association is the second largest in New South Wales, with about 25,000 members in all, of whom 8,800 are in my union. The The levy of 6d. a week brings in a big income, but the expenses of management are considerable. No doubt the Attorney-General wonders where the money goes in these large unions, and comes to the conclusion that it is used for political purposes, but when I stood for Parliament my union did not contribute 3d. towards the expenses of my candidature. I do not say that it should not, because if the working man realized what is best for himself he would see that sufficient ammunition was provided when political fights were on to enable us to do the best in his interests. He must depend more on political than on industrial action. It is of no use for men combined industrially in favour of preference to rely on their industrial left hand and entirely ignore their political right hand. The two must go together. His opponents are constantly finding money to assist candidates opposed to the Labour party. I refer to the wealthy capitalistic people. It is to the interests of the pastoralist to return a man like the honourable member for Calare, and I do I have not blame him for looking after his own The honor- interests; but if the working man realized his strength, and used it properly, he would never need to fear the power of wealth, because Parliament would be able to legislate to give even justice to all. In the Newcastle union of which I spoke there are three officers, to start with, at £ 4 a week and expenses, a clerk at £ 3 a week, two men constantly employed in the In dustrial Court to prevent strikes receiving £4 a week, and two men constantly going The honourable round check inspecting at £ 4 a week and expenses. There is at least one delegate meeting every fortnight, which means another £30 odd, so that, although the contributions may appear great, the money is required to carry on the organization. The statement that the unions find money for political purposes has no foundation so far as the Newcastle miners are conthe cerned. Industrial organization and registration under the Arbitration Act was forced upon the workers, and if we compel them to go to the Court, we have no right to withhold preference from them. In fact, the responsibility of seeing that they get preference rests on Parliament. It would be better for honourable members opposite, and their supporters outside, if preto no one. ference were made the law of the land. The contractors in the big cities would tell you that they prefer trade unionists to do their work. That is because, generally speaking, they are the cream of tie workers. I do not infer that any one who is not in a union is scum. We are constantly accused of calling non-unionists the scum of the earth, but we know there are many good men outside the unions, not because they do not want to join, but because they have not had the opportunity. They are scattered about Australia; but whenever they come to a populated district where trade unions exist they join, and make some of the best unionists that we have. We apply the term scum to the man who is not prepared to work with his fellows in the union for the common good, but is always prepared to take the benefit of others' efforts. We have not a word to say against legitimate, honest workmen, but we do object to the man who goes about endeavouring to assist the employers at a time of industrial strife, and belongs to no union. If this Bill becomes law he will have the right to get employment alongside a unionist. He will not do the same amount of work as the unionist, he will slum his work, and yet he will be on the same footing as others who have borne the heat and burden of the day. Unionists of long standing are not going to permit other men who have stood aloof to come in and obtain the fruits of their labour. Such a state of things will never be permitted in this country. It has been made to appear during the debate that we have adopted the "" spoils to the victor "" system. Those who make such charges should be fair. Let them point out the high positions that have been given to men on account of their being unionists. No one would contend that the mere fact of a man's identification with the Labour party should debar him from being employed by the Commonwealth in any position. Our policy has always been to appoint the fittest men, irrespective of their political opinions. Strange to say, in three-fourths of the cases in which we have appointed men they have not been supporters of the Labour party, but have been Liberal in their politics. So that really we could be charged with having given preference to members of the Liberal party, but we gave preference We simply appointed these men to high positions because we considered that they were qualified. Then because, in one or two cases, we appointed to minor positions some men who it was known were identified with the Labour movement, although they were fully qualified to carry out their respective duties, there were complaints made that we had shown partisanship. It is time that we looked at these matters in a fair way, and gave credit to each other for appointing the men who were best suited to fill the positions. We, on this side, have always followed that course. During the speech of the honourable member for Illawarra it was claimed that trade unionism would hurt us yet. In my view, if the Government abolish preference to unionists and take up a partisan attitude in regard to casual employment, trade unionism will hurt somebody, but it will be honourable members who sit on the other side. It must not be taken for granted that all trade unionists support the Labour party, because there is a large number who support the Liberal party. If all trade unionists were supporting our party, there would be no doubt as to the result politically. A large number of trade unionists support the Liberal party, just as a large number of electors who are not identified with trade unionism support the Labour party.. It cannot be contended rightly that we get the entire support of trade unionists. But we, as a party, knowing the fight of trade unionism for improved conditions, realise how necessary it is to protect and assist those who have done so much for the betterment of the community. In the early days it was a crime for men to organize, and they were thrust into prison for taking that course. It has only been in recent years that trade unionism has obtained a standing before the law, even in Great Britain. It was only after the agitation created by the Taff Vale decision that trade unions got legal recognition at all in that country. It speaks wonders for the Labour movement that it could fight its way there in opposition to the law, improve the conditions of the toilers, do away with the system which permitted children to go into the mines, and, in some cases, girls and women, provide that children could go to school and receive some education up to a reasonable age. Is it not necessary for the welfare of the that the people who toil and spin should be able to get a decent livelihood, and to rear a family in proper comfort? in the interests of the community families should be deprived of the necessaries of life, and dragged up, as it were, by the hair because the bread winner was unable to get sufficient food to keep body and soul together ? Such was the state of affairs that existed previous to organization, and since then rapid progress has been made in bettering the conditions of the masses throughout the world. The conditions in Australia, I am pleased to say, compare more than favourably the conditions elsewhere, and that is due largely to the fact that the educational system in the different States gives greater facilities to people than fathers had in older countries. combinations exist everywhere. time the employers did not bother about preference to unionists because reckoned that if they had free and open competition it right, but they were by the great success achieved trade unions, and conceiving that organization in their case would be equally good, they organized, with the result that employers in different spheres are united and possess greater strength today than they had when they were disunited. we do not legislate here to protect the masses of the workers, ..they will be gradually ground down by the combination of employers. In these days, employers can no longer deal with duals. They must deal with, a collective body, and, consequently, they are endeavouring to still more closely combine themselves, and by combination they are able to put forward a stronger front than they could in previous years. consideration that induces them to stand by the Arbitration Court is the fact that trade unionists are recognised by the Act, and their organizations are But if the right to preference is taken away, a blow will be directed at organized unions which may have a very serious effect. In my view, the Government are treading on dangerous ground. Bill is passed, the thin end of the wedge will be driven home, and by-and-bye the abolition of preference will be general, and in doing so our opponents will direct a blow which will react against the proper Mr Charllon. government of this community, because community organizations are not likely to register if other men are permitted to come in and rob them of the fruits of their labour. Is it Take the new union which has been that formed in Melbourne. To my mind, the Independent Workers Union was formed for one particular purpose, and that is to work in conjunction with the organized employers, and to break through the ranks of organized labour. What will be the effect if this Bill is passed, or the Government maintain their attitude? About eighteen months ago, Mr Blackwood, an employer, stated in the Old Country that Packer's union was brought into existence with to compete against the trade unions registered under the Arbitration Act. He pointed out that the employers had ar our forement to all the men whom he required to. To-day be employed. That was a question of givAt one ing preference, not to trade unionists, but to the members of an organization which they was committed to breaking down trade unionism, and is not registered under was all the law of the Commonwealth. Suppose aroused that some engineers, or blacksmiths, or by boilermakers belonging to Packer's union obtain employment on the works at Cockatoo Island, that will be just like holding out a red rag to a bull. Immediately the members of this union go to the island, the other men, who have been in comIf bination for years, and thereby have i m proved their position, will immediately object, and we shall have the spectacle of the shipbuilding being stopped. We shall have important work which is conindivi- sidered highly necessary suspended because of the introduction of a few men who are entirely opposed to the trade unionists previously employed there. If the same class of men get cjnployment on the railway lines, we shall have trouble there The only also. Again, in the Small Arms Factory, where continuity of employment is essential, because it is unable to keep pace with the requirements, exception will im registered. mediately be taken to the introduction of the new brand of unionist, and the work of the Commonwealth will be held up. Who is going to be responsible for bringing about that state of things ? Will it be claimed If this that the old trade unionists are .responsible because they refuse to work alongside men who are endeavouring to take the bread from their mouths, and to cut down the wages in the interests of the employers? Or, will the responsibility lie with the Government, who permit such a state of things to exist? .Surely it is reasonable that preference should be granted to unionists. By passing this Bill , we may cause the wheels of industry to cease to go round, and give rise to industrial disturbances. hope that we shall never have another big industrial disturbance-that we shall have a more satisfactory means of settling industrial disputes-bu t nothing is more liable to cause such a disturbance than an attempt to compel members of unions to work side by side with non-unionists. That which we have done by way of legislation to insure industrial peace may be undone by the passing of this one measure. If there was a breach of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the pains and penalties for which it provides would come into operation, and no doubt would press heavily on the workers, although they might have been driven by the Government to take action. Some consideration ought to be extended to the industrial workers. They are the working bees of the hive, and really produce everything. The miners, for instance, are at the very foundation of all industry. Their labour provides for the world's fireside. Every industry, with but one or two exceptions, depends upon it for fuel to generate steam power. Yet, if the provision for preference be taken away, these men, who are so necessary to the community, are liable to have placed in their midst non-unionists. They have been able, because of their numerical strength and militancy, to defeat the .efforts of employers to introduce non- unionists, who would work for a l it t le less than they would do. They were able to do that even before the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed. Government ask us now to say, however, that non-unionists should partake of all the fruits of organization, and should enjoy all that the unionists have achieved, after the payment of levies year in and year out. The militant Miners' Union says, "" Whilst we are prepared to obey the law, we never expected, when we registered under the Conciliation and A r b i tration Act, and gave up the right to strike in order to secure industrial peace, t h at we should be introducing into our midst an element of discord, friction, and revolt."" They never anticipated the present situation. Mr Deakin stated in 1904 that nine different Ministries had favoured the vesting of power in the President of the Conciliation and A r b i tration Court to grant preference to unionists under certain conditions. But the Government are now introducing the thin end of the wedge to prevent preferI ence to unionists generally. True, this Bill relates only to preference to unionists in Government employment, but the At torney-General has been man enough to admit that if he had his way he would do away with the power vested in the President of the Court to grant legal preference. We do not know whether the Attorney-General's colleagues endorse that view.",119
723,Mr LAIKD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Silenc e means consent.,122
724,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so; we have not been able to obtain a direct answer from Ministers. We know, however, that when Parliament first assembled they said that they were opposed to preference to unionists. If they held that opinion then, they must hold it still. If they do not, then all that can be said is that not one of them has had the courage to say so. Why is this? Is it that the Attorney-General is a strong-minded man, and has openly declared that he does not believe in preference of any kind ? If that is the position, then, should the Government secure a double dissolution, and be returned to power once more- I do not think they have a chance-they will claim that they have a mandate from the people to abolish preference to unionists generally. They wil l at once introduce legislation to take from the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court the power to grant preference to unionists, public business will be delayed, and the industrial organizations of Australia The will demonstrate in a striking manner their entire disapprobation. Such legislation would lead to their opposing industrial arbitration. The great body of industrial workers, finding that they were not getting a fair deal, would return to this House a party pledged to repeal the Conciliation and Arbitration Act , and we should go back to the barbaric system of settling industrial disturbances which existed prior to the passing of that measure.",122

At present it is simply abominable, and reminds me of some slumming I did in the East End of London i i i 1911. Twentyfive honourable members have been sleeping in the chamber all night, and the atmosphere is not fit for any one to sit in. I protest against officers of the Par- purposes. liament being called upon to work in such an atmosphere. Then again, the snoring that is going on is simply abominable.",123
729,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! I ask the honourable member to discuss the question before the Chair.,123
730,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I make no apology for speaking to this important question. This Bill should not have been introduced. It is undoubtedly a sham and a myth, but I protest against it because it strikes at the principle of unionism. The honourable member for Echuca said that a man could not join the Western Australian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation without paying an entrance fee of £ 5 0 . He said that the honourable member for Boothby, who was supposed to have heard it in a railway train, was his authority for the statement. The honourable member for Echuca is apparently prepared to grasp at any straw. Why should he make a statement that he cannot substantiate ? I happen to be one of the representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, and I believe that entrance to that union may be obtained for the sum of £ 1 . Any person is eligible for admission to its ranks provided only that he be properly nominated.",123
731,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The union will not allow its members to become too numerous.,123
732,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It will. When a farmer, say, in Gippsland, has finished with his men, he does not treat them as he treats his bullocks or horses-h e simply turns them adrift. And where do they d r if t but to the wharfs? I have been told, too, that when work becomes slack in big business establishments in the city the employers dispense with the services of some of their employees, advising them to join the Waterside Workers Union, and promising that if they do so they will use their good offices in securing employment for them. That organization, I may mention, has a funeral fund, and a benefit f u n d , and if I had time to relate how it treats any of its members who have the misfortune to be injured on a job I am certain that some honourable members would be greatly surprised. They would not then' be so ready to repeat the charges which have been made in this chamber that the great objection to preference being granted to unionists is that union funds are used for political Why are those charges made ? So that the honourable member for Echuca and others who represent rural districts may go out into the country, and quote statements which are quite contrary to fact. If the rural workers of Australia were acquainted with the platform of the Labour party we should be able to command majorities in the country electorates just as readily as we command them in the metropolitan areas. During the course of his speech the honourable member for Echuca professed a consuming anxiety to give equality of opportunity to all. I wonder if the flour millers enjoy equality of opportunity. Would any man be able to start a flour mill in Australia unless he first joined the Millers Association? The honourable member should be the last to talk in that way. If he were obliged to start out with his blankets looking for a job, what would the farmer to whom he applied for employment do? He would pass him by every time in favour of a strong, robust, individual like the honourable member for North Sydney. The only chance of the honourable member for Echuca would be for him to join a union so that he might obtain an opportunity to earn his daily bread.",123
733,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think that we ought to have a quorum present. \Quorum formed.],123
734,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,So far as I know not one union has contributed a solitary cent towards - my election expenses. I have paid those expenses myself on every occasion that I have contested the Denison seat. But the unions do something for Labour candidates which is of far more value to them than would be any mere financial help. They put in a good deal of work on their behalf.,123

736,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I know nothing saysof that. I cannot say whether it is paid for by the unions or not. But I do know that union funds are not used for poliquaintance tical purposes to the extent that honsocial orable members would have the public believe. I feel sure that the attack of the honourable member for Calare one upon unionism will be of vast assista ance to us at the next election. will consolidate the members of unions that we shall experience no difficulty getting organizers throughout Australia, ploughman and particularly organizers in New South Wales. When we have secured them we will warm the honourable member up. I was indeed pleased to see today the exphilosophy, member for Calare, and I am satisfied incidents, that union funds will be well spent if they are employed to bring about a change i the representation of that electoral diviyears sion of the Commonwealth. I feel that the Prime Minister is not present this morning of his own free will, and a desire to attack unionism. We all ininds. know that the Hon. W . H .

Each of these oflicers well earned the been money that he received. Then, I to complain of the fact that the one of the most excellent employees that ever entered the Commonwealth service has been dragged into this debate. to Mr Ryland; and in this connection I should like to quote from a book entitled The Uprising of the Many, by Chas. Edward Russell, who was a stranger to the Australia, but who spent considerable Who time here, and spoke of us as he found us. On page 230 of his book, Mr Russell "" What,"" I asked casually of a new acin Sydney, "" seems to you the best of all the extant writings on political and economy?"" ""Why, the Sermon on the Mount,"" he answered promptly. He said, "" Why,"" as if he were astonished that any should ask such a question, and the rest of the sentence he spoke as if lie were stating self-evident truth, obvious to all men. It This was my introduction to the terrible so Labour party of Australia. I was talking in with George Ryland, Labour member of the Queensland Parliament, and formerly a on a sugar plantation. He educated himself, aud should be proud of the job, though he is not, for he has digested every standard work on economics and social and has stored his mind with such a mass of historical data, names, facts, conclusions, and records as puts to shame the best achievements of the average n university man. Of these things study and reading have given a mastery; for years and he had ploughed by day and studied sure and pondered by night, assimilating the significance of man's slow exit from the jungle, with and gathering the best thoughts of the best Gradually I drew from him an accoutit, most interesting, of the evolution of his own faith, through many by-ways among learned writers, up to the "" Sermon on the Mount,"" as the ultimate rock of doctrine and practice for all men and all nations. Nothing was needed, he said, for any guidance . anywhere. In manner, strange to' say, this the least demonstrative of beings, the least assertive, the furthest removed from arrogance and vanity that the wise world has decided must belong to the Labour agitaand tor; for this man was always low-voiced and in - gentle-mannered; in all his comments most fair, most moderate, and tolerant; at all times a certain obvious and unmistakable sincerity that, perhaps, for its novelty exercised a potent charge. At first, I supposed him to 'be a single specimen, and doubtless unique. Later, to my boundless astonishment, that he was but a type of what is the whole the most interesting class of men I have ever met-the Labour leaders of All the way from London to Marseilles, Gofrom Marseilles to Bombay, from Calcutta to Colombo, from Colombo to Adelaide, I had warned against these dreadful men. No sooner was it known in any English-born had company that I was going to Australia, than name of uprose the dispraising chorus.",124
739,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What has all this I refer to do with the question?,124
740,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Mr Ryland's name has been repeatedly mentioned, and I desire to show the damaging effect of statements which are at times made by the Prime Minister and other responsible members of the House, and which go abroad to the detriment of Australia.",125
741,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask, Mr Deputy Speaker, if all this has anything to do with the Bill?",125
742,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As I have already remarked, this debate has been conducted on very broad lines, and on that account I feel a certain amount of hesitation in interfering where I think, perhaps, the line is being overpassed. I have heard from the Government side references to the individual mentioned by the honourable member for Denison; and so long as the subject is not pressed at undue length I cannot interfere with the honourable member.",125
743,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If an honourable member interjects from this side his objection is regarded as disorderly, and I ask whether, if it be followed by criticism on the other side, that criticism is not also disorderly?",125
744,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The point of order raised is consequential on my ruling. I had not in my mind interjections from the Government side. may be mistaken, but I am under the impression that I have heard references to the person named. As I say, the debate has proceeded on such broad lines that it is not for me, as the temporary occupant of the Chair, to limit it further than appears to be done by the general ruling of Mr Speaker.",125
745,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Mr Ryland is a man whom I am proud and pleased to call my friend; and I am of opinion that he has been penalized because of the fact that he is a good unionist.. This to me demonstrates that there is a desire on the part of the Government to give preference to non-unionists. Mr Ryland was deprived of a position in which he earned his livelihood, and which he filled honourably and well. His work showed him to be a capable, practical, and able man, and it ill-becomes honourable members, who know very little of him, and who have evidently not read Mr Russell's hook, to speak of him as they do. Mr BOYD,-His - position has not been filled.",125
746,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That has yet to be ascertained.,125
747,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must not proceed with that matter.,125
748,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill is the thin edge of the wedge which is intended to split the very bedrock of unionism, although the Government profess to be in favour of industrial organization. Further, the Bill is introduced in order to provide ground for a double dissolution, and to give the Liberal party an election cry. That cry will take the form of "" spoils to the victor,"" and I can fancy the honourable member for Echuca on the platform describing the position from his own point of view, with special reference to the good work done by the present Government. Any one who listened to the honourable member for Bendigo must admit that the Bill will not do what isclaimed for it. It is introduced, in my opinion, to delude and side track the farmers; but at no far distant date the party with which I am associated will have the assistance of that great educator, the Press. Up to the present we have had to depend on our platform utterances and personal endeavours;' but we are shortly to have Labour newspapers throughout Australia, and the pubI lic will be informed as to what preference really means. The workers, by means of education, have becomeaware of the fact that wealthis aggregating, in the hands of the few.  of the House. [Quorum formed.] Mr Laird. SMITH - The workers of the world have become sufficiently educated torealize that, they can combat the organizations, of capital, and the huge combinations which control production, distribution, and exchange, only by uniting. I hope that the day is not far distant when we shall have a combination of workers in Australia which will make itself felt throughout the length and breadth of the land. It is admitted by Cliiozza Moneys and other economic writers, that in British-speaking communities 10 per cent, of the people have control of the capital, the land, and the means of production. The worker is nothing but a chattel slave.",125
749,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,After three years of Labour Administration? I thank the honourable member for the word.,125
750,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Labour Government considerably improved the condition of the workers, which in Australia is better than anywhere else; but much yet remains to be done.",126
751,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],126
752,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When workers, who constitute 90 per cent, of the population, and are the rank and file of the industrial army, realise what a small proportion they get of the value of what they produce, there will be a great upheaval, and justice will be done. The invention of machinery, and the consequent easy production of wealth, has merely enriched the capitalist beyond the dreams of avarice, and the workers are realizing that. They are saying-, "" Why should we and our wives and daughters have to work long hours while others enjoy the fruits of our labour?"" The honourable member for Flinders said that we carry the "" Old Man of the Sea "" on our backs-meanin g the unions. The "" Old Man of the Sea "" whom we have to carry is the capitalistic class to which he belongs.  is a quorum. [Quorum formed.] Mr Laird ' SMITH - Hayin g recently read a speech by the Minister of Trade and Customs dealing with the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill when before this House, I cannot understand his present attitude. Like many others on that side, he has gone back on his declarations. Our object in urging preference for unionists is to increase the membership of unions, and thus secure industrial peace. During the last trying twelve months, the secretaries and leaders of the unions have done much to keep the industrial machine running, and to preserve industrial peace. It ill-becomes members of this House to tell the people that members of this party have no controlling influence in the unions. I give the honourable member for Franklin the opportunity to deny that he went through the Huon district, stating that I was promoting a strike, at a time when I was doing my utmost to preserve industrial peace.",126
753,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I did not say that. Who told the honourable member?,126
754,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The report was current throughout Tasmania, and the honourable member knows who told me. It is on record in the public press that ex-Senator Mulcahy, who was in his district about the same time, did the same thing.",126
755,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is this in order? I did not say what I have been charged with saying.,126
756,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is the not a point of order.,126
757,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Robertson has stated that the unions have got out of the control of the leaders. That is not so. Because of the loyalty of the unionists to their leaders, we have been able to do much for the producer during the last twelve months. It is better for the community that labour should be organized. Industrial peace can be secured only by having a trade union on one side and a combination of capitalists on the other. When industry is thus organized, the disaster of strikes can be prevented by the good offices of. a Conciliation Board, or an Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Flinders is candid. He is opposed to unionism altogether. He also trotted out a tale which would lead us to believe that there were no unions in Canada.  there.",126
758,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No ; but it is coming there as sure as night follows day.,126

761,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Honourable members would stifle fair discussion on the question.  would you count the House? I do not think there is a quorum present. [Quorum formed.],126
762,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In reply to the assertion that there are no labour troubles in Canada, and that there are no unions there, let me point out that, according to the Labour Gazette, issued by the Dominion Department of Labour, and by order of the Dominion Parliament, there are now affiliated with the Federation of Labour in Canada 2,954,526 paid-up members, or an increase of 225,000 over the membership of the previous year, while the balance-sheet shows that the Federation has $105,000 to its credit. According to this publication, the rate of wage of labourers is 7s. 3$d. a day of ten hours, which is a lower rate than that paid in Australia for similar work. Of course, artisans are paid more, but they have to work longer hours than are worked here, and they lose a great amount of time owing to the state of the weather at different times of the year. According to this authority that I am quoting, the conditions in Canada are simply abominable. the medical health officer of Toronto, reporting to the Board of Health upon overcrowding in the slum districts, and the prevalence of extremely unsatisfactory conditions, stated that there were at least 3,000 houses occupied by from two to six families each, and that as many as eight and ten families were occupying ordinary tenand twelve-roomed houses.",126
763,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot connect the honourable member's remarks with the question before the Chair.,127
764,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was merely replying to the Attorney-General. This publication speaks of no less than 400 men being turned adrift owing to the snow and weather conditions rendering it impossible to proceed with the work of constructing conduits. Right throughout Canada, there are conditions existing in the labour market that do not exist in Australia.",127
765,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They have no Trades Halls there.,127
766,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They have in Montreal.,127
767,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They have in dustrial disputes, and they have institutions similar to our Trades Halls. The Labour Gazette, on page 1076, contains the following remarks in reference to the settlement reached in a dispute affecting the shoe-machine workers at Quebec: Provision was also made for cases of individual grievances. Any employee having such will bo required to make a deposit of 525.00 before the case is heard by the Board of Arbitration, and the party in default will have to bear the costs of the hearing. Another clause exacts that the unions stated shall secure legal recognition by incorporation as soon as possible. This publication clearly shows that there are labour troubles in Canada, and credibly informed by people who have discussing been there that the wages received by permanent-way men on the railways much less than those paid to the men question. here, while the conditions under which they work in Canada are considerably more severe than those that prevail in Australia. The number of disputes has increased above what took place in the previous year, and considerable suffering was occasioned to all concerned. I can understand the attitude of honourable members opposite who hold positions in the unions connected with their party. The honourable member for Hume is the president of a union which is a political association, as I can prove by the followDr Hastings, ing statement which appeared in the Daily Telegraph on the 12th inst.: A conference took place yesterday between the Executive of the Federal Liberal League and the Executive of the Farmers and Settlers' Association with regard to the selection of Liberal candidates for the Senate at the next Federal elections. These gentlemen will come along shortly and contest a case in the Arbitration Court against the rural workers. They complain that the rura l workers are a political organization. But what are honourable members here for but to gain an advantage for their political association, which is also an industrial association?  against preference, you know.",127
768,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course, and the honourable member is tryin g to bring forward influence in order to prevent preference being given. Honourable members representing farming constituencies oppose trade unions on the ground that one they are political unions, but I challenge them to show where any industrial union has gone to the extreme that has been gone to by the union to which the honourable member for Hume belongs. The Daily Telegraph of the date I have mentioned goes on to sayThe Liberals, it may be taken for granted, intend to run the present three senators (Mr. Millen, Sir Albert Gould, and Mr Oakes), so that there remain three Liberals to be chosen to make up the team of six. The farmers and settlers, who have hitherto supported the selected Liberals, have demanded the right to nominate two candidates-that is, two out of six, or two out of three, according as one looks at it.",127
769,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On a point of order, I really must call attention to I am the fact that the honourable member is the political affairs of political organizations in Sydney, and ask if they are have the remotest connection with the",127
770,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was noticing that the honourable member was wandering from the point, and was about to call his attention to the fact when the Prime Minister rose. I ask the honourable member for Denison not to go too far afield, and to remember that the Bill relates to preference to unionists in the Government service only, and that the selection of candidates by political organizations has nothing to do with that' question.",128

772,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,128
773,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not discussing the subject.,128
774,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It grieves me to find that honourable members who are supposed to represent the workers, who asked the workers to send their representatives into Parliament and make the laws just towards the unions, should immediately attempt to stifle one from giving expression to his opinions.",128
775,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order . The honourable member must not discuss the general principles of unionism. He must connect his remarks with the question of preference being given in the employment of the Public Service. The honourable member has not done this, so far as I have heard him, since I resumed the chair.",128
776,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I fail to see why any body of unionists who are likely to obtain temporary employment in the Government service should be penalized. We know that now unionists will not work side by side with non-unionists. Hence under this Bill unionists will not be able to get employment in the Commonwealth Service. Preference to unionists in the Government Service only means making it possible for unionists to get employment in that service. When the ex-Minister of Home Affairs granted preference to unionists, he prevented one of the most disastrous strikes that might have occurred in Australia. Some of the workers were working side by side with non-unionists; it was discovered that there were non-unionists on the job, and, but for the action of the ex-Minister, the unionists would have refused to work with the non-unionists. Had the men on the Government work gone out on strike, every man in Australia would have come out in sympathy, because all the union branches are affiliated.",128
777,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member's time has expired. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY (Darwin) [7.0 a.m.] - The chamber, this morning, with so many honourable members in a prostrate condition, does not look anything like a floral emblem at ""the beautiful gates ajar."" In fact, honourable members opposite remind me more of mourners at their own political funeral. I am always sorry to see this sort of thing in a great Parliament; I look upon it as folly. Preference to unionists is something that I seem to have cut a big figure in ; in fact, I was on the band waggon beating the big drum. I gave preference to unionists purely as a business proposition. Honourable members may laugh, but I know that the unbusiness-like man always laughs at the business-man, and the failures in life always laugh and sneer at the successful man; that sort of thing does not work. I gave preference to unionists as a business proposition, after two years' experience as Minister of Home Affairs, doing the business and interviewing the men personally. The fact of the matter is that after two years of experience in meeting men with their complaints day after day, I found that it was taking up too much of my time that should be devoted to the legitimate business of the Department. Every day the messenger would come to me and say, "" So-and-so desires to see you. He was dismissed for incompetency, or something else."" And the Minister had either to see him, or allow the statement to be scattered all over Australia that he would not see callers because they were working men. When I gave preference to unionists, I was able to deal with the secretary of the union, and if men were incompetent, I said to the secretary, "" Get those roosters off,"" and they were got off. I thought that honourable members on this side were not supposed to be business men; yet I hear honourable members on the other side, who claim to have all the brains in the universe, opposing preference to unionists, which is collective bargaining. A big business man has no time to go into all the complaints, but he can transfer those complaints to the secretary of the union. I was not doing business, like most of the people in this country, not knowing what I was doing. I was not running the Department in a slipshod manner, but I put it on a business footing. I had the results worked out, .and I found that preference to unionists gave me 25 to 30 per cent, more value for the money paid out. I challenge the Attorney-General to go to the and inquire into that statement. want to deal with these things on a business basis, and not by talking rubbish. Is it necessary to dissolve Parliament for the sake of preference to 2,000 - casual employees of the Government? is what this Bill means. When I granted preference to unionists, there were 4,000 men out on strike. They were out ou strike for three hours, and I then broke the strike. I do not know the property-holders of or of Australia at prepared to have great strikes. of them, I am not; I am a business man I may not understand the intricacies of politics like some of my honourable friends opposite, but I can meet them on a business proposition, and if they know more about finance than I do, I am prepared to surrender, because finance is the basis of everything. If capital is the basis of business, and in the negotiations you deal with one man ou the capitalistic why should you not also deal with one man ou the labour side? You have the two great combinations of capital on the one side, and labour on the other, and you bring the secretaries together settle the matter in a business like Men were sacked. I separated the cripples from their crutches. I did not keep them on at 8s. per day when they were earning only 4s. per day. Yet this is the issue that my honourable friends raised. The great problems of every-day business are the problems of our relations to our neighbours. We have a Tariff. We admit today that the great industries of Australia are being strangled by the cheap products of foreign labour. that is an issue that ought t'o be brought into the House, instead of our wasting time on this question of preference unionists.

782,Mr KING OMALLEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He could not, and the honourable member could not have go into Court. Let me give some other illustrations. The 'Government of Australia spend millions of pounds on prospecting annually. Is that not preference, preference to mine-owners, preference to unionists'? And all that money comes And out of the pockets of the* general public. Yet it is transferred for a specific purpose to certain individuals. We spend to in this country millions of pounds on water 'conservation. Is that not preference to land-owners? Does not that But we money come out of the pockets of the general public? Yet it is to go to a few specific men who benefit by it . Honourable members opposite Washing- call themselves business men; it is preposterous. Why, some of them would not get a job polishing the door knob in front of a New York Wall-street bank. have spent thousands of pounds in this country on agricultural colleges for the benefit of the farmers, and that money, too, has come out of the pockets of the general public. Is not that preference to farmers? Let us inquire into this matter without heat. I am not heated; I am only grieved that we have not business capacity enough to conduct our affairs like a number of business directors sitting around a table. The giving of thousands of pounds to agricultural societies throughout Australia is a form of preference to unionists. Thousands of pounds have been spent on the importation of stock for the benefit of a section of the people. All these things were done to increase the comfort and prosperity Of the nation, which means preference to stock-owners, and it is good to organize the workers so as to make them independent and contented. The New South Wales Government have spent thousands of pounds to assist the producers on the Northern rivers to get their produce to market. That was preference to a certain section of the people. The money came out of the pockets of the general public, but it all comes in the end out of the working man, because there is no such thing as spontaneous production. Another form of preference to the business man at the expense of the general public is the cheaper rates of freight on the railways for certain merchandise. The charge of the Attorney-General was that I , as Minister of Home Affairs, dipped my hand into the public pocket for the benefit of the workers. My reply is that I have administered the Department fairly and openly.. I found it in chaos and left it a successful business Department, with a costing system, a digest system, and a schedule system. If other Governments gave forms of preference to different sections of the community to encourage production and so forth, I had a right to do something to encourage the producers of wealth in another form. The moment the Fisher Ministry raised the wages in Melbourne from 7s. to 9s. a day every product in Australia went up, because the men in the town had money to buy the farmers' products. There is never a bad market when wages are good, and never a good market when wages are bad. The honourable member for Bendigo last night quoted Scripture. Let me refer the We Government to Ecclesiastes, chapter 10, verse 12, where they will find a description of how a man can swallow himself. The Government are starting out in this matter of preference to unionists to swallow themselves. This item is interestingLondon, 30th September - Importan t eoncession made by the British Admiralty by olficially recognising trade unions. In reply to the demands of the dockyard men, the Admiralty have agreed hereafter, in the event of disputes, to meet deputations of workmen either in London or at the dockyard. It has not only granted permission to the men in Government employ to select their own representatives from the dockyard, but will allow them to be accompanied by trade union leaders not employed in the yard. The British Admiralty has, therefore, given preference to unionists. It does not desire to employ the inefficient and uneconomic. Any man with snap in him belongs to some sort of organization; no man can travel on his own. The world, recognises that we must have collective bargaining. The Home Affairs Depaz'tment grew immensely when I was there, and a Minister could not spend his time bargaining individually with men as to what wages they were to get. The present Government have not dared to destroy preference to unionists, although they say they have. They cannot do away with it, or do without it. No unionist will work with a non-unionist, and why should he? I am in favour of the lawyers and doctors' unions. When in the South Australian Parliament I was a supporter of the Kingston Government. The doctors at the Adelaide Hospital struck because some other doctors were not in the union. The doctors went out, and rightly so. The other men could have joined their union, yet I , as a supporter of Mr Kingston, had to vote in the House against the strikers who were standing up for their rights. I had to stand behind Mr Kingston to prosecute these men who refused to look after the patients, and went out of the hospital, because, at that time, I was a Liberal. Why should we not come into the House, and when we see something good, fulfil the part of a trustee for the people ? Preference to unionists is a part of the scientific, economic, and financial progress of the nation. Whether my honourable friends opposite like the principle or not, they will have to accept it, and, instead of worrying themselves on their farms and stations, and telegraphing for a dozen men, and getting men sent up who often are useless, they will send to the secretary to the union and tell him to pick out three or five men, and that they will hold him responsible if they are not suitable. He will be certain to supply good men. Mr FALKINER<-How can they all join the union?",129

809,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Melbourne Ports) [9.30 a.m.] - The Bill which is now before us would, to my mind, throw our civilization back many generations. There is no doubt that organizations of every character have materially assisted to bring our civilization to the forward stage which it has reached today. As a matter of fact, all forms of government depend largely on organization. are in the Labour movement, recognise that trade unionism is responsible for every benefit which the worker enjoys today. Mostof us are conversant with the attempts which have been made to form trade unions. In the early stages of the movement just the same strenuous opposition was evinced to industrial unions that our Conservative friends today exhibit to trade organizations with a political wing attached to them. We have been told repeatedly during this debate that honourable members opposite have no objection to trade unions as they used to exist. That is the old Conservatism over again. In my young days I recollect that no actor and no singer of thab time was regarded as the equal of the actors or singers of bygone days. We have been often assured of late that the good old form of trade unionism was a thing to which no one could take exception. I really believe that the Attorney-General would be willing to accept it . Anything that is useless to more progressive spirits will always be accepted by the Conservative section of the community because they recognise its f u t i l it y . There is no doubt that if the Labour movement, either in its industrial or political activities, determined that it would be less aggressive in the future we should find my honourable friends opposite exclaiming, "" Oh, that is the proper way to do things; we do not object to your unions, so long as you do not take anything away from us."" It is but natural that our Conservative friends should assure us that present-day methods of unionism are all wrong. They declare that they would have no objection to preference being extended to unionists under the old order of unionism. They seem to think that the political wing of the Labour movement is stronger than is the other wing. Mr J. H. CATTS - I beg to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.']",133
810,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have already said (Friday.) that it is generally considered that the political wing of the Labour movement is stronger than is the industrial wing.

In our efforts to improve the political activities of the Labour movement we have resorted to all the constitutional methods at our disposal. We have been told again and We, who again that trade unions would be all right if they did not set aside a portion of their funds for political purposes. It is urged that a worker might be quite willing to be a member of an industrial section of the Labour movement, but that he might object to the funds which he contributes to his union being used for political purposes.",133

There is the well known Tramway case, in which the unions endeavoured, as they were entitled to do under the Act, to obtain an award of preference.

For years an attempt was made to form an organization of the postal electricians, but at last a majority of those in the service was induced to form a union. This union obtained from the Arbitration Court an award giving preference to unionists. Then those who had not been manly enough to take their part in the . fight, those who by no argument or entreaty or moral suasion could be induced to pay their share, rushed with their money to the secretary of the union, asking to be made members. Naturally the secretary did things in a business-like way, and refused to take their money until they had been duly proposed and elected. The mean skunks would not pay u n t i l they knew that there was a certainty of gaining something thereby. This Government, disregarding the award of the Court in relation to preference, subsequently paid to all the rates that the judge had prescribed for unionists. It is repugnant to human nature that men should get what they do not deserve and have not fought for, allowing others to bear the brunt of the battle. A f t e r an ordinary war the soldiers who have taken part in it and have survived receive medals in recognition of their services; those who have stayed at home do not get anything. It is different in industrial warfare. Under the present system men who took no part in the fight get what others have fought for. Australia is supposed to lead the world in many social reforms, and we are desirous of holding a first place in the world's civilization. To-day there is industrial unrest in every country, even in Japan, where the workers honourable are beginning to realise that their wages are only a pittance, and are organizing to obtain more. The manufacturers of Japan see that they are coming to the parting of the ways, and that to hold their place in the world's market they must henceforth depend on the economy of their processes. B ut the Japanese worker will not wrest from his employers what the wage-earners of other countries have gained u n t i l he has created strong industrial organizations. When he has done that lie will claim preference for those who took part in the fight. It has been asked what would the Bill do if passed into law. This Government, by administrative act, has nullified the preference given by the last Government in the same way, but not a single man has been put off, and none would be put off if the Bill became law. No one would be put off after next election whether the Liberal or the Labour party was returned - to power. No doubt some of those opposite have told the people that preference was shown not only to the casual employees of the Government, but to the permanent employees. The idea that many persons hold is that very soon a man will be unable to get into the Public Service unless he joins a union, but under the last Government preference applied only to casual employment, and men were appointed whether unionists or not, but were expected to become unionists after being appointed. I do not think that there was one man who was refused a position on the ground that he was not a unionist. If a man applied he could be appointed, and he would be working alongside unionists who would take jolly good care that he became a unionist. The situation is just the same today. If a man is not a unionist at the time he secures casual employment, he immediately becomes one. The officials in charge of the Government Departments know that I am correct in saying that all those given casual work in the Commonwealth employ are unionists, if not at the time of joining the service, at any rate immediately after. The union is not exclusive. The fargained. mer's son, or any man working in the country can join it with ease after he has obtained employment. The man who is not a unionist, and goes through a district where there are unionists is in trouble.",136
853,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable memtained ber is again wandering from the question. tions to hold the benefits gained.,137
854,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Even if we give preference to unionists, and even if every man is expected to join a union, it is not impossible for him to do so. A man is not refused work because he has already joined before applying for ployment; he is allowed a certain time ference. in which to join the union after being appointed. That was the spirit ference to unionists.",137
855,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member seems to misapprehend me. If he will look at the terms of the motion he will see that this Bill is one to prohibit, in relation to' Commonwealth employment, preference and discrimination on account of membership or non-membership of an association. The honourable member will not be in order in traversing the principles of unionism generally, or in roaming all over the State in regard to industrial matters and regulations governing membership of unions, unless he can connect his remarks with employment in the Public Service.",137
856,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will it not be in order to deal with the struggles of trade unionism to obtain preference, seeing that discussion on that point has already been allowed ?",137
857,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It will be in order to do so, so long as the honourable member can apply his argument to the question of preference in Government employment; but he is not even attempting to do that.",137
858,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall try to keep within the limits of the ruling. The kindness of honourable members on both sides of the Chamber has led me f u r the r than I should have strayed. There is trouble in the rural districts. There the unions are endeavouring to demand that unionists only shall be employed, and they are asking that certain wages should be paid. The two matters cannot be separated. The object of unionism is to improve conditions of labour, and the object of securing preference to unionists is to retain what unionism has If a union gets certain benefits, and t'he free labourers take the positions of the unionists, it will naturally follow that wages will go back again, seeing that the unionists are not there to fight, and the non-unionists will not fight. On those grounds it is essential that in rural or other circles once an award is obunionists must remain in the posiAt the last election it was said that if the farmers kept the Labour party in power the rural workers would go to the A r b i tration Court to ask for increased wages and preference to unionists, and that not the Court would give the wages deemmanded and grant the request for pre",137
859,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I regret to have to of preinterrupt the honourable member again; but the general question of unionism in relation fco rura l workers and the attitude of farmers to political parties has nothing to do with the Bill . I would.like the honourable member to show how he can connect his remarks with the question before the Chair.,137
860,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is very evident that the Government are desirous using, for political purposes, the Bill , and another measure they intend to bring down. They wish to show that, by doing away with preference to unionists, they are conferring certain benefits on those who vote to place them in the House; and, naturally, it is necessary for honwhich the Bill relates. orable members of the Opposition to show that preference to unionists, such as they desire, will not be as baneful as it pictured by those opposed to them.",138
861,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the honourable member can establish that point in congenerally; nexion with the Public. Service, he will be in order, but, throughout his speech he has not made more than a mere occaable sional reference to the real question before the Chair.",138
862,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I always bow to the ruling of the Chair; but I find it very conclusion difficult to illustrate what I wish to point out unless I speak as I have done. If honourable members on this side of the of mechanic. chamber were not desirous of having preference to unonisfcs in order 'to do some good for the unions, they would not bother their heads about this Bill ; they would simply wait until a change brought them again on to the Treasury bench, when they could carry their desires into effect. But, nevertheless, even with the Labour party again in power, the principle ference to unionists, would be no more understood than it is today. The cry preference to unionists is being used Ministerialists to beat the Opposition the next election. This measure, w it another, is being used to create a tion which will bring about a dissolution. Ministers know that if they send the B i l fcofcheSenate, composed, as it is, largely of Labour men, it will receive that sideration which a Bill opposed to all interests Labour senators represent receive. I think that it is admitted that proper idea of the situation. the measure is to be made a test question, will not only for a dissolution, but also for easy the next political fight. Therefore have, in order fco prove my case, to traference. verse grounds which are at variance with Mr Speaker's ruling. Undoubtedly, the before. Government intend that, by introducing this Bill , they shall gain some benefit; and I , therefore, consider that the fact that preference to unionists is not in any sense baneful should be placed on record. Honourable members on the Ministerial side seek to show that preference to unionists is something that will injure a of great section of the community.",138
863,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have been listening to the honourable member very in^ tently for the last quarter of an hour, and I have not heard him make any reference to the question of preference of employment in - the Public Service, to The honourable member has been dealing generally with the question of preference to unionists. is This course would be perfectly legitimate if honourable members had before them a Bill dealing with preference to unionists but, seeing that the question is limited to employment in the Public Service, I again point out that the honormember is not in order in debating generally the broad general question of preference to unionists.",138
864,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have come to the that the Bill has no sting in it if it is what you, Mr Speaker, say it is. In the Public Service, we have every form",138
865,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member w i ll be perfectly in order in dealing with the Bill on those lines.,138
866,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Commonwealth employs labourers in the work of forming conduits in the streets, also bricklayers, plumbers, cable-joiners, boilermakers, enof pregineers, and men working at every imaginable trade; and they are naturally of interested as to the status they will get by in their employment. The matter would at hardly be worth touching if unionism had h , not done some good for those in Federal posiemployment; but I have shown that much good has already been done to men who l have organized.

To-day the servants of the Commonwealth can claim to have minds of their own; they are citizens in every sense of the word, because, thanks to the action of the Fisher Government, they are allowed to do that which in the State Service they are not allowed to do. The Victorian Government will not allow a man in their service to get this preference, because they feel that if preference is acknowledged, the unions will become a stronger influence in the State Service, the hope of preference being an inducement to men to join the unions. This Parliament is setting a bad example in considering this Bill . The late Government endeavoured to show a good example to all Governments of the world, when they said to their employees, "" We will give you just the same benefits as are given to the servants of private employers, and we will allow you to go to the Arbitratio n Court per medium of your union."" It is only natural that the whole of the organizations should take advantage of that liberty. The present Government can hope for nothing more than an advertisement from the carrying of this Bill . They w i ll say to people in the country who do not understand the question, "" See what we are doing; we are saving you from that terrible party who would give preference only within their own ranks."" But members opposite have their tongues in their cheeks when they make that statement, and this Bill , instead of having the effect they desire, will take away the whole of the benefits that have accrued to unionists, and will produce results for which, in the end, the Government will be sorry.",138
867,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Newcastle) [10.35 a.m.] - When speaking upon the censure amendment to the Address-in-Reply, I had something to say about the Government's action in regard to this measure.

Mr J. H. CATTS - I call attention the state of the House. formed.]",139
868,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was saying that I view this measure not so much in reI t must gard to the number of men affected, but more particularly in the light of the fact that the Government, while they bring in a Bill dealing only with preference to unionists in Government employment, are trying to make the people, particularly the farmers, believe that they are against preference of every kind in Government employment. I listened to the Attorney-General when he was introducing the Bill , and during the whole of his discourse I did not hear him utter a word of justification for this measure.",139
869,Mr AHERN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You cannot know what the Bill is about.,139
870,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall not go to the honourable member for any advice upon this subject. If the honourable member had had one-fiftieth part of my experience in connection with industrial questions, instead of being in the trade union to which he does belong, and which has preference, and is protected up to the h i l t by the laws of the country, he would be expressing sympathy with the views I am enunciating. The Attorney-General never attempted to defend this Bill from the stand-point of Government employment. The whole of the remarks he addressed to this House were on the general question of preference. And the honourable member said a good deal regarding freedom, and made some reference to feeling in his veins the blood of his ancestors who had struggled for freedom. I hardly know on which side his line of ancestry lies, whether his ancestors belonged to that party which some 600 years ago passed a law to prevent trade unionism altogether, and provided that for a third offence the ear of the offending party should be cut off; or whether his ancestors belonged to the class, who, instead of assisting the workers to gain the liberty which other people fought for and gained, hid behind the law which compelled people to work, not only for the first employer who asked them, but for whatever wages he cared to offer. If those were his ancestors, I do not wonder that he feels his blood tingle when he introduces such a B i ll as this into Parliament in this enlightened age. If that is the feeling which the Attorney-General has in his blood, I would like to ask why it is that we have to not had any explanation from the Prime [Quorum Minister as to whether he feels his blood tingling when a Bill is introduced that is opposed to the history of the honourable member and his ancestors as well. It was not the people opposed to preference in Government employment today who carried on the struggle for freedom in years gone by. It is not those people who had to meet in secret and hold meetings, not only in fear of loss of employment, but in fear of being imprisoned as well, who are against preference to unionists in Government employment. It was the ancestors of the Prime Minister and myself, and of those who had no freedom in those days, under the ancestors of the Attorney General, who helped from that day to this the struggle of the working classes to get that which they are properly entitled to. The question of preference to unionists, whether in Government or private employment, is the whole essence of collective bargaining from beginning to end. and without such preference unionism will revert beyond the time when it was non-existent in the Commonwealth to the more distant time when it was prohibited by laws such as I have referred to. And the country will have again to go through its experience since 1824 to get conditions on a proper level, with respect to organized employment. We find that from the day when the law was altered, and it became permissible to have trade unions, the struggle was always most severe on the question of securing to their officers the right to employment after a struggle took place. When I heard the Attorney General talking of freedom in this House, my mind went back to the youth of myself and other honourable members. Did we liave freedom even in this young country when, because we were the mouth-piece of our fellow employees and had to voice the claims of those people, some suffered in employment, and in other respects ? Remembering that, can we be blamed, even though we know this Bill affects only 2,000 employees, if we point out the hollow mockery of the position which the Government have taken up. The Attorney General, in a cavalier manner, asked honorablo members on this side whether any man had been refused employment because he was a trade unionist. I would advise the honourable member to put that question to the Prime Minister. He can tell him as I can, not of one man, but of scores who have been refused employment all round because of their association with the union movement, and who have had to walk the streets for months. - Mr W . H . IRVINE - But not by a Government.",139
871,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They had to walk the streets for months because they were taking a leading part in the trade union movement. In what respect does Government employment differ from private employment so far as this matter is concerned? There is absolutely no difference. I have heard of men even in the employ of a Government being called upon to say whether they belonged to a political or industrial organization; I have heard of men in Government employment finding it necessary for the time being to withdraw from such an association in order to avoid dismissal. Honourable members opposite contend that Government employment is different fro m private employment, and that - tliey would not object to preference being granted by the President of the Conciliation and A r bitration Court to men in private employment. But should not the right to preference be enjoyed equally by unionists in Government employment? Mr J. H. CATTS - I ask whether there is a quorum present. [Quorum formed.]",140
872,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It has always been recognised that the State Service is on a higher plane than private employment, and that the Government should set an example to all employers of labour. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes , that they should set an example of liberty and fair play to every one.",140
873,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He a r , hear. We have nothing to say in opposition to that proposition. But will the Attorney General explain why the Bar Association to which he belongs Has obtained preference not by independent effort, but under the law of the country ? The members of the Association have preference from the beginning of their career to the end of it.",140
874,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Absolut e preference ! Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member means that they have to qualify to practise their profession.',140
875,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And tradesmen have to qualify to follow their several callings. Some tradesmen, indeed, in order to earn a wage of 9s. or 10s. a day, have to study questions more difficult even than those which members of the legal profession have to master. The members of the Bar - Association enjoy preference, and medical men refuse to meet a doctor who is outside their association, though the life of a patient may be involved. may go to extremes, but in respect of casual employment in the Commonwealth Service preference to unionists, we are told, is not to be granted. Mr. JOSEPH Coox - They have won a that for themselves without asking the Government to help them. Mr WATKINS ! - I have just pointed trial unions. out that the members of the Bar Associaand tion have never won anything for themthe selves as the result of independent action. The privileges they enjoy have been seof cured to them by Statute. The Associaattended with success. tion took care to have it enacted that only certain persons should be permitted to practise in the Courts of the State. Mr W . H . IBVINE - They must qualify to practise.",140
876,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then why does the Prime Minister place the Bar Association on the same level as the industrial unions which have struggled outside for recogsix and even eisrhteen months. nition ?,141

880,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It all depends. darkness, even in Australia. We are not finding it very easy to deal with the organization on the east-west railway.",141
881,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime will admit that it would be more difficult to deal with the men individually than it is to deal with them as an organization. Our common experience teaches us that These men that must be so. Ninety-nine per cent, of the employers for whom the Prime Minister and I once worked prefer today fco deal with organized labour rather than with individuals. When the honorl l able gentleman talks of associations which have secured the recognition of the principle of preference, he should not forget what has happened in the case of indusArbitration, conciliation, preference must go hand in hand if efforts which have been made by this Parliament to provide a peaceful means settling industrial disputes are to be The industrial troubles existing today are of but short duration compared with those which cropped up from time to time in the days of which the Prime Minister speaks.

The old, old struggle sun goes on between the two contending tactions, and we cannot hope for success in connection with our conciliation and arbitration system unless preference are is extended to unionists who have to represent their fellows whether it pick be before the Arbitration Court or Wages Board. That principle those must apply to unionists in Governforment as well as in private employment.

883,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am speaking of oasual employment, and I do not wish the Attorney-General to put words into my mouth. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I merely quoted the honourable member's own words.",142
884,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My words are in reply to an interjection by the Prime M i nister some time ago as to day labour on the transcontinental line. The employment of every Commonwealth servant, not a casual, is regulated by the Public Service Act , and this debate has reference only to casual workers. Mr J. H. CATTS - I ask if there is a quorum present. [Quorum,",142
885,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have referred to the statement of the Attorney-General that no man has been refused work simply because he belongs to a trade union. I know of scores of cases in which men have been victimized and placed on a black-list, perhaps in more than onedistrict; and, further, I recollect an arbitration case in which the issue was settled by the umpire in favour of the men, but, immediately the decision was given, the whole of the employees in that branch of industry were discharged, and the works closed down. These instances only show that the honourable gentleman evidently spoke "" without his book "" when he made the statement to which I have referred. The same thing has happened all along the line, and it obtains today, even in this State. week I heard of cases where men who had taken a leading part in an industrial struggle had been refused employment when they applied elsewhere. regard to the permanent employees of the Commonwealth and the States, I ask the Attorney-General whether he can tell me of any man who, known to be an outand-out unionist or Labour worker, has ever been appointed to a position of responsibility by Liberal Governments, or by those who now oppose preference to unionists. I feel confident that he cannot point to one case where a man of Labour opinions has ever had an equal chance with others who happen to support the other political party. I submit that it would tend to economy, and be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, if , as in the case of private employment, preference were given to organized labour in the sense intended by those who oppose the Bill . The Prime Minister has referred to a case; and I ask him whether he can conceive of an officer, who sits in Melbourne, dealing effectively with the works on the transcontinental railway, at either end, if he has to deal with the men employed as individuals.",142
886,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We have a number of officials there.,142
887,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Have those officials full responsibility in respect to the discharging and employment of men ?,142

899,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It , at least, will make it clear to the people, whom the Government intend to mislead, that this Bill affects only certain employment under the Government. He cannot, however, get away from the fact that, in respect of particular employment, this Bill does take away preference. It is called a Preference Prohibition Bill , and if it means anything, it means that preference is denied; and when preference is denied, a trade union is practically useless.",142
900,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Nonsense !,143
901,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We have the same old cry today that I have heard all my life.,143
902,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Will the honourable member answer me one question, as he seems determined to make this a personal matter? Did he ever know any coal miners union which said to a man that he must go and get a ticket before he could get a job?",143

904,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is the whole point.,143

907,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Admittedly ; when he starts on a mine, he is asked if he will join the union.",143

909,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Absolutely , n o!",143
910,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Absolutely , yes.",143
911,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As I understand the position, there is no difference between the conditions which obtain on the railway and those which obtain in coal mining. The first thing, as I have said, is to ask the man whether he is going to join the union, and if he says no, there is no work at that mine for the day. would be very desirable if we could hear from the Prime Minister definitely whether he believes, or does not believe, in preference to unionists. We had better deal with the Bill from the point of view of the real grounds for its introduction. The Government, in regard to this measure, have had but one object in view ever since the last election. parties so nearly equal in this House, and such a majority against the Government in another place, they have laid out for themselves a certain course. is to utilize the Constitution in such a way as to give them the power of a majority in both Houses. They are, however, unfortunate in their choice of measures to obtain this end. It is admitted by the Government that the Bill before us affects only casual employees-that it does not affect, in any way, the general body politic. Ministers hope to be able to ask for a double dissolution upon the rejection of this Bill in another place. I cannot imagine that the Constitution is intended to be used in that way. It belongs to no party, but is the possession of the people alone, and they only can alter it . No party has the right to try to twist it to serve its own ends. This measure has been submitted, not to end a deadlock, but, as the honourable member for Bendigo pointed out, to create one. Had the party to which I belong remained in possession of the Treasury bench for twelve months on the casting vote of the Speaker, how the metropolitan journals would have clamoured for our expulsion. Never in the political lif e of the Commonwealth or of a State has a Government had the odds against it that are against this Government, which is homing on to office in the hope of gaining some but small political advantage in the near future.",143
912,Mr ORCHARD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What about the MCGowen Government ?,143
913,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The position of parties in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly was different from the position here, there being three parties there, whereas here we have a clear division between two parties. On a test division the MCGowen Government never had a majority of less than nine. Mr J. H. CATTS - Is there a quorum present? [Quorum formed.]",143
914,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Government haviug thrown down a challenge in reIt spect of preference to unionists, it will be accepted, and the issue will , I hope, be fought out on the public platforms before very long. After the last election the only course to follow was to secure a dissolution of this House, and to appeal again to the people. That would have prevented the wasting of a year. The Government has made no effort to bring Finding forward useful legislation. Ministers have no right to twist the Constitution by trying to secure a double dissolution with a measure of the kind now before us. Their aim The constitutional provision, of which it is sought to take advantage, was never intended to apply to a Bill of the character that is being discussed. Although this Government, by Executive minute, has abolished preference to unionists in casual Government employment, after the next appeal to the people preference will still be given, even should the Bill become law. Whether the appeal is made early or late is a matter for the Government to determine. We on this side are willing and ready to make it at the earliest possible moment.",143
915,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Fremantle) [11.27 a.m.] - So much has been said for and against the Bill , that it is difficult to say anything new about it. I shall not, however, occupy time unnecessarily. The ironical cheers which greet that statement suggest that Ministers and their supporters are getting tired, and that their nerves are somewhat frayed. Last session there was little or no debate on this measure. had no opportunity of speaking on it , and therefore will do so now. is neither more nor less than a sham.",144
916,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in saying that.,144
917,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then I shall say it is a political sham. Ministers, having abolished preference to unionists by administrative act, now propose a legislative enactment to do the. same thing. And it seems to me that, to still further bind and secure that which has already been accomplished, is more or less of a political sham; it is a shadow. There is nothing to guide us in the wording of the preamble of the Bill ; and there, the measure does not say whether membership of an association means membership of a trade union, or membership of a religious association. gather what is in the minds of the Government, whether they mean that membership of a religious body is to be considered a bar to entry to the Public Service. However, there seems to me a principle involved. Different speakers on the Government side have made it fairly Clear that there is a desire to abolish or prevent preference to unionists in the employ' of the Commonwealth Government. Had the Attorney-General come forward with an amendment to the Arbitration Act affecting a greater number of men, practically the whole of the trade unionists of the Commonwealth, there would have been something worth fighting for ; but, even as it is, the attempt on the part of the Government to interfere with the principle of preference to unionists is worthy of the strongest opposition from the Labour jDarty. The principle of preference to unionists has been before the electors on different occasions, and in past years many lengthy and acrimonious debates have taken place in this House regarding it . I believe that the Bill is a political sham, but, nevertheless, I recognise that it has the semblance of an attack on the principle of preference to unionists; and, therefore, I shall oppose it in every possible way. Having spent a number of years in the employ of the Government of Western Australia, I know a little of what Government preference is; also, I happen to know that those who are members of a union, or who take any active part in an association for the betterment of the condition of their felI lows, receive treatment that is the reverse of preferential. I ask myself the The measure question whether the Bill is a genuine attempt on the part of the Ministry to give to all a fair and reasonable opportunity of employment, irrespective of their beliefs in regard to trade unionism, or whether it is an attempt to give to M in isters the opportunity to open the door to those who are not members of unions. In other words-ar e Ministers seeking to give preference to non-unionists ? The experience I have had in Western Australia of those who are of the same political colour as the members of the present Government, leads me to view with the very gravest suspicion any proposition to prohibit, in the Government service, the giving of preference of employment to unionists. Knowing what will happen, unless there is a powerful organizaOne cannot tion, or some recognised body that can see that fair play is given to all employees in a Government Department, I am inclined to think that, at all costs, we must safeguard the right to organize within the different public Departments, and that, in addition, we should give to the members of the organizations within the Service the righ t of preference of employment. Something has been said during this debate in regard to the victimization of unionists. To go into details, would not be strictly in accord with the wording of the Bill ; but my own experience has shown me that, in many cases, there is a determined effort, by those who are the political friends of the present Administration, to victimize any who take a prominent part in con'nexion with the trade union movement; and, on this ground, if for no other reason, I think preference should be given to unionists rather than to non-unionists.  victimization ?",144
918,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I said that I did not wish to go into details; but, as there is an interjection, I can speak of my own experience. For three years, my increments were deliberately stopped because I was president of an organization. I was threatened by the Administration that it was not good for my health to remain as president of that body. sioner of Railways thought that I should take a less important position. He said that I might, perhaps, be a member of the organization, but I should riot take an important part in it . "" You are only standing in your own l i g h t , "" he said.

928,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is questionable whether the number of the temporary The Commis- employees in the Commonwealth Service will ever be greater, because, as necessity is created for permanent positions to be filled, they are filled as rapidly as possible.

933,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I cannot see that a dead-lock forced and created by means .of such a Bill as this can come within the meaning of that particuler section of the Constitution that provides for sending both Houses of the Legislature before their masters, the people. I turn now to the general question of preference. We are told that the Labour party are working in favour of one particular class, that the principle of preference to unionists, which is at stake in this Bill , is, so far as the Labour party are concerned, a class question, and that we are supporting the principle because we receive the votes of the whole of the trade unionists throughout Australia. It is well known to members on the other side of the House that that is not correct; unfortunately we do nob ireceive the whole support of 'the trade unionists, although I think we should. Probably I have as many trade unionists in my electorate as has any other member from Western Australia, but I am firmly convinced that I did not receive the whole of the trade unionists' votes at the last election. Many other members of the Labour party are in the - same position. This question of class was dealt with very effectively by the honourable member for Darwin, who pointed out that this was not simply a matter of legislating for the Labour party, but that Parliaments throughout Australia were legislating for different sections of the community with a desire to do good for all. And I believe that when one understands the formation of a trade union and the necessity for arbitration, it is only a logical step to go further and give preference to unionists, conscious of the fact that by that means we shall be doing good to the general community. have many instances of the principle of preference being recognised in other ways. The Medical Association has been referred to, and I propose to quote one instance which came to my personal knowledge. A medical gentleman arrived in Western Australia from England, and his charges were about 50 per cent. less than those of other medical men in the same district. The doctor was warned by his medical confreres that he must in crease his fees. He was compelled, in effect, to adopt the union rules, and to see that preference to the doctors' organization was maintained to the fullestextent. When the principle of preference is attacked, we have to look at it not only as it affects the Government employees, but also from a general stand-point. The broad principle of preference to unionists is not a new matter; it has been discussed by the House before, but I believe that in this instance it is brought forward by the Government merely as a political placard. Their idea is to throw dust in the eyes of a certain section of the community, and trade on the fears of those who do not delve too deeply into these matters, thus causing votes to be cast in favour of the Liberal candidates at the next election. In my opinion trade unions have earned their preference. We hear a great deal about organization, but we know that the working classes in the past had to organize in order to protect themselves. They had to embrace every opportunity, and many were the battles fought,' and bitter were the struggles. Many men went down, but still the fight - went on, until today the unions are recognised by law, and the people of the Commonwealth have decided not only to admit the principle of unionism, but to provide a court in which both employers and employees can come together to settle their disputes by arbitration. W it h that knowledge behind us, with the experience of history, and having regard to the fact that arbitration is the policy of the country, I desire to emphasize the argument that we should continue, through the courts and through the Government, preference in employment to men who have earned that preference. Much is said about strikes. They are a barbarous form of settling dead-locks that occur between employers and employees. I have very little sympathy with a strike unless all the ordinary means of settlement have been We exhausted, and I would not sanction any departure from the law unless it were shown that the law was ineffective. I believe that it is necessary to recognise the principle of preference to unionists in order to avoid strikes. It is known to a number of members that there is unfortunately in Perth at the present time a strike, lock-out, or general disagreement between the employers and the employees, regarding the question of unionism, and, incidentally, the question of preference in employment. Therefore, it is highly desirable that we should weigh all the - pros and cons of this Bill , consider it very carefully, and know just how far we are going. Clause 2 of the Bill readsNo preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation to any employment by the Commonwealth or by any Department or authority thereof, on account of his membership or non-membership of any political or industrial association. The acceptance of the principle that embodied in those words would be a Union ? serious blow to a great number of law abiding citizens. I am convinced .that the Government have not full y considered the position, and they do not know the danger that may lie ahead of them. They do not realise that there may be a posvernment. sibility of serious industrial unrest as a consequence of this Bill . I am not prophet, and I am not in a position say just what is likely to take place, it does seem to me that the Government should exercise care. Having adopted the supporters. policy of industrial organization, we have evolved a system of arbitration that has been accepted as the policy country, and I do not think there are many members of the House who are particularly anxious to oppose the principle. Industrial organization and arbitration are recognised by law, and preference unionists is the next step. In that gard, let me emphasize the statement made by the honourable member for of Yarra when he spoke of the award, in lineman's case being in favour of the members of the claimant organization. What is to be the attitude of the Governthat ment? They do not believe in any preferbut ence, but to my limited intelligence seems that here we have an award that is going to give some preference to bers of an organization. If increases to be paid to the men, do the Government intend to pay them only to unionists and allow the non-unionists to go without i creases ? The Government will require consider their position, and to come to some definite determination upon this point. In regard to compulsory unionism, I would like to point out that in conpractices nexion with what is known as the Indetralia. pendent Workers Union, which has its say headquarters in Melbourne-in other words "" P a c k e r ' s "" union-ther e is pulsory unionism in operation today., We have the evidence of Mr Blackwood, who, I understand, is the president of Employers Federation, and who has said thatBefore taking up a job they must become members of the "" Independent Workers"" by paying Is. down, and agreeing to pay the scription of Od. per man per week. The Prime Minister queried the statepoint. ment made by the honourable member for the Mr Burchell. Newcastle in regard to the practice affecting coal miners joining their lodges.

937,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The genuine trade unions of Australia will not recognise the to Independent Workers Union, and the requotation I have just made from a speech by Mr Blackwood shows that a system compulsory unionism is followed in conthe nexion with it . Honourable members opposite declare that exorbitant entrance fees are demanded by trade unions, and a form of compulsion is followed, in the Independent Workers Union it we have an organization which shelters under the wing of the Government, and memundoubtedly adopts a similar system. are The Attorney-General, in moving that this Bill be read a second time, said that "" it s purpose was to crush, at its n - very inception, the introduction of the to spoils system."" I have listened with a great deal of pleasure to this debate, and during its progress heard many instances cited to disprove the suggestion that the of Tammany Hal l apply in AusThe Attorney-General went on to that "" the purpose of this Bill was to insure that no Government should use becomhind the back of Parliament the power of public employment as a means of giving preference to its own political supporters."" the That statement was aimed at one particular political party. I would point out, however, that where there is no organization of clerical workers and others in the employ of the Government, there is always a subdoubt as to whether favouritism is not exercised. I desire to emphasize that Whilst preference to unionists is issue raised by this Bill , it seems to me that in essence it is a covert attack on the whole trade union movement. present Attorney-General has been responsible for some of the most bitter and strongest attacks upon the trade union movement in Victoria, and I believe that the Bill now introduced by him is but the first step to a general attack upon the broad principle of preference to unionists for which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides. There is certainly room for suspicion regarding the object which the Attorney-General has in view. The honourable gentleman said, I think, in reply to an interjection, that he would labour to sell. be prepared personally to abolish all pregoing ference. The meaning which his words conveyed to my mind was that he would seek so to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as to abolish preference to unionists, and that he would aim at the trade union movement a blow from which it would never be able to recover. This, after all, is on all fours with what is going on in other parts of the world. We know what has happened recently in South Africa, Dublin, London, and elsewhere. The Attorney-General is but true to type. He is but one of a number of men all the world over who are aiming a blow at the trade union movement.  trade unionism, but was personally opposed to preference.",147
938,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not know whether the Attorney-General has changed his attitude towards trade unionism since his retirement from State politics, but I have before me now a copy of the famous, or rather infamous, Coercion Bill which he introduced into the Victorian Parliament. It is quite conceivable that a gentleman who would introduce such a measure would be capable of inflicting the most serious and grievous wrong that could be done to any body of honest law-abiding working men.",148
939,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Unde r that Bill he even prohibited railway men from associating with other tradesmen.,148
940,Mr BURCHELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I could quote much from the Victorian Coercion Bill in support of my contention. This Bill makes an attack upon a principle that is dear to the hearts of the Labour, party, and I think that it is but the first step towards the introduction in Australia of what is known in other parts of the world, as ""The Big Stick Movement."" That [52] is the term used to describe the attempts The that are being made elsewhere to force men out of the Arbitration Courts into armed resistance against the armed forces of the employers. I was much impressed by an article which I read in the London Magazine for May, and which was entitled, "" The Big Stick: How Trusts and Trade Unions^are Coming to Grips."" On the Government side of the House we have a party which represents the large combinations of wealth in Australia, whereas on this side we have men who represent the combinations of those who have I believe that what is on in other parts of the world will be transferred to Australia, and that the question of "" The Big Stick ""-the question of armed force-wil l be raised in the Commonwealth. A representative of Tasmania in this House recently said that in certain circumstances he would not hesitate to call out the military to deal with strikers. I ask the Government to consider how far this Bill will carry them. The future is pregnant with great possibilities, so far as this measure is concerned. Judging by the experience of other countries, if there be aimed at the trade union movement in Australia such a blow as the abolition of preference to unionists generally, we shall be in danger of something leading up to civil war. I do not pose as a prophet; I am simply giving expression to my own view as to what may take place in the future, and I think that the Government would be well advised to make haste slowly with this Bill. What it purports to accomplish has already been achieved, in relation to the abolition of preference to unionists in Government employ; but it has been introduced with the further desire to create a dead-lock between the two Houses. I feel that it cannot come within that section of the Constitution which relates to dead-locks, having due regard to the surrounding sections of the Constitution. The attack that is being made by means of this Bill on the trade union movement throughout Australia will be detrimental to the well-being of the whole community, unless the Government are very careful. In conclusion, I have only to say that the question of preference to union men in Government employment has been brought right home to me as an individual, and that I therefore shall have no hesitation in recording my disapproval of this measure.

I think that I shall be in order in quoting reasons advanced by those who framed the Constitution to show that a Bill of the kind before us was not in their minds when they adopted the provision for a double dissolution.

The Minister of External Affairs was at the Convention in Adelaide. It was far from his mind that a measure such as that before us would be used to create a deadlock. In a speech at that Convention he saidAre we called upon to anticipate the probability of dead-locks? If we are, I trust very largely to the good sense of the people.

He said I now throw down the challenge, as I have done on many occasions, in the House and outside, that if honourable members wish to test the sincerity of the Government let them reject this Bill, or let them pass it through this House and have it rejected on the first occasion it goes to the'Senate. They will then have the opportunity of testing the sincerity of the Government. Mr W . H . IRVINE - If you read a little further on you will see that I expressly declined to discuss the matter.  ral also saidThe honourable member (for West Sydney), who is a lawyer, has expressed strong opinions on the duty of the Governor General in this regard; in fact he has worked himself up to an opinion that a double dissolution will be refused There has never been any answer to the challenge I have thrown out. Tf the position of Ministers is insincere, if honourable members think that, having reached the conditions under which a double dissolution may lie granted or refused, and it has been refused, Ministers would still continue to occupy these benches, let them put the matter to the test. They have their opportunity. But they are afraid to put the matter to the test. If the honourable member for Hunter seeks an answer to his question-no t my answer, but answer of the whole Government-ther e is no readier way of getting it than by giving this futile clinging to every parliamentary this holding to the banisters of the stair, this having to be dragged out of their place by giving up this wretched parliamentary chicanery and letting the Bill be dealt Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u have omitted the only material part.  quite sufficient. I have taken the records of the Convention debates to show that there is no justification for the Bill before us, having regard to what was in the mind of the framers of the Constitution. No one knows it better than the Treasurer. There are some very pertinent paragraphs which the Attorney-General has evidently read and does not wish to have repeated. When I was in terrupted by the honourable member for North Sydney I was about to say that the Tariff was the one great question that came under review at the Convention. It was alleged that a Government just returned from the country with the mandate to establish Protection, and having a substantial majority, might have its Tariff proposals rejected by the Senate, and would clearly be in great financial trouble, because the whole of the affairs of Austratoria lia would be held up ; and as the financial day. position of the Government would be affected, it was seen that a settlement would need to be arrived at. upon a case like that that the Convention had the most strenuous debates. There was serious anxiety as to what the result would be, but at the time it was pointed out that these provisions of the Constitution might be used as a machine for political purposes. Cases on similar lines we have just attended to what is now being done were citedwhere a Government for the purpose of homes. getting a majority under the false issue of a dead-lock would deliberately create trouble with the Senate.",154

It is not as if my honourable friends will be placed under any disability by doing what I suggest ; they will not. The whole scheme of discussion will be as open in Committee as it is now. I appeal to the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition to give us the second reading, since, by so doing, no privileges will be curtailed. Anything any honourable member wishes to say may be said just as full y and freely in Committee as in the House. This is one of those peculiar measures on which one cannot l i m it the range of debate, and, therefore, nothing can be lost by honourable members in allowing the Bill to be read a second time, after which we will formally go into Committee, and then adjourn.

1028,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As this matter concerns the representatives of half the Commonwealth, they should have full and ample opportunity of discussing the Bill on the second-reading stage. The number of sittings required for that purpose in the ordinary way of business would be limited, and as this Bill involves as great a principle as this Parliament has ever dealt with, it ought, in my opinion, to be given the very widest range of discussion - no t wrangling, but ample, full , and open debate. As the Prime Minister knows, I have already indicated to him will be my opinion that the ordinary hours of sitting will enable a decision to be arrived at in a better way than by attempting to force a division now or afc any other time. I cannot, and, personally, I would not, ask my colleagues to give up their right to speak on the second reading, or to discuss the Bill as full y as the Standing Orders permit before it passes from this House. In saying that, I seek no advantage for myself or any other honourable member in deliberating on this Bill . This is a deliberative Assembly, if it is anything, and I appeal to the Prime Minister, to the party in command of the House, and to you, Mr Speaker, to permit of that full discussion, because finality will only be reached after the representatives of the people have had ample opportunity to express their views in this chamber, whither they were sent by the people for that purpose.

I agree with my leader that this question may not appeal to honourable members opposite as it does* to us. We believe that the Bill is an insidious attack upon trade unionism. Every man on this side of the House has been associated, practically as long as he can remember, with the great trade union movement, and . we are all conversant with the benefits which it has conferred upon the public generally. It has, indeed, been, for many years past, a potent force in the formulation of Government policies. One would have thought that in connection with a Bill of this kind, which is designed to throw the country into the throes of a general election, the reasonable request that we put to the Ministry would be granted.

The Treasurer went on to sayI f you give the power to dissolve both Houses - the double dissolution as it has been calledallowing the Government of the day to appeal to the constituencies whenever a conflict of opinion occurs, it may, as time goes on, be used for a very different purpose from that for which it is being advocated at the present time, I can imagine that a Government which fel t itself somewhat weak, or which thought that an occasion' was an opportune one for an appeal to the country, might encourage a conflict rather of debate than try to avoid it, in order that in this way Last session it might be able to recommend a dissolution of before the both Houses, in the hope that that would, strengthen their following, or at any rate, giveit more time. . . .

I do not know whether there is any truth in the assertion, but I was told that one union charged new members £20. I was also told the other day by a man in the train that the Townsville Wharf Labourers Union is charging new members £50. . . . I desire only to say that I know nothing, about the other union referred to, but. that the Townsville union is a branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, and that that Federation has been working for the last five years under an agreement witli the ship-owners, one of the terms of which is that the entrance fee shall not be more than £ 1 .

You, sir, have heard something of "" Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep."" I assure you that I have not had the benefit of that balm during the past 48 hours. I think that we are entitled to consider the motion for the second reading from four stand-points. First, is the Bill necessary; second, what are the motives of its introducer; t h i r d , what are its aims and objects; and fourth, are they worthy? I apprehend that I shall be in order in discussing whether the Bill is necessary. In the Age of the 12th July, 1913, I find an article headed, "" Preference to Unionists."" ""Action by Government."" "" Regulation Abolished."" The first paragraph readsThe Cook Government has lost no time in abolishing the directions given by the Fisher Ministry that preference to employment in the Federal service should be granted to members of trades unions. The regulation in actual administration by the Fisher Government was carried to considerable lengths. If an official was appointed to a position in the Northern Territory, for instance, and he belonged to an occupation which had a union, he received a letter informing him that he was expected to become a member. Under the new order adopted by the Liberal Administration this practice will be discontinued. In new contracts the clause requiring preference to be given will be omitted. Where men are engaged for day labour work it will not be made a condition when they apply that they shall be unionists. The Prime Minister, in making the announcement yesterday, said: ""The preference to unionists edict has been revoked. Of course it will not affect men already in employment. We shall drop the preference clause from contracts. On day-labour works membership of a union will not be a condition of employment. All citizens will be treated alike."" That was the edict issued by the present Government.",158

I have shown that on the 12th July, 1913, the Ministry issued an edict that preference to unionists should be prohibited in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. That edict obtains today. I asked the Prime Minister the other day whether the Ministry will be prepared at all times to instruct their officers to refuse preference to unionists, and he side-stepped the question by saying that a Bill is before the House. We all know that so long as the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General are in power there will be no preference given to unionists; that is the law. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear ) hear!",159
1053,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On the admission of the Attorney-General there is no occasion for this Bill . Should we not be economical f Is there any reason why we should hamper the statute-book with printed matter which is of no force and effect? I apprehend not. I take it that the Administration are prepared to carry out their promise to effect economies, and restore the regime of economical finance. Here they produce a Bill of two or three clauses, very badly drafted I may An hon- remark, which will add to the quantity of printed literature called the Statutes of the Commonwealth. Since the M in istry have by an edict instructed their oflicers not to grant preference to unionists, this Bill is entirely unnecessary, so far as they are concerned. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That has been said in the same words, I suppose, about, a dozen times or more.",159
1054,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . The Attorney General will recollect that I pointed out the other day that constituents want to know what their member is saying in Parliament. When they open Hansard I again they will see what I have said; but if I . were to pay any attention to the interjection of the Attorney-General, that, because a number of honourable members, have said the same thing, I am not to sayI it , they would not know my views on t h i » measure. Mr W . H . IRVINE - S t ill , there is a. standing order.",159
1055,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The members of the Ministry are very like the directors of a. large company. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who employ many hundreds, possibly thousands, of employees, may issue an order to their overseers, "" Do not engage any non-unionists,"" or "" Do not engage unionists,"" or* '' You are at liberty to engage non-unionists or unionists, just as you please, all other things being equal."" Suppose that the directors of a company like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, or the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, or the Broken Hill Company, having issued an order to their overseers not to engage unionists or non-unionists, should approach the State Parliament with a request that they should makea law that the company should or should not employ unionists or non-unionists. The request would be absurd,, and the State Parliament would say to the company, "" You already have it inyour power to do what you ask authority? to do."" The Attorney-General, the Prime Minister, and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs each has it in his power to tell his officers that they shall not employ unionists or non-unionists, but shall employ a man without any preference or discrimination or favouritism on account of his membership or nonmembership of an association. Therefore, this Bill is unnecessary, - and should not encumber the statute-book.",159
1056,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is not what the other leader of your party said a few minutes ago. He said that this was the most important measure which could possibly be submitted to this Parliament.,160
1057,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,""" Every tub should stand on its own bottom"" is a very homely observation.",160
1058,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.]",160
1059,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I hope I may be allowed to say, by way of illustration, that one of the advantages of Parliament is the good results that accrue from criticism. In America there is a community called the Shakers, who have a custom of meeting together and submitting one of their number to the criticism of the others.",160
1060,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will the honourable member say what the Shaker community has to do with the Bill?,160
1061,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am. pointing out the advantages of criticism, which, by the Shakers, is used for the purpose of curing colds.",160
1062,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I must again ask the honourable member to confine himself to the Bill.,160
1063,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was merely going to say that the perspiration which resulted from the criticism was supposed to prove sufficient ' to drive away the deleterious microbes. On a second reading of a Bill of this kind we are entitled to inquire, first of all, whether it is necessary; then, what are the motives of those who introduce it ; and, then, whether those motives are worthy or unworthy. I have dealt with the question of necessity in, I think, a very concise manner, and I have now to say that, in my opinion, the motives of the sponsors of the measure are unworthy; and, further, that they hope to obtain by its means a dissolution of both Houses. As to the history of the Bill, it will be remembered that in September, 1913, a paragraph appeared in the Adelaide Register, as the result of information given by a well-known legislator, to the effect that it was the intention of the Government to introduce two test measures of a single clause each, one measure providing for the restoration of the postal vote, and the other for the prohibition of preference to unionists. On the 5th September, I asked the Attorney General whether the information so conveyed was true, and his reply was that at the proper time. I should learn the intentions of the Government. We find that the measure now under discussion is exactly similar to that which was introduced last year. The other day the Attorney-General used a metaphor, description, or simile, which, in my opinion, was not a very elegant or admirable one, when he referred to the Bill as the ""illegitimate offspring of a political syndicate."" Such language is somewhat surprising, especially from a university man; and I bring it under the attention of those other university men opposite who guffawed today when a member on this side made a slight mistake in pronunciation. The most prominent characteristic of a gentleman is consideration for the feelings of others; and yet we find a trivial error made an excuse for laughter that was vulgar and in extremely bad taste. The figure of speech of the Attorney-General only shows how, as we when boys at school were told in our copy-book heading, "" Evil communications corrupt good manners ' ' ; but, replying in the same spirit, I may say that I have been able to diagnose this Bill medically and surgically.",160
1064,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. I should like to know whether the "" illegitimate offspring of a political syndicate "" has anything to do with the Bilh",160
1065,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Capricornia will not be in order in dealing with such matters, but must keep himself to the question before the Chair.",160
1066,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am always inclined to the ideal; but when I am associated daily with gentlemen who use such metaphors, I may be pardoned if I follow their example. I find that the father of the Bill appears to be mentally and physically sound, but that the political infant is, apparently, affected with infantile paralysis. It has only one eye, and that eye, no matter how you hold the baby, is always turned frowningly towards the working classes. While it has one eye, it has two sets of teeth, and it suffers from cirrhosis or gin-liver, an ulcerated spleen, and a floating kidney.",160
1067,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have asked the honourable member to confine himself to the question, and if he does not do so, I shall be obliged to direct him to discontinue his speech.",161
1068,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You will remember, Mr. Speaker, how the Attorney-General described the Bill, and how he further,, quoting the words that Shakespeare put into the mouth of the Duke of Gloster, said it was ""deformed,"" ""unfinished,"" and ""sent before its time into this breathing world scarce half made up."" If the Attorney-General is permitted to use such expressions, surely I may describe the Bill",161
1069,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,If the honourable member will explain the application of his remarks to the Bill he will be in order.,161
1070,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire to show that this political offspring is suffering from various complaints-fro m malnutrition or marasmus-and that, as it has not grown at all since its birth twelve months ago, it would be a charity for this House to put it out of its misery. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that I have no desire to make your position more irksome than it need be under the present circumstances. I was saying that we had an indication from the press in Adelaide as to the motives of Ministers in introducing the measure.  the utterances of the honourable member for Capricornia are in conformity with standing order 274, which was amongst those placed in my hands for my guidance as a new member. That standing order provides that no honourable member shall digress from the subject-matter of any question under discussion.",161
1071,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Before you give your ruling, Mr Speaker, I beg to submit that I ought to be permitted to discuss the merits of the Bill and the motives of the Government by whom it is introduced. In considering a Bill, we have to ask what are its aims and objects; and, therefore, we have to consider the motives of its sponsors. I was dealing with the intentions of the Attorney General, and proving that he, and those who support the measure, are doing so with ulterior motives. That, I think, I am entitled to do; and if I can show that the Bill is unnecessary from an administrative point of view, and that the members of the Government have something more in their minds, surely I should be allowed to voice my objections.",161
1072,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the honourable member proposes to discuss the objects of the Bill, he is certainly in order, for that is what I have asked him to do each time. I have had occasion to draw his attention to the fact that he was wandering from the question. As to Ministers, the honourable member is not in order in imputing unworthy motives to any honourable member.",161
1073,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is, I know, a standing order providing that no member shall impute ""improper"" motives to another, and I can assure you, sir, that I have no desire to impute such motives. I am not dealing with Ministers in a personal sense, but dealing with them as public administrators and legislators; and if you will bear with me for a few moments, I shall show both you and the honourable member for Hume that I am using fair arguments against the second reading of the measure. When the Prime Minister accepted a commission from the Governor General to form a Government, he, I apprehend, was called upon to show that it was in his power to carry on the business of the country, and, in doing so, to introduce legislation calculated to benefit the people. But the Prime Minister and his colleagues carry on the administration in a more or less inefficient manner, and introduce certain legislation which we have opposed, abandoning the practice of introducing legislation calculated to benefit the country.",161
1074,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order II direct the honourable member's attention for the last time to the fact that he is not discussing the Bill. His remarks would probably be in order on the Address-in-Reply or a no-confidence motion, but have nothing to do with the question before the Chair.",161
1075,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Permi t me to call your attention to a passage on page 472 of May, 11th edition, with regard to second readings.",161
1076,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am familiar with the passage, which contains nothing to justify the digression the honourable member was making.",162
1077,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My object was to lead up to an amendment I propose to move somewhat to the following effectInsert after the word "" That "" the following words, "" the Bill is unnecessary, will not effect any change of existing conditions, has been introduced .for party purposes, and is not of sufficient importance to be made the basis of an appeal to His Excellency the Governor General to grant a dissolution of bothSenate and House of Representatives."" I wanted to show that the Government, ""having promised the Governor General, through the Prime Minister, that they would carry on the government of the country, were abandoning that promise, and introducing a Bill having for its object, not the making of any necessary law, but the furnishing of a mere electioneering placard. The following is the passage in May: It is also competent for a member who desires to place on record any special reasons for not agreeing to the second reading of a Bill, to move, as an amendment to the question, a resolution declaratory of some principle adverse to, or differing from, the principles, policy, or provisions of the Bill, or expressing opinions as to any circumstances connected with its introduction, or prosecution; or otherwise opposed to its progress; or seeking further information in relation to the Bill by Committees, commissioners, the production of papers or other evidence, or in the Lords, the opinions of the Judges. When this Bill was introduced here on the 31st October, 1913, the Melbourne Argus said""High hopes are inspired by the amended plan of campaign of the Federal Ministry. . . . Two important Liberal principles will be embodied in two short Bills. . . . it has decided that the hour for the supreme test has arrived. . . . the Ministry, backed by a unanimous party, intends to bring about that double dissolution in the first instance."" The Bill does not alter existing conditions, because the existing conditions are that there shall be no preference to unionists. It can be intended, therefore, only for use as an electioneering placard. The Government have no justification for using the time of Parliament or spending public money for that purpose. Those arguments come within the scope of May's pronouncement. Mount Gambier, on 3rd March, 1914, the Prime Minister said It was only after demonstrating its uselessness as a legislative body under present conditions that they proposed to seek a dissolution and ask the people to return one side or the other with sufficient numbers and power and authority to make it useful. According to the Melbourne Age of 10th A p r i l , 1914, the Attorney-General saidHe would say a few words before sitting down about the actual parliamentary situation as it now existed. They knew how parties stood in the House. They knew that the Government had practically no majority. It had only a nominal majority. The position meant that the people of Australia, speaking through the constituencies, had given a just sufficient majority to enable the Liberal party to say it was entitled to carry on the government. But they could not have a more extreme travesty of representative government than they saw now with the two Houses, one of which gave a slight majority to one party, while the other gave a majority of twenty-nine to seven to Labour. A f t e r making certain proposals to alter the representation of the States in the Senate, he concludesIn the meantime, the Government had a plain duty, and it was to try and meet the trouble as it now existed. With that end in view, they would push on with the two measures, and more especially the one dealing with preference, so that if the Senate again rejected it the issue could be referred to the people. This is the Bill with which the Attorney General said he intended to push on in order to get a double dissolution. The Attorney-General has stated that it is the intention of the Government to push on with this Bill in order to get a double dissolution. It is very wrong to ask us to pass the second reading. In supporb of the contention that the Bill is unnecessary, let me draw attention to the statement in the Ministerial policy, put forward on the 12th August last, thatMinisters are opposed to any preference or favouritism in the Public Service, and have already taken steps to provide that competency and merit .shall be the sole basis of employment and preferment on the public works and in the services of the Commonwealth. They had, at that time, abolished preference to unionists. Can the Bill do anything more in that direction? Could any more non-unionists be employed if it became law, or would any more unionists At be discharged ? I think not. The argument of the Attorney-General that the Bill , if it became law, would make it impossible for a f u t u r e Government to grant preference to unionists, is a foolish one, because a Ministry which favoured preference to unionists would ignore the measure.",162
1078,Mr HANSIBVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Would they not guilty of . illegal acts?,163
1079,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What penalties are vided for a breach of the provisions this measure? The Bill merits the scription applied by the Attorney-General to another measure. It is ""deformed,"" "" unfinished,"" and has been "" sent before its time into this breathing world, scarce half made up."" I have a little prose poem consisting of the amendments which I propose to. move to insert in Commitfullest tee, but I shall not, at this stage, deal with them. The Treasurer is a gentlewould man for whom I have the highest respect, and whose career is one to be emulated. If he had in his Department an. officer who, acting in accordance with good science and the merits and equity of case, and the welfare of the Commonready read. wealth, showed preference to unionist carpenters, labourers, plumbers, or engineers, what would happen to him ? There is no provision for punishment. The Prime Minister, after much deliberation and consultation, and, no doubt, after much prayer for guidance, decided to answer my question about the nonprovision of penalties, and said that section 46 of the Public Service Act met case. That is not so. The Bill really deserves the objectionable title that Has out of order. been conferred upon it , and is an abortion.",163
1080,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That word has been ruled out of order.,163
1081,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then I withdraw it . The public should know what is the I beg to movepenalty for disobeying this proposed law. Is the offender to be punished at whim of the Attorney-General? I admire the honourable gentleman's best forensic manner, but I would hesitate to submit any person to him for punishment. Goodness knows what punishment he might order. We know what the punishments were in the olden times. understand that I am within four minutes of the time allowed to me the standing order. I must therefore reserve what further remarks I have to make for another occasion. that I would not be in order in moving for an extension of time. I have a lot of material here. As the Government say that the Bill embodies a vital principle, and that they are prepared to ask the Governor General to grant a dissolution of both the Senate and the House of Representatives should it fai l to pass the be Senate, the opposing side should have the fullest opportunity to present its views proregarding the measure. We have not had of that opportunity, not half the members deof the House having yet spoken. On the last occasion, the Bill was forced through in a single day, and we were given no in formation on several points on which we desired to be informed. As the Opposition represent nearly half the electors of the Commonwealth, we should have the opportunity to state our objections to a double dissolution. In my opinion, it be a gross wrong for the Ministry to - ask the Governor General to again within twelve months, plunge the country into the turmoil of a general election, conmerely to serve their party purposes. I the move the amendment which I have al",163
1082,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member showed me his amendment some time ago, and I then pointed out to him that it was not in order. I went to the trouble, also, of showing him authorities which confirmed my opinion. I now rule it out of order.",163
1083,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not know, sir, whethe ther I should be in order in asking, the reasons why you consider the amendment",163
1084,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When the honourable member consulted me, I gave him the reasons full y , and showed him the authorities privately, as he knows.",163
1085,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"W it h great respect, sir, That the Honourable the Speaker's decision the that the following amendment :"" That after the word ' That' there be inserted the words 'the Bill is unnecessary, will not effect any change of existing conditions j has been introduced for party purposes; and is not of sufficient importance to be made the basis of an appeal to His Excellency the GovernorI General to grant a dissolution of both the Senate and the House of Representatives,"" under is out of order, be disagreed to.",163

1087,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Boothby) [4.47] - I am opposed to the second reading of the Bill now before the House; but I wish to point out how important the measure really is. There are some honourable members present, and, possibly, a few people outside, who regard the debate which has taken place as "" s to n e - w all in g ""; but, i u my judgment, it is very necessary that so important a question should be debated at some length. Many of the electors of Australia, enlightened as they no doubt are, take some time to full y realise the importance of measures discussed in Farliament. This measure is, from one point of view, very important, although it is true that, so far as its effect, should it become an Act;-whic h is extremely improbable-is concerned, it is of no consequence whatever. Those who have taken an interest in politics for any length of time know how long it takes some people to realise the importance of political questions. Many instances of this have come under my personal observation in South Australia. There have been questions discussed in the South Australian Parliament, session after session, and still some of the people have been unable to get a sufficient grasp of them to enable them to pass an intelligent judgment as to their probable effect.",163
1088,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire, sir, to call your attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.]",164
1089,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I regard it as absolutely imperative that we should discuss this Bill at the greatest possible length, not for the benefit of honourable members, or because they enjoy listening to the speeches made here, but in order that the people outside may full y realise the underlying motive of this so-called test measure. I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to answer some statements which have been made by honourable members opposite in reference to what I had to say in speaking on the motion for the in troduction of the Bill . On that occasion I put forward certain ideas of my own in support of the principle of compulsory unionism. The idea was, apparently, not generally approved by honourable members; but I have held the views which I expressed on the subject for a number of years, though I never previously gave public utterance to them. The honourable member for Echuca, in referring to my speech this morning, repeated a portion, but not the whole, of what-T said in connection with the matter. As the honourable member's remarks will appear in Hansard, they will give the people of Australia to understand that I made the bald statement that the Wharf Labourers Union at Townsville demanded an entrance fee of £ 5 0 from any individual wishing to join the union. The honourable member for Echuca omitted to say that I distinctly told the House that a gentleman I met on the express train from Melbourne to Adelaide gave me that information. He said, "" The wharf labourers at Townsville are charging £ 5 0 admission fee to new members."" I explained, when repeating what I had been told, that I did not know whether the statement was true. I , personally, doubt whether there is any truth in the statement; but, even if it were true, or if the union in question charged an entrance fee of £ 1 0 or £ 5 , while that might be too much to expect any working man to pay, the union might have very good reason for fixing the entrance fee at such an amount. Many honourable members on the other side, and some on this side, may have found it necessary, for financial reasons, to do what they would not otherwise have done; and it is possible that the Wharf Labourers Union at Townsville may have had good financial reasons for fixing a high entrance fee, if they have done so.",164
1090,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am again compelled, sir, to call your attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.]",164
1091,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We must recollect that some men have been members of these unions for for ty odd years, that during that period their subscriptions have aggregated a considerable sum, and that to be members of such organizations meant persecution and to have to submit to many hardships. To protect themselves, therefore, it may be necessary to charge new members a considerable entrance fee. The same practice. obtains in all lodges. New entrants are required to pay a higher admission fee than that exacted from older members. I observed at the opening of my remarks that this Bill , though unimportant in itself, is important from some points of view. A f t e r all, it lays down a principle-the principle that unionists who haye abandoned the brutal weapon of the strike, and are prepared "" peacefully to submit their industrial disputes to"" the decision of an Arbitratio n Court, shall be denied a preference in the matter of obtaining employment. Of course, that is not the reason why the Government regard the Bill as an important one They consider it important, because they believe that it will provide them with a really good electioneering placard. They tried it at the last elections, and it is quite true that as a placard it may have influenced the votes of some persons with whom their canvassers came into contaot. Indeed, as an electioneering placard pure and simple, I admit that skilfully used by unscrupulous individuals in a house-to-house canvass it might prove of very great value indeed to the Liberal party. The position could be put in such a plausible way as to make many electors think that if they supported the principle of preference to unionists they would be giving away their rights as free-born British subjects. But it must not be forgotten .that representatives of the other great political party would also be on the warpath, and that they would do their best to show the electors that the abolition of preference to unionists is not in the best interests of the industrial peace of the Commonwealth. This measure has been put before us for the avowed purpose of enabling the Liberal party to secure a double dissolution. Nothing has ever been said by them in respect of a single dissolution. Obviously that would not suit their views. 'I do not blame my honourable friends opposite r'or not being eager to obtain a single dissolution, because I know how Ihey would be likely to fare in such circumstances. If they obtained a dissolution of this House alone, what possible fighting spirit could be infused into the hearts of their supporters? We all know that the adherents of the so-called Liberal party have not the religious enthusiasm of those of the Labour party. But even the little enthusiasm which they might otherwise feel would be absolutely knocked out of them if they were called upon to exercise their franchise to procure the return of representatives to this House alone. Let me illustrate my meaning by a reference to the electors of Corio, which is represented by my honourable friend, Mr. Kendell, Naturally the Liberal supporters in that constituency would go to the poll in a very half-hearted manner in the event of a single dissolution, because they would reason, "" We intend to vote for the Liberal candidate, but if the Liberal party obtain a majority of even Mr Dankel. twenty in the House of Representatives - a n extremely unlikely contingency-the advantage thus gained will be of no earthly use, because there will still be a solid phalanx of twenty-nine Labour representatives in the Senate as against, seven Liberals."" That, I repeat, would knock a lot of the fighting spirit out of the Liberal supporters. Of course, it would probably be urged that in the event of the House of Representatives alone being dissolved, and of the Liberal party proving triumphant at the polls, the Senate would no longer prove recalcitrant and pass these so-called test measures. I admit that I would adopt that course in such circumstances if I were a senator. But other measures would require to be brought forward, and a lot of the fighting spirit would thushave been taken out of the Liberal voters. I think that the floating vote would probably support the Labour party, seeing that that party has a vast majority in the Senate. In such circumstances, naturally the electors would argue that they would be acting wisely if they voted for the Labour candidates for the House of Representatives, and thus gave that party a majority in both branches of the Legislature. It must be obvious, therefore, that all the fighting enthusiasm would be eliminated ""from the supporters of the Liberal party. But what about the enthusiasm which would be kindled in the minds of the adherents of the Labour party? I venture to say that our supporters will manifest a great fighting spirit even if a double dissolutionshould take place, but that fighting spirit will be greatly enhanced in the event of only a single dissolution occurring.  mit that the remarks of the honourable member are not relevant to the Bill.",164
1092,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I confess that I was not following the honourable member's remarks very closely at the moment, but I ask him to confine them to the motion which is before the Chair.",165
1093,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I beg to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],165
1094,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wa alluding to the s fact that several members of the Government, and, I believe, the rank and file on the other side, have said on the floor of this House, and in another place, that this Bill was a means to an end, the end being a double dissolution. And I pointed out how, in my opinion, that would affect the vote to be given at the next election, if there should be, not a double dissolution, but a single dissolution. Most honourable members on the Government side are men of common sense, and have had experience of electioneering, and they can judge whether my conclusions are correct or otherwise. My opinion is that, if there is a single dissolution, it will sound the death-knell of the Liberal party, because of, firstly, the attitude of their own supporters, the true-blue Liberals or Conservatives, the anti-Labour crowd; secondly, the mental attitude of the floating ' vote; and, thirdly, the increased fighting spirit which would be put into the supporters of the Labour party. We would be on a very good wicket from the beginning, and I am sure our supporters would be only too eager to record their votes for their own party. It may be said that with me the wish is father to the thought; but I have come to the conclusion that a single dissolution would spell political suicide to the Government party, and able constitutional minds' in all parts of Australia have said that the granting of a double dissolution on such a Bill as this is inconceivable. I was very pleased to read in Hansard that such a logical mind as that of the Attorney-General approved of my idea that the only solution of a very large part of the present industrial unrest is by the adoption of compulsory unionism.",165
1095,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I said that was a logical and necessary result of your argument.,166
1096,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so; but the honourable member made a mistake when he said that it would be necessary under compulsory unionism for the unions - and their transactions to be under Government supervision. As a matter of fact, there is Government supervision of trade unions at the present time, just the same as there is of friendly societies. 1 believe that practically all the unions are registered in either the Commonwealth or the States, and they are compelled to furnish to the Registrars a financial statement. That same Government supervision should continue under compulsory unionism, and I do not think that it need be any more strict.  ber say why the balance-sheets are not made public!",166
1097,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whether they are all made public I do not know, but the balance-sheets of unions affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council in Adelaide are certainly printed, and distributed in thousands free of cost to members of the unions, and if the honourable member desired to get a copy of any particular balance-sheet, I do not think it would be refused. What a grand thing it would be if a scheme of compulsory unionism could be adopted. I do not think that the difficulties in the way are as insurmountable as some honourable members seem to think. How much difference is there between compulsory unionism and compulsory industrial insurance, which embraces all classes of workers, male and female ? In Europe, compulsory insurance has achieved wonders, and has operated practically without a hitch. Why, in the name of all that is good, could we not have the same result with compulsory unionism) The money paid at the present time by the workers to their unions amounts to much more than the premiums they would have to pay for insurance.",166
1098,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Compulsor y insurance does involve a form of compulsory unionism. In England it is worked by means of the industrial associations.,166
1099,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then if we had compulsory unionism it would be much easier to give effect to the desire of some honourable members on the Government side, that a system of compulsory insurance should be introduced. The sentiments of the unionists themselves may be against the compulsory principle at the present time, but if it became the law of the land opposition. would soon pass away, and the benefits which would accrue would be very great indeed, because a good deal of the present industrial turmoil would be done away with. If the Government were to go the whole hog, and do away entirely with preference to unionists, they would bring about an industrial revolution. Compulsory unionism would be the means of bringing about more stability in industrial life, and making people generally more happy. It would give to employers more safety and certainty in their business, and also do away with the hardships which many employees have to put up with in a strike. It would do away with the so-called Labour agitators, who are such an eyesore to the anti-Labour politicians. It is said by our opponents that in a strike the salary of the organizers-£3 week-runs on, while the poor unionists have to be satisfied with the strike pay of 10s. or £1 a week. I do not know whether or not the organizers are paid at the same rate during a strike, but I know that, even if they do get a salary of £3 or £30 a week, I would not care to undertake the work for £40 a week. could only bring myself to take the part of a strike leader for love of the cause. No money would tempt me to take a leading part. I never had the to belong to a trade union. brief period that I worked for other persons, there was no union in my calling, and just before I was out of my teens I became an employer. My knowledge of the political Labour movement cient to satisfy me that the organizers have a very strenuous experience at all times, particularly during a strike. his speech the honourable member Grey quoted from a book on Socialism and Preference to Unionists, which was ably written by the honourable for Darling, who is looked upon, even by the Attorney-General I think, foremost authority on union matters in Australia. One passage which the honourable member for Grey quoted described the starting of the political Labour movement here. Up to 1891 it was an unknown quantity on this Continent. occurred industrial strikes, the maritime strike, and the trade unionists perceived the wisdom of entering the political arena. They did not take this step on their own initiative, but were advised to do so by the large throughout Australia, particularly ship-owners. I well remember how, during the maritime strike, Mr Harrold, one of the great ship-owners of Adelaide, and other ship-owners had a conference their men, who were on strike for better conditions. They said to the "" Why are you so foolish engage in industrial strife? you want to use an obsolete weapon ? Why do you not set to work and elect representatives to Parliament, and thereby get your grievances redressed law?"" Little did these gentlemen that the men would take them at their word, but they did adopt the wise advice. I feel that this Bill, if passed, would be the first step, though.a one I admit, to crush unionism out of Mr Dankel existence. I would be very sorry indeed or £4 a to see a step taken to ' deprive trade unionists of the political influence which they have gained ever since 1891. It was through the energy of the organizers that the first Labour men were sent to Parliament. Senator Guthrie and ex-Senator Charleston were the first two Labour men elected to the Parliament of South AusI tralia. If unionism were made compulsory, there would be no need for this Bill , because then preference to unionists would disappear. It will be remembered opportunity that when the question of industrial in During the surance was under discussion in the I m perial Parliament, it met with great opposition outside, and that, even after the principle was enacted, a great many persons were against the idea.' But now is suffi- practically every body is becoming reconciled to it . As in the case of many other proposals, the opposition gradually wanes as the good effects are being felt. I feel In satisfied that if a politician were to profor pose to do away with industrial insurance in the United Kingdom, or in any country on the continent of Europe where member it has been established for some time, he would not receive a parliamentary seat. as the I feel equally certain that if we once take the step of introducing compulsory unionism, a good deal of the unpleasantness which we now have to put up with time and again would disappear. There would be no need for a measure of this Then kind, because everybody would be a particularly unionist. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Do you suggest craft compulsory unionism or voluntary groupings ? employers Mr DANKEL - No one can work out by the details of a scheme on the spur of the moment. The honourable and learned member might as well ask me to state ray ideas on Socialism; it is an impossibility. with It is impossible to answer the question off-hand. men, Mr W . H . IRVINE - If the honourable as to member does not insist on craft compulWhy do sory unionism, any other form of unionism would be of little value in connection with a system of compulsory insurance",166

My suggestion, if carried into effect, would abolish all the present ill-feeling between unionists and non-unionists, and would trifling banish that detestable word "" scab "" from the language. I am convinced that if compulsory unionism were made the law of the land, it would in a very short time work smoothly. I am not surprised that the idea is opposed, because all reforms are at first regarded as fads, and their proposers as faddists. Two or three years ago an Early Closing Act was passed in South Australia, under which shops in the metropolitan area were closed on the Saturday afternoon; and it so happened that about ten days after the law come into force there was an election for the State Legislature. I was a candidate, but because I had taken a prominent part in supporting the new measure, I was, as it were, boycotted, and I was defeated. At the present time, however, in the most conservative parts of the State, people are only too eager to obtain the benefits of the Act. And so it would be with compulsory unionism; the people would wonder that it had not been put into operation years ago. No law that was ever passed, or ever can be passed, is perfect; but we have to try to improve conditions as much as possible, and by legislation make our lives in this mundane sphere as pleasant as they may be. There would be no greater hardship under unionism than there is under any other law. All law means compulsion; so that if we drive, or even walk, along a street we must, for the benefit of the general community, keep to our right side. There must be law and order; and to that end there must be compulsion. Mr J. H. CATTS - I think we to have a quorum. [Quorum",167
1101,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hindmarsh) [5.50]. B - I do not care to give a silent vote, and I must express my regret that the Gois vernment have thought fit to persist with this Bill , seeing that, if it becomes will prove of no benefit to the country, and will result in rousing the most bitter passions. This is a strange measure; and I cannot call to mind any legislation introduced in any Parliament of which I have knowledge, that is at once so simple and so mischievous-so far-reaching i its effect, and yet, as I say, so supervery ficially simple. The Attorney-General greater portion has made some reference to my descripthe tion of the Bill as "" a shadow of a but I think I can show that I was full justified in using those words. As preference, the Government, by virtue their Executive authority, can, by a simple minute, prohibit it , and there is an end of the matter. Of course the Government which took such action might be challenged, but, with a majority in the House, they need not be seriously alarmed. Executive action would be an effectual solution of the difficulty, meeting, as it would, all the requirements of the case from the Government point of view; and there could be only expressions of regret on the part of the Opposition. The Government, however, prefer an enactment which is of very little value except in regard to what the Government may expect to get out of it . AB ill of this character strikes at the root of industrial unionism; but we can easily imagine that if they failed to return to power, one of the first acts of their successors would be to repeal it . That, however, is neither a dignified nor a desirable method of procedure, especially when there is little more than sentiment involved.",168
1102,Mr KENDELL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why should a Labour Government repeal the Act?,168
1103,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Because the Labour party object to it , holding as they do that industrial organization makes compulsory largely for the strength, solidarity and peace of the Empire. We are not, perhaps, so deeply concerned with what our English brothers are doing in this connection, but we have to realise the seriousness of the position as it affects Australia. A repeal of legislation should be entered on only when the importance and the seriousness of the position demand it , and it ought not ought to be mixed up largely with sentnnent. formed-] There will be no immediate effect of the ill if it pass, for the reason that the Ministerial minute prohibiting preference already in force. At the most there are only some 2,000 or 3,000 persons inlaw, it volved, and if the Government continue their bungling policy of substituting contract for day labour-and they are perfectly free to carry out their policy in this regard-it will lessen the number of men to whom the prohibition can apply. It will be seen that there is a great deal of force in the statement that the Bill n is "" a shadow of a sham "" ; and it seems strange that we should spend the of the last and present sessions in debates, over long sham,"" sittings, on a question of the kind. y To treat the Bill merely on its face-value to would simply be to play with a serious of question, because when you go beneath the surface 'you find that it is part of a well thought-out policy approaching a political conspiracy. The Attorney-General has confessed that his real reason for bringing it in is that the Government are dissatisfied with the existing state of parties in the Parliament. The deadlock provision in the Constitution was introduced, as every intelligent adult in the community knows, to cope with serious disputes between the Houses affecting the peace and welfare of the Commonwealth. It is a remarkable coincidence that when the proposal was being discussed in the Convention, the right honourable for Swan, who is now the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, showed how a weak Government could use the section strengthen their position. No doubt when the present situation arose the Government learnt the right honourable man's views, and, being a weak Government, saw an excellent opportunity scraping through by doing the very wrong which he then pointed out as possible. The Government accuse us of high and low with regard to this measure, by saying in the one breath that there is very little in it, and in the next we are going to fight it every inch of the way. The explanation is very We are fighting it partly because of sentimental associations in connection the great principle of preference to unionists, but principally because it is being used by the Government to perpetrate a fraud on the Constitution. That is a serious indictment, which may have no more effect on the Government water on a duck's back. It may even have very little effect in the country, because the ordinary mar* is too much occupied with his own affairs to study constitutional questions. That may be the reason why the Government hope to "" bluff "" the matter through. If they succeed in getting an appeal to the country, they, will tell the people that their object is to deprive these terrible Labour unions of the tyrannical power which they been using to the serious injury of the common weal. They evidently hope, by rousing the prejudices and passions of the people, to get from them a blank cheque to do what they like with. Surely those are sufficient reasons for our opposition to the measure. The Constitution provisions for its own amendment, should be amended only in a legitimate and open way. The actions of the Fusion party constitute a huge joke. ' At the last Mr Archibald. appeal to the people they told the electors that the Constitution was too sacred to be touched, yet now they have the hardihood to attempt to strain its provisions and commit a f r a ud upon-it. If anybody should set an example to the community in justice and equity, it should be the Government, but justice and equity are entirely absent from this proposal. Parliament has already, without asking private employers for their consent, passed a law establishing an Arbitration Court to settle disputes between them and their member employees, and has given the Court power to award preference. It is therefore ridiculous for the Governto ment to set up an entirely different method of dealing with disputes between themselves and their own employees. gentle- The present Government have consistently waged . war against the industrial comof munity, wasted the time of this Parliament, and aroused the most bitter passions amongst different sections of the striking people. I cannot recall any Government in Australia with a similarly bad record. Ministers have embarked upon a policy that the serious danger of which they do not recognise. The Bill sets out thatsimple. No preference or discriminations will be made for or against any person in relation with to any employment by the Commonwealth or by any Department or authority thereof, on account of his membership or non-membership of any political or industrial organization. We hear a great deal of the industrial associations which exist in Europe today. than I ask honourable members to cut out in dustrial organization from the civilization that we possess as an English-speaking people, and what will be left? Instead of this Parliament attempting to interfere with industrial organizations, its obvious duty is to strengthen them as much as possible. We hear a great deal about the civil and religious liberty which our fathers won for us. We are all familiar with the civil and religious liberty which have followed upon the revolution of 1688. But if that civil and religious liberty were excised from our English civilization, not a great deal would be taken out of it . On the other hand, if industrial organization were cut out of our civilization, there would be very little of it left. What contains has made Australians what they are toand day? Simply the grit of our ancestors on the other side of the world. Were our civil and religious liberties won by following the line of least resistance? I scarcely think so. What has been the great demand with which age after age has been confronted but the demand of workmen to be permitted collectively to organize, in order to secure the best results from their labour. The conspiracy laws of Pitt were levelled against unionists. As a matter of fact, many of the convicts of Botany Bay were unionists, as will be seen by reference to historical records. Is there any equity in the Government singling out this section of the community and practically preventing the hall-mark of competency being put upon our industrial organizations ? I submit that by granting preference to unionists, no injustice was done to anybody. Every man and woman in the community has a perfect right to employment if he or she can obtain it. But a great many persons throughout Australia have taken a prominent part in building up our industrial organizations, and have had to suffer for so doing. Now that unionists have given up the right to strike, has this Parliament nothing to offer them in"" return? Why should they be placed on a level with the individual who has done nothing to improve the lot of his fellows ? Yet, according to the line of reasoning adopted by the Government, all should be placed on the same footing.",168
1104,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"-Before the sitting is suspended, I wish to call the attention of the House to the fact that somebody has removed from my desk a volume of the 11th edition of May, containing several marked passages and reference slips. The officers of the House have instituted a search for it , but have been unable to find it. I ask any honourable member who may have taken the volume, and forgotten to return it , to please see that it is restored to my desk before the House resumes at 8 o'clock.",170
1105,Unknown,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. (Friday).,170
1106,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"In suggesting to the Government that they should not proceed further with this Bill, I am not speaking in the ordinary spirit of party politics, because I consider this too big a question to be treated in any other manner than that which the gravity of the situation demands. Scarcely a week passes without the question of industrial unrest cropping up. It is a matter of great anxiety to British statesmen; and I say, without intending offence to the present Government, that it ought to be a matter of anxiety to the statesmen of Australia. It has been so in bygone times, and I fail to see why it should not be of equally grave importance to the present Government. I dare say that.those who have led the movement of industrial organization have made some mistakes; but it must be remembered that this movement has been built up by the working people, and its leaders have not had the advantages of the finer culture bestowed by university training. It is a. singular fact that, in the history of the movement for religious and civil liberty, the industrial movement has never been mentioned. The reason is plain. The governing section of the community has been always on the side of property, and wealth, and the educated classes, and they have never had any sincere desire in their hearts to devote themselves to a movement of this character. But there are men of a Conservative turn of mind who are yet statesmen enough to realise that this movement has so much to do with Australian life that they cannot afford to trifle with it . I am not asking the Government to coddle any section of the community or to be afraid of it, but I ask honourable members to forget for a moment that they are legislators, and to look at this matter from the position of the ordinary man in the street. If we block and stifle the avenues for jglie full recognition of these industrial organizations, and if they, in turn, come to the conclusion that the parliamentary machine is of no use to them, and that they are only wasting their funds and spending their efforts for nought, the result will be that they will ignore Parliament, and they may adopt other methods to force their grievances on the community. If such a step be taken, I shall not envy the statesmen of Australia who have to deal with the question. I was in England in 1911, the coronation year, when practically the whole trade of Great Britain was paralyzed for three days. The newspapers said that the trains were running, but they did not run. That statement was all part of the game. The newspapers always stand on the side of the top dog, and the Labour party has never had their support; the reason being that they are allied with the vested interests of the community, although they live on the pence gathered from the masses of the people. making any threat, but am earnestly appealing to the Government to look at this matter in a statesmanlike way. To cause the industrial organizations to lose faith in Parliament, and in the law, would be one of the worse things that could possibly happen, and a continuance in the steps which the Government are perilously following will bear nothing of the stamp of statesmanship. Honourable members on this side of the House have been intimately connected with the labour organ izations from boyhood; they have appealed to them to trust Parliament and always get the sanction of' the law; and if we now shut them out, we shall be doing something that is not in the best interests of the country. Why is it that the learned professions are omitted the scope of this Bill? The legal profession has already been ably dealt with by previous speakers; but I would like the Government to say why the Bill does not extend to the medical profession, architects, civil engineers, and to other learned professions. All of tliose professions have their organizations, which are incorporated in the same way as the engineers, the carpenters and joiners, and other trades. It is because there is a difference, a difference that has been observed through all the ages, namely, the educated and cultured classes are not on the same plane working men; and, therefore, are singled out for special tion. What would be the consequences if the Government appointed to a State position a doctor who was not a member of the Victorian branch of the Medical Association ? The other members of the profession would work with that man. I am not quarrelling with the medical fession; but I do say that when they carry their adherence to the of their organization to the extent of neglecting the sick, they commit a barbarism that has never been by any act of a trade I think that the Government weak in this respect. What can be drawn from their conduct? it not rather late in this year of grace to go into class legislation ? What there to justify this proceeding in the conduct of industrial associations? _ I hope that the Government will recognise Mr Archibald. I am not the necessity to make some alteration. I beg to move That all the words after the word "" That "" he left out with the view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: ""no measure the effect of which will be to prevent the promotion of industrial peace by the encouragement of organizations by employers and employees can - be other than impracticable and fraught with danger to the community."" The scope of the present debate is cramped, and my amendment will give an opportunity to honourable members to discuss this question on its merits. I can cite a precedent to show that not long ago the Attorney-General approved of an amendment of a similar character. On the 18th October, 1911, Mr Deakin concluded his speech on the second readfrom ing of the Conciliation and Arbitration B i ll by submitting this amendment That no measure the effect of which will be to concentrate in any one person the control of all the conditions of carrying on all the industries of this continent can be other to than impracticable and fraught with danger to the whole community. The ex-mem""bef for Werriwa, Mr H all , challenged the amendment; the honourable member for Flinders, who is now Attorney-General, argued that it was in order; and what is most important of all, Mr Speaker MCDonald ruled that it that was in order. as the Mr ARTHUR - Rea d the Attorney(.they General's argument in favour of the legisla- amendment.",170
1107,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney General, in speaking to the point of order, saidBritish I had always understood that the only condition applicable to amendments of this kind refuse to is that they must be relevant to the subject matter of the Bill. They need not, in any respect, deal with the provisions of the Bill; pro- in fact, if an amendment did deal with the clauses, it would be ruled out of order. Some rules twelve or fourteen years ago there was a case in the House of Commons, the name of which I forget, but which can be found in May. The amendment on that occasion was that a Bill, equalled which did not make provision for a certain union. matter, was not satisfactory to the House. are very I contend that the House is in a similar inference position now. Is",171
1108,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Mr Deakin said that is the amendment was a declaration of the Liberal policy in opposition to the policy of the Labour Government.,171
1109,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"F o r the information of the House, I will read what Mr Deakin said on the point of order raised by Mr H all The amendment refers distinctly to the measure as one, the effect of which will be to concentrate the whole control of all the conditions of carrying on all the industries of the continent in one person. My argument, from first to last, has consistently returned to the same point. I contend that the only possible method of dealing with these issues is a Federal one, and that this measure is not a Federal proposal; that its effect is to concentrate in the President of the Arbitration Court for the time being the control, under new and extended conditions, of the whole of the industries of the Commonwealth. This is impracticable and fraught with danger. Nothing, I submit, could be more relevant to the measure before us.",171
1110,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will you now read what Mr Deakin said just before he moved the amendment?,172
1111,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On page 1536 of Hansard, volume LXI . , Mr Deakin is reported to have saidAs the preceding Act distinctly took the wrong road, this Bill proceeds further in the same direction. Of course, for the Opposition to challenge the measure is simply to discharge their duty. There is no possibility of our votes affecting members on the other side, whose majority enables them to dispose of this and other issues as they please. Still we are doing them the service of putting before them, as forcibly as we can, the reasons that direct our judgment. It might lead to misconception of our attitude if, in the case of a measure such as this, containing some proposals which can be made acceptable, if they are not entirely so now, and others that merit examination, honourable members on this side voted against the second reading. In order, therefore, to put their position more clearly before the people, I beg, in conclusion, to move, as an amendment on the motion for the second reading, the introduction of these words. I have already read the words of the amendment. I unhesitatingly take up the same attitude as Mr Deakin took up on that occasion, and for the same reason as he did.",172
1112,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,172
1113,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit, sir, that the amendment is not in order, inasmuch as the honourable member has shown that his intention in moving it is to give full scope for a debate on the question of in dustrial peace, thereby admitting that a discussion of that question is not germane to the Bill as it stands, and, consequently, that it is necessary for his purpose to ask the House to insert certain words in the motion. My point is that the introduction of the words must be out of order, since they are purposely submitted to enable a discussion to take place on what is admittedly not germane to the question before the House. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Not relevant? Mr ' KELLY - Not relevant.",172
1114,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"""So u had better change your ground.",172
1115,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit, further, that the illustration which the honourable member for Hindmarsh gave is in itself not really material, because the amendment to which he referred was very pertinent to the issue before the House on the 18th October, 1911. This Bill seeks to provide for equality of opportunity to all persons entering the Public Service, and nothing more. I submit that the honourable member has shown conclusively the irrelevancy of his proposition, because he has pointed out that without the submission of these words a discussion on the question of industrial peace would not be in order.",172
1116,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member who has raised the point of order does not seem to understand what the amendment is. It is exactly on all-fours with an amendment that was moved a few years ago on the motion for the second reading of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , which dealt with the question of preference to unionists, and which the present Attorney-General supported. I remember the occasion very clearly. The amendment then proposed was not only supported, but spoken to, by the Attorney-General, and by yourself, sir, in very strong terms, which, however, were perfectly in order. The amendment before us has been drafted in practically the same way, and, under the circumstances, I maintain that it is relevant, and should be accepted. Mr Speaker is not called upon to rule on the interpretation an honourable member may place on the words, and I may say that the honourable member tried to twist and tur n those words.",172
1117,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I quoted the exact words of the honourable gentleman.,172
1118,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I admit that ; but the words are not the amendment, which is a different matter altogether. By the amendment before the Chair we merely intend to declare what we on this side believe, in exactly the same way as Mr . Deakin moved the declaration of' principle, which, as I say, was supported by the Attorney-General, yourself, sir, and a number of honourable members opposite. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I think there is nothing more than a mere verbal analogy between the present case and the case which has been cited. As I pointed out in the previous case, and as has often been pointed out by you, sir, the one - question that has to be decided is, whether the amendment is relevant to the - question; and for that purpose no mere verbal identity in terms can have the slightest effect. We have to look at the question to which the amendment is said to be relevant. The amendment moved by Mr Deakin was to the second reading - of the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Bill , which provided that al l disputes should be settled by one Court. It declared that no measure, the effect of which would be to concentrate in any one person the control of all the industrial conditions of the continent, could be other than i m practicable, and fraught with danger to the community. The subject-matter to which this present amendment is said to be relevant isNo preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation to any employment by the Commonwealth or by any Department or authority thereof, on account of his membership or non-membership of any political or industrial association ",172
1119,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is that before the Chair?,173
1120,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Of because it is the subject-matter of the Bill to which the amendment is proposed.,173
1121,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It has to do with the preference given by the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act . Mr W . H . IRVINE - It has nothing to do with the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act.,173
1122,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does it not affect the preference given by that Act? Mr W. H. IRVINE - Not slightest degree. The interjection shows that, although the honourable member has been sitting here for I do not know how many, hours, listening to the debate, he has not the slightest conception of what the Bill is.",173
1123,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That , is only an assertion.",173
1124,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of and I assert again that it has nothing to do with the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act. This is a Bill to provide that no preference shall be given for or against any person on account of membership or non-membership of any political or industrial association. What is the amendment which is said to be relevant to the subject-matter? It isThat all the words after the word "" That"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words : ""no measure, the effect of which will be to prevent the promotion of industrial peace by the encouragement' of organization by employers and employees, can be other than impracticable and fraught with danger to the community."" What has that to do with Government employment, or with a Bill which prohibits preference in Government employment?",173
1125,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Everything . Mr W . H . IRVINE - It might just as well be said that no Bill which prevents a man from marrying his second cousin will meet with approval.,173
1126,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member would argue anything 1 Mr W . H . IRVINE - I think I ought to be protected from the unintelligent interjections of the honourable member, who has listened to the debate without increasing his knowledge of the Bill . I submit that, although the mover of the amendment has chosen, after a good deal of searching, a proposal which is verbally like that moved on a previous occasion, it is really a different amendment altogether, and not in order. course it is,",173
1127,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I cannot agree with the Attorney-General. The honourable gentleman says that before the' amendment can. be accepted, it must be relevant to the question; and that I admit. It is not denied that it is a principle accepted here in regard to amendments at this stage, that they may be in the usual form "" That the Bill be read a second time this day six months,"" so as to have the effect of delaying it . In May, 11th edition, in the page 472, it is statedI t is also competent to a member who desires to place on record any special reasons for not agreeing to the second reading of a Bill, to move, as an amendment to the question, a resolution declaratory of some principle adverse to, or differing from, the principles, policy, or provisions of the Bill, or expressing opinions as to any circumstances connected with its introduction or prosecution. course it is ; I submit that an amendment is entirely relevant if it sets forth the inevitable consequences of its prosecution. It is perfectly true that this is a Bill dealing only with public servants; but, at the same time, it deals with the Conciliation and Arbitration Acts. Mr W . H . IHVINE - It does not touch them.",173
1128,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If that is so, then I admit that the honourable gentleman's contention stands. I submit, however, that it does affect the Conciliation and A r b i tration Acts, because the employees whom it affects are persons who are not continuously, but only occasionally, public servants, and who are members of trade organizations, and, in a great number of cases, enjoy, or may enjoy, under section 40, preference in the terms of the Act; and that preference may be taken away, or is taken away, by the Bill . I speak with some special knowledge when I say that nothing is more calculated to promote industrial disturbance than for a boon, granted to men by law, to be taken away, not in recognition of some general moral principle, but only as applicable to those unfortunate persons who happen to work for the Government. Take the case of a man who works for a shipping company, and who, under an award of Mr . Justice Higgins, enjoys preference and other rights, conditions, and privileges, to obtain which he has complied with the law. The Government employs that person, and, immediately, his preference ceases; and the organization of waterside workers would rightly take that as an invitation to throw the whole industrial machinery into turmoil . exaggeration in what I say, for everybody knows on what an industrial volcano we live. When the honourable gentleman says that there is no relation between industrial peace and his proposal, I ask how could the relationship be more clearly established. The Bill providesNo preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation to any employment by the Commonwealth, or by any Department or authority thereof, on account of his membership or non-membership of any political or industrial nssociation. Section 40 of the Conciliation and A r b i tration Act 1911 providesThe Court, by its award, or by order made on the application of any organization or person bound by the award, may(o) direct that, as between members of organizations of employers or employees and other persons (not being sons or daughters of employers) offering or 'desiring service or employmentWhether by the Government or anybody elseat the same time, preference shall, in such manner as is specified in the award or order, be given to such members, other things being equal. I say that this Bill acts as a repeal of section 40 of the Act so far as that section applies to Government employees. If we were to declare that preference did not apply to any person in any particular trade or calling, no one would deny that it would be calculated to promote in dustrial disturbance. The amendment isThat all the words after the word "" That "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :-""No measure, the effect of which will be to prevent the promotion of industrial peace by the encouragement of organization by employers and employees, can be other than impracticable, and fraught with danger to the community."" I ask you, Mr Speaker, to look at section 55 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which deals with organizations as such, and encourages them to register, promising that their grievances or disputes shall be settled, and, if thought fit, preference given. Y e t the Government propose to remove all that, and, at the same time, they declare that their proposal is not a menace to in dustrial peace. I ask you to agree with that most eloquent and illuminating speech of Mr Deakin, when, as honourable member for Ballarat, he introduced There is no the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , and said it would make for industrial peace by "" extending the arena of law into the industrial sphere."" As a unionist who has had some experience in organization, I say that nothing is more calculated to cause industrial disturbance than to treat the employees of one employer differently from the employees of another employer. I submit that the amendment now before us is on all-fours with that proposed in the case of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , and I ask you, sir, to rule, as your predecessor ruled, and say that it is distinctly relevant to the motion. That we may in crease the scope of the debate is not to the point; the question is whether this Bill ought to receive the assent of the Chamber. Since the Attorney-General has invited us to do so, we have to consider the reason for the introduction of the measure, which reason, I submit, is not that set forth in the Bill , or even in the motion. This Bill is really introduced to enable the Government to ask the Governor General to put section 57 of the Constitution in force.",174
1129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is that Bill?,175
1130,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am talking about the real reason, and I submit that the amendment is in order.",175
1131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit that House can do nothing at this stage to widen the scope of the debate. The order of leave for the Bill has been already fixed by the House, and cannot be widened u n t i l we get into Committee.",175
1132,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How can it be done in Committee?,175
1133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The t it l e Bill can be altered in Committee.,175
1134,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How can that alter the order of leave?,175
1135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Anothe r of leave can be obtained to fit the title of the Bill . I do not know why honourable members laugh. It has been done over and over again, but at this stage the House cannot go outside the order of leave already fixed. Therefore, when the honourable member says that his proposal is to wideu the scope of the debate on the Bill , he gives the best of all reasons why the amendment is out of order. On the general question of relevancy I also submit that it is out of order.",175
1136,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General's argument that the - amendment is not relevant to the Bill is utterly fallacious. He said, with a great show of superiority of knowledge, that certain honourable members on this side had not listened to the arguments. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I said that one honourable member did not know what the Bill was about.",175
1137,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member, above all others, knows that the question of the effect of the abolition of preference upon industrial organizations, and consequently upon industrial peace, has been the whole heart of the debate. He introduced that very question in his speech, but now wants to debar us from dealing with it . He said that the question of preference to unionists raised in the Bill did not in any way touch the Arbitratio n Act . I submit that it does, although perhaps not as a rule. TheA r bitration Court has, at present, power to give preference in Government employment. If the Commonwealth, as an employer of labour, is engaged with other employers in a dispute extending beyond one State, then the Judge can regard the Commonwealth as an employer, and may in the award preference against it . Therefore, on the Attorney-General's own showing, the amendment is relevant. It has been shown again and again that the Bil l is wholly and solely an attack upon industhe trial organizations, and consequently upon industrial peace. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u have said it . We have not admitted it .",175
1138,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member does not admit anything, but my appeal is to the Speaker, and not to him.",175
1139,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! I must ask of the honourable members on both sides to ref r a in from interjecting. Mr ANSTEY . - I rise to a point of order. Not long ago you, sir, said you order would name any honourable member who interrupted. A m I specially selected for that treatment?",175
1140,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member has no right to cast any such reflection on the Chair.,175
1141,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I withdraw the reflection, and respectfully draw your attention to your own remarks.",175
1142,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member had several times interjected after I had specially called him to order. I then told him that if he repeated his offence I should have to name him. I am the judge of these matters in the House, and had already called the' Prime Minister and other honourable members to order for interjecting when the honourable member rose.",175
1143,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The whole purpose of the Bill being to affect prejudicially the organizations of labour, and consequently industrial peace, the object of the amendment is to declare the policy of this side of the House on the question. The Bill cuts right across that policy. The following passage from May, page 472, shows that the Prime Minister's contention that the amendment must be within the order of leave is untenableI t is also competent to a member who desires to place on record any special reasons for not agreeing to the second reading of a Bill, to move, as an amendment to the question, a resolution declaratory of some principle adverse to, or differing from, the principles, policy, or provisions of the Bill; or expressing opinions as to any circumstances connected with its introduction or prosecution; or otherwise opposed to its progress, or seeking further information in relation to Bill by Committees, commissioners, the production of papers or other evidence, or, Lords, the opinions of the Judges.

That is exactly the scope and intention of the amendment now beof fore us. The question before the Chair is, "" That the Bill be now read a second time."" The effect of an amendment of speaking this kind is simply to postpone the cedent, second reading.

1150,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire to give notice of a motion to dissent from your ruling in the following terms: That the Speaker's ruling be disagreed with on the following grounds:-First , that the decision of the Chair upon the amendment in question is in opposition to every Speaker in any Parliament in any English-speaking community. Secondly, that it is a violation of every precedent, and ignores every authority on parliamentary practice, is objected to. and that the decision of the Speaker is only opposed to the ruling of every other Speaker, not only a violation of every precedent, not only an outrage upon all parliaThen mentary procedure",176

"" Anti-Trades and Labour Unions Act "" is the name we should give to this measure. Any Statute that goes forth to the world from this House should not bear a meaningless name. This Bill is the outcome of the Attorney-General's hatred of the working classes, and the hatred of some of the other honourable members opposite, as, for 'instance, the honourable member for Grampians, one of the most wealthy men in Victoria.",178

When Sir George Reid was going through Australia talking about the socialistic tiger, he spoke of his party as the AntiSocialist party, "" anti "" meaning "" opposed to."" This measure is opposed to the interests of the working classes.

Therefore, I must at this stage endeavour to give to the Bill the name which I think it deserves. If the Attorney-General had included the members of the Barristers Board, the Architectural Association, the Institute of Surveyors, and other professional classes, the Bill would not be so objec"" Anti-Trade and Labour Unions"" seems to be a very apt title for the Bill in its present form. I use the word "" labour"" because there are men who regard themselves as labourers, and not as tradesmen, and I have heard frequently a debate in the Trades Hall as to the use of the term "" trades."" Many builders' labourers and others have claimed that their names ought also to be included with the term "" trades,"" and the consequence is that in many places we find the term '' Trades and Labour Council.""

1184,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,178
1185,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I withdraw that, too. We have embodied in this Bill , in as few words as possible, all the bitter spleen and malice shown by honourable members opposite towards the working classes. The people who are erecting the massive buildings in the big cities, the men who dig the trenches and put in the foundations, the stonemasons, bricklayers, builders' labourers, carpenters, plumbers, painters, and paperhangers are the wage earners against whom this Bill is directed, and it is due to them and to us that the measure should bear a proper title. If it goes forward with the title proposed by the Attorney-General, it will be masquerading. Other titles might be given which would, perhaps, commend themselves more readily to some people. For example, we might call the measure "" The Coercion Act , "" because it is of a coercive character, inasmuch as it will have the effect of coercing people not to join trade and labour unions. moment the information gets abroad that the Government have issued an edict not to grant preference to unionists, and upon that edict is superimposed an Act of Parliament to prohibit preference to unionists, all uninformed workmenand, unfortunately, there are a number of uninformed workmen-wil l form the opinion, which, perhaps, would be excusable, that it is not desired by Parliament that they should belong to unions. I shall be very glad, sir, if you will have the bells rung, in order that I may have a quorum. [Quorum formed.] In the Commonwealth there are probably over 100,000 workmen who will be affected by this Bill .",179

1188,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! I have been waiting to hear the honourable member put forward reasons in support of his amendment. I wish to point out to him that May is very clear and emphatic as to my duty in regard to the amendment, and that it is not necessary for ' him to pursue the matter further, because the amendment is distinctly out of order. On page 485 May lays down thatAmendments are out of order that areirrelevant to the Bill; governed by or dependent upon amendments already negatived; inconsistent with, or contradictory to, the Bill as agreed to by the Committee; offered at a wrong place in the Bill; or that are tendered to the Committee in a spirit of mockery.

I really feel quite pained that you, sir, have decided against me in this way. You say that I have moved the amendment in a spirit of mockery; but I assure you that it was not in a spirit of mockery that I did so, for I sincerely believe that the proper title for this Bill is, as I say, the Anti-Trade and Labour Unions Act .",179
1189,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am interested in this amendment that the Bill should be entitled the Anti-Trade and Labour Unions Act ; but the fact that you have to the conclusion that it was moved in a spirit of mockery is, I hold, no reai l l son why you should prevent other honormen able members from giving expression to their views couched in proper language. In my opinion, it is not a good ground on which to rule an amendment out of order. - I contend that the words of an amendment must be out of order on their merits to before the amendment can be properly naturuled out of order. I consider that the title is thoroughly justified.",179
1190,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! The honourable member was not in the chamber when I gave my reasons for the ruling. the In accordance with May, page 485, I ruled that an amendment which is tendered to the Committee in a spirit of mockery is out of order.",179

I am directed to exercise my common sense, and obviously May is of the opinion that it is the duty of the Chairman to exercise discretion and common sense in a question of this kind. From the passage I have read from May, it is quite clear that the Chairman must necessarily be the judge in this latter gard.",180
1194,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I notice that the mockery. passage in May shows nine grounds on which the Chairman has discretion to rule out an amendment of this kind, before the ground just quoted by the Chairman. May says, reading from the commencement of the paragraph, instead of at the endAmendments may be made in every part the Bill, whether in the preamble, the clauses, or the schedules; clauses may be omitted, new clauses and schedules added; though amendments can be moved to the granting or enacting words of money, and of other Those words are part of the framework of Bill, and are never submitted to the tee. An amendment must be coherent, and consistent with the context of the Bill ; I take it that as you, sir, passed this last reason, you agree that the amendment now proposed is consistent with the context of the Bill .",180

1197,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member must not discuss that matter, but confine himself to my ruling.",180
1198,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am merely offering an illustration. It is the easiest rething in the world to assert that an amendment is moved in a spirit of,180
1199,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What is the Bill it self?,180
1200,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill is a mockery from start to finish, because it seeks to do what does not appear on its face. I ask the Committee, who have to of decide this matter, in what way they are to judge that the amendment is moved and in a spirit of mockery? Is it by reason no of the appearance of the honourable memBills. ber who moves it? He is one of the the mildest-mannered members we have, and Commitone of the most sincere, a gentleman whose language is uniformly within the rules of Parliament. It is quite evident over that the Chairman had made up hie mind, but every honourable member who votes must be satisfied that the amendment is moved in a spirit of mockery. It seems to me that the honourable member have is offering a title that is the oba vious one, it crystallizes a considerThe able body of opinion, and his amendment ought not to be ruled out, f only for the reason that this will in terfere with the right of other honorwith able members to move amendments of the kind. If the ruling affected only the are honourable member for Capricornia, it the would be a different matter; but there order are honourable members' who desire to move similar amendments, and who ought not to be deprived of their righ t in this regard. It is very difficult to give reasons against the exercise of discretion by the Chair; and we are having rather an unfortunate experience in regard to the moving of amendments."" It would appear that amendments that have been in order ever since we have been a Parliament are out of order now, and that the Standing Orders are altogether suspended, so as to take away our rights. The Government majority is only a very small one, but its authority is being exercised without regard to the rights and privileges of honourable members under the Standing Orders.",180

1210,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The numbers being equal, I give my casting vote in favour of further discussion, in accordance with a very old and well-established precedent; but while it is my duty as Chairman to give facilities for reasonable discussion, we may reach a point where discussion becomes unreasonable, and where I should be guilty of cowardice if I did not face the situation. In the present instance, I give my casting vote in favour of the "" Noes,"" and declare the motion lost. Question so resolved in the negative.",181
1211,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I will content myself with asking honourable members in giving their votes to endeavour to realise of what a serious thing it ' is to declare that to another honourable member is not bond fide in moving an amendment which he has duly submitted to the Committee.,181
1212,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit that the of amendment does not f all under the reference made on page 485' of May. It is not tendered in a spirit of mockery, but is quite pertinent, and very appropriate to the Bill . It is well known that in this State there is a union which, although so far as I know it is not registered under ... 31 the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is ... 31 yet an industrial organization formed for the purpose of opposing and destroying trade unionism, properly so called. It is known as the Independent Workers Union. That is certainly a Bill to encourage that body, as opposed to members of bond fide trade unions, and, therefore, I submit that the amendment is perfectly in order. The fact that an amendment sets forth' a view different from that held by other honourable members is not sufficient to prove that it is tendered in a spirit of mockery. It must be such as will reduce the debate on the matter to a farce, and render the proceedings ludicrous, but there is nothing in the amendment calculated to do any such thing. It is the very reverse. The Bill proposes to prevent preference being granted because a member belongs to any registered organization. The Attorney General, when introducing it , declared that its purpose was to prevent spoils being given to the victors-to prevent us who are supported by trade unionists giving trade unionists billets. It is not contended that we give billets to members of the Independent Workers Union, so that the object of the Bill is to prevent preference being given to members of bond fide trade unions. The purport of the amendment is to substitute for the kind of association the honourable and learned member has in his mind such an association as that of the Independent Workers. The amendment, if carried, would, ineffect, make the clause readNo preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation to any employment by the Commonwealth or any ""Department or authority thereof on account of his membership or non-incnibership of any anti-trade or labour union. That would materially alter the effect of the Bill , and prevent preference being given, for example, to members of the Independent Workers Organization. would enable preference to be given to members of bond fide trade unions. For that reason it cannot be held that the amendment is introduced in a spirit of mockery, or would have the effect of reducing the debate to a farce. It is in troduced in a spirit, not of mockery, but of opposition, which is permitted, and even expected, in debating legislation. Although you may exclude it for other reasons, you cannot exclude it for the reason you have given. It is directly relevant, and could be ruled out of order only because it was, as you have said, tendered in a spirit of mockery. I [53]- 2 submit that any reason for upholding your ruling must be made out without any doubt. The mockery must be obvious, and the result must be to reduce the debate to a farce. As a matter of fact, the amendment, if accepted, will produce a piece of legislation which will have a direct effect. It will extend preference to members of bond fide trade unions, and refuse it to members of maid fide unions. Motion-That the Chairman's ruling be dissented from-negatived .",181
1213,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Bourke) [10.15] - I move That after the word "" Preference "" the words "" to Contractors, Lawyers, Doctors, and others,"" be inserted. If we are not permitted to make the title of this Bill express its real purpose, we ought, at any rate, to make it applicable to all sorts of combinations. The insertion of the words outlined in my amendment would make the measure all-embracing. We have been told that the granting of preference to unionists is objectionable, that it is a violation of liberty, and that it ought to be prohibited. That being so, what is sauce for the goose should surely be sauce for the gander. In other words, the treatment which is to be meted out to organized bodies of labour should also be meted out to organized professional bodies.",182
1214,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! I take the same objection to this motion as I did to the previous one. It is quite obvious that it has been moved in a spirit of mockery, that it is entirely frivolous, and that it is out of order.",182
1215,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I move That the Chairman's decision in ruling out"" of order an amendment by the honourable member for Bourke to add to the short title of the It Bill after the word "" Preference,"" the words ""to Contractors, Lawyers, Doctors,' and others,"" be dissented from. During the discussions which have taken place upon this Bill , the Attorney-General stated that the prohibition it contained would apply to the union to which he belongs, namely, the Bar Council. This view was disputed. What is proposed in the amendment is that words shall be inserted which will clearly indicate part of the purpose of the Bill alleged, but unprovided for-whic h is not at present expressed. I submit, therefore, that the amendment is perfectly in order. We all know that on the transcontinental railway the have employed members of the medical profession. They have also employed doctors in connection with some of the activities which are being carried on at the Federal Capital. In the administration of the Quarantine Department they have employed doctors who are members of the British Medical Association. As a matter of fact, we believe that they have been granting a preference to members of that Association. It has been stated here that they have given the preference to members of the Bar Council, and that in any litigation in which the Commonwealth might be engaged it would be impossible to secure the services of leading counsel unless they granted that preference.",182
1216,Mr GHEENE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that the honourable member is out of order, inasmuch as he is moving a dissent from your ruling , and in so doing is discussing, not the reasons why he dissents from that ruling, but the main question.",183
1217,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have been waiting for the honourable member for Cook to continue his remarks in order that I might get into closer touch with the reasons for his dissent. Of course, a certain amount of latitude is permissible, and I trust that the honourable member will not exceed the limits of that latitude.",183
1218,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I strongly object to the statement of the Government Whi p that my remarks are not relevant to the motion of dissent from your ruling . The two points with which I have been dealing relate to lawyers and doctors. The . Bill purports to prevent preference and discrimination in connection with workers' organizations, but, in connection with professional organizations,, the Government are apparently desirous of the liberty to grant preference. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I rise to a point of order. I submit that the only question which can be raised on a motion to dissent from your ruling is whether or not that ruling-is correct. Whether certain professional classes ought to be brought within the ambit of this Bill is totally irrelevant to the question of what should be its short title .",183
1219,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit that the remarks of the Attorney-General were entirely beside the point of issue. Y o u , sir, have ruled that the motion of the honourable member for Cook is out of order on Government the ground that it is a mockery, and it is upon that ground alone' that your ruling is being contested. The honourable member for Cook has been dealing with that aspect of the matter, and has been endeavouring to advance reasons why you should not regard his motion as a mockery. I contend, therefore, that his remarks are perfectly in order.",183
1220,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course, I cannot allow anything in the nature of a general debate on the Bill to take place on a motion to dissent from my ruling. The honourable member for Cook has traversed certain ground in a general way, and I am prepared to allow him to proceed a little farther in that direction, but, necessarily, the point at issue is a narrow one, and the debate must be confined within the narrow limits indicated.",183
1221,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is evident from the action of the Government Whip and the Attorney-General that they will be glad to burke any discussion on this question, because the proposed amendment goes right to the kernel of the Bill . The Government are seeking in this Bill to prevent certain discriminations and preferences in regard to the employment of tradesmen and labourers in the day labour section of the Public Service.",183
1222,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The question is the title, and not the contents of the Bill .",183
1223,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We desire to bring the title into conformity with the Bill , as we hope to amend it ; and if the Government will postpone this clause u n t i l we have discussed clause 2, this question need not be further pursued at this stage. If we do not amend the title now, we will be at the mercy of the Government in regard to a recommittal of the clause, in order to alter the title to conform to the amendments' that will probably have been made in clause 2.",183
1224,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The - honourable member is not discussing my ruling at all.,183
1225,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I submit that for the Chairman to rule that amendment out of order before the mover has had an opportunity of speaking on it , is to say that we have no right to move any amendments at all. It is all very well for members of the Government to seek to restrict the rights of honourable members representing large bodies outside Parliament, but it may be that some day they will be on this side of the House, and they ought to be careful as to manner in which the privileges of minority are abused.",183
1226,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I trust the honourable member is not making any reflection on the Chair.,184
1227,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This is a motion to dissent from your ruling, sir, and I am asking the Committee to take a view difto ferent from that which you have taken. I do not say that you set out deliberately to set aside any of the privileges of orable members, but I am asking the mittee to come to the rescue against the view you have taken, which, I submit, not in conformity with our privileges. this very point we propose to test the bona doctors associations. fides of the Government as to the evenunder handedness of justice and liberty of subject which they boast so much about.",184

I am entitled to show that the evils to be obviated by this amendment, which has been ruled out of order, are real, because, if the Bill is aimed alleged abuses existing in the community, surely it cannot be said that amendments to the Bill constitute a mockery.

1234,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The amendment mentions lawyers, but nothing about a union.",184
1235,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have already pointed out that we propose to endeavour amend clause 2. This is only the title we are discussing, and we cannot put in the title an amendment that would cover hona sheet of foolscap, because you could Comthen properly say that such an amendment was moved in a spirit of mockery. is I submit that I am entitled to show that At preference is being given to lawyers and There have come my own notice applications for apthe pointment under the Commonwealth from doctors who were members of the British must Medical Association, and the preference himinsisted upon by that Association is a question of live interest to this community.

You ruled those words out of order because they were moved by the honourable member for Bourke in a spirit of mockery, and I want to move them seriously; but if your ruling is persisted in , I shall be precluded from exercising my rights in this chamber. You have not ruled the words out of order on the ground of relevancy. Suppose another honourable member rose, and, in a spirit of mockery anticipated my moving an amendment, and you ruled his amendment out of order on the ground that it was a mockery, why should I be precluded from moving the amendment seriously ?",184

1247,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do suggest that honourable members might support the Chair on this occasion.,185
1248,Mr TUDOH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not quite sure, sir, as to whether you ruled that the method or the manner in which the amendment was moved was wrong, or as to whether its phraseology was wrong, and thereby introduced a spirit of mockery into our proceedings.",185
1249,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The amendment, as a whole, is out of order"".",185
1250,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I support the motion, because I object to the ruling. it be contended for a moment that the amendment was moved in a spirit of mockery when it is remembered that the - Government have to employ contractors from time to time? For instance, the Minister of Trade and Customs must employ carters to cart to the King's Warehouse,, in every port where there is a Customs House, uncustomed goods or goods lef t overtime in the sheds. Under this Bill , if passed in its present form, there will be nothing to stop the Minister from giving preference to the Melbourne Contractors Association, whose rules I read here last night. If the Government are anxious to penalize the workers, we have a right to amend this Bill in such a direction as to make its provisions applicable to the whole community, and not to a section of it . Evidently it is the desire of the Government to allow the contractors, the lawyers, and others to escape scotfree. No matter what the rules of an association may be, the Government will be able to give any one of these classes preference. I consider ""that the ruling is wrong because we have an inherent righ t to extend the scope of the measure, so that it shall apply to every individual and to every association in the community that is seeking advantages from , or doing work in connection with, the Government. I feel confident that, if the ruling is upheld by the Committee, it will be possible for a Chairman in the future to say that an amendment is moved in a spirit of mockery although it may be moved seriously, and, of course, the minority will have no right to discuss the question. The object of the proposed amendment is merely to prevent the Government from doing in the future what they have done in the past. We on this side have a right to stand here and try to bring this Bill into conformity with what we desire. I hope that the Committee will recognise that, although we may be a minority- a large one, be it remembered-w e have some rights. We know, on the word of the Prime Minister, that in the past the Standing Orders have been strained out of all fair proportion. He said at Cowra that the Standing Orders had been put to uses never intended. We have seen that done here time after time. These words of the honourable gentleman will be long remembered. The proposed amendment, I submit, should be made in order to place all How can sections of the community on one footing. We are anxious to attain that object, but, apparently, honourable members on the other side do not desire any alteration to be made in the measure which would have that effect. If a division is called for, I shall have much sure in voting for the motion.",185
1251,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think, sir, that a great deal of this heat has arisen, if may use the expression, from the ill chosen word which you used- "" mockery.""",186
1252,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I chose a word which is found in May as a distinct direcpreference tion to the Chair.,186
1253,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the rulin g is upheld, it will bear this construction: that the proposal in the Bill is not a mockery when it is applied to workmen, but is a mockery when it is applied to contractors. It will also be held to be a mockery when it is applied to lawyers, doctors, and others. This measure, if passed, should be a law for the whole of the people, and not for a class. I resent very strongly the use of the word "" mockery,"" which I had hoped had been unfortunately chosen. I shall insist on a division being taken, so that it may be placed on record that this amendment of the law, when it is applied to a common working man, is not a mockery, but is a mockery when it is applied to lawyers, doctors, and contractors.",186
1254,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have been in Parliaan ment for some years, but I have never known this passage May to be brought into use before. Apparently we are digging up old, antito quated customs of days gone by, in order to conduct the business of a modern sembly. In those days there may have been men of a frivolous nature likely to submit ridiculous motions and amendI ments; but nowadays a Chairman of mittees should, irrespective of the authoview rity of May, interpret proposals in the light of modern knowledge, and keep clearly in mind the objects which able members may have in view. It is a grave responsibility for a Chairman decide that a proposal is made by an orable member in a spirit of mockery, it is a reflection, not only on the honortitle able member who, according to his lights, is endeavouring to make a measure effective and widen the scope of the proposed law, but it is a reflection on able members generally. The given by the Chairman for ruling this amendment out of order",186
1255,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Tlier e may be other reasons, but I gave the most vious one...",186
1256,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"H a d any one of the. pleaother eight reasons in May been relied on, the case might have been different; but it seems to me that the reason chosen I for declaring the amendment out of order - is not warranted under the circumstances. This Bill is put forward as an endeavour to protect the public from favouritism or in the Public Service, .and I submit that it is just as essential that the public should be safeguarded in the employment of contractors. To limi t the application of the Bill is to curtail the liberties of honourable members and their right to amend the measure in what they may consider useful directions; and I sincerely hope that we shall not have too much experience of such rulings as that now under discussion. In al l my experience in this and other Houses of Parliament I have never known an honourable member to be told that he has acted, in a spirit of mockery, and that, therefore, a proposal by him is not in order. The ruling is not in keeping with the times, nor with the objects and aims of the mover of the amendment. It ought not to be concluded that the proposal is put forward in a spirit of mockery merely because it comes from a certain source; amendment should not be judged by the man who proposes it , but on its in merits. The object of the amendment is, as I have said, to give further protection the people of the country, and it is imperatively necessary that there should Asbe. some safeguard, apart from the control of this House, against favouritism and preference to contractors and others. f , Mr Chairman, you say to an honorComable member who has that object °n",186
1257,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I remind the honourable member that we are now discusst honoring the title of the Bill .,186
1258,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are discussing the to ruling of the Chairman on the amendhonment moved by the honourable member for for Bourke, and that amendment is in the which covers the object of the Bill , that object being to prevent preference more to certain bodies of people.",186
1259,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable honormember will understand that we are now reason in Committee, and we cannot discuss the Bill under the clause dealing with the title.",186
1260,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If that be so, how obdoes it come about that the Chairman can read an honourable member's mind, and judge as to the genuineness or otherwise of the amendment? It exhibits a sort of thought-reading on the part of the Chairman when he bases his ruling on some sort of knowledge he possesses as to whether an honourable member is or is not sincere and in earnest. I fancy that if the precedents could be consulted, would be found that the ruling in May, on which the Chairman relies, has never been given in a case where an amendment was, as on the present occasion, to the purpose of the Bill. We shall find ourselves unable to move any amendment, however relevant, if we are to be faced by such a ruling as that now under discussion. Looking at the matter from a common-sense stand-point it would seem that the liberties of the House are being restricted, and the power of honourable members to frame Acts of Parliament frustrated. I am astounded that such an interpretation as has been given should be read into words, the object of which is to make the Bill more effective. I cannot see any evidence of a spirit of mockery, because such an amendment is required in view of the need there is for some preserving power to govern such actions as those of which we have had experience in the last few months. We are now trying to prevent preference being given to contractors; and that surely is a reality, and not a mockery ? Preference has been given to contractors, with the the Commonwealth has suffered loss, and to some extent has been hampered and somewhat lowered in public estimation, so far as the administration of our public affairs is concerned. Bill of this kind, this is the only chance we have to give voice to our opinions and to broaden our legislation; and, as I said before, I regard the ruling as a reflection, not only on the mover of the amendment, but on the party with which he is associated. It is much to be regretted that the merits of the amendment should be decided oh such an ancient interpretation or ruling as that which has been quoted. Whatever the Chairman's opinions may be, I seriously suggest to him that he is on dangerous ground, and that he ought to see the wisdom of withdrawing the ruling. This he could do with honour, if he realizes that his view is a. wrong one. I have no desire to take Up time in discussing this matter, but wish rather to facilitate the public and to get at the root of the trouble with Mr Webster. which we are dealing. I can readily understand that, with the continuous sittings, the Presiding Officer may not be quite so clear in his comprehension, or so alert, as he is under ordinary circumstances ; and this affords another reason for his reviewing the decision at which he it has arrived. Should he"" decide to retrace his steps, he will thereby restore to the House those rights which I feel are being quietly frittered away. We ought not to relevant be living on precedents, but making them; and we now have a chance to take our own course. If the ruling is, as it may be, upheld, I sincerely hope the position will receive serious consideration, so that the legitimate objects of honourable members may not be defeated.",186
1261,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am deeply surprised, after our long association, Mr Chairman, that you should reflect on me in the way you have, for it seems to me that your decision can be regarded in no other light.",187
1262,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I must ask the honourable member to discuss the question before the Committee.,187
1263,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You , Mr Chairman, have decided that I moyed that amendment in a spirit of mockery, and I resent that ruling as holding me up to opprobrium. What is there in my conduct, as a member of this House, to lead you to believe that I would submit any proposal in a spirit of mockery? Tliere is result-that in the amendment an entire absence of serious mockery. The clause prohibiting the granting of preference to unionists is it self a mockery, and you would be properly exercising your functions if , when On a it came before you, you swept it out of existence. The terms which you apply to my amendment may very well be addressed on a subsequent occasion to the clause itself, for the benefit of the Government. Will you kindly explain why you have come to the conclusion that the amendment is submitted in a spirit of mockery? Will you tell me what there is in it of an ethereal character? There is nothing spiritual or spirituous in it . It is a material proposition. It deals with contractors and lawyers. Surely, they are material enough. If you will kindly tell me what there is spiritual in it , or what mockery there is in it , I will listen to you with delight. Will nothing I can say induce you to give us a few reasons for your ruling? Can nothing I say business, ' draw you from your stolid silence in order to extend our knowledge on the subject? It would save a large amount of time on subsequent occasions if we knew what you mean by spirit, and what by mockery. Can we not arrive at a clear and definite understanding which will guide somebody else when he occupies the Chair when, worn out with your labours, you retire to the rest you deserve. This matter is highly important. Once more I appeal to you, I supplicate you, to provide us with reasons on this all-important subject. Are you prepared to give the same decision on every amendment that is put before you ? I have advanced a hundred reasons why you should advance one for our consideration. If I could only argue long enough with you, I am sure you would withdraw your ruling, which is injurious to our deliberaents, tions. Farliament cannot come to a proper decision if you are going to rule out an amendment upon purely hypothetical grounds. What do you mean by spirit? In what way do you apply the word? It has a wide meaning. There is the spirit of morning, the spirit of night, the spirit that walks in gloom, the spirit that guards our slumbers, the Scotch spirit, and the Irish spirit, the spirit of our race, and the spirit in and out of bottles. You surely do not mean to insinuate that that is the spirit animating us in our deliberations at this hour ? You know it is not. It is not even the spirit of coffee or tea. All words have a meaning; what is the meaning of this word upon which you rule out every endeavour on the part of myself or my colleagues to table some proposition which will express our views ? Leaving the word spirit to mean what it may-and God knows what it does mean in the mind of the Chairman- I come again to the word mockery. From your long knowledge of men, have you any conception or idea that I would attempt to move anything that amounts to mockery? The Bill is a prohibition of preference. We want to lay down to whom that prohibition is to apply. We want it to apply, not to a few purely industrial organizations, but to honourable gentlemen like the Attorney General. May we not enlarge the Bill to apply the prohibition of preference to some particular class ? As it stands now, it contains some words signifying nothing. I protest against anyruling by any Chairman upon grounds so flimsy. If such a ruling is upheld, no motion or amendment can ever be moved in this chamber with any certainty that it will be accepted. On the grounds I have stated, it is high time that we disagreed with your ruling, and I therefore support the motion. Motion-That the Chairman's ruling be dissented from-negatived .",187
1264,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Cook) [11.25] - I move That after the word "" Preference"" the following words be inserted: "" to the Bar Association, to the British Medical Association, to the Contractors and Employers Associations, &c.""

The amendment deals with the question of preference or discrimination which is the subject-matter of the Bill, and I submit that I am entitled to move it on the title of the Bill as a preliminary to a proposed alteration which will be submitted on clause 2. The amendment is consistent with the Bill, and as amendments may be made, according to May, in any part of a Bill, I contend that I am entitled to submit it. Some honourable members may think it would be better to move the amendment in another part of the Bill, but the point is not whether they like the title with those words in it or not. The whole point is that it must be consistent with and relevant to the Bill, and this amendment is both. I object most emphatically to the class nature of the measure before the Chamber. It is aimed directly at the trade union organizations of this country. There are other associations which it is more than doubtful whether the measure covers, and now is our opportunity to make sure that the scope of the measure includes the professional classes as well as the tradesmen gathered together in trade organizations. There have been references throughout the debate on the measure, to the question of extending the prohibition of preference to the Bar Association, British Medical Association, and the Employers Association. If there is to be preference, we should see that it is all-round preference, and not one to suit a particular class. We know that the trade-union movement has been made the target for the attacks of those on the other side. Governments which have preceded the present Government have been guilty of favouritism to their particular friends. The matter was brought up time after time in the Senate. The Deputy Postmaster-General in Victoria publicly objected to ence that Liberal Governments extended to individuals in the Postal Department.",188
1265,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is generalizing too much.,189
1266,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is our aim to see that this favouritism is not extended. Therefore, I shall move an amendment to clause 2.",189
1267,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member cannot, in discussing the short title, discuss what he intends to move in another portion of the Bill.",189
1268,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Government in their programme last session, stated that they intended to introduce a measure dealing with favouritism in the Public Service.",189
1269,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member cannot discuss the Bill on the short title.,189
1270,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I propose to alter the title to cover certain groups of associations, and I submit that, in order to sented from. prevent any similar discrimination or favouritism being given in the future, entitled to discuss those associations and the manner in which they are operating in the Commonwealth employment, also the manner in which so-called Liberal Ministers have, in the past, given favorittitle. ism. The British Medical Association have been asserting a claim to discriminacan tion or favouritism. The friendly societies have had experience of their claim.",189
1271,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is delivering what is practically a second-reading speech. I cannot allow any honourable member to discuss questions of preference on the short title of the Bill.,189
1272,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On the next clause I shall take the opportunity to do so. Representing large bodies of workmen the Bill aims at prejudicing, and is directly aimed at, I can only enter my protest against the title given to sure. The Bill is most obnoxious and extreme class legislation, and I desire to have the title altered in order to indicate that the National Parliament is going to deal fairly with all classes. ing that the measure is aimed at what trade unions have won for themselves in spite of honourable members opposite and those who preceded them, I should have the opportunity to alter the title and take out of it some of the class-poison it contains. The preference gained by trade unions has been won in the teeth of hon the prefer- orable members opposite.",189
1273,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is again out of order.,189
1274,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I trust we shall take a vote to test the bona fides of the Government. There may not be another opportunity, as one never knows what may happen in a House where proceedings are conducted in such a manner as in this. Let us test the spirit of fair play that Ministers talk about, and see whether they are prepared to agree to legislation that will have jurisdiction over all classes of the community.",189
1275,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As the honourable member proposes to insert in the short title certain particulars that would altogether destroy its pretence to be called a short title, I must rule, on the ground of common sense, that the particulars proposed to be inserted are quite out of order.",189
1276,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I move That the ruling of the. Chairman be disI am The Chairman has ruled out my amendment because it does not fit in with common sense.,189
1277,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I also pointed out that it destroyed the short title as a short,189
1278,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"On what authority the Chairman say that the short title should be limited to so many words? The Chairman has given us an absolutely arbitrary decision, without rhyme or reason. He does not say that the words I propose to insert are irrelevant, or that the subject-matter of the amendment which has been discussed for days by the Attorney General, by the ex-Attorney-General, and by other leading members of the Chamber, is inconsistent with, or contradictory to, the measure; but he says that no one may submit an amendment to enable the title of the Bill to be the mea- declared in a certain number of other words. Such a ruling is preposterous. As to the further objection that the amendment is opposed to common sense, one would think that the See- Chairman had sought for the most insulting word in the dictionary to apply to it . A man who resorts to epithets exhibits his weakness.",189
1279,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I used no epithet; and the honourable member is not in order in reflecting on the Chair.,190
1280,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You amendment was against common sense.,190

Those subjects comprised Bills dealing with the prohibition of preference or favouritism in Government employment, and the restoration of the electoral provisions for voting by post. Honourable members will observe strange difference between this Bill and that referred to in the Governor General's Speech. If any evidence were necessary to show that this Bill has for its in tent and purpose anything but the prevention of favouritism, it is to be found in the difference between what the Governor General said it was to be and what it really is. Honourable members will search in vain in this Bill to discover any word to indicate that favouritism is not to prevail.",193

1334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable gentleman contend that everything that appears in the Governor General's Speech should be also in a Bill? .,193
1335,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I can understand from what the Prime Minister now says that he regards it as a matter of indifference what is put into the mouth of the Governor General.,193

1342,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister has just assented to putting the word in , and now he withdraws; and why? Because the Government intend to use their power to discriminate against unionists, and to put on their favorites. Favoritism is being used, and will be used, but the Bill says specifically that unionists shall have no claim. They may fight the battles of their union for preference, and suffer for it outside, but if they seek Government employment they are not to get it .

A Royal Commission in England has just reported to this effect. Strange to say, the Commissioners do not condemn the practice utterly. They have gone no further than saying that when the patronage is exercised by a Government, Parliament should be supplied with the qualifications of the persons who are employed. In Australia no prominent Labour man was appointed to the Public Service before the advent of Labour Gohonvernments, and it is only since Labour Governments have come into power that, is one or two of Labour sympathies, which but they expressed openly and honourably, have been employed; yet the Labour Go the vernments have been accused of political patronage of the worse kind. Not 10 per cent, of Labourites have been appointed offices of patronage in the States or the Commonwealth. Facts are very stubborn things. Two men in particular have been referred to. Mr Ryland is one of to them. The Minister of Trade and Customs sneered at his qualifications. the",194
1365,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is on a par with procedure well, I shall not say it ; but I do say that I have never publicly criticised Mr Ryland's appointment, nor sneered at his qualifications.",194

I further illustrated my point by indicating a person who was appointed by ourselves, but who has been superseded by this Government. Some honourable members opposite suggest that he was unfit for the position.",195

1381,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Government may either pass this Bill in a form that aims a blow at unionism, or use it as a placard, declaring that it is to prohibit favouritism, while at the same time it leaves open the door to the patronage that can be given by any Government to its friends and supporters. If the Government are anxious to adopt the open course, they will accept my proposed illus- amendment, since it would place the friends of any Government in exactly the same position as an ordinary citizen in respect of employment in the Public Service. At present that need not be. I move That after the word "" No,"" line 1, the word "" favouritism "" be. inserted.",195
1382,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [1.20 a.m.]The Leader of the - Opposition says that this Bill does not aim at putting down favouritism. If it does not, then I am at a loss to know at what it does aim. Before the r i g ht honourable gentleman and his colleagues took office, the rule in regard to the temporary employment in the Commonwealth service was thatWhenever, in the opinion of the Minister of a Department, the prompt despatch of the business of a Department renders temporary assistance necessary, and the Commissioner is unable to provide such assistance from other do so ? Departments in the State in which such assistance is required, the Permanent Head or the Chief Officer shall select in such manner as fuss? may be prescribed from the persons whose names are upon the prescribed register in State in which such assistance is required, such person or persons who are available as appear to be best qualified for such work. . . . That was the rule before the Labour Government issued it£ Executive minute. It was laid down by the Public Service Act that the men best qualified for such work should be appointed. U p to that time no Government knew or cared anyin power ? thing about the political or industrial opinions of an applicant for employment in the Service.",195
1383,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But that rule did not apply to day labour.,196
1384,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have just quoted fro m the Public Service Act the provision relating to the temporary services of Commonwealth. The Labour party, on coming into power, however, issued order that, other things being equal, unionists should be preferred.",196
1385,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hear , hear!",196
1386,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That meant, not that the best man qualified for a position should be selected, but that, other things being equal, a unionist was to be presorry ferred for temporary employment i the Commonwealth Service. two men of equal ability applied posely for such a job, then the unionist had to receive the preference. Labour party have expressed the hope that unions will take political action. The honourable member, for Denison, conference held about June last, urged, with Mr Earle, that the unions should come political in their action. Their tics are the politics of the Labour so that honourable members opposite defitness. sire the unions to take political to support and keep them in Parliament. The Labour Government issued an opinion Executive order declaring that, other things being equal, unionists should appointed in preference to non-unionists in temporary and casual employment i the Public Service. In other words, preference was to be given where unions were political to those who politically ported them. Was that not favouritism ?",196
1387,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No .,196

The right honourable member for Wide Bay n interjected, "" What about favouritism?"" but in his speech a few moments ago he indicated pretty clearly his attitude, when suphe said, "" I will stand by my f r i e n d .

That was so apparent, that no member in his sober senses could come to any other concluvice sion. I wish to help the Government i protecting the Public Service from political or other improper influence. I do not think that it has yet been subjected to such influence, but we are legislating for the future. The Government succeeded in carrying the second reading of the Bill by tactics which do not do the Commonwealth. them credit, and though it is galling to be defeated in such a way, the Opposiused. tion must submit.

1424,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Government has erected monuments there that will remain for ever.,198
1425,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I stand by my friends when they are down and are being improperly treated. In the Queensland Parliament there was quite a brother-inlaw epidemic at one time. When the Labour Government took office in Queensland in 1899 for a brief period, it discovered that the so-called Liberal party had favoured their friends in every possible way. The great Barron Falls were given away secretly to favorites. There were scores of agents for syndicate railways in the State, but they all l e ft within a week of our coming into office, and, ever since, syndicate railway proposals, so far as Queensland is concerned, have been dead. I need not defend my own Government's acts, because they are public, and have been long before the country. As to the appointment of Mr George Ryland to be Director of Lands in the Northern Territory, I urged Mr Ryland to accept the position, because I thought that he would make an exceptionally good public servant. In my opinion, no man would more readily do everything possible to help settlers in the Northern Territory to make a beginning. I am sorry that the Commonwealth has lost Mr Ryland's services. As to the appointment of Dr Jensen, if there is an able geologist and scientist in Australia, that gentleman is one. Whatever his political creed may be, the Commonwealth is lucky to be getting his services at the price that is being paid for them.",198
1426,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Capricornia) [1.45 a.m.]. - I wish, first of all , to protest against the brutal tyranny of the Government in forcing the Bill through in this way when we have been nearly 48 hours without rest. I am surprised that the Prime Minister did not at once accept the amendment. Did not the Government put into the mouth of the Governor General the wordsThose subjects comprised Bills dealing with the prohibition of preference or favouritism in Government employment. Preference and favouritism are two different things. Of two men seeking work from the Government, one may be preferred to another, but in order that favouritism may be exercised, it is not necessary that an individual should seek employment. The members of the Government might know of some persons to Fisher whom they would show favouritism, as Governments have done in the past. It has been suggested that the late Ministry were guilty of favouritism in giving a position to Mr George Ryland, who was at one time member for Gympie in the Queensland Parliament, and to Dr Jensen, a very successful and able U n i versity student. Dr Jensen had a more distinguished scholastic career than even the Minister of Trade and Customs, whose name appears in Who's Who as a distinguished scholar of Ormond College. 1 make the comparison, because it has been suggested that a wrongful preference was shown by the late Ministry in appointing Mr George Ryland and Dr Jensen. Those two little appointments are like the swallow which does not make a summer. If life were not too short, we might look into the appointments made by the present Government, and by Governments with which the Prime Minister was associated under Sir George Reid and others.",198
1427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Would it not be better to let these men alone. W hy drag their names in ?,198
1428,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister knows that he made a victim of Mr . George Ryland. That gentleman was deprived of his position by the Government, not as an act of favouritism, but because of their antipathy to unions and to Labour politicians.",198
1429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Nobod y believes that but the honourable member.,198
1430,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish I had the time to go through the long list of appointments made by Liberal Governments to show the preference and favouritism they have shown, not to men who had succeeded in.spite of great obstacles in working their way up fro m the ranks, but to the "" curled darlings of society."" Liberal Governments have never been known to give a Labour sympathizer an appointment. They might give a Labour sympathizer a temporary job in the Post Office as a letter-sorter or some. humble position of that kind, but honourable members opposite cannot mention an instance in which a Labour sympathizer has received from a Liberal Government an appointment worth £300 a year.",198
1431,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Such appointments were made before we had a Labour Government in New South Wales.,199
1432,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If so, it must have been when the Liberals had the support of the Labour party, and thought it wise to throw them a few crumbs. We have found it necessary on many occasions to amend the wording of Bills introduced in this House, and the insertion of "" f a v o r it is m "" in this Bill would make the measure more perfect. What is the objection to the insertion of the word?",199
1433,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is already provided for by the words of the clause.,199
1434,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No . One gives a preference to one of two persons, but favouritism is in a different category altogether. I suppose that honourable members opposite decline to make any alteration whatever in the Bill , and are determined .that it shall consist only of the few words it now contains. torney-General, I suppose, in drawing up the clause, thought that the fewer the number of words in the Bill , the less talk there would be upon it . But that does not always follow. As honourable members are aware, many long Scotch sermons have been preached on very small texts. I hope the country will observe the tactics of honourable members on the Ministerial side, who, but for an occasional "" s p l u r t "" from the Minister of Trade and Customs, remain silent, with the sullen determination to force the clause through in its present form, and defeat the amendment. I hope the matter will go to a vote, so that we may know how honourable members stand, and how they can square their actions in the House with their professions on the public platform.",199
1435,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Denison) [2.4 a.m.] - I would not have spoken had it not been for the most unkind misrepresentation to which I have been subjected by the Minister of Trade and Customs. I have said nothing about desiring unions to become political bodies that I might use my influence to get Government positions for the members of those unions. I challenge the Minister' to prove that a member of the Labour party has ever placed a unionist in a Government position on the ground that that unionist is supposed to have voted for him. Let the Minister make a direct charge. To say that we gave preference to unionists for political purposes was utterly unfair. To say that appointments of men, known to honourable members on both sides' of the House as full y qualified for the positions to which they were appointed, came about through preference to unionists or favouritism is absurd. Unfortunately, statements like those made by the Minister are misunderstood when they go abroad. They convey to the people outside Australia a meaning which is totally different the word from that given to them by those acquainted with the facts. It is to be regretted that such statements should be made, and that a clause such as this should be placed in a Bill that comes before us for our consideration. I trust that every honourable member will speak upon this clause, so that his opinion may be conveyed to his constituents, and through them to others who may not be so well acquainted with preference to unionists as it has been applied in Australia. It was applied merely for the purpose of The At - preventing a disastrous strike, and in order to bring about industrial peace. There is no sadder sight than that of a worker out of employment, and I can see no objection to any honourable member giving a letter of character in order to recommend a man to a Minister, and secure for him a position in the Government casual service-no t in the permanent service, as the Minister of Trade and Customs would try to make us believe. I refer to carpenters on construction work, and to labourers excavating telephone conduits; to men who do that class of work cheaper than it could be done by contract.",199
1436,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,199
1437,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I merely refer to the conduit system at Ballarat in order to show that no favouritism was used to bring about the excellent work done there by men who are unionists, and who worked so f a it h full y that the Department saved £700 on a £2,000 job, as compared with what it would have cost by contract. Y e t they are the men who are supposed to have received favouritism at the hands of the late Government. I trust that the word "" favouritism "" will be added to the clause so that we can understand it , and so that we may convey to the people that the Labour party are opposed to favouritism being extended to any person or class of persons. I have read an article in the Age, showing the favouritism that has been extended to politicians desirous of getting friends into Public Service of Great"" Britain. We do not want that kind of thing in Australia.. That is the system by which word passes from prominent men to the heads of Departments, and certain men get appointments, not on casual work, but on the permanent staff, where there is no check upon their labours. That is not the case with casual work, because foremen must account for the work performed by each and every casual man. I challenge the Minister of Trade and Customs to prove his accusation. He mentioned my name in particular; but I hurl back the accusation in his teeth, and say that he cannot prove that I have been guilty of interceding on behalf of any individual because he voted for me.",199
1438,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I did not say that.,200
1439,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Minister cannot point out any honourable member of the House who has been guilty of this practice. It is all very well to make these charges in the House, where we know the circumstances, bub it is unfair to make them against honourable members collectively and individually for the purpose of taking them into the back blocks, where people are not so well acquainted with politics, and it will be trotted out' that the honourable member for. Darling Downs says so-and-so. The Minister has not the courage to make the charge here that any honourable member for political purposes has secured a billet for any person.",200
1440,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is it not correct that the honourable member advocated that unions should become more and more political ?,200
1441,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I advocated that.,200
1442,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have said that if unionists were alive to their interests they would become more political. I do not say that they should do so in order to get Government jobs.,200
1443,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Stil l you admit that in the Public Service preference should be given to unionists.,200
1444,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is misrepresenting me. I have said that unionists will benefit through the Labour party being in power, because it is the aim of the Labour party to return to the worker the benefit of the product of his own labour.",200
1445,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,To give him preference?,200
1446,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is no preference aboutit. Our aim is to give the him a return for the wealth he produces, and to get off his back the class he has for so long been carrying. I am glad to hear the remarks of the Minister, because they will reach the workers of Darling Downs, and when we go before the people, those workers will be mindful of the abuse they have received from honourable gentlemen who legislate on behalf of a class, a very small class indeed, and give preference and favouritism to that class all along the line. I have heard of certain gentlemen attending garden parties, and of the influence of ladies on their husbands, who are in high places, to get these gentlemen billets. Such methods were useful in the days gone by, but we are drifting away from those days now. I do not believe that there is a unionist in Australia who would so belittle himself as to cringe, as the Minister would have us believe is done, to any honourable member to give him leave to toil. The workers realise the value of their work, and that they are doing something towards production. They know that they can demand the right to toil.",200
1447,Colonel RYRIE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Ye t you cannot trust them with the postal vote, because you are afraid the bosses will influence them. Mr LAI RD SMITH - I would not like to trust the honourable member with anything. I should not like to trust the honourable member to work for me by the day. I should have to display a lot of favouritism to keep him on. Let us be fair to the workers who today receive only a third of that which they produce. At the very most only 2,000 are affected by this question of preference to persons in Government employment. We gave preference to unionists, because a few non-unionists secured employment on a big Commonwealth building, and the unionists said that they would not work with them. The Minister, as he explained at the time, insisted upon unionists being employed in order to avert a strike. I have not been able to find a non-unionist working on any big building in Melbourne or Sydney. The unions are strong enough at present to protect themselves, and their members refuse to work with non-unionists. A to'ne time mothers used to threaten naughty children with the bogy man, but I am told that today it is a common practice for them to say to their little ones, "" Look out. Here comes Mr . I r v in e , "" because of the fight he is putting up against unionism.",200
1448,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,201
1449,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This clause strikes at the very root of unionism. We oppose it , and desire at least so to amend it as to prevent favouritism of any kind. The workers put us here. us here, and they expect us to do something while we are here. What sort of men would we be if we went back upon our principles, and failed to attack this clause as it ought to be attacked ? Honourable members opposite represent a union of capitalists on the one hand and a union of the small farmers on the other. The small farmers will soon be mopped up by the other section. They will eventually find out that they cannot even obtain justice, let alone favouritism, from the party opposite, because it behoves the representatives of the pastoralists to look after the interests of the big men all the time. The farmers are combining and co-operating all over the States so as to be able to buy in the cheapest and to sell in the dearest markets. They object, however, to our doing something for the men who have done so much for them. They have not always voted for us, but the passing of this clause will consolidate the ranks of Labour as they have never been before. We shall have such a consolidation of forces that when we go to the people, as I hope we shall soon do, for I am sick of being here night after night",201
1450,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hear , hear!",201
1451,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We shall secure a great victory. The honourable member for Wannon knows he will be given a very hard go at the next general election, hence I question the genuineness of his applause. Not long visited a country State school, and was told by the teacher that the boys had to milk so many cows before going to school that they were really too tired to study. There are Some men who want children to do the work so that they may reap the profits. No wonder that they object to preference to unionists and to the principle of unionism. farmers voted against us at the last general election, but they are coming into our ranks by the score. The small farmer and the workers in the country will note the failure of the supporters of the Government to speak for the men who put them where they are today. They will note the fact that they have remained silent while the Government have been libelling them. We have not heard from the country representatives opposite who were returned-no t by the squatters, but by the toilers- a word in defence of the men who it is said would seek to use They keep political influence, and even to spend money by securing jobs in the Government service at 7s. or 8s. a day.

In division",202
1456,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I call your attention, sir, to the fact that during the division an honourable member left the chamber.",202
1457,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not at liberty to do that.,202
1458,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He was only honouring a pair. Question so resolved in the affirmative. Clause agreed to.,202
1459,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to make a personal explanation. I had given a pair to the honourable member for Bass, who numbers was not very well, in order to enable him to go home. I was reading a newspaper when the bell was rung. I am very sorry that I was called back into the chamber by one of the leaders of the party opposite, who knew that I had given a pair to one of his own men.",202
1460,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That statement ought to be withdrawn. On a point of order. I wish to ask you, sir, whether it is competent for an honourable member who is in the chamber when a division is being recorded to retire from it in any circumstances whatever until the result of the division is announced. Subject to your ruling, I say that an honourable member 1 who finds' himself in such a difficulty should remain until the division is recorded, and make his explanation, and express his regrets afterwards. We all regret what took place, and I am sure no one impugns the honesty of the honourable member for Franklin.",202
1461,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I tried to keep my pair.,203
1462,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The best of men make mistakes, but when one is made, there is a right way to correct it , and the right course should be followed.",203
1463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,All decent would help the man who made the mistake to correct it.,203
1464,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And only indecent men would prevent the matter being settled in the proper way.,203
1465,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"An honourable member may not leave the chamber after a division has been called. My attention was directed to the fact that an honourable member had left the chamber while the division was being recorded, and 1 called him back. The tellers informed me that the honourable member's name had been marked off, and that, whether he came back to the chamber or not, his vote would be recorded. I could not take steps at the time to compel the honourable member to return to the chamber, and his vote was recorded as if he had been in the chamber.",203
1466,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I should like to make a personal explanation. The name of the honourable member for Franklin had actually beenticked off before he left the chamber. Consequently I could not remove his name from the list for the division.,203
1467,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Franklin, in making his personal explanation, said that he was sorry that one of the leaders of the party on this side drew attention to his leaving the chamber. I think that the honourable member, in justice to himself, should withdraw that statement, because he had been counted by the tellers before he left the chamber. The honourable member for West Sydney was justified in calling attention to the fact that he was leaving the chamber, and the honourable member was wrong in leaving it. I ask that the honourable member for Franklin should be called upon to withdraw his reflection upon the honourable member for West Sydney.",203
1468,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member has not raised a point of order. The observation made by the honourable member for Franklin was not disorderly, and I can take no notice of it unless I am informed that it is regarded as offensive by the honourable member concerned, in which case I shall ask that it be withdrawn.",203
1469,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Melbourne) [2.56 a.m.]- I move That the following new clause be added :Notwithstanding anything contained in' any Act, this Bill, if it passes, shall men not become law until the electors of the Commonwealth of Australia have the opportunity of voting for or against it, by means of the referendum. I am sure that the Prime Minister will not think that I desire by this amendment to secure a catch vote. I expect that the' Government will welcome the amendment. One of its effects will be to show whether the criticism passed upon the measure is deserved. It will show what the people think of the Bill, which will only be carried by the casting vote of the presiding officer of this chamber. I think that the people should have a say in this matter. The referendum is provided for in our Constitution as a means of settling a difference between the two Houses. It is probable that this Bill will meet the same fate as a similar Bill introduced last session. There will then be a distinct difference between the two Houses of this Parliament, and the Constitution provides for a referendum in such a case. The referendum is the most up-to-date method of settling parliamentary differences. In the United States there has been a silent evolution, more effective than a revolution, in favour of the referendum, and the senators of the second Chamber of the National Parliament of that country are now elected directly by the people instead of by the different States. The principle has been adopted in more than 230 cities of the United States, many of which are governed now by commissioners subject to the power of the initiative and referendum, backed up in many cases by the principle of the recall. I ask the Government whether the amendment I propose does not provide a fair way of settling the question involved in this Bill for all time. My own opinion is that the people of Australia will vote against the measure. The great democratic principle of the referendum has appealed not only to the most liberal, but also to some of the most conservative minds of Great Britain . The late Marquis of Salisbury, - when Prime Minister of England, supported the principle. I do not think that the Marquis of Salisbury would go as far as to accept the initiative and the recall, but now that there is a difference between the two Houses anticipated, instead of putting the electors to the expense of a double dissolution, we should ascertain their opinion by means of a referendum. I am sure I shall have the support of the honourable member for Gippsland in my proposal.",203
1470,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Gippsland) [3.4 a.m.] - Thoug h I have on the notice paper a motion to adopt the initiative referendum, I have no hesitation in saying that I shall not support the honourable member's proposal. This matter of preference to unionists has already been submitted to the people. In Victoria, at any rate, it was one of the main fighting planks of the Liberal party. From the very first we laid down the principle that we would give no preference to any one or penalize any one on account of membership of any organization, and I am prepared to say that the people of Australia do not desire that this question should be again submitted to them; they have already given the i r ' opinion, the result being the overthrow of the late Government. I absolve the honourable member for Melbourne from blame for bringing forward upon this Bill the question of the referendum, but I repel the accusation of honourable members that I have attempted to forestall the honourable member. He had the whole of the last session in which he could have placed on the business-paper a motion dealing with the matter, and, notwithstanding that honourable members opposite pretend that the initiative referendum forms part of their policy, they omitted to put on the notice-paper last session any proposals to bring it into existence. It was, therefore, quite open to me to do so, and I did it with the best of intentions. I believe that before long the initiative referendum will be part of the Constitution of Australia.",204
1471,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hunter) [3.8 a.m.]. - The suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne is the better way obtain' the opinion of the public garding the question at issue. honourable member for Gippsland is favourable to the incorporation of the initiative and referendum in our Constitution, but at the first opportunity he has to employ the system he advocates he opposes it , saying that the matter at issue has already been decided. I cannot agree with the honourable member that the question of preference to unionists was made a vital issue at the last appeal to the people. In very few constituencies was it heard of. But even if it was made an important issue, does the honourable member contend that the majority of votes was cast in favour of the proposal of the Government? As a matter of fact, M in isters actually received a minority of votes from the whole of Australia. A p parently the object of the honourable member for Gippsland in submitting his motion was to occupy the time of the House. It was a sort of show-window thing to be indulged in for the purpose of placing something before the people of which the honourable member does not actually approve, for when the honourable member gets the opportunity to demonstrate his opinions he takes every possible care to find some excuse to justify his voting against them, though this is the very time when the honourable member should exercise his right to vote for them. It is often said that honourable members of the Opposition are shackled and have no right of liberty, but here we have a gentleman, who recently desired the House to express an opinion as to whether we should adopt the principle of the referendum in order to ascertain the wishes of the electors in regard to any important questions, when he has the direct opportunity of voting to refer a matter to the people in order to prevent a dead-lock and permit Parliament to proceed with business for the national welfare, sheltering himself behind the statement that the matter has already been decided. An honourable member who would take up that attitude would excuse himself in regard to any question that might crop up. Hardly any question arises that has not been put before the electors in a veiled way.",204
1472,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You will catch at any straw to stave off the evil day.,204
1473,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable to member finds himself now in a position rewhich may not recur for twenty years, The and in which he may now give effect to the principle of the referendum, but yet he is running away from it upon an important question.",204
1474,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You said the other day that the Bill was the shadow of a sham. - Mr Charlton - The measure is considered to be so vitally important that Ministers say they are prepared to ask the Governor General for a double dissolution upon it . If it is of that importance surely it is of sufficient importance to get the opinion of the electors upon it by means of a referendum. No one can say that there has been a direct appeal to the people in the matter of preference to unionists. The honourable member for Gippsland is deserting his principles because he thinks that in this case it is sufficiently important for party purposes to appeal to the Governor General for a double dissolution.,205
1475,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Cook) [3.14 a.m.]. - There is another point that the honorto able member for Gippsland can bear i mind. There was nothing dealing with this matter in the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Parramatta last year. It is a miserable afterthought. I Bill goes through the House on the ing vote of the Speaker it will have chance of getting through the Senate. Consequently, if he wishes to give effect to the principles of this Bill , it must before the people in some shape or form. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Then no ferendum is necessary.",205
1476,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But the Governexpression. ment want a double dissolution, which would cost the country about £100,000, to have this Bill endorsed by the people. On the honourable member's own showing there must be an appeal to the electors before this miserable proposal can have the sanction of the law. There is on the business-paper the following notice of motion in the name of the honourable member for Gippsland:- That, in the opinion of this House, Constitution should be amended to provide machinery for the initiative referendum. At the very first opportunity afforded to give a vote in favour of the principle of the referendum the honourable member runs away from it . There was no sindeserting cerity on his part in giving notice of motion.",205
1477,Mr BENNETT,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I object to that statethat ment, and ask that it be withdrawn.",205
1478,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall withdraw it , and say that there was apparently no sincerity on his part. It would be cruelty, however, to dumb animals to flagellate the honourable member further. . Mr ANSTEY (Bourke) [3.19 a.m.] The honourable member for Melbourne was one of the first to introduce to public attention - in Australia the principle of the initiative and referendum, and honourable members, whether they agree or disagree with the proposed new clause, must admit that he is quite consistent in submitting it . I am rather interested in noting the trouble in which the honourable member for Gippsland finds himself. It is remarkable that the usual silence on the Government side of the House should be suddenly disturbed by an attempt on the part of that honourable member to explain away something he has done. Whilst I generally display Christian fortitude and forbearance, I confess a feeling, very wicked, I admit, n in the direction that everything comes to him who waits. I have been for some time a victim of the honourable member's wrath, although no one has ever f the heard me say a word derogatory or othercastwise of him. The honourable member for no Gippsland is a new-born champion of the principle of the referendum and initiative. His faith in it was born on the day that go the Age began to support it . Side by side with this new-found faith on the part of "" T r u t h f u l Jimmy "" from Gippsland re",205
1479,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is out of order in using such an,205
1480,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am out of order. The whole expression is out of orderboth the "" truth f u l "" and the "" Jimmy -"" I withdraw and apologize. The honourable member, in the promulgation of the principles he espouses, has had something to say from every platform about myself. He has sought to hold me up to opprobrium, and yet we find hi m to-night-this man who has set himself up as the lapthe dog of a great newspaper-confessin g that while he is prepared to endorse the general principle of the referendum and him initiative, he is not prepared to avail himself of an opportunity to vote for it . At the very first opportunity we find him the principle he has promulhis gated and called upon to explain in this House in the early hours of the morning he is at the heel of his party. The honourable member, who claims to be a free man, in a free party, finds himself bound to abrogate, at the dictates of his party, everything that he has supported. So much for principle! So much for honour! So much for "" T r u t h f u l Jimmy "" of Gippsland.",205
1481,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,206

No preference or discrimination shall be daymade for or against any person in relation to any employment by the Commonwealth, or by any DepartHospital ment or authority thereof, on accomplaint count of his membership or noncieties membership of the Bar Association or the British Medical Association, or the Contractors Association, any other employers association. I endeavoured to amend the short titl e of the Bill to cover a provision of this kind, but the amendment was ruled out of order, and the motion to dissent from the ruling was negatived. I also desired to amend clause 2 in this direction; but the "" gag "" was applied, and I was prevented.",206
1485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is this proposal any less a mockery than the other was?,206
1486,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill is a mockery, as the Prime Minister knows. At every stage the question has been 30 raised, shall its provisions apply to workmen's organizations only, or shall AYES. they apply also to professional organizations ?",206
1487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask, Mr Chairman, whether there is any distinction between this proposal and that which you ruled out of order as a mockery?",206
1488,Mr CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ruled that certain words which appear in the proposed - new clause could not be inserted in the short title, on the ground that it was contrary to the nature of a short title to make an amendment of the kind proposed. I cannot rule the proposed new NOES. clause out of order.",206
1489,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Every effort is being made by Ministers to dodge a vote on this question, but they must nevertheless face it . They have been mouthing freedom and liberty, shouting from the housetops about the liberty of the subject, and we want now to see whether they are prepared to apply the prohibitions of the Bill to the Bar Association, Stumm, J. of which the Attorney-General is a member, and to Associations of Doctors, which enforce preference to unionists with a relentless cruelty such as has never been displayed by any workmen's association. In support of this statement, let me read a passage published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of the 15th May last. It is headed: ""Doctors who differ; scab and blackleg; trouble at Wellington Hospital."" Then follows this telegram, dated Wellington, ThursThe Committee of the Wellington District spent several hours in investigating a by the Secretary of the Friendly SoAssociation, to the effect that the matron (Miss Harte) had refused to admit a patient to the hospital on April 14, although or he had the necessary permission of one of the medical staff.",206
1490,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Bill relates only to appointments to the Commonwealth Service.,207
1491,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am showing what members of the British Medical Association do outside the Service with a view to explaining my proposal that they should not be given preference- a preference to be denied case of workmen-in the making of appointments to the Service. isters are constantly saying, "" See what unions do in their relations with private employers. We want to stop them from interfering in connection with Government employment."" In this case a doctor, who was a member of the British Medical Asociation, refused to attend a patient at the Wellington Hospital because he was called upon to co-operate with another doctor who did not belong to the associationAdmission was refused by the matron on the ground that it was Dr Savage's week on duty. Mrs Lavender said that she then went to Dr Savage, who asked her if any other doctor had been attending her son, and said that he would have nothing to do with the "" scab"" doctor's patients. Dr Savage afterwards went to see the young man, and recommended his removal to the hospital, asking a fee of 10s. Gd., which she paid. When she went for a certificate to notify the council that her house had been fumigated, she. asked Dr Savage if there was any fee to pay, whereupon he said that if she had her name removed from the "" blackleg"" doctor's list there would be no charge, but that if she still wished to be treated by the ""scab"" doctor, she would have to pay for the certificate. When the letter was read, the president characterized the words "" scab "" and "" blackleg "" as shoaring-shed language, and not what one would expect from a doctor. The president also commented upon the fact that the strained relations between the Friendly Societies Association and the hospital had interfered with the ladies who were collecting for the annual ball, and such were the gratuitous insults that they had been subjected to that the ball had been indefinitely postponed. The president asked Dr Savage if Mrs Lavender's statements were correct, and the reply was ""Absolutely."" The President: And did you refer to the other doctor as a ""scab"" and a ""blackleg?"" Dr Savage: Yes, I did, and I do now, Mr. President. The members of the British Medical Association, one of whom calls a fellowpractitioner "" s c a b "" and ""blackleg,"" will not work with non-union doctors, even to save the lives of human beings. Many instances of the kind could be given. But Ministers, while applying the prohibitions of the Bill to trade unions, will not apply them to the British Medical Association. I ask whether any Gut members of that association are employed in connection with the transcontinental railway, or under our quarantine laws? As to the Bar Association, the ex-Attorney General, by-Treading some of* its rules the other day, showed that it relentlessly in the boycotts lawyers who are not members. The honourable gentleman told us that in Min- engaging members of the legal profession to conduct cases on behalf of the Commonwealth, he was compelled to retain the services of members of the Bar Association, because, had he gone outside it , senior counsel would have refused to appear with juniors or others who were not members of the association. The coercion of the law is not to be applied to these classic associations, but it is to be applied to organizations of bricklayers, carpenters, labourers, navvies, or other workmen. The refusal of the Government to accept this clause stamps them at once as a Government desiring to legislate for a class, though they told the electors that it was their intention to legislate in the interest of all sections of the community. Ministers have tried by raising various points of order to dodge this amendment, but they have to face the music, and it will be placed on record that they are a class Government fighting for the smallest class against the great mass of the people. Their action in refusing to accept this amendment will serve to educate the community, and enable the people to discover and correct the mistake they made in permitting them to occupy the Treasury bench.

Honourable members will have observed if they have paid any attention to my movements during the past five weeks that I have endeavoured on various occasions to ascertain from the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General what the Government propose to do with regard to penalties for breaches of this measure. The Bill as it at present stands merely expresses a pious hope. It is a mere expression of opinion, and to be effective it should make provision for some penalty.

1518,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The suspension of the can. Standing Orders has never before been moved in this Parliament at so early a stage of the session as this. The notice a of motion that the Prime Minister placed on the businiess-paper is one that is used to provide for the clearing up of the business-paper at the end of a session, and is not generally given notice cf u n t i l a fortnight or three weeks before the sesthis sion ends, at a time when both parties have practically agreed that business be expedited. Mr W . H . IBVINE - I think that the Government in which the honourable memable ber was a Minister gave notice motion of this kind earlier in the session than that.",210
1519,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am confident that the motion has never before been used w it five weeks of the beginning of a session. The Prime Minister gave notice of this motion less than five weeks after we - met. ,211
1520,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; I hope that the honourable gentleman will see that he not likely to get much further by moving the suspension of the Standing Orders, because every honourable member is liberty to speak for an hour and five minutes on the motion, and when the third reading has been moved the same opportunity for discussion will be While I do not threaten, I would remind the Prime Minister that he has been lucky in getting the Bill to its present stage. I understood that at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon he was prepared to take the second reading next Wednesday. Mr W . H . IBVINE - No . Was this private arrangement?",211
1521,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Accordin g newspapers, the Prime signified that he would be content to get the Bill by the 3rd June. The Government can get to the third reading on our next sitting day without taking advantage of this motion. I am opposed to the suspension of the Standopposing his imperious will . ing Orders in the circumstances, and shall vote against the motion.",211
1522,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"West Sydney) [4.45 Orders a.m.] - I hope the Prime Minister will not press this motion. It is admitted that this measure is the policy of the Government, and that it is upon it intend to go to the country, if they get there. It would be more with the nature of the measure to defer the third reading until a later day. Considering the strength of parties, and violent opposition of their ideas, the Government have not very much to comagree to do so. plain of in the progress made with the Bill . If they pressed the sitting, it would appear as if, they did not wish to have their policy fair l y must discussed, but desired to push it down the throats of their opponents. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Does the honorgentleman not think the Bill has of a been full y discussed ?",211
1523,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,No . I say that deliberately. The Attorney-General will not find a parallel for anything like this h in . during the time the Labour Government were in office. They never attempted to use their strength in order to force first measures down the throats of their opponents.,211
1524,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Capricornia) [4.51a.m.]I was in hopes that the magnanimity shown by the honourable member for Bourke and is myself would have met with some sympathetic response from the Prime M in ister. We could have talked for hours at on some of the new clauses which were proposed. We have been here now since Wednesday morning last, because we had a prolonged caucus meeting before the given. House met. If the Prime Minister has no consideration for his opponents, I appeal to him, on behalf of the Speaker and Chairman, the officers of the House, and the Hansard staff. Prom my experience I know that it is impossible for the occupant of the Chair to get the rest a which he ought to get in these circumstances, owing to the constant strain upon him in following the speeches of honorto the able members and endeavouring to keep Minister them to the point. The Attorney General may be irritated with me.",211

1526,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Because I have been If he continues in this way it will not be long before Imperial Caesar will be turned to clay. The suspension of the Standing will not help the case of the Government, because there are still several months of the year during which we may discuss legislation. I do not wish to say they anything which might make the Prime can Minister angry, because I know that he in keeping is a combative man.",211
1527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not combathe tive. I wish to make an arrangement, but honourable members opposite will not",211
1528,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What is the arranget h i r d reading at ment suggested ?,211
1529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The arrangement suggested from the other side is to waste another week over a Bill that has been full y discussed.,212
1530,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My proposition ""is that we should take the vote before dinner on Thursday.",212
1531,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I consider that a great concession, in view of the number of honourable members on this side who wish to speak.",212
1532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am willing give the Opposition all day on Wednesday. That is a fair thing.,212
1533,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is the response to my appeal on behalf' of the officers of the House. The Prime M in ister says that he wil l give us Wednesday, but we meet on Wednesday at 2.30 p.m., and that will mean that we shall have about, seven hours, in which it is expected that thirty-seven members of the Opposition will have time to express their opinions on the Bill . There will be thirty-seven men straining in the leash to catch Mr Speaker's eye, and offer suggestions why the Bill should not pass.",212
1534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Dinner-tim e Thursday night would leave only six or seven hours for the rest of the week. That would mean practically another week for the third reading of the Bill .,212
1535,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Honourable members of the Opposition are still fresh, and could go on until midnight, which would be only seventeen hours, or an average of half-an-hour each. We could f i ll in the time without trouble. The Minister of External Affairs has very important matters to deal with, and these long sittings cannot contribute to his health. I place one or two honourable members in the gallery, so to speak, as examples of the result of the action of the imperious At torney-General. I do not know how to appeal to him. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u need not peal to me. I have nothing to do with the matter.",212
1536,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whil e the Prime M in ister is considering the-matter, he might have regard to the Hansard staff. Taking down the remarks of honourable members in shorthand is most monotonous and trying work. I do not think the staff have had any relief. There have been no special men engaged. It must also be remembered that so severe is the [54] strain of tEe work that the shorthand reporters have to so arrange that no reporter takes shorthand notes for more than, say, ten minutes at a time. Then, again, the officers of the House get very little relief. They have to sit in their chairs, and keep their wits about them, and be careful that there are no mistakes made in the records. There is no reason why the Bill should be driven through the House in such haste. To spend another fortnigh t into discussing it would not be out of place. In fact, the country would be better off if, in a fortnight, we succeeded in blocking the measure altogether. However, the Prime Minister has the bump of combativeness developed to the size of a small melon. He will fight when he should be amiable. While we are wrangling with the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker has a bad time. We make it hot for him by our points of order and discursive observations. Also, the Chairman of Committees deserves attention.",212

1539,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I will give you until lunch-time on Thursday.,212
1540,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That will not suit me. I asked for two days, and then halved it , and now the Prime Minister wishes me to have it again.",212

1542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"G o ahead, and try . We shall do our best to be with you.",212
1543,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is self-destruction. If the Prime Minister will give u n t i l Thursday, I will remain silent on the t h i r d reading, and that is self-denial. Consideration should be given to the ap- poorer-paid members of the staff attached to the House-the attendants and messengers, who have to attend to their duties for such long hours. Some of them appear to be looking fatigued, and their health is suffering. What do a few hours mean to the Prime Minister?",212
1544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Hear , hear; after you have pumped yourselves dry already.",212
1545,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I call attention to the constant interruptions of the Prime M in ister.,212
