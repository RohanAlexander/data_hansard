1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J, S. Rosevear) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. RAIL TRANSPORT. TRANB - AUSTRA.LIAN SERVICE-NORTH SOUTHLINE.'",11
2,Mr BURKE,Unknown,"Can the Minister for the. Interior furnish any information in relation to negotiations with the Government of South Australia for the running of a third passenger train weekly between Perth and Adelaide and thence to Melbourne? Prior to the war, when this additional service was provided, was a concessional fare allowed to railway employees, and to - members of football and other sporting' teams which travelled as a body? Was this concession suspended during the currency of the war? If so, is it intended to grant it afresh when the tliird train is restored? If the restoration is not to be made automatically, will the Mmister consider its immediate application, and thus confer a distinct benefit on the Perth and West Perth football teams which propose to travel - to the eastern States this year, and help considerably many footballers who have returned to the game for the first time this year after lengthy and noble service in the defence of tlieir country ?",11
3,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am able to inform the honourable member that arrangements have been completed for the provision of an extra regular passenger train each' week to and from ""Western Australia, commencing from Melbourne on Thursday, the 25th July, and from Perth'on Monday, the 29th July. This has been made possible by the withdrawal of a regular military personnel train service. Concession fares were discontinued as the result of a decision by the various Railways Commissioners in 1941, because of. the heavy traffic on the railWays at that time. I see no reason why the concession should not be restored, and I have instructed the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner to raise the matter ' at the next conference . of Railways Commissioners.",11
4,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Transport read a letter signed by Mr. W. Langdon Parsons, and published' in the Adelaide Advertiser of recent date, wherein it was claimed that he and the Prime Minister had intended to repudiate the agreement entered into some years ago' between the. Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia for the construction of the NorthSouth railway line to connect Darwin with the South Australian railway syslem ? Will the Minister inform ..the House whether there is any foundation for such an assertion?",11
5,Mr WARD,Unknown,"I have not read the report to which the honoiable member has referred, but I can assure him that the statement has no basis in fact. On a recent visit to South Australia, I had a conference on the matter .with the Premier of that State and the Leader of the Opposition in the Sonth Australian Hou=e of Assembly. The difficulty that arose was that - South Australia was endeavouring to have the construction of this line included in the genera] scheme for the standardization of railway gauges. The Commonwealth Governmentwas not prepared at that time to have it so included, but it has again considered the matter and I am hopeful that it will he able to assist South Australia with regard to it. CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION. .",11
6,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Has the ' Prime Minister read a statement by Mr Guy Anderson to the effect that the Australian basic wage worker is better off than a worker in the TJnited States of America in receipt of from £12 to £15 a week? As that statement was made by a minent trade union official, will the right'honourable gentleman incorporate in the ""Yes "" case being prepared Government for distribution to the .electors at the forthcoming referendum io determine whether increased powers shall be conferred on this Parliament?",11
7,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not read the statement. As to the .second part of lionorable member's question, consideratralia tion will be given to the suggestion. REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.",12
8,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether, the Government acquires property for Commonwealth purposes, it accepts the current year's valuation ? Is it a fact that all other real estate sales are pegged at the 1942 valuations? If that be so, will the right honourable gentleman into the matter, and arrange for all estate sales to be approved on the same basis as that applied to properties acquired by the Government?",12
9,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,I shall examine the point raised by the honourable member and supply a reply a later. NORTHERN TERRITORY.,12
10,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"I rise to a personal explanation. Yesterday I addressed a year 1942. question to the Minister for the Interior concerning a lessee in the Northern Territoiy who already had a lease of 10,600 1942'. square miles, .and secured an additional area of more than 400 square miles on 42 years' lease. On consulting the schedule I find that the additional area is square miles. In reply to my question, the Minister said-and I quote from a Bansard proofTlie lease of Alexandra Downs became possible because the people of the Northern had his say. Territory lacked auy representation in. this Parliament.",12
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honorout able member is entitled to make a perMinister sonal explanation only if the Minister misrepresented anything he said.,12
12,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,That is what I claim.,12
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"But , of course, the honourable member may not engage in u debate witli the Minister on the pretext proof making a personal explanation.",12
14,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"I disclaim any responsiit bility for the indefensible act of the Goby the vernment in granting such a big additional area to a lessee already possessing 10,600 square miles of land. When the Minister said that people of the Northern Territory lacked representation in this Parliament he could be referring the only to me, and to my absence from Ausas a member of the Sth Division Australian Imperial Force, and to the fate which honourable members well know befell me in becoming a prisoner of war in the hands of the Japanese for three when and half years. I am obliged to make this personal explanation in an endeavour to clear myself of the intolerable charge levelled against me by the Minister that, an indefensible administrative act of his department occurred only because I was a look member of the Australian Imperial real Force, and a. prisoner of war. I am astonished that the reply of the Minister should amount to an admission that his department had performed in my absence an administrative act which would never have heen attempted had I been in my place in this House.",12
15,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. When I reLEASES. ferred yesterday to the lack of representation in this Parliament for the Northern Territory, I did not. have in mind the",12
16,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,The lease was granted in,12
17,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I had in mind the a lack of continued representation and administration in connection with the 825 affairs of the Northern Territory.,12
18,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,Nonsense !,12
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for the Northern Territory has,12
20,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"When the honourable member for Indi. interjected, I pointed that he had himself at one time been for the Interior, and that he and his Government had neglected to amend the ordinance so as to prevent an occurrence of the kind complained of by the member for the Northern Territory. The ordinance provided that when a lease expired by effluxion of time, the new lease was to be disposed of by ballot.. In the particular instance referred to there was only one applicant for the lease, the Alexandra Downs Company, to which it was eventually granted. I further explained that action had been taken by this Government to prevent such a thing happening again.",12
21,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I rise to make a personal explanation touching the statement of the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) that while I was Minister for the Interior I had neglected to amend the Crown Lands Ordinances of the Northern Territory, thereby making inevitable the allocation to a lessee who held 10,600 square miles of country an' additional 825 square miles for a period of 42 years. My explanation is that nothing in the Crown Lands Ordinances, as they existed during the term of my administration, prevented the resumption of land from lessees who held large areas. On the contrary, they specifically provided for the resumption of areas-2 5 per cent, after 10 years, and 50 per cent, after 20 years. The managing director Alexandra Downs, Mr Forrest, interviewed me personally, and made representations that I should not exercise my right, as Minister, to resume 25 per cent, of the area of his lease. I told him-and I am sure the records of the Department of the Interior will support my statement-that nothing would prevent me from resuming the proportion of his lease that I was entitled as Minister to resume, .for the purpose of making it available for new settlers. Mr Forrest's company was able to obtain the additional area only by an unprecedented administrative act of the Department of the Interior during the term of office of Senator Collings, by advertising as available the' resumable proportion, of the lease before the resumption fell due. Because this method was followed the department established the sole right of the Alexandria Downs Company again to secure a lease of the additional area.",13
22,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Coupled with the honourable gentleman's failure when Minister to amend the ordinance.,13
23,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"Ha d the present Minister's predecessor merely delayed advertising the advisability of the area in accordance with the Crown Law Ordinances until after the due date for resumption, the land would have been open to application by any person who desired it. The charge of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr . Blain) is supported by the records. MOTOE VEHICLES. - PRICES AND SALES TAX.",13
24,Mr SHEEHY,Unknown,"In view of the fact that wages have been pegged, so that they may be varied only in accordance with variations of the cost of living, can the Prime Minister say what are the factors that account for the difference between the pre-war price of motor cars and the present price? Will the Government consider a reduction of sales tax on motor cars seeing that, at present prices, they are beyond the purchasing power of most people who wish to buy them?",13
25,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The high prices of motor cars are due largely to"" the fact that the vehicles, or, at least, their main components, are imported, and that in the countries of origin, namely the United Kingdom and the United States of America, prices have risen considerably. As to reducing the sales tax on motor cars, that matter will be considered when a general review of the sales tax is being made. APPLES AND PEARS.",13
26,Mr GUY,Unknown,"In view of the announced! intention of the ' Government to extend potato control for an additional year, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture indicate what, are the obstacles holding up the decision in regard to a similar extension of the apple and pear acquisition scheme?",13
27,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,"I do not, propose to state the reason. PEICE OF. MILK .",13
28,Mr FEASEE,Unknown,"I refer to the widely publicized letter stated to have been sent by the Prime Minister's secretary to the secretary of the Milk Zone Farmers Council, Mr Sedgwick. Does this letter indicate a change of the Government's attitudetowards the claims of the farmers in the milk zone for a review of production costs? - Will the Governmenl bear in mind that, despite the present ceptionally good winter conditions in the zone, there is still widespread discontent because the finding of a cost of ls. 6fd. by Professor Copland, on which the retail price is at present based, is substantially below the Milk Board's finding and also that of two independent investigators? If the Government's attitude has not changed, will the Prime Minister consider the desirability of conducting a further governmental inquiry into costs of production in the zone, with a view to fixing a return to the producers which will enable them to pay their way in both good and bad seasons? ' Mr Chifley - There has been no change of the Government's policy in relation to this matter. It is true that some time ago an arrangement was made with the State Government for a committee to inquire into the circumstances, of dairy farmers in the milk zone who had suffered as theresult of drought or dry weather conditions. Costs of production in the dairying industry bave been made the subject of a number of inquiries and are constantly under review by the Prices Commissioner. However, I shall consider the representations made by the honourable member. MERCANTIL E MARINE . WAE RISK BONUS.",13
29,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Thre e weeks ago the Prime .Minister undertook to make statement regarding the seamen's war risk bonus. Has the Government considered the question of the payment of the bonus to coastal seamen operating ships north of Townsville, which expired on the 30th June? Will the Prime Minister give an any other country. assurance to the House that this payment will not he continued ?",14
30,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The war risk bonus bas been under consideration by the Government from time to time and its decisions thereon have been largely based upon decisions made by the governments of other countries. If I - have not furview nished a reply to a previous question the subject by the honourable member apologize, and I assure him that I shall endeavour to see that it is supplied at early date. As to the - last part of the honourable member's question, I cannot give an assurance that the payment of the ex- bonus will be discontinued. The subject is reviewed periodically. PUBLIC SERVICE. RESIGNATIONS.",14
31,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"Is there any special reason why a number of highly placed public servants have resigned from the Commonwealth Public Service recently to accept positions with private companies? If the reasons for these resignations are known to the Prime Minister, is any action - being taken to see that the Public Service is not deprived of its brains trust by outside interests?",14
32,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"So far as I know, the reason 'why public servants to whom the honourable member refers join outside organizations is that they are offered a higher remuneration than they receive in the Public Service. The three particular public servants who, I think, the honourable member has in mind were in constant contact during the war with outside organizations and public men who learned to . appreciate the ability and capacity of many Commonwealth public servants. Despite what has been said about these officials being bureaucratic, outside organizations have been anxious to obtain their services and have been prepared to offer to them much more attractive terms than the Commonwealth Government is able to offer to them. On the other hand, a many men transfer from private enterprise to the Public Service, and in the long run the losses and gains almost balance. I believe that the Commonwealth Public Service contains officers of as fine a type as is likely to be found in SOUTH-WEST PACIFIC ",14
33,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Information familiar with the South-West Pacific, a publication issued by his department for circulation abroad? In of the concern he expressed yesteron day regarding the export'of information I which he considered to be unfavorable to this country^ what is his opinion of an page 25 of the latest issue of that pub- lication, whereon is a picture of a bark hut in Central Australia accompanied by the following caption, "" Homestead of ihe £16,000 (51,200-dollar) cattle ranch where ' Bullwaddy' Bates held a party which lasted 12 days to celebrate the ' wedding of his half-caste son?"" What good purpose does the Minister believe is served by purveying such unedifying information abroad?",14
34,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I ask the honourable member not to be too censorious about a particular item in the publication to which he refers. South-West Pacific has been published for a.number of years, and ""has won unstinted praise by honourable members and honourable senators of all parties for the excellent service it renders in enabling overseas editors to print stories of the Australian way of life. Some honourable members opposite have asked me for additional copies of the very issue to which the honourable member has taken objection. It may be. that he finds grounds for criticism by dragging something from its context. I ask him to read the whole of the article.",15
35,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,I did.,15
36,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I . am sorry that whole article did not impress the able member; but we cannot picture Auswealth tralia solely as it is seen in Sydney Melbourne. The Government does not. intend to commit the criminal mistake of past governments which attempted to attract migrants to Australia by publishever, ing photographs of Parliament House, Canberra, and representing the building as a typical squatter's home in Australia. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. LAND SETTLEMEN T OF EX-SERVICEMEN.",15
37,Mr CLARK,Unknown,I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction what progress in the same trade. has been made in settling ex-servicemen on the land. Will be discuss with the State governments the advisabilities of making single-unit farms available to cx-serviceinen?,15
38,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Settlemen t of exmoney servicemen on the land in the States-was fully debated in this House recently. shall see whether a further statement the matter is required from me. The matter of single-farm units has been cussed with the iState governments over a long period. The agreement reached the 1st July last* at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers excludes single-farm units from the land settlement scheme. That has been made clear to State Ministers who have made representations to me on the matter. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is completely opposed to single-farm units chosen by individual ex-servicemen- I think the term "" singlefarm units"" may be misleading-as being unfair and inequitable to the very large number of ex-servicemen who would have no chance to obtain farms under similar conditions. PETROL.",15
39,Mr ADERMANN,Unknown,Is the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and. Shipping prepared to consider the imposition of a uniform price for petrol throughout the Commonwealth in order to encourage increased production? The high prices charged for petrol in out-back districts discourage country citizenship.,15
40,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"That matter has the been considered by the Minister for honorSupply and Shipping. The CommonGovernment bas no constitutional and power in peace-time to fix a flat rate for petrol throughout Australia, although it is true that it could do so temporarily under the National Security Act. How""because some petrol companies operate in only a small way and distribute supplies only in the capital cities and the larger companies supply country areas as well as the cities, it. would be obviously unfair to declare a flat rate, which . would differentiate between the rates of profit of companies operating TUBERCULOSIS.",15
41,Mr FALSTEIN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services whether the allocated under the Tuberculosis Act 1945 has yet been made available to I the State governments for distribution? on At what rate will the money be distributed, and when will the distribution discommence? Will the Minister undertake that the benefits will be retrospective to",15
42,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"T h o £50,000 allocated to the States for diagnostic purposes has l>eeii available to the States since the 1st January last, although I do not know whether any has been used yet. The .Commonwealth portion of the joint fund of £250,000 for the payment of special allowances to dependants of sufferers has been allocated to the States. Details of the distribution will be completed in amending legislation to be introduced during this Parliament. The amounts payable will he determined by the authorities on the merits of each case. Wliatever payments are made to relievo the economic situation of dependants of tubercular sufferers will not be calculated as income and will be paid in addition to invalid pensions, old-age pensions or any other pensions that may be drawn by them. Whether the payments wil l be retrospective will be decided when the amending legislation is introduced. NA REGULATIONS. I r . SPENDER,-Unde r the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations wages are pegged rates ruling on a. certain date, and it is illegal both for an employee to receive, and an employer to pay, wages in excess of those rates. To the management of certain firms namely, the Purcell Engineering Co, Pty. Ltd. , and Babcock and Wilcox Ltd., both of Sydney, members of the Federated Iron workers Union and the Moulders Union have intimated that, unless they are paid an over-all in crease of 10s. a week, ballots will be taken each week to decide which employees shall resign from these firms, thus defying the law, and visiting' great loss upon the employers. As this action would be a breach of the National Security Regulations and of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, rendering those concerned liable to heavy penalties, does the acting Attorney-General propose - to take any steps to uphold the laws that this Government itself introduced?",16
43,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The honourable member for Warringah has not made clear the exact matter on which he wishes action to be taken. He stated that the iron workers and moulders are demanding an increase of pay and are threatening, if their request be not granted, to hold ballots to decide which members shall resign fro m their employment. M'.r. SPENDER - They are holding ballots now.",16
44,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,Does the honourable member want to know whether the Government will take some action against the men if they receive an increase of wages?,16
45,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL SECURITY,No . Will action be taken to prevent them from continuing State theiv criminal conduct?,16
46,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"If their conduct is a. breach of State awards, then it is a matter for State authorities.",16
47,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL SECURITY,It is a Commonwealth law and a Commonwealth crime.,16
48,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,No offence has yet been committed.,16

51,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL SECURITY,There is no shadow at about this. The union is talking about pulling its members out of the two firms I have mentioned.,16
52,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Order ! The honourable member for Warringah has asked the question, and now he is proceeding to answer it himself.",16
53,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,The honourable member asked had my notice been drawn to the fact,16
54,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL SECURITY,- I did not ask that at all.,16
55,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"If the honourable member does not want an answer, then I need not give it to him.",16
56,Mr SPENDER,NATIONAL SECURITY,Obviousl y the Minister cannot give an answer.,16
57,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL SECURITY,The Minister might take the honourable member at his word and so avoid wasting the time of the House.,16
58,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I am trying to answer, but the honourable member is not giving me a chance. The answer is that if the employers and the employees'conspire to defeat the National Security Regulations-the y have not done that yet-actio n will be taken. WHEAT INDUSTRY.",16
59,Mr FULLER,NATIONAL SECURITY,"In view of the promise hy the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) that he wil] recommend to the Government that the cost of producing wheat in Australia be made the subject of an inquiry by a commission, as requested by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, will he also recommend that a practical representative of the wheat-growers be appointed to the commission? I should like to know also whether the Minister will recommend that the inquiry be a complete one, and not merely an investigation from the point at which the Gepp Commission ended its inquiries in L935?",17
60,Mr SCULLY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I did promise gates to the conference of the Wheat Growers Federation held in Sydney 5 at recently that I 'would submit to Cabinet and proposals similar to those mentioned by with dust. the honourable member. If my.suggestion be approved, I shall ask the Government to agree to appoint to the commission of inquiry at least one nominee of the Wheat Growers Federation. INSULI N. Dame ENIDLYONS - I have reconcerned ceived from Tasmania a telegram indifoodstuffs cating an acute shortage of insulin, that, I understand, is due directly to the people? meat strike in Queensland. As the strike has now ended, I ask the Minister reprefacts senting the Minister for Health to inform me what supplies of insulin are now available, what steps have been taken distribute them, and how soon can appreciable improvement be expected?",17
61,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"It is true that those supplies of insulin became very low beproved cause cattle were not being slaughtered in Queensland, but the position was not so acute that persons requiring the drug were unable to obtain it. The Minister for Health quickly arranged for stocks of pancreas in the north to be hard-frozen, moment. and brought south to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in order to maintain continuity of the supply of insulin. The danger has now passed. Insulin plaints can be made quickly. I am certain that no difficulties will now arise in providing supplies for patients, but I shall ask the Minister for Health to supply to the honourable member the exact figures regarding stocks. - FOOD FOR BRITAIN . PRIVATE PARCELS.",17
62,Mr WILLIAMS,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ""heen advised of reports in British newspapers that food parcels forwarded to the United Kingdom by generous Australians have accumulated in English dock-side warehouses and are not being distributed?

The the delereport stated also thatTen miles from Charing Cross, in warehouse the King George V.

Will the Minister take up this matter with the British Ministry of Food, with a view to .allaying the, anxiety of patriotic Australians who are at the reports .that valuable are being wasted when they are and so urgently required by the British",17
63,Mr SCULLY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I am not aware of the contained in the honourable member's question. The British Ministry of Food has heen most prompt in distributing to parcels sent from Australia. Although an comments bave been made from time to time regarding the maldistribution of parcels, investigations have always that the criticism was unfounded. .

ALIENS "" BILL 1946. Motion (by Mr Calwell ) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a an. Act relating to Aliens. TRADESMEN'S RIGHTS REGULATIONBILL 1946. Bill presented by Mr Holloway, read a first time. SECOND READING.",18
66,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour ancl National Sertion vice) [3.17] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is intended not only to give effect to undertakings given to unions and men. employers when dilution agreements were made between the Federal Government, employers organizations, and unions in the early days of the war, also to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. Whilst dilution necessarily involved a lowering of trade standards to meet war requirements, the normal standards of the trades were to be nition restored as soon as dilution was no longer essential. The present Leader of the were Opposition (Mr Menzies) headed the Government of the day which was a party to those agreements. Labour ministries since then accepted fully the terms of the agreements. I 1.942 the late Mr Curtin, as Prime Minister, re-affirmed in the House the men. promise to restore normal trade practices at the end of hostilities. The present r.soi Government considered that this agreement would unduly prejudice the rehabilitation prospects of a number of returning servicemen, and therefore undertook negotiations with employers and unions. As a'result of these negotiations,"" the scheme provided for in this bill was evolved, and whilst it adequately fulfils the earlier agreement in regard to the protection of recognized tradesmen, it will also make a material contribution to the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen by it possible for a number of them to enter the skilled metal trades. It will be recalled that with the fal l for an of France in May, 1940, it became obvious that Australia would not only have to depend on its own resources for the production of arms for its own forces, but also would have to help to supply the munitions required by the mother country and allied forces in the Middle Bill for East. However, the huge munitions programme contemplated could not be carried out, without considerable increase of the number of tradesmen in the engineering and related trades. The Menzies Government approached the and trade unions and employers organizations, and agreement was reached on a scheme of dilution to meet these exceptional needs. Under the dilution agree- ment, the unions assented to the relaxaof existing trade customs and practices to enable semi-skilled and partly trained workers to perform work normally carried out by full y qualified tradesI t was, however, fullyunderstood that this action would not be permitted to prejudice the ultimate rights of the trade recognized tradesmen. The dilution but regulations subsequently made under the National Security Act give clear expression to these principles. Honourable members know that the munitions programme expanded almost beyond recogafter the extension of the war into the Pacific, and the skilled metal trades diluted, to a far greater degree than had been originally planned. Approximately 50,000 men were added to the Both diluted trades, andalthough a large number of these have now returned to n their normal occupations, 24.000 stall remain in employment as added tradesThe temporary need which brought these men into this field developed in Australia new industrial activity, a part of which at least is likely to he permanent. It is only right and proper that these new avenues of employment should not be closed to men who have been absent in the armed forces. The bill, therefore, makes provision for the admission to the engineering, boilermaking, blacksmithing, electrical, and sheet-metal trades of ex-servicemen who liave had sufficient training and experience in those trades while in the forces to enable them, after a reasonable period of probation or training in employment, to reach the standard of skilled tradesmen. Honourable members will be aware that the Navy, Army and Air Force needed large numbers of technicians to meet the demands of modern mechanized warfare, and for this many thousands of servicemen were trained in special technical work. Naturally, many of tliese men will not wish to use this technical skill in civil life. Many have other occupations to wbicb they prefer to return. For others, however, this skill acquired in the services, and the opportunities provided by this bill, will be a means of rehabilitation. At the same time, I must warn honourable members that the Australian engineering industry, despite its expansion since 1939, has not unlimited absorptive capacity, and, therefore, one function of the committees provided for in the bill will be to avoid the overloading of industvy, wbicb would result in the ultimate unemployment of both, ex-servicemen and recognized tradesmen. To avoid sucb overloading, some portion of the dilution structure must be retained in the interests of all. Following upon conferences which were held with representatives of the appropriate employer organizations and unions, the provisions of the engineering, boilermaking, blacksmithing, electrical, and. sheet-metal trades dilution regulations were revised and amended in March of this year to meet the new situation, and the substance of this bill is, for all practical purposes, identical with that of the amended regulations. - The bill provides for administrative machinery to control the scheme by central and local trades committees similar in composition and functions to the committees of unions and employers which Mr Mollomuy. administered the dilution scheme. These committees will bave the additional duty of settling matters concerning the employment of the different categories of tradesmen, and will be Industrial Committees under the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945, in respect of these trades.. First priority in employment is accorded to "" recognized tradesmen ""(a) in respect of engagements, by the provision in clause 43 that an employer shall not employ on tradesmen's work any person other than a. "" recognized tradesman "" if a competent recognized tradesman is available and offering for employment; and (b) in respect of dismissals or retrenchments, by the provision in the same clause that the ""recognized tradesman "" would be the last to go unless a local committee consented otherwise, and subject to an employer exercising award rights tp dismiss an employee for malingering, neglect of duty, or misconduct. Provision is made for ex-servicemen with training and experience in the'trade, acquired in the forces, to become "" recognized tradesmen "" in three ways:(1) Ex-servicemen who have served in the forces for a long period in a trade capacity, and have so acquired the full skill of a tradesman, may be certified immediately as "" recognized tradesmen"" by a local committee. (2) Ex-servicemen needing a periodof employment at the trade, not exceeding twelve months, to attain full trade skill, may be authorized as "" probationary tradesmen "" by a local committee, and upon successfully completing the probationary period, may be certified as "" recognized tradesmen "". (3) Ex-servicemen who have gained some trade skill in the forces and are eligible for training benefits' under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme may be authorized as ""trainee-tradesmen"" by a local committee, and after a , reasonable period of training on the job may be certified ns "" recognized tradesmen "".

Applications to a local committee for admission as a "" probationary"" or "" trainee-tradesman "" must be made, unless there are exceptional circumstances, within six months after the ex-serviceman's discharge from the forces or after the 22nd March, 1946, whichever is' the later. So as to avoid any misunderstanding; I point out to honourable members that the 22nd March is, in fact, the date on which the scheme was brought into effect by the National Security (Trades Dilution) Regulations No. 2. I commend the bill to the House, in the hope that it wil] be treated. as a non-party matter. Both sides of the House will wish to redeem the pledge to our bona fide tradesmen that pre-war practices and customs would be restored, and wil] also desire to provide for a just measure of rehabilitation to men who have served in the forces. In concluding, it is fitting that I should pay a just tribute to men who, as skilled tradesmen or added tradesmen, contributed their part in factory and workshop, and also to the trade unions and employers, without whose voluntary acceptance of the dilution principles our munitions programme could not have been carried out. In the name of the Government and the people of Australia, I thank, those employer and employee organizations which so wholeheartedly co-operated in administering liie wartime scheme and are now further co-operating in the administration of the scheme that is incorporated in the bill.",18

68,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The ex-servicethird inan will be given preference in employvice ment and dismissal over other men who are .of equal technicalstatus. The "" added tradesmen "" are adults who had passed the training age. I believe that they will not come under this scheme, will have to take their chance of obtaincome ing employment.",20
69,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL SECURITY,Are they now accepted as full tradesmen?,20
70,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"They will not be priority as "" recognized tradesmen "". The honourable member knows that when this scheme was first introduced there was a tremendous shortage of skilled tradesmen in Australia.",20
71,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL SECURITY,I am familiar with the problem.,20
72,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The parties that now sit in Opposition then composed the Government. Tn 1940, the Government was asked to complete contracts which were of immense magnitude although not comparable with those that had to be undertaken later. The scarcity of technical tradesmen made the task almost impossible. The Minister for Munitions of that day was Senator MCBride.",20
73,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL SECURITY,I negotiated the agreement.,20
74,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The then. Leader of the Opposition, the late Mr Curtin, was asked to fulfil his promise of 100 per cent, co-operation with the Government, and to assist in organizing conference? of unions and employers, witli a view to devising means for increasing the number of technical tradesmen in this country. The .present Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) and I were detailed to assist the Government - I remember attending the first conference, which was held in the offices of the Munitions Department in William-street, Melbourne, with Senator MCBride in the chair. The Munitions Department represented to the conference that, on a peace-time basis, 7,000 !oolmakers would be required to complete the contracts that were in hand for that one year. A census showed that there were only 500 of these tradesmen in the Commonwealth wifh a peace-time status. . Mr Holt - To-da y we have recognized tradesmen who have done the full course. We also have the dilutees, and there is a group, of men who have given serin the war. Are the latter to be retained in industry or to be dismissed?",20
75,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"We hope that, there will be no dismissals. This measure has been introduced so that a promise and made when the shortage had to be overmay be kept. The trade unions and the employers agreed conjointly to break down the customs of the past by accepting semi-skilled men as full y skilled, aud regarding unskilled men as semi-skilled. That was the only way to get over the difficulty. The present Government and the previous Administration repeatedly promised the recognized tradesmen that their positions would be restored to them after the war.. If ever the stage be reached at which dismissals will be necessary, the last men to be dismissed will be those who have been recognized as tradesmen. This Parliament, should not only keep that promise, but should also provide for the employment of further quotas of ex-servicemen who have had experience in the metal trades and are to be given a short probationary training.",20
76,Mr WHITE,NATIONAL SECURITY,Will an A i r Force fitter - be classed as a tradesman or a prober bationer?,21
77,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"If he has not had sufficientexperience to satisfy a comto mittee that he is a full y qualified man, his training will be completed.",21
78,Mr WHITE,NATIONAL SECURITY,The provision with gard to apprenticeship is being waived? not,21
79,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,Yes .,21
80,Mr HARRISON,NATIONAL SECURITY,Is there any guarantee that these men will be admitted into the trade unions?,21
81,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The . scheme is based on a voluntary agreement with the unions. We should recognize the value of what the engineering unions, which initiated this scheme, did during the war years. They are now prepared to accept quotas of ex-servicemen with experience in the metal trades, and I hope that the bill will be passed without opposition. Debate (on motion by M.r - HOLT ) adjourned. OVERSEA S TELECOMMUNICATIONS "" - BILL 1946 SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 10th .July (vide page 2369), on motion by M CALWELLThat the hill bo now read a second time.",21
82,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Melbourne-Ministe for Immigration and Minister Information) [3.35 [ - iv: reply - The honourable member ior Wentworth (Mr . Harrison) offered several suggestions and criticisms. He said in the. first, instance that no adequate tribute had been paid to the work performed by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Liniited in developing overseas radio telegraph services. Had he referred to m y . second reading speech he would have found that a tribute was paid to the enterprise of the company in developing its overseas telegraph services, and to the efficient manner in which it had operated the various services underits control.",21
83,Mr HARRISON,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I referred to that, and said that, the recognition was tardy and inadequate.",21
84,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The honourable memhas his own metliods, and they are not the usual methods of honourable members generally. I paid what I considered be an adequate tribute to the company tradesfor the handling of this section of its business. I know that it has done a fine repiece of work for Australia in respect of only its overseas services, but also its Australian manufacturing in terests. It may be said to the credit .of the company that it has never had an industrial dispute among its employees, but has maintained the happiest relations with them. Altogether it employs about 5,000 people, and I think the number was as high as 7,000 - during the war. These men ancl women have rendered good service to their country and to the company.that employed them. If there is any feeling at all that 'the tribute has not been adequate, I add that the Government is highly appreciative of the services of the company ancl its employees. The honourable member for Wentworth also said that no other British country had yet ratified the proposal in the over-all agreement recommended at the conference on telecommunications in 1945, and he asked why Australia should be the first to r at if v r . it. He argued that we should proceed slowly'in the work of ratification. My reply is that all of the British Commonr wealth governments concerned have apf or proved of the form of the over-all agreement, and liave indicated their intention to proceed to a full implementation of the plan for the nationalization of the overseas telecommunications, services.",21
85,Mr HARRISON,NATIONAL SECURITY,But the plan has yet been ratified by the various governments.,22
86,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,The governments concerned are parties to the agreement and have signed it . What the honourable gentleman complains about is that they have not submitted r at if y in g legislation to the parliaments of their respective countries.,22
87,Mr HARRISON,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Unti l the parliaments have passed the necessary legislation, the agreement will not be ratified.",22
88,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"A bill relating to the matter is now before the Parliament' of Great Britain , and I take it that the lionorable member regards that .as an important body in the consideration of the scheme. Great Britain , like Australia, has a good Labour government, ancl will proceed with the work of ratification at the earliest possible moment. The High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in Australia, as a former Minister for Information in the Government of Great Britain , was interested i i i the preparation of the plan for the ratification of the scheme.",22
89,Mr HARRISON,NATIONAL SECURITY,I mentioned that. My argument still stands.,22
90,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"It stands alone, like a shag on a rock. The third point taken by the honourable member was that the Government should consider the operation of the services through the medium of the Postmaster-General's Department rather than by setting up a commission. The honourable member said that the master-General's scheme should be debated in a non-party atmosphere, but before he concluded his telecommunication remarks he descended to gross personalienable ties. He alleged that the idea of the Government in proposing to set up a commission, was to find an opportunity to give jobs to its supporters. He infor stanced the appointment of the former lionorable member for Hen,ty (Mr . Coles) as chairman of the National A i r - ' communication services. lines Commission. That, of course, was most unfair and grossly improper. The former lionorable member Henty was selected on his merits to be chairman of the Commonwealth Airlines Commission, and if success in business is to be regarded as the criterion of a man's capacity to not manage a big business organization, the honourable member for Henty is much better fitted for the position than is any honourable member opposite. The honourable member for Henty.is one of Australians true patriots. He has been actuated, not by base personal motives, but by a desire to serve his country. He has been prepared, even at the cost of in j u ring his business, to put the nation's interest first, and that is more than can be said of many of his critics. The honourable member should understand that it is fundamental to the plan agreed upon at the Loudon conference that the organization to be set out in each Empire country should be a separate entity; that is, either a public corporation or'company wholly owned by the Government;- or, in the event of this proving to be impracticable in any country, and if the organization is a part of a government department, it should take the for m of a separate undertaking. The reason for these arrangements is that the plan agreed upon is Empire-wide, and that under such a plan the government bodies in each Empire country will contribute on an agreed basis towards the expenses of a central board to be established in London, and towards the maintenance 'of the . extensive submarine cable system. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seems to imagine that this is to be a purely Australian concern with no Empire associations. The honourable member further argued that an arrangement by which the PostDepartment would undertake the operation of overseas services would many miles of telegraph lines now used by cable and wireless companies to be released for the use of the department, I point, out that special telegraph channels the handling of overseas traffic would still he needed even were the department to assume the operation of overseas teleThus, there would hot be anything like the saving in the use of telegraph lines which the for honourable member envisages. The honourable member also asked how the interests of the cable staff employed in foreign countries by Cable and Wireless Limited were to be protected. This is matter for determination by the British Governinent, which will acquire the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited. Under the London conference plan, the British Government has agreed to protect the interests of the employees, and there is reason to doubt that it will do so. The honourable member said that government institution was not so well suited to carry out research and developreduced, mental work as were private underhimself imposed it. takings. The answer to that is to be found in the record of the Postmaster General's Department, which maintains one of the finest research laboratories in the country. No private enterprise could succeed in research as does the postal department.",22
91,Mr WHITE,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Cabl e and Wireless war Ximited, in England, has also done much research work.",23
92,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"That is a very big organization, but it has been in nnanciai difficulties for many years, because it not able to compete with new methods of overseas communications. Even though wireless communication offers an alterfinances. native method to communication by cable, the Government of Great Britain found it necessary for many reasons, including the need for secrecy during the war, keep the cables in operation, and therefore subsidized the company so that it might carry on. It would have been foolish for Empire governments to take wireless communications without also taking over the cables. It will be responsibility of the governments of the countries concerned to undertake research work to ensure that advantage is taken of all developments in the science of communication, in respect of both radio and undersea cables. There is in Melbourne a very fine laboratory associated with the Postmaster-General's Departa non-party measure! ment. There is in Sydney another very fine research centre, although a smaller one, associated with Amalgamated Wirepolitics less (Australasia) Limited, and the vernment has no desire to close it There cannot be too many of these laboratories. We learned that during war. We experienced great difficulty because at first we did not have enough research laboratories and worse still, not enough trained research workers. Nothing, a will be done to disperse the research workers associated with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, or to lessen the efiiciency of its laboratories. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) allowed his imagination no to run riot when he attacked the efficiency of the postal department. He a argued that the war-time surcharge on telephone and postal services should be although he admitted that he",23
93,Mr HARRISON,NATIONAL SECURITY,I was not Postmaster General at that time.,23
94,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Well , the surcharge was imposed by the Government of which the honourable member became a member. The reason for the imposition of the surcharge still exists. It was imposed for purposes, and the war is not yet over for at least 100,000 men who are still in uniform. The transition from war to peace is still in process, and that is the most difficult and most dangerous stage is of all. We have not yet returned to the halcyon days of peace. Postal"" and telephone charges are bound up with national When it is possible to reduce the charges they will'be reduced.",23
95,Mr SPENDEB,NATIONAL SECURITY,That means that this to Government will never reduce them.,23
96,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The honourable member for Warringah may have his suspicions, but they prove nothing.. He over was a member of more than one government which succeeded in doing the just nothing. As a matter of fact, the Opposition is where it is today because it did nothing about defence, and it was the honourable member himself who confessed that one division of Japanese troops could have overrun Australia.",23
97,Mr HARRISON,NATIONAL SECURITY,This is supposed to be,23
98,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,If honourable members opposite insist upon introducing they cannot complain if they Gogel. hurt. The honourable member for down. Wentworth said that the Governmenl ought not to retain its interest in the the manufacturing business of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited.,23
99,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Hear , hear!",24
100,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The irrepressible tory from Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) approves, and the equally antideluvian tory from Balaclava (Mr White) echoes that approval. It is illuminating to hear the'members of the newly-formed Liberal party endorsing such tory views. This Government does not subscribe to them. Asa matter of fact, there are good reasons why, in this instance, the Government should retain its interests in the business activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The Commonwealth has participated in those activities over t.he last 24 years, ami there is no good reason why it should now vary an arrangement which has worked so successf u l l y. '",24
101,Mr FADDEN,NATIONAL SECURITY,Does the Government expect to make a reasonable profit out of the business activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited?,24
102,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"Yes . In any case, since the Government is taking away the major part of the company's business, it is morally bound to help the shareholders to preserve their interest in the restricted sphere in which the company will in future be operating. During the period of the company's reconstruction it. would be unfair for the Commonwealth' t.o withdraw its financial investment in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The company will be faced with many problems in re-arranging its organization, and the withdrawal of the Commonwealth's financial investment at such a juncture would place it in an unfortunate position. The Government does not desire that such a position should arise, and therefore it proposes to help the company by allowing its investment to remain. Some honourable members opposite hold a different view; they believe that the best way to help the company would be for the Government to withdraw its money.",24
103,Mr WHITE,NATIONAL SECURITY,I thought that the Minister and his colleagues were not interested in the profit motive.,24
104,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,We are interested in maintaining a strong organization to conduct communications.,24
105,Mr SVENDKR,NATIONAL SECURITY,The Government tends to leave its investments in the company .because it does not want to hand the money over to any private organization.,24
106,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The opinion of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) on this or any other matter does not count,",24
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL SECURITY,I ask the Minister to return to the bill.,24
108,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I do not like being asked to return to the.bill , Mr Deputy Speaker, when I am being subjected to interjections. I propose to reply to them if I think that they are germane to the subject under discussion. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) said that he had been in formed that £1,400,000 had been agreed to as compensation to be paid by the Government to the shareholders in Amal gamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited . He went on to say that, in his opinion, that sum was altogether too high.",24
109,Mr FADIJEN,NATIONAL SECURITY,I said that it may he too high.,24
110,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,The right honourable gentleman then said that the Government should appoint an expert panel of accountants to make an investigation. .,24
111,Mr FADDEN,NATIONAL SECURITY,I did not refer to accountants; I said that a panel of experts should be appointed. They ueed not necessarily be accountants.,24
112,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,I am glad to have the right honourable gentleman's observation that accountants are not necessarily experts.,24
113,Mr FADDEN,NATIONAL SECURITY,I would not have a panel consisting only of accountants to do this work.,24
114,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"The right honourable gentleman said that £750,000 would be adequate compensation. Obviously, lie has received information from some one who has bad access to confidential documents. The use made of information thus obtained is, to say the least, highly improper.",24
115,Mr FADDEN,NATIONAL SECURITY,The information I in- obtained was given to me by - an exuiember of this House. \,24
116,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I have not said that the right honourable gentleman bad no right to use the information; I shall use inf ormation that comes into my possession if by so doing I can serve the interests of the country. I said that the use of the information was, to say the least, highly, improper.' I did not criticize the'right honourable gentleman for using it. The man who gave it to him was guilty of a misuse of information. Finality has not yet been reached with the company, but negotiations for an agreement are proceeding. . The Government is of the opinion that it is better to reach an agreement by negotiation, if that can be done, rather than that it should provide a feast for lawyers such as the honourable member for Warringah. That certainly would be a misuse of public funds. If we are to pay compensation in'the way indicated by the Prime Minister, who is also Treasurer, honourable members can rest assured that neither too much nor too little will be paid. The figure which will ultimately be arrived at will probably be less than if a case were allowed to drag through the law courts of this country, until finally a number of judges in either Australia or Great Britain decided the issue, without knowing as much about the operations of the company as do the people who are at present conducting the negotiations. I point out that,, in addition to the purchase of the physical assets of the company, the Government must have regard to the loss of profits resulting from the termination of the agreement. The company has ahvays maintained that it has valuable interminable rights. Whether it has them or not, the fact remains that it makes that claim. Such ii claim cannot be dismissed in the flippant way that the honourable meinber for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) would dismiss it.",25
117,Mr CONELAN,NATIONAL SECURITY,Whateve r rights the company claims to have were given to it by non-Labour governnients.,25
118,Mr CALWELL,NATIONAL SECURITY,"That is so. It must not be forgotten that in acquiring the telecommunications assets and services of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the Commonwealth will acquire also .the revenue benefits arising out of the conduct of such services solely by a government authority. That revenue is considerable. Indeed, trade rivals of Amalgamated - Wireless (Australasia) Limited say that that company has been able to compete successfully in its manufacturing sphere of activities because of the diversion thereto, as subsidies, of profits from the telecommunications section; Adequate and reasonable compensation must be paid to the private shareholders of the company for the loss of their rights. No good purpose would be served by the appointment of a panei of experts, as the Government has confidence in its present advisers. Whatever the final compensation figure arrived at may be, honourable members may rest assured that it will be fair to the company as well as to the taxpayers. I doubt Avhether experts equal in ability and knowledge to the two gentlemen who are conducting the . negotiations could be found. Although they have been named by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), I repeat that the task has been entrusted to the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. MCFarlane, and the Director-General of Posts ancl Telegraphs, Mr Fanning. The honourable member for Barker said that the charges imposed by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for ship to ship and ship to shore communications are high compared with those in other British countries. The reply to that observation is that the rates for this class of traffic are determined by the agreement entered into between the administrations of the countries concerned, the shipping companies, and the bodies operating the coastal radio stations. The charges made by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited are in accordance with that agreement. In some British countries the rates are higher than those charged by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in the Australian and New Zealand zones. In respect of British ships operating beyond those zones', Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has offered to reduce the rates to the lower level obtain-' ing here, but with the exception of one company, the authorities controlling such ships have not so far accepted the offer. The details are shown in a statement which, witli the consent of the House, I shall incorporate in HansardNA SHIPS AT SEA FROM AUSTRALIAN, PAPUAN AND NEW GUINEA STATIONS. To Australian.

(sterling) per word, according to classification of ship and nationality, and according to the coast station through which the message is transmitted. Particulars regarding tlio corresponding charges levied i r i New Zealand are not readily available but information in this respect will be obtained later if so desired. The other points raised by the honourable member for Barker were equally interesting, but not very convincing. He said that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited had certain monopolies over patents which he questioned its right to possess. The reply to that observation is that as between the Commonwealth and the company the matter of patent rights was covered by Part II . of the Wireless Agreement 1927. That part of the agreement was completely determined on 1st March, 1934, by processes therein provided. Since that date the company's claims to those rights have ceased to exist. The honourable member is just twelve years out of date, but that is nothing exceptional for him. When I asked him why, when he was Postmaster General, he did not rectify some of the things about which. he now complains, the honourable gentleman replied that he was in office for only five months. The average member of the Australian Labour party would not need five months in which to rectify something which he believed to be wrong. The honourable member apparently Aot only wasted the whole of the five months he was in office, because he did nothing to remedy the things he complains about today, but he also did not even attempt to find out what the position was because he has referred - to something which, on the evidence, ceased to exist about twelve years F r o m New ago.

120,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,"Temporaril y belongs! - Mr Calwell - I accept the correction, which is indicative of the honourable member's mind on all questions. And the fact that he is even temporarily under the deputy leadership of the honourable member for Wentworth is also merely an accidental circumstance. The plan for co-ordinating overseas telecommunications throughout the British Commonwealth and Empire, as recommended by the London Telecommunications Conference of 1945, was accepted in principle by all the-governments of the British Commonwealth, not only those that had the advantage of an up-to-datej progressive Labour outlook, but even by those that were somewhat backward in their outlook. It is fundamental to that plan that the organization to be. set up should be a separate entity, that is, either a public corporation or a wholly government owned company, or, in the event of that proving impracticable in any country, and if the organization is part of a government 'department, it should take the form of a separate undertaking. I have already said that in' respect of the observations of the honourable member for Wentworth, and I fool impelled to repeat the statement, in order to make the position clear in relation to the observations of the lionorable member for Barker. reason for this arrangement is that the plan agreed upon is Empire-wide, and that under such plan the governinent bodies in each Empire country will contribute on an agreed basis towards the expenses of a central board to be establisbed in London, and towards the maintenance of the extensive submarine cable system. We cannot look at this merely as a problem associated with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, Cable and Wireless Ximited and the Australian Postmaster-G-eneral'sDepartment. A general rule - should be laid down, claimed the honourable member for Barker-who, way, observes no rules at all in respect of anything-that an activity of this kind .should either be a 100 per cent, government undertaking or left wholly to private enterprise. The honourable gentleman is certainly an extremist; he goes the limit whichever way he decides. There is a happy medium in all things, and this (Government commends itself to the Australian people because it is always able to discover the happy medium, not only in respect of a matter such as is covered by this bill, but also in all other matters Overseas telecommunications as provided for ini the bill will be a 100 per cent, government undertaking. The Government's interest in the manufacturing activities of the company is not covered by a provision in the hill as it now stands, but by an agreement that may be made under clauses 23, 49A and 52 of the bill as they will be amended later. Some of those who at present are employed in cable and wireless services are fearful of their fate under the new arrangement, said the honourable member for Barker. honourable gentleman went further and said that I had given no clear statement of what the Government proposes to do with these employees. Suitable provision has, however, been made in clause 18 (11) of the bill' for the protection of the interests of the cable and radio employees. Following the implementation of that provision, the Government intends to set up a oommittee to give consideration to all matters affecting all employees concerned in the transfer of the telecommunication services. That committee will consist of representatives of the twoAO. Calwell. companies, Amalgamated Wireless (AusThe tralasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited and of the Government, and whatever is decided upon will no doubt be given effect immediately and without dimculty.",26

The framing of provisions defining the rights of employees would, in the opinion of the legal - advisers of the Government, be beyond the capacity of the Parliamentary Draftsman,-'and even if they could be framed, their, inclusion in the bill may even be beyond the right of the Parliament.

For instance, the 1922 agreement exempted the company from payment of terminal charges to the Commonwealth, but this provision was altered later and the pany was required to pay tliose Tn addition, the company was required to pay to the Commonwealth 30 per cent, of the revenue it received from its and island services. Thus, instead of receiving a subsidy, the company was required to make a contribution from revenue to the Government. In order compensate the company to some for the loss incurred on its coastal and island traffic, and in consideration of the company discharging certain obligations of the Commonwealth in respect of safety of life at sea. the Commonwealth agreed to pay £45,000 per annum. But the Commonwealth would have been obliged to pay that amount to any instrumenof tality for sending messages from'the to vessels at sea. However, this payment by the. Commonwealth is more than truth balanced by the revenue received by Commonwealth. Tf there is anything wrong with the agreement, the honourable member for Barker has been long enough n member of the. Parliament to raise his voice in the councils of the various parties to which he has given his doubt that f u l allegiance, ancl in the various governmonwealth ments in which he has served with siderable notoriety, .with a view to effecting any remedy he desired. However, he conies now, in 1946, like an'avenging angel with a fiery sword, and says that Bourke * (Mr Bryson), lie is going to bave something fixed up. There is nothing to fix up now, because the i-aso put up by the honourable member is based on shifting sands: The amounts paid by the company for the year ended the 30th June, 1945, totalled £101,417, consisting of £91,874 in respect of terminal charges for beam service, -£3,S00 in respect of terminal charges for . coastal and island radio services, and £c>,743, representing 30 per cent, of revenue from its coastal and island radio services. Allowing for a contra amount of £45,000 paid to the company by the Commonwealth, the balance in favour of memthe Commonwealth was £56,417. That was the position in a typical year, but other years the balance in favour of the Commonwealth was greater. Therefore, instead of all the dreadful revelations regarding payments by the Commonwealth to the company year afteryear, which the honourable member said! the files would disclose, the fact is that comlast year the Commonwealth received charges. from the company £56,417.",28
127,Mr FADDEN,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,Did not the company coastal receive services for that amount?,28
128,Mr CALWELL,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,"The right honourable gentleman, as a brilliant accountant, its should know that the Commonwealth to never pays anything without getting degree service for its outlay.",28
129,Mr FADDEN,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,The company got value for that amount.,28
130,Mr CALWELL,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,"The argument is not, whether the company received value. The honourable member for Barker said that the Commonwealth was paying out a lot money to the company which it ought shore not to be paying out-that the Commonwealth was subsidizing the company. The of the matter, as I have shown, is the that the company is making veiy lieavy payments to the Commonwealth. No subsidy is paid to the company. The aspect of service does not arise. I have no doubt, however, that the company has provided very good service for the money it has received, and that the Comhas not paid more for that conthan was fair and equitable. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr . Haylen), the honourable member for the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Chambers), ancl the honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly) spoke in support of the bill, and I - compliment them upon their statesmanlike utteralready ances. The honourable member for the Bourke urged au extension of the mittee system of competitive examination to all employees rather than limiting' such examinations to clerical employees only. He also suggested the establishment a promotion appeals board by the comto mission as is provided for in the monwealth Bank Act.' The conditions employment of technical and other em-' ployees, except .clerical employees, will call for the laying down of certain qualipany fications. It may be considered that the commission should make any necessary detailed arrangements in this connection by the issue of regulations under the rather than by specific provision in the act itself. In respect of the promotions appeals board it may be ""preferable, an appeal board is to be set up by the commission to determine questions relatstatement. ing to promotions, that the matter be dealt with by the issue of regulations under the actand not by special provision in the act itself. However, I am impressed by the remarks of the honorof able gentleman, and I have referred the - I movematters he raised to the Postmaster General (Senator Cameron) with a view mittee. to determining whether any amendments should be made to clause 18 of the bill to cover the points at issue, or whether it would be preferable to deal with these matters by way of regulations issued under the act."" If it is found desirable, certain provisions in this respect will be included in the bill at a later I shall, ask the Postmaster-General make such amendments in the Senate. I come now to the speech of the right honourable member for North ney (Mr Hughes), who, among Opposi-' tion members, at least knows somethe thing about the measure. He has that played a very important role in guiding, the relations of the Commonwealth Government with the various teleassurance communication companies which have operated in Australia.

The capital of the company is approximately £1,000,000. At the date of the last balance-sheet, reserves, other than specific reserves, amounted tq £625,878. So, each share at the date of the last balance-sheet had a backing of 30s. l i d . , whereas buyers are offering 71s. 6d. That shows that the price of 71s. 6d. is a result of those negotiations.

152,Mr HUGHES,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,"North Sydney) [4.50]. t.o understand that an ex-serviceman will have the same rights and privileges under this bill as he would have in industry generally? Is that what the Minister means? . Mr Calwell - An ex-serviceman will have the same rights as he would have if he were a member of the Public Service or an employee of any other commission appointed by the Government. Mr HUGHE'S - When the Re-estab-. lishment and'.Employment Act was before the House honourable members were given to understand that preference in employment would be accorded to ex-servicemen. Whatever'the precise, meaning, range and effect.of the sections purporting to confer preference in that act may be-and nobody seems to know-this clause may take away from ex-servicemen the rights provided for them in the act. I do not believe for a moment that that is the intention of the Minister. However, such an interpretation could be placed on this clause, ancl I consider that it should be clarified in order to place the position beyond doubt. When we deal with the Tradesmen's Eights Regulation Bill we shall find that it provides that an employer may engage only a recognized tiadesman to engage in a trade job. Nothing is said, about the employee being an ex-serviceman or anything else. In effect, this provides for preference to trade unionists, not to soldiers. I do not object to preference to unionists, but I do object to it being brought in by a sideentrance, as it were. Honourable members understood that preference in employment to ex-servioemen was to.be general, and that the Crown was to be bound by the Re-establishment and Employment Act. But if the interpretation of the act given by a lower court is upheld, the Crown is not bound by the provisions of the act. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission will represent the Crown, and,according to,one magistrate's.decision, it will not be bound to accord preference to cx-servicemen. The Mmister should make ihe position quite clear.",33
153,Mr CALWELL,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information) [4.54] - I draw attention to clause 44 of the Australian Soldiers Bepatriation Act 1943, which deals with the point raised by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes). It statesAfter section fifty-five of the principal llic following section is inserted in Part IV . : "" 5flA - (1.) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law of the Commonwealth of any - State or Territory of the wealtli fir in any award, order or determination of any industrial tribunal or of any industrial agreement, preference shall, in the appointment of persons to the Public Service Commonwealth ov to the service of an authority of the Commonwealth, be given to persons have been members of the Forces and have served outside Australia or in any area prescribed as a combat area for the purposes of this Act and who are competent for the work required. That covers the position. Obviously, it will apply to persons seeking employment with the proposed commission, just as it now applies to persons seeking employment with any other commission or Commonwealth department.",34
154,Mr SPENDER,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,"Warringah) [4.56] I am concerned in particular with the position of employees of Cable and Wireless Limited. I am not greatly concerned about the issue just raised by the right honourable member for North 'Sydn'ey (Mr Hughes), because I believe that the Minister has explained the position adequately. For the purposes of the law dealing with preference to ex-servicemen, the conimission will be equivalent to a department of the Public Service. I observe that, in sub-clause 11 of clause 18, an attempt is being made to provide for the employees of Cable and Wireless Limited. The taking over of a concern such as this has a direct bearing on its employees. The sub-clause statesNotwithstanding anything contained in this section, any other employee of the Company or any employee of Cable and Wireless Ltd. who. at the date of acquisition by the Commission of the telecommunication assets referred to respectively in sub-sections (1.) and (2.) of section twenty-three of this Act. is exclusively engaged in Australia in or in connection with telecommunication services and has been so exclusively engaged for a period of three years, and for whom the Commission can find suitable employment shall be entitled „to a position in the service of the Conimission with such status and salary and under such conditions as the Commission determines: The first important factor .to consider is that the principle will apply only .if the employee concerned has been engaged exclusively with - the comact pany for three years prior to the taking over of the company. That may be interor preted in'such a way as to operate very Commonunjustly against a man who has been engaged in one of the fighting services. It might be said that a person who had of the been serving with the armed forces at the termination of hostilities had not who been engaged exclusively by Cable and Wireless Limited or Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for a period of three years. That is a distinct possis bility. I do not believe that the Government intends such an interpretation to be made, and I am sure that this committee has no such intention. Three years is not a fair period, because persons employed for less than three years may justly deserve, some consider a-tion as the result of the disturbance caused by this legislation. I am not satisfied that there is sufficient provision for the welfare of such persons. Men who have had less than three years exclusive service with the company are entitled to some consideration. They may have certain rights in respect of pensions, for instance. There ought to be in this hill a provision similar to that in statutes providing for the taking over of State employees by the Commonwealth. Failing that, compensation should be paid to persons displaced unless an opportunity is given them to find employment with the commission. Thus, three problems arise in connection with employees of the companies to be taken over. First, the bill does not at all for persons with less than three years exclusive service. No provision made for pensions for them, or for comimportant matter. pensation for superannuation rights which they may have lost. Secondly, words ""engaged for a period of years "" may exclude servicemen who the actual employment of the company for service overseas. In their case, might be denied that'they have had years exclusive service with the company. Thirdly, the provision which entitles such as do come within the meaning of sub-clause to a position in the service the commission is of little real value since the right is conditioned by these words-""to a position in the service of the corn-mission with such status salary, and under such conditions, as the sub-clause 11. commission determines "". I realise that the problem is not a simple one, but I raise the matter now because the ememployees if it can. ployees constitute an important section of the public, and are important parties to'this transaction. Therefore, I believe that they should receive more consideramittee tion than is afforded them in the bill. The three points which I have raised should'be answered, if not now, then at some later time. '. Mr WHITE (Balaclava) [5.4] - 1 should like the Minister (Mr Calwell) to state clearly whether it is proposed to merger. ensure that preference in employment shall be given to ex-servicemen. The Minister said that there was no doubt of this, but, with due respect to him, I say that there is considerable doubt. It is my belief that the section of the Repatriation Act which gave preference was repealed by section 22 of the Re-establishment and Employment Act.",34
155,Mr CALWELE,WORD RATES FOR RADIOTELEGRAMS TO,"There is a' substitute provision for that section. Mr - WHITE - This point-sbould be properly considered, 'and if there is any doubt the Minister should accept an amendment which I propose ""to move as an additional sub-clause in order to provide that, in the matter of employment, preference shall be given to ex-servicemen. I agree with what the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) said in regard to protecting the rights of other employees, but I emphasize that the particular rights of ex-servicemen should be provide guaranteed.

This motion is to give effect to the Goby vernment's wheat stabilization policy in and two regard to the contribution by growers. It relates to a charge on all wheat exported. The charge applies to wheat now in No. 9 pool from the 1945-46 season and to later crops. It will be 50 per cent, of the excess of the export price above the guai antee; the otlier half going to growers as a part of the pool return. There is propresvision for a lower rate than 50 per cent, to be prescribed, or for a lower price to on be prescribed for the basis of calculating and the .50 per cent, contribution. It has already been stated that this season the growers will get the full benefit of the end export price above 9s. 6d. a bushel, and so ilj.it price will be used this season stead of the actual export return now estimated at 10s. a busnel. The reason for this is that a price of 9s. 6d. a was used as the basis of calculation when the plan was being considered, and now that the export return is likely to exceed 9s. 6d. a bushel the growers will get the full benefit of the extra amounts. . Other portions of the resolution are intended facilitate collection of the charge on a powers pool basis. The Australian Wheat Board powers will, in effect, be the export seller, will pay the charge at reasonable interwhich vals instead of paying each time a shipsiderations. ment is made.

187,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) |'5.35] - It is impossible in one speech to deal with all the political problems of the wheat industry, not only because it is one of the greatest of Australian industries, but also because it provides us'with a considerable share of our export income. Its problems are, and for many years have been, far-reaching; as far back as I can remember politics, the Parliament has from time to time considered the needs of this industry and has inendeavoured to do something for it. I propose to concentrate my remarks upon certain essential aspects of the bill before bushel the House, which contains a portion, at any rate, of the Government's wheat stabilization plan. The first aspect with which I wish to deal is the relation of this bill, and the plan to which it refers, to the referendum for the alteration of to the Constitution by including marketing in the list of those held by the Commonand wealth Parliament. This is a question gives rise to some curious conI n the course of the Minissecond-reading speech, which contained a full and fair statement of the of Government's plan, he gave expression tn some ideas which I desire to quote because they have a great bearing on the forthcoming referendum. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture saidCo-operation - with the States is an essential part of the plan. The States control production, and production must be regulated according to the markets available for our wheat. In marketing,-Commonwealth and States must .use their constitutional powers in harmony, if the plan is to be effective; neither can provide effective marketing unaided. Later, he saidThe stabilization plan is intended to make the wheat industry"" sound financially. Regulation of production, not restriction of production, has been recognized over the years as one requisite for any plan. It is recognized not only by the governments concerned, but >by the growers; and growers are willing to co-operate in regulation of the industry to secure the wide benefits of stabilization. Regulation of production is another feature . which was brought in as a war-time measure, and now can readily be adapted to peace-time needs. It is a State function, and Commonwealth and States will co-operate to secure uniformity in administration. The experience gained by State oflicers during the war years, wliile they were co-operating to carry out Commonwealth policy, will be invaluable in the future in carrying out the joint policy. Special mention should be"" made of the need for co-operation between Australian governments on this question. Commonwealth and States have their separate powers, and, by using tliem together, the plan can be carried into effect. Used separately, the constitutional powevs of the governments are not capable of dealing with the problem. The plan represents a high degree of co-operation between Australian governments, and it provides for a partnership in which all of them will - play au effective part, not' only in deciding the policy, but also in carrying it out. Those observations by the Minister are, in niy opinion, completely correct, but they are wholly at variance, I believe, with the basic argument that has been submitted for the marketing referendum. 'It was said from this side of the House, and - in particular by those honourable members who sit behind me in opposition, that the problem of production could not be discussed quite independently of the problems of marketing and prices, and, accordingly, that the ideal system was one in which there was co-operation between the States, with their special authority over production, and the Commonwealth, with its special authority over interstate and international trade. If any justification were required for that argument it is to be found in the passages I have just quoted. Here is a scheme which, as I have followed the Minister's speech, is not regarded as being in any constitutional doubt. It is put forward as a valid scheme designed to last for a period of years, and it therefore cannot be regarded as depending on an affirmative vote at the marketing referendum. The Constitution amendment which will shortly be before the people seeks to concentrate all power in relation to marketing and prices in the hands of the Commonwealth, leaving the problem of production entirely in the hands of the States. Accordingly, if the power is to be used with any success exactly the same-type of co-operation will have to be achieved between the Commonwealth and the States as is exemplified in this bill with no constitution alteration at all. I pass to the second consideration. The Minister has just introduced to the House a second measure, the Wheat Export - Charge Bill. It is perhaps unfortunate for the proper consideration of this plan that the House has not had before it from the beginning, first, the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, to which I am now addressing myself; secondly, the Wheat Export Charge Bill, which is an integral part of the plan; and, thirdly, some outline of the legislation io be presented to the State parliaments, because we must have a knowledge of all three if we are to have an accurate conception of the plan as a whole.. I would like to say a littlenot much need be said-about Mr Menzies. case for the stabilization of the wheat industry on the basis of what I might call a floor prioe. There have been, over the yea>rs, differences of opinion about this matter-ther e are probably still differences of opinion on matters of greater or smaller detail-.bu t I believe that all parties agree that if we are to solve the problem of the wheat industry there must be a stabilization upon the footing of a guaranteed price.' That is just, because, of course, it would create a more balanced economy in Australia. The position might be different if we had an uncontrolled economy all round; but we have not had an uncontrolled economy. By our tariff policy, which I strongly support, we have accorded to manufacturing, industries a protection which is designed to enable them to sell. in competition at a price which will cover the cost of production and some reasonable measure of profit. In other words, we have in the case of manufactures assured the reasonably efficient manufacturer of a reasonable price upon the local market. In respect of wheat we should in the first instance afford a similar stability. But wheat is a commodity which, is not merely sold on the local market. In the past our manufactures 'have been almost entirely - sold on the local market, a circumstance which many of us hope will change rapidly in the next few years. Wheat, on the contrary, has been one of our great export products. The wheat industry is one of thechief industries on which Australia has depended for its overseas income, and it is now so constituted that we cannot say that we have given to it any degree of real stability if we deal only with that portion of the wheat crop which is harvested and sold in Australia. We must seek to give a reasonable measure of stability to the whole of what migbt be described as the average wheat harvest, whether it be sold in Australia or abroad. Therefore we must be prepared to potect the wheat-grower in re-, spect of not only that portion of his crop which is sold here but also a reasonable volume of production for export. Whether the . latter should be arrived at by.control of acreage, or by some other means, is a matter which excites.some difthe ferences of opinion. I do not propose to discuss those differences of opinion at this stage because, fortunately, we have some reasonable assurance that, for the next few years at any rate, Australia will be able to sell all the wheat it can grow. A stabilization scheme upon a proper price basis should not be looked at merely as if it imposed at some future time a potential liability upon the Treasury.. Looking at this plan we may feel con-: fident, as 1 do, that in the next few years the contributions to the stabilization fund will come out of the realization of wheat ancl not out of the Treasury; but the object of the scheme is that if at some future time the moneys in the fund should be exhausted, in order to stabilize the price at the necessary level assistance will be forthcoming front the Commonwealth Treasury. That may be expressed as a future possible liability. Against such a potential liability there must be offset enormous advantages to Australia. The fact that we stabilize this great staple industry means that we are helping to produce a balanced economy and a proper spread of population in Australia-that we are doing something ih the real sense towards the prevention of undue aggregation of population in the big cities. In a word, a. scheme of this kind represents practical decentralization. Itmay not be decentralization in the sense in which that - word connotes the establishment of new industries, but it certainly will make secure an old and well established industry which is vital to the - Australian economy. All these desirable things that I have referred to require .solvent and progressive rural industries as the foundation of a modern and civilized life for our primary producers, with the necessary amenities to ensure that our country dwellers are able to resist the lure of city life and city occupations. It is proper that I should say, and I kpow the Minister will agree with me, .thai, the stabilization idea is not new. .Attempts have been made to produce plans in the past. The present proposal, I say at once, appears very liberal when compared with the plan of 1940-41 at the time when the government of which I was Prime Minister was in office; but, in reality, the difference between the 1940-41 plan and the present plan is very, largely, apart, from certain features which I shall discuss later, a difference of price. In 1940-41 world parity for wheat was substantially below the price which was to be guaranteed under the Government's plan. As honourable members will recall, the plan at that time provided for a guaranteed price, of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. ports. There was a provision that any receipts on realization of wheat above that price should be divided, as in this plan, between the fund and the growers. The guarantee was to be applied to a realized harvest of 140,000,000 bushels. That meant this: In 1940-41 the government of that clay was accepting what looked like a certain responsibility to subsidize the plan heavily at the outset, because, as I say, world parity was below the price that was indicated. In 1946, the present Government is in a very much happier position because world parity is well above the guaranteed price proposed in the bill, and, consequently, there will be no initial liability upon the Government; that is something for the distant future. So far as we can judge, over the next few years the fund wil] be accumulating its reserves out of the plus difference between the guaranteed price and world parity. Therefore, for the first few years at least this will be essentially a growers' fund. Having regard to some references which are made occasionally to the 1940-41 plan-no t by the Minister,' but I have heard contemptuous references to the 1940-41 plan-it is, perhaps, worthwhile reminding the House of two facts in relation to.that plan: First, that scheme provided for a guaranteed price of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. ports, and for the provision of a fund into which surpluses were to be paid, the surpluses to be divided equally between the growers and the fund; and, secondly, the price then indicated was remarkably close to the price which bad been asked for by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. It is not to be thought that the governinent in tbose days was nominating a price completely out of harmony with the ideas of those engaged in the industry. It was not; because on the 27th August, 1939,. the Australian Wheat Growers Federation made certain proposals, all of which, if I remember rightly, found a place in the Government's scheme. But the price asked for b.y the federation was 3s. lOd. a biishpl f.o.r. nort.s. That is not identical with 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. ports, but is remarkably close to it . I mention those figures in order to indicate that the proposals then made had all the essential features of a sound stabilization plan, whilst the price imposed, as we were reminded recently by the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen), a very large immediate ancl potential liability upon the government of the day. I turn from that, because I do not want to dwell unnecessarily on-matters of past history, to another question. Should there be a poll of wheat-growers before this scheme comes into operation? There is a fair l y well-established - practice in Australia- I can recall many instances in rural industries-tha' t before schemes of this kind, which affect primaril y the growers of commodities, are put into operation, the wishes of the growers sliould be ascertained. A fte r all, their labour, skill and assets, their acceptance of risks, and in many cases their acceptance of - hardships, have produced the harvest, and they are,, therefore, the most interested people. Indeed, as we have seen, for thenext few years, they will inevitably be the major contributors to the stabilization .fund; and in those circumstances we believe that before legislation of this kind comes into operation it should require to be approved by a majorit y of the wheat growers voting at a poll taken for that purpose.",40
188,Mr BURKE,WHEAT INDUSTRY,Does the right honourable gentleman - mean a poll on the subject of stabilization or on the conditions of stabilization?,43
189,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"I am suggesting that the bill when passed, before it comes into operation, sliould be referred by poll as a total scheme to the growers in orcier to secure' their approval or disapproval. It is not for me to say whether the growers approve the proposal. I am not in the least degree qualified to say what the view of the wheat-growers would be upon that matter. I have heard seine honourable members who affect to know something about these things say that the wheat-growers were hostile to the plan. I have heard others say with equal confidence that the growers would be in favour of it. I offer no opinion about that, aspect at all, but I venture to offer the opinion held by many people that when you are dealing with a large i m portant industry of this country and you are establishing a scheme which, for some time to come, will involve large contributions by the growers tliemselves out of the realization of their own wheat, the opinion of the growers should be taken.",43
190,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT INDUSTRY,Did the right honourable gentleman follow that course when his Government introduced its stabilization scheme ?,43
191,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY,O u r stabilization scheme never came into operation. Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. .,43
192,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Before dinner I had been ' addressing myself to the Government's wheat stabilization scheme and in particular to the general case for stabilization. I now want to refer to some aspects of the scheme requiring determination. The first is perhaps one of the most important 'questions connected with the scheme: Should the 1945-46 harvest be included; in this scheme? I want to say at once that the answer to that question is in my opinion and in the opinion of many otlier honourable members of this House, no, the 1945-46 harvest should not he included in the scheme. Indeed, it is difficult to .understand on what principle of justice a stabilization scheme of tha kind now before us can be made retro ; spective, and that is, in effect, what the proposal of the Government amounts to. The 1945-46 harvest, that is the harvest of the last season, was acquired by the Commonwealth under regulation 14 - of the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations. It was acquired, as preceding harvests during the war were acquired, by virtue of the Commonwealth's war-time power, and if I read regulation 14, which is the important one for this purpose, honourable members will 3ee exactly how it operates. It says thisFor securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth and the Territories Of the Commonwealth, for the efficient prosecution of the war, and for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community, the Minister may, from time to time, by order published in the Gazette, make provision for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of any wheat described in the order, and that wheat shall, by force of and in accordance with the provisions of the order become the absolute property of the Commonwealth, freed from all mortgages, charges, liens, pledges, interests and trusts affecting that - wlieat, and the rights and interests of every person in that wheat (including any rights or interests arising in respect of any moneys advanced in respect of that wheat) are hereby converted into claims for compensation. It. will be seen fro m the terms of regulation and from the other regulaextent tions that the Australian Wheat Board was the body set up to sell wheat the acquired by the Commonwealth under to regulation 14. Tliat power was exerbeen cised by the Commonwealth presumharvest. ably under the well-known and mucli1945-46 quoted provision of the Constitution which, we findi n paragraph xxxi of section 51. It is perhaps as well to restitutional mind ourselves of its termsThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to(xxxi.) The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person any purpose in respect of which Parhament has power to make laws . . . Consequently, the wheat harvest, not only in 1945-46 but in previous years, was acquired by the Commonwealth. The rights of the wheat-growers were coning verted from rights of property in the wlieat into right to receive compensation from the Commonwealth, and, as comdemands pensation is represented by the words "" just terms "", it is difficult, if not sible, for me to understand how payment for that wheat can f all below the level of the actual market value of the wheat. When the wheat-growers' 1945-46 harvest was acquired and delivered the claim substantially by the wheat-grower at once arose. We are now dealing with a scheme which seeks to include the 1945-46 wheat, the f though the rights of wheat-growers to paid for that wheat came into existence, under regulation 14, months and months ago. So that when this scheme proposes go back and take away from the grower some of the benefits' of the claim that he had, it is retrospectively deprivwould ing him of a right which was f u l matured at the beginning of the year. It is not disputed, as I understand it. that the price at which wheat was sold or saleable by the board was greater than the 5s. 2d. f.o.r. ports stated in this bill and it may very woll be greater even than the larger siim mentioned by the Minister in the course of his second reading speech. It seems to me a most astonishing proposal that wheat already acquired, wheat in respect of which Comthat monwealth liability to an ascertainable has already accrued, should be included in a future scheme, the effect of acquisition being to reduce the price which the grower .otherwise would have entitled in relation to the 1945-46 The proposed inclusion of the harvest is not only grossly unfair and retrospective, but it seems to me to deliberately cut across the conprotection to which the wheat grower was entitled at the moment at which the wheat was acquired. I do not want to labour that. I put that view the briefly as clearly as I oan. I have heard nothing so far from the Minister or the Government which would indicate that there is any answer to that argument at for all . Certainly there is no answer satis% the factory to the individual wheat-grower. But there are other reasons, economic reasons, for excluding that harvest. The harvest was extraordinarily low, following a drought year. In many wheat-growareas in Australia that drought was not merely of one year's duration, it was of two. On top of. that the inevitable and circumstances of war have on - meant that a good deal of maintenance, imposrepair and development work on farms has been postponed ancl plant has become obsolete or worn out. The result of all that may be a fictitious state of credit for some farmers, others may find themselves in debt. If we add all those circumstances together, surely they sup1 port the elementary justice of giving to armer the full benefit of the full price be of the 1945-46 harvest so that he may have proper opportunity of paying his debts, re-establishing himself, doing re; to pair and maintenance work and buying plant, for the future. If that were done the effect would be that the industry be in a more solvent position, and l y the new scheme would not begin until the 1946-47 harvest. It would then operate entirely in relation to future harvests and deliveries. The next consideration is the problem of how the guaranteed minimum price should be fixed. The bill fixes the guaranteed minimum price to be paid by the board to the growers at 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports, and, as I understand the scheme, that is to be the price for a period of five years. The bill itself contains no provision that I have been able to discover for the variation of the price at any time during that term. On that state of affairs I have two comments to make. The first is this: It seems to me practically a certainty that over the next five years, the cost of producing wheat in this country will rise in terms of Australian money, because it is quite clear not only that the basic wage in Australia will be due very shortly for revision, but also that when wage-pegging is relaxed, and it. will be relaxed someday, wages generally will rise, and prices and costs also will rise. If that expectation be correct-and he would be a very bold-man who offered any other prophecy of the events of the next five years- a guaranteed price for wheat that seems quite fair in 1946 may have become seriously inadequate by 1948 or 1949. Therefore, it seems to me essential that there should besome fair and accurate means bf adjusting the guaranteed price in accordance with any increase of costs that may occur during the period of the operation of this scheme.",43
193,Mr BURKE,WHEAT INDUSTRY,What about a reduced world price?,45
194,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"I am directing my attention, at present, to that element of this scheme that says, "" Here is a guaranteed minimum price which is designed to make the industry solvent, and which is to last five years"". If the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke) believes that he can guarantee to the wheat farmers not only a price for the next five years but also a level of costs, he will have an answer to my argument; but J. do not believe that anybody can guarantee the maintenance of the present cost, level. In terms of Australian money this is certain to rise. We of the Opposition propose that there should be incorporated in this scheme some'means for a periodica] adjustment of the guaranteed minimum price to accommodate any increase of the reasonable cost of the reasonably efficient production of wheat. That, we believe, should be done-by means of a rural industries board which would make periodical investigations and reports. That is the first, comment that I make on this aspect of the matter. My second comment is this: If we do have machinery for the periodical revision of the problem of costs and the periodical reascertainment of a .guaranteed minimum price, a period of five years - seems unreasonably short. After ail, if we intend this stabilization scheme to be permanent, so far as possible, and if we are really endeavouring to carry the problem of the wheat industry beyond mere annual or sporadic treatment, the obvious thing for us to do is to institute a longer term for the scheme, and to introduce into that longer tenn means for a periodical adjustment of the price to be paid. Therefore, we suggest that the period should be ten years instead of five, to enable wheat-farmers to plan the development and use of their properties over a reasonably long period. I have referred to the need for a rural industries hoard. May I add just a few words about the purpose and function of such a board. With great respect to all honourable members, and particularly to those who are closely acquainted with the wheat industry, I suggest that the ' Parliament ' is not an effective tribunal for determining the cost of producing wheat. The great majority of us in this chamber are not qualified to attempt that task. The fixing of the price, therefore, must be either a matter of sheer bargaining from time to time between contending political elements, which is a very unscientific way of dealing with a great industry, or a matter of careful, accurate, and impartial investigation. Many years ago in this country we established the Tariff Board primarily to deal with secondary industries. That board consisted, and still consists, of specially chosen men with capacity for impartial investigation and with great facilities for such investigation - The Tariff Board has established a very high reputation and a very high authority. I am sure that every member of this chamber will agree that the Tariff Board, in relation to secondary, industries, has achieved such public authority that its recommendations almost invariably are regarded throughout Australia as reasonable and having due and proper relation to tlu? costs of Australian production. If an application is made for a tariff, the Tariif Board investigates the actual local industry or the potential local industry. It examines the efficiency and costs of that industry, and in clue course makes its'recommendation. What we propose is thnt in relation to primary industries, particularly the wheat industry, there should be a board which corresponds in its function to the Tariff Board- a rural industries board competently manned, and with adequate facilities for investigation so that as a permanent body it would very soon develop a reputation and authority similar to that of the Tariff Board. Its prime function for the purpose of this scheme would be to determine periodically- I shall hot attempt to define "" periodically but so far as I am concerned it would be annually-the reasonable cost, of reasonably efficient wheat production, and the reasonable profit margin that should be added to that eost to arrive at a guaranteed minimum"" price which would enable the industry to be carried on effectively and progressively. It is not only unjust but also useless to guarantee a price that falls below the total figure so determined by impartial investigation. We shall clo nothing for the wheat industry if we fix a price and stick to it doggedly for five years, notwithstanding the fact that after, say; three or four years it has become apparent that the price is below the reasonable cost of production. That will not bring solvency to the industry; it will bring the scheme to ruin and precipitate once more further investigations and plans by this Parliament.",45
195,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT INDUSTRY,It may be above the cost.,46
196,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Naturally. There added:would be no point in having an annual re-examination of costs unless we were contemplating the possibility of a price that altered from year to year. Theoretically the price could alter upwards; but I venture to say that the Minister will still agree that that is a mere theory for the next five years at least. 8 Government supporters interjecting,",46
197,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"I am delighted know that some members of this Parliahave ment believe that during the next five years, the value of money in Australia will vise ancl the costof production in this industry will fall: The wheat farmer is entitled to an assurance-and this is the whole basis of our argument that the price guaranteed to him under a scheme like this shall be adequate to cover his true average cost of production, and to give to him a reasonable margin of profit. That result, cannot be achieved unless we have the means of revision, and the means which arc suggested and which I have been discussing for the last five minutes seem, to many of us at any rate, to be admirable and flexible means for arriving at a just result. We believe that by the introduction of machinery of that kind, and its effective use in a ten year plan of stabilization, the Australian wheat-grower will, for the first time, have a feeling of proper security, and that wheat itself, instead of being, as it has been for many years, the subject of almost constant political controversy, will take its place as a settled, solid and highly valnable feature of the Australian economy. . Debate (on' motion by Mr LEar,»ro.\) adjourned. - OVERSEAS NA BILL 1946. In committee: Consideration resumed (vide page 2404).

The ""purpose of these proposed new'subto clauses, ancl the amendments which I r forecast to clauses 4S and 52, is to allow the Minister to enter into an agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited on behalf of the Government providing for the acquisition by the Gommonwealth of the company's telecommunication assets - Negotiations are proceeding between the Government and the company in the matter, ancl it is expected that an agreement will be reached at a reasonably early date. Therefore the proposed amendments to clauses 23, 48 and 52 will enable the Minister to take the necessary steps to acquire the assets mentioned, and later, upon the establishment of the. Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) to vest such property in that body. In other words, we are not waiting for the commission to be established before we acquire the assets of the company. We are empowering the Minister to acquire those assets before the establishment of the commission. . Mr HARRISON (Wentworth) [8.24]. - Obviously , there must be a hiatus between the time when the Minister acquires the property of .the company, and when he vests it in the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Ausfor tralia).

210,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The Parliament approved the granting of authority to 'the Treasurer to appropriate a sum of £3,000,000 and to make advances from that appropriation from time to time for the purposes of carrying out the probe intervisions of this bill.",47
211,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Where do those words appear in the bill?,47
212,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I assure the right honourable gentleman that the power which is sought in this bill is a power to appropriate a sum of £3,000,000. That doei not mean that the commission will be given £3,000,000 with which to commence its operations. That sum of money will be authorized for expenditure by the Treasurer, if necessary, for the purpose of acquiring the assets of the company and carrying out the objects of the bill. If the right honourable gentleman's information be correct, .namely, that approximately £1,500,000 will be sufficient to acquire the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited, there may still remain an obligation on the Treasurer to provide certain other moneys for working expenses.",47

214,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"No , the appropriation is for a sum of £3,000,000 to enable the commission to commence operations. That expenditure is not likely to be in curred annually. It is an expenditure to enable certain capital assets to be acquired.",48

218,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I ask honourable gentlemen opposite not to be horrified because the proposal is to appropriate £3,000,000.

228,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"T be committee has just approved the insertion of a new clause which will permit the Minister, who is the Postmaster-General, to acquire these assets pending the constitution of the commission. Obviously, that means that the negotiations have reached the stage at which it is possible to saythat they will be concluded before the commission has been constituted. In the transitional period, the Postmaster General will exercise the powers of the commission. I have said that the Treasurer will be authorized by this provision to approve advances being made from this appropriation, and from such further appropriations as may be made by the Parliament from time to time on the recommendation of the responsible Minister. I take this opportunity to make some references to the observations of the Leader of the Australian Country party in regard to the amount that may be paid for the assets of the company. The right honourable gentleman has-said that a payment of £1,500,000 for those assets would represent about £6 a share to the private shareholders.",48
229,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"No . Bo not misunderstand me. What I said was that, having regard to the asset value of the shares, which today are quoted at 71s. 6d. for the full company, on a comparable basis the Government is offering £6 a share.",49
230,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Since the re-opening of the Sydney Stock Exchange in .1942, the value of the shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has followed the general trend of the stock exchange, they having appreciated by about 60 per cent. There is nothing remarkable in' that. The value of the shares of quite a lot of other concerns also has appreciated. The fmancial columns of any newspaper published in any part of Australia will show that every company is doing very well, today. That may be a very nice compliment to the Government of Australia, which is responsible for the good conditions that make such a state of affairs possible.",49
231,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"No ; it shows that there is an inflationary trend,",49
232,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"^-When the right honourable gentleman draws attention to the appreciation of the value of company shares he must also, as a natural corollary, pay tribute to the efiiciency and good administration of those who occupy the front ministerial bench in this Parliament today.",49
233,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Not at all. It is inflation, because the £1 is now worth les3 than it has been worth.",49
234,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"If there is one country in the world which has avoided inflation and inflationary trends, it is Australia.",49
235,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,The Minister should not deceive himself in that regard.,49
236,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"No other country has managed it3 economy so well as has this country, despite the fact that it is passing through the transitional stage from war to peace and has had to contend with all the difficulties incidental to that fact.",49
237,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"If the Minister believes that, he is pathetic.",49
238,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"What is important is that the people of Australia believe it. The right honourable gentleman appears to think that the increased value which, now attaches to the shares of Amalgamated Wireless '(Australasia) Limited signifies that, for a long time past, there has been "" something in the wind ""-to use the vernacular-in the matter of this transfer, and that people who deal in slock exchange transactions have considered that more than a. reasonable figure was likely to be offered-to the holders of shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The accretion to the value of the shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited compares thus with the accretion tO the value of the shares of other large industrial concerns - Australia n Consolidated Industries, 56 per cent.; Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, 65 per cent.; and Tooth's Breweries, 81 per cent. Those figuresprove that the right honourable gentleman's comments were not justified. There has been no unusual trading in the shares of this company. None knows that better than the right honourable member for North .Sydney (Mr Hughes), who is a director of the company.",49
239,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,It shows that there is activity on the part of buyers.,49

242,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The £1 is worth £1 in any part of Australia today. I do not understand the right honourable gentleman's reference to ""so-called money"". All the paper money of this country is backed by the security of the nation, and i i worth its face value.",50
243,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,The £1 is worth about 14s.,50
244,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The return of £2 l is . per cent, which the right honourable gentleman cited is in line with these returns, which were published in a Melbourne newspaper last Wednesday: Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, 2.2 per cent.; Colonial Sugar Befining Company Limited, 2.7 per cent.; and Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited, 2.7 per cent. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has paid dividends of up to 14 per. cent. No doubt the value of the company's shares would appreciate considerably if its telecommunications were not acquired, by the Government, as these offer a widely expanding field in the future. Rather would its shares be likely to ciate by reason .of the Government's compulsory acquisition of the telecommunications section of its business.",50
245,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Of course they should, appreciate when the Government is ing £3 a share.",50
246,The CHAIRMAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,I ask the Minisventure. ter to deal with the clause.,50
247,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The right honourable gentleman cannot have it both ways. shares do not appreciate one minute and depreciate the next. He contends first that they are depreciating, because the .Government is to do what it proposes do, and his other argument, which is valid one, is that the value of the shares is likely to appreciate as a result of what the Government proposes to do. That is the Government's case on this clause, and it is safe for the committee to authorize the Treasurer to make advances to the commission up to £3,000,000.",50
248,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Barker) Limited, [8.41] - It is most unusual for any . "" [87] Minister, except in time of war, to ask the Parliament for money for an undisclosed purpose. In accordance with the custom ' of the Parliament of Great Britain, it is laid down that a Minister, on the recommendation of the Governor General, shall ask the Parliament to approve the appropriation of certain moneys, and the Governor General's message recommending the appropriation must state the purpose for which the money is required. Neither in the clause which Ave are debating nor in any statement by the Minister has that been disclosed. It is competent for the committee to accept an assurance by the Minister, but no statement by him can bind the Government. The Crown is bound only by what is contained in the legislation, itself. The clause contains two different statements. From that read by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden), it is clear that, if we agree to the clause in its present form, the Commonwealth will be entitled to hand over to an unknown commission-w e do not know the name of even one person who will be a member, of it-the sum of £3,000^000. In addition, the conimission depre- may be paid such other sums as from time to time arc appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose. There is no limit whatever to these other sums. If a purchase of assets is made on behalf of the Government, a certain., sum of paymoney must be paid and must come back , - to the Government as its share of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is not a private concern, and, according to what we have The beard in the last 24 hours, the whole transaction depends on what the private shareholders are prepared to accept. If the Minister's last statement be correct, to we are forced to the conclusion that a a part is greater than the whole. In other words, the minority shareholders are to have certain rights under the bill, but the Government has no rights whatsoever. The total capital of the' company is under £1,000,000. A double acquisition is to be made, partly the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and partly tbose of Cable and Wireless but at no stage of the proceedings, either in the House or in committee, has any Minister ventured to forecast, even in the most shadowy terms, what the cost will be to the Government of these two ventures. The representatives of the taxpayers are entitled to know the mind of the Goevrnment on this matter. The assets of Cable and Wireless Limited must have a known value to the Government, and that might be some guide. Similarly the value of the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited must be known. Only a portion of them are required solely for government purposes, but in respect of capital, more than half of that company is owned by the Commonwealth already. For a portion of the company's assets the Government is asking the Parliament to provide £3,000,000, an unknown fraction of which would be devoted to the purchase of certain of the company's assets and the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited. This clause must be read in conjunction with clause 32, which provides that moneys and investments may be lodged with the Commonwealth ' Bank or such other bank as the Minister _ approves. .1 know of no government instrumentality which has the right tp do other than comply with the provisions of the Constitution, which require all public moneys to be paid into Consolidated Revenue. For that reason the Postmaster-General must pay all moneys received by his department into the Treasury, and he can only function, as far as expenditure goes, - on the money voted to him by the Parliament from year to year. The Minister has declared that the Government intends to have Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited carried on as a manufacturing concern, and that the Government will retain an interest in the undertaking; . Mr Calwell - In the manufacturing part only.",50
249,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"If that be correct, we still require from the Minister an explanation as to what.the Government proposes to do regarding patents, franchises and commercial wireless assets of the company. Will .the Government take a part in conducting those activities, or does it intend to farm them out? The Minister says it is necessary that government capital sbould be retained to carry the company over a critical period. Only last year, banking legislation was enacted under which the Commonwealth Bank could lend as much money as it wished to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. From the taxpayers' point of view, the Government's connection with an undertaking which is a delicious hybrid of no particular value is an entirely different proposition from the Commonwealth Bank financing the company in the customary way and taking the usual risks.",51
250,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The latter part of the clause contains a complete answer to the honourable member, as it provides that the Treasurer may advance to the commission such amounts as are, in the opinion of the Minister required by the commission, and the commission may accept those advances,' but shall not. otherwise borrow moneys. The advance will come from Consolidated Revenue.",51
251,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"This Parliament has no power to instruct the Commonwealth Bank what it shall do. We are still entitled to some explanation from the Government as to what is behind this measure. So far we are still in a fog as thick as any experienced in Canberra during the present parliamentary'sittings Nothing that the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has said has thrown one ray of light on the subject of the real charges to which the community will be committed, if this bill is .passed in its present form.",51
252,Mr CONELAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Griffith) [8.50] Once again, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) has put up his own ""Aunt Sally's"". He said that never before has a government appropriated a specific sum of money for a purpose such as that contemplated in this bill. I remind him it bas been done twice in the life of this Parliament-once , when £4,000,000 was appropriated for the purpose of inaugurating the Mortgage Department of the Commonwealth Bank, and again when £3,000,000 was appropriated to establish, the Australian National Airlines Commission. Now, the Government is asking Parliament to appropriate £3,000,000 in order to nationalize telecommunications. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) and the honourable member for Barker have taken certain parts of the bill out of their context. The clause providing for the appropriation of money should be read in conjunction with clauses 29 and 32. Clause 29.is as follows :For the purposes of enabling the Commission to meet such expenditure as is necessary for the purposes of this Act, the Treasurer may advance to the Commission(a) out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or out of the proceeds of any loan raised under the authority of any Act, which Fund and which' proceeds are hereby appropriated accordingly, such amounts, not exceeding in all the sum of Three million pounds; and (6) out of sucn sums as are from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for the' purpose, such further amounts, as are, in the opinion of the Minister, required by the Commission, and the Commission may accept those advances but shall not otherwise borrow moneys. Honourable members will agree that a person buying a business would not pay down the full amount of the purchase money if that meant leaving himself short of money with which to establish himself. The Government is now asking the Parliament to appropriate £3,000,000, which will be probably more than half of the amount which will eventually have to be paid by way of compensation to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for the loss of its telecommunication business. That is the side of the company's business which showed such substantial profit during the war. Once that asset is removed the company will be in an entirely different position. The money left after the Government has paid compensation will be put into a fund which will be audited annually by the Auditor-General, who will report to the Government and to the Parliament as to how the'money is disposed of. It seems to me that the honourable member for Barker, in criticizing the provisions of the bill, is merely tryin g to make political capital out of it .",51
253,Mr SPENDER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Warringah) [8.55] Clause 29 should be read in conjunction with clauses 31 and 39. Clause 31, which contemplates conditions as they will exist after the commission has been established, is as follows: The conimission shall prepare estimates, in such form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial year, and shall submit those estimates to the Minister. Parliament is being asked to appropriate £3,000,000 for the purposes of this legislation. I agree that the-purposes have been made clear, but what has not been made clear is how this amount of £3,000,000 is made up. For too long the Parliament has been asked to appropriate amounts running into hundreds of millions of pounds, - and never have I heard one honourable member on the Government side demand particulars of the amounts sought. In these days of very large expenditure we should demand the closest scrutiny of all proposed appropriations. To-day we are presented with the extraordinary spectacle of the Government asking Parliament to appropriate £3,000,000 without any explanation being offered of how the amount is arrived at. I do not expect a detailed statement showing everything to the last half-penny; estimates must, of necessity, be in general terms, but surely we are entitled to more information than has been offered. The present situation cannot be considered apart from the situation which will exist once the commission has been established. Will the Government then come to the Parliament and say, "" For the purposes of the Overseas - Telecommunications Commission we require an amount of ' X ' millions of pounds"", and tell the Parliament nothing more? That is precisely what it is doing to-night. The Parliament is entitled to more information than has been given to it , and the public, too, are entitled to know how the amount of £3,000,000 is made up. This is a committee of supply, whose function it is to scrutinize all government expenditure. I do not suggest that the amount asked for is not needed, but the committee is entitled to further particulars. Either the Government just plucked' a figure out of the air, or it represents an estimate. If it is not more than a guess, the Government should say so. If it represents an estimate, there should be certain particulars available,' and these should be made known to the committee.",52
254,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Watson) [ 9 . 0 ] - I had expected the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) to relate his remarks to clause 39. In his discussion of the clause before the committee he said that it had relevancy to clauses 31 and 39. He then proceeded to relate his remarks tc clause 31, but not to clause 39. It seems clear that the object of the - Opposition is to make public the business activities of the commission which is to control overseas telecommunications. Honourable members opposite desire to force the Government to reveal the business activities of the. commission to its trading competitors such as Standard Telephones and Cables Proprietary Limited. we have been informed that the tangible assets to be taken over exceed £1,000,000 in value, a total of £3,000,000 seems reasonable.",52
255,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The tangible assets are valued at only' about £500,000.",53
256,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"If I were to cite figures in the way that the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) does, I should be stating figures which are not in accordance with the facts. The right honourable gentleman has persisted in saying that the value of these shares is about 30s. l i d . each. He relates that amount to the tangible assets of the company. In reply, the Minister for I m m i gration (Mr Calwell) pointrd out that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited have other intangible assets, such as long term agreements for certain rights which have.a money value. If the right honourable gentleman persists in making statements which are not in accordance with the facts, I must take him to task.",53
257,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,The honourable member is a member of tick-tock- a very watchful member.,53
258,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I am tired of these attempts at jokes. It is clear that when members of the Opposition cannot answer the arguments advanced by their opponents they resort to the Aristotelian fallacy of ad hominem. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) said that there was no embargo on the commission borrowing ad infinitu m to the l i m it of the financial resources of the Commonwealth Bank, but a reading of clause 29 would have revealed to him the weakness of his argument. clause readsFor the purpose of enabling the Commission to meet sueh expenditure as is necessary for the purpose of this Act, the Treasurer may advance to the Commission(6) out of such sums as are from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose, such further amounts as are, in the opinion of the Minister, required by the Comniission. . . . That is clear, but apparently the honourable member for Barker has difficulty in understanding English. The Leader of the Australian Country party said that the sum of £3,000,000 was a faked figure. As - Mr FADDEN - I did not say that.",53
259,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"On the other hand, the honourable member for Warringah was satisfied that the Government had estimates before it when it decided that £3,000,000 was a proper amount to include in the bill.",53
260,Mr SPENDER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,I said that the Government either plucked a figure out of the air. or had estimates before it .,53
261,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The honourable member for Warringah has held office as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and he knows that before any Minister places before the Parliament a figure such as has been done in this clause, estimates have been carefully scrutinized. In my opinion, the sum of £3,000,000 is adequate, having regard to the limitations imposed by clause 29, namely, that the moneys to be expended shall be raised under the authority of any act and shall not exceed in all the sum of £3,000,000. I hope that the Leader of the Australian Country party does not suggest that the whole.of that amount must be expended during this financial year. The meaning of the clause is that sums up to £3,000,000 will be expended by the commission as it deems necessary for the proper conduct of its affairs. I consider that any attempt by the Opposition to - obtain detailed items making up this amount is an attempt to aid business competitors to obtain information for use by them in their own interests ",53
262,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Darling Downs Leader of the Australian Country p a r t y ) [9.5] - Havin g regard to the fact that the party with which the honourable memThat ber for Watson (Mr Falstein) is associated has as its object the socialization of the means of production, distribution nnd exchange, he has made an extraordinary speech. The honourable member said that the purpose of the Opposition is to obtain information for the benefit of competitors of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I remind him that the people of Australia, through this Parliament, are half-owners in the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and are therefore entitled to know what is going on and how their money is being.used. The honourable member said that I had stated this afternoon that shareholders' funds, namely paid up capital plus reserves, amounted to 30s. l i d . for each f He went on to say that the intangible assets of that company should be taken into account. I remind him of the basic fact that the intangible assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited were given to the company for nothing, and .have been enjoyed by it for over 20 years. Despite that fact, on a comparable basis, shareholders will receive £6 for each share. If that is not a margin for the intangible value of assets I clo not know what is.",53
263,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Does-the right, honourable gentleman deny that these intangible assets have been earning profit for the private shareholders during that period ?",54
264,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Of course they have. They have been profit-bearing for the Government, also. Whatever dividends the Commonwealth Government has received as a half-owner of the company must be set off against the subsidies that the company has enjoyed from the Commonwealth Government. Having regard to the earning capacity of the company for twenty years, the Australian people as half-owners of the company, have received inadequate returns. I want it - to be thoroughly understood that a definite drive for shares in this company has occurred only since negotiations were opened in June. This means that on a comparable basis the Government is paying £6 for every £1 share' in the company. The facts are undeniable and indisputable ",54
265,Mr FALSTEIN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,The ' valuation 71s. 6d. a share applies only to private speculators.,54
266,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"That does not matter. The fact remains that that is their lished value. Yet, on a comparable basis, the Government is prepared to give the equivalent of £6 for them. I draw the attention of honourable members opposite to clause 29 of the bill, under which the Treasurer may advance to the commission no less than £3,000,000. This Parliament and the people are entitled to know exactly upon what that £3,000,000 is to be expended. I have already stated that £1,500,0.00 is to be utilized for the. acquisition of the telecommunications portion, of the busil share. ness of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, ancl only for a half, share of that, because the Government owns half the share holding. I h other words the Government is prepared to give to the private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited no less than £1,500,000 for a half share of one department of its activities.",54
267,Mr CONELAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,The right honourable gentleman does not know whether his figures are correct.,54
268,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I have cited them and they have neither - been confirmed nor denied. If there be any doubt about the matter I ask. how much of the £3,000,000 the Parliament is asked to appropriate will constitute compensation for the acquisition of this one department of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. This large amount of money must be provided either from Consolidated Revenue or from loan funds, ancl as the custodians of the public purse we have a right to demand that we be taken into the confidence of the Government in regard to the items' on which this money is to be expended. It is strange that the Government has a habit of adopting the figure of £3,000,000 in connection with its socialization proposals. That amount was appropriated for the establishment of the Mortgage Department of the ""Commonwealth Bank, the Aluminium Commission, and the National Airlines Commission, and now we are again asked to appropriate a similar amount, for the purposes of this bill. of Complete details of how the money is to be expended should be supplied.",54
269,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for In estabformation) [9.12] - When discussing the acquisition of ' certain assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited lionorable members opposite should endeavour to keep somewhere near the beam. Diverging widely from the beam they have been arguing about the provisions of clause 29 as if the £3,000,000, which is to be the maximum amount which may be advanced to the commission, were proposed to be expended tomorrow. There is no proposal in this bill to do that. It is necessary that some maximum figure be stated in the bill. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) says that the Government should state everything precisely r",54
270,Mr SPENDEB,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,I did not say precisely.,55
271,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The honourable member claimed that the Government should state approximately the estimated expenditure on eaoh item. That, of course, would mean that the commission would have to be. established and negotiations completed before the bill could be presented to the Parliament. It is obvious that the Government could not pursue the course suggested by - the honourable member. We ask for authority to appropriate £3,000,000 in order that compensa-' tion may be paid to the private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, that the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited may be purchased to provide for developmental expenditure which, might be necessary from time to time, and, finally, in order to provide working capital for the commission once it com&3 into operation. If the clause were as bad as honourable members opposite suggest I should imagine that when a similar provision in the other legislation instanced by the Leader of the Australian. Country party (Mr Fadden) was under discussion in this Parliament similar objections would have been raised.",55
272,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,They were.,55
273,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Unfortunatel y for honourable members opposite they were not. This is a case where certain people are rushing in where angels would fear to tread. Hansard contains the record of what honourable members said when similar provisions in the other legislation cited by the Leader of the Australian Country party were Under discussion. As a matter of fact) section 30 of the Australian National Airlines Act is identical in every respect, right down to the last full-stop, with clause 29 of this bill; and when that section was under discussion in a committee of this House last year the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), by some extraordinary feat of self-control, said nothing at all, and the honourable member for Warringah was either not present or he was not as garrulous on that occasion as on this. Neither honourable gentlemen took part in its discussion. The Leader of the Australian Country party, however, had something to say. His speech is recorded in Hansard of the 1st August, 1945, at page 4856. Whilst the right honourable gentleman offered no objection to the provision of £3,000,000 for the purpose of commencing the activities of the Australian National Airlines Commission he did offer some observations in line with what he said a few moments ago in answer to my very distinguished, learned and gallant friend, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein). In his opening remarks the right honourable gentleman said I.oppose the motion and object to the appropriation of Coni.moiiwcalth moneys for the purposes of this bill. I do so for many and varied reasons, but for the fundamental reason that the payment of these moneys would contribute toward the socialization of industry in this country. I recognize that considerable sums will be required by the Government if it intends to implement its policy of socialization and give effect to the pledge which has been signed by every member of the Ministry and its supporters; but members of. the Opposition are totally opposed to the policy of socialization of industry and favour private enterprise and individual effort. He continued to argue in favour of private enterprise but did not revert to the purpose for which the money was to. be appropriated. He opposed the appropriation of the money merely because he opposed the principle of the bill. Nor did he seek to prevent the Australian National Airlines Commission from operating as 1 he is apparently seeking to prevent the Overseas Telecommunications Commission from operating. If this Government were to itemize the estimated expenditure it would be likely to incur in accrairing the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited it would thereby indicate to the directors of the company and to its .private shareholders just how much it is prepared to offer for the shares. When commencing negotiations one does not set down the maximum value one is prepared to pay, but rather one allows negotiations to proceed as a necessary preliminary to the fixation of a price. If the Government were to set down a figure of £2,000,000 or £2,500,000 as the amount it was prepared to pay for the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited it may be found that that amount would be greatly in excess of what it would actually pay after negotiations had been completed. It is better to negotiate an agreement and reach finality before setting down a figure which might be made the subject of legal tussles in the courts of the land right up to the Privy Council. Under such an arrangement it might take two or three years to reach finality. I ask the Parliament to trust the Government, which will see that justice is done to all parties concerned in the agreement.",55
274,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Barker) [9.20] - No analogy whatever exists between the circumstances of this proposal and those referred to by the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) with respect to the acquisition of Australian interstate air-lines. In the latter case, the Opposition was opposed to the Government's proposal from start to finish, including the appropriation provision. The Opposition has not registered a - hostile vote on this measure. The general tenor of the remarks of all speakers on this side of the chamber was that these communications should be in the. hands of the Postal Department. fact, many of us said that they should never have been taken out of the ownership of the Government -.On this occasion, when we are asked to vote £3,000,000, we are entitled to be given detailed statement of how the Govern the ment proposes to expend that money. In the case of the acquisition of the intercountry, state air-lines we said that we did care what the Government proposed; were opposed to that measure from start to finish, including 'the appropriation cla.use.",56
275,Mr CONELAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The sum of £4,000,000 was appropriated for the establishment a Mortgage Department of the Commonwealth Bank.",56
276,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"On that occasion we supported the Government's proposal, and it is unthinkable that we should object to an appropriation of which we were in favour. Having voted the sum of £4,000,000 for the purpose mentioned, we knew perfectly well how the money was to be expended. In this case we do not know how the money is to be expended. Mention bas been made of the Aluminium Industry Bill. The Opposition fought that measure clause by clause, and for very good reasons.. This matter depends upon the circumstances in which the bill is presented to the Parliament, and the Government's failure to disclose the purposes for which it requires the money proposed to be appropriated. We have a rough, foggy outline of what is proposed, but the Government has nottold us exactly what it proposes to do. It is one thing for the Opposition to oppose the appropriation of a sum of £3,000,000 for the acquisition of interstate air-lines when ""we were opposed to that proposal. It is quite another thing to support the appropriation of £3,000,000 for the acquisition of telecommunication services, which we believe should be in the hands of the Government; but we should be entitled to. an explanation of the details of this expenditure. Instead of giving.us that explanation, the Minister simply asks us to trust the Government - -.Quite frankly, w.e do not trust the Government.. .",56
277,Mr WARD,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Honourable members oppoI n site do not trust 'each other.,56
278,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I recall ' / occasions upon which the Minister - for Transport (Mr Ward) was so vocal in a his criticism of his colleagues that I wonder Hansard does not smoulder with, beat of his words. It is clear to the Parliament, and it should be clear to the that the Government is - not not prepared to disclose the purposes for we which it seeks this money. Therefore, the Opposition is not prepared .to agree to the proposed appropriation. The. Minister may argue that it is necessary to appropriate the sum proposed in order to of enable the Government to make a start. - Clause 57 provides that if the comraisdiscuss -'sion acquires the assets of the companies - concerned it shall not be obliged to make payment for three months, and sbould ,it fail to make payment within that period it may in its discretion interest on the amount owing. That an interesting point. Another interesting point is that it is unusual, if not unique, to hear an honourable member with the socialistic tendencies of the Minister f Immigration defending the rights and privileges of a very successful semiin private enterprise, and expressing fond hopes for its future. I am sure that that news reached the Y a r r a Bank the reception given to my friend's remark would be rather summary. Clause agreed to. Clause 30 agreed to. Clause 3 1 TheCommission shall prepare estiniates, in .What I suchform as the Minister directs, of its I receipts and expenditure for each financial year and shall submit those estimates to the support Minister.",56
279,Mr SPENDER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Warringah) [9.26]. - In my observations with respect to the - consequences of clause 29. I referred to clauses 31 and 39, and suggested that the relationship of those clauses sbould be recognized. Clause 31 readsThe Conimission shall prepare estimates, - such form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial away from the Parliament. year, and shall submit those estimates to the Minister. Clause 39, which I - suggest should . read and discussed in conjunction w this clause, reads(1.) The Comniission shall, as soon as possible after the close of each financial year that relates .to the close of a nnanciai year whereas clause 31 relates to the beginning of a financial yearsubmit to the Minister an annual report with respect to the operations of the mission and financial accounts, in respect that year, in such form as the Treasurer n pproves. (2.) The annual report and financial accouuts, accompanied by a certificate of Auditor-General, shall be laid before Houses of the Parliament within fifteen sitting days after tlieir receipt by the Minister. On more than one occasion honourable members have shown how futil e it is to the financial operations of the Government after such operations have come to an end, and how f u t i l e it is to attempt to persuade this Government to pay any heed at all to remarks of the pay Auditor-General with respect to its is financial operations. I emphasize that clause 31 makes no reference at all to the necessity for placing these estimates before the Parliament. My objection, which o r is fortified b.y the discussion which took place on clause 29, is that the estimates respect of an organization of this kind should be placed before the Parliament if at the commencement of the financial year. It is quite idle for the Parliament to claim any charge-over finance, if , indeed, the estimates are to be given to the Minister who simply does not present, them to the chamber but merely says that he requires a certain sum of money in respect of the proposed commission. wish to emphasize, and have sought in vain to attract for my contention from honourable members opposite, is the right of the Parliament, particularly since the war has come to an end, to know in detail the estimates of every department and every authority which functions under an iict of Parliament while .such estimates are being discussed. As I have remarked on more than one occasion, thetruth is in that control of finance has been taken Indeed, finance is no longer in the control of the Executive, because when a Minister is be asked to give information as to how a itb large proposed vote is made up we are vouchsafed no details at all. It is important to direct attention to this clause and to the need for an amendment to be made to provide that the estimates referred to therein shall be brought before the Parliament with all the other estimates of governmental expenditure each year and tabled so that we shall bave Comthe data upon which intelligent disof cussion and criticism may take place. I cannot imagine that any Parliament could"" function efficiently without that the data, but for more than five years no both one' outside the Ministry has been able to say that he has received it . I know that during the war, for the sake of security, expenditure on defence needed to be lumped into one sum without disclosure of details. but that time has passed, and the Parmatter liament must re-establish its authority over finance. If we do not we cannot claim to be a democratic parliament. is .significant, in connection with clause to direct attention to what place with respect to clause 29. The able member for Watson (Mr Falstein) said that the Government could not give .the information because to dp so would of public moneys. be to reveal details to - trading competitors of the commission. That has nothing to do with this matter, because slight, analysis shows that the commission to be a legislatively created monopoly, and consequently it, will have no business competitors. But the Minister will have nothing of that idea. He says that that is not the reason. He says, "" If we vealed the figure at. this stage of the negotiations we should be telling investing public how much is to be paid or how much we are thinking of paying to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited"". A little analysis .of that, shows that it does not hold water. Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) has revealed that there no sellers, only buyers, of shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited on the stock exchange. It is. extraordinary that we should liave one statement from a back-bencher opposite and a contradictory statement from the Minister. I appeal to honourable members to assert their rights. Priusually vate members to the right or the left of the Chair ought to have full details of every appropriation. Is it intended that the estimates to be prepared under this clause shall be the secret of the Government? Is it intended by the Government simply to seek the priation of so many million pounds? is it intended, when the annual estimates of all departments are being considered, an answer. if "" considered "" is the right word, that the estimates prepared under this clause shall be laid on the table? To have those estimates in their possession is the right of honourable members. Are we mere pieces of machinery with some of us one side of the chamber and the larger number on the othor side? Is this in reality a committee of ways and means? . It is not when we are told only that Government requires £3,000,000. N.o how much we ask for details they are kept from us. They will never be given to us unless we impress our will It on theExecutive. Every honourable this member has a duty to his electors to took preserve his custodianship of public honorfunds. We shall never have a reduction of taxes unless we assert our authority over those charged with the expenditure",57
280,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Melbourne-Minister - for Immigration and Minister for In-formation) [9.33] - The honourable memis ber for Warringah (Mr Spender) has worked himself into a fine frenzy fto defence of the right of the Parliament toexamine the estimates of public departments.

He proclaimed that it was the right of every honourable member to v also demand full information on the finances The of the conimission. I do not deny that it is the right of every honourable member are to get any information, he desires about the financial activities of any government department; but there is the duty imposed upon honourable gentlemen to be in their places when these matters are submitted tq the Parliament and to take an intelligent part in discussions on all reports . submitted to the Parliament. There is a great desire on the part of many, honourable members opposite to rush away from the Parliament, or to attend very rarely. They negative their rights to discuss matters.

286,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"To get down to realities again, this clause, about which the honourable member works himself into such simulated indignation, is identical vvith the corresponding clause in the Australian National Airlines Act. All these things are just the normal procedure of government. What we have put into this bill has been put into every other similar bill. It is not until today that honourable gentlemen opposite have dis- ' covered that an attack is being made on the fundamental rights of honourable members of this Parliament. It is nonsense.' They are only wasting the time of the committee with their simulated indignation. All that the clause provides is- ' .The Conimission shall prepare estimates, in such form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial year and shall submit those .estimates to the Minister. Is there anything wrong with that? If - the provision were not there, there would be strong opposition from honourable 1 gentlemen opposite.

They would say that the Minister was guilty of 30me'nefarious intent if he did not include a clause like this in the bill. This clause is in every similar bill, and it is a necessary clause. There are other clauses.

287,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Prin t the report of the Auditor-General and - see! Mi'. CALWELL - Authorit y has been given by this chamber for the printing of the Auditor-General's report. The honourable member for Warringah should not attempt to put words into my mouth bj saying that I would have none of the ideas of t.he honourable member for Watson' (Mr Falstein). There was nothing antagonistic to my remarks in what was said by the honourable member for Watson. He was dealing with the trading activities of the company, and I was dealing, with the national interest in what will become a government concern when the telecommunications section of the company's activities become a government responsibility. There is no clash of opinion between myself and the honourable member for Watson on this matter. All the right-thinking members of this Parliament, of course, sit on your right, Mr. Chairman, and they know what legislation is being passed, and whom it is intended to 'benefit. We are convinced that the public interest is being well served by the.general purposes underlying this measure. The clauses to which objection is being taken are purely machinery provisions. Apparently, the Leader of the Australian Country party did not hear, or did not take note of, what I said to the conimittee this afternoon iii answer to the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), namely that this Government"" did not pay any subsidies, to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited.

At least, that' is true of, the Australian National Airlines Act,- the Aluminium Industry Act, and , now this measure. ' This clause relates to the preout paration pf estimates, and the Minister far has .refused to give us any estimates of the money that will be expended. I should have thought that, a government . which has the* socialization of industry as objective would have been anxious to disclose these things. Honourable members opposite claim to haye no interest in the profit motive, yet they are afraid to say how this money will be expended. The Auditor General has referred to the manner in which accounts are kept by departments under the control of this Government, and I do not think that the Minister should be permitted to get away with this without giving the committee more details. I support honourable members on this side of the chamber who have raised this matter. I believe that in doing so they have rendered a service to the taxpayers who will have to provide the money. Finance cannot be obtained from thin air; it must be derived either by taxation, loans, or bank credit. Already too much bank - credit has been used with resulting inflationary tendencies. Of course, the - Government has a majority somewhere -'in this building-it is not in the cham' her at present-and can force this proposal through regardless of the interests ^pf the general public and the Opposition. "" Mr SPENDER (Warringah) [9.50] I propose to move an amendment and I shall not be deterred from referring to it by the comments of the Minister (Mr.. Calwell). Whenever he is in difficulty, he tries to make some slighting reference to members of the Opposition. If I may be forgiven for saying so, since you, Mr. Chairman, permitted the Minister to make some remarks upon this matter, I "" point out that I am present in this chamber much more frequently than he is, and I conduct myself much better than he does. Having said that, I shall direct my remarks to the clause. To this clause, I have no objection, what I have sought to convey, and apparently it has not penetrated the magnificent intelligence of the Minister, is that it does not go far enough, because it does not protect the people. I know that it is the habit of the Government to think less and less of the people, and more and more of its power; but, strange to say, although members of the Opposition are accused of being the minions of "" B i g Business "", I believe that more money is represented by honourable member's opposite, in the form of hotels and other interests, than we represent. We assert the right of the people to know what the Government's financial proposals are. Therefore, I propose to test honourable members opposite by compelling them to show precisely where they stand in respect of these vital matters. I move--That the following words be added to the clause:- "" which estimates shall be laid before both - Houses of the Parliament as soon as is reasonably possible after their receipt."" There can be no objection to that amendment. In his "" meanderings of Monty""' - if I may so describe them-the Minister walked round and round and round and round, but be never reached the central point, namely, the need for the Government to inform honourable members of the estimated cost of acquiring the telecommunication assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. It is upon that, subject that I ask the honourable gentleman to bite, if he will, assuming that his teeth will penetrate it. The Minister directed attention to clause 39, which provides that the commission shall, as soon as possible after the close of each financial year, submit to the Minister an annual report relating to its operations and financial accounts. The only relevance of that clause to the present discussion is that it supports my amendment, and does not support the contentions of the honourable gentleman. It draws attention to. the obligation of the commission, when the money has been expended and any extravagant expenditure cannot be recalled, to submit to the Minister a report of its operations and its financial accounts. Those documents, accompanied by a certificate of the Auditor-General, shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within fifteen sitting days after their' receipt by the but Minister. All I ask is that a similar procedure be followed before the money has been expended. The Government will not be justified in refusing my request. After all, the Government may expend money only with the authorityof this Parliament. It has no right to say, "" We shall expend so much money upon this project. We have a big majority, and shall roll the Budget through the House of Representatives and the Senate"". The correct approach is to present to this Parliament early in the financial year estimates of revenue and.. expenditure, with all the detail available, so that honourable members may discuss intelligently the Government's financial proposals. The Minister has failed utterly to reply to the criticism voiced by honourable members on this side of the chamber. He sought to turn the argument by resorting to personalities, in which he often engages. We are discussing an important matter. It is not to the point for the honourable gentleman to say, ""When similar proposals were under consideration in the past, the Opposition did not raise these objections."" Even assuming that all honourable members failed in their diligence in the past, that is no reason why .the point now having been raised, should not be dealt with. The clause, if amended in the way I suggest, will readThe Conimission shall prepare estimates, such form as the Minister directs, of its ceipts and expenditure for each financial and shall submit those estimates to the Minister, which estimates shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament as soon as reasonably possible after their receipt.",60

This belated display of diligence to his parliamentary duties by honourable member for Warringah (Mr Fremantle Spender) does not impress any one.

But whatever his purpose in raising these objections may be.

304,Mr SPENDER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,No honourable member is entitled to misrepresent another honourable member. I know the object of the honourable member for Fremantle in it. I seeking to misrepresent me.,62
305,The CHAIRMAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,That is . not a point of order. The honourable member for Warringah has the right to reply in the course of the discussion to the statements of the honourable member for Fremantle.,63
306,Mr BEAZLEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The technique of the law courts serves the honourable member for Warringah in good stead. He stated that he was moving his amendraent. He then read the' whole of the clause. The safeguards provided in this bill are more than adequate. example, the clause providesThe Commission shall prepare estimates, in such form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial year and shall submit those estimates to the Minister. A - further safeguard is contained in clause 32, which readsMoneys held by the Conimission which are uninvested may"" be lodged either in an account at call or on fixed deposit, or partly in an account at call arid partly ou fixed deposit, with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia or with such other bank as the Minister approves, and while so lodged shallbe held to be moneys of the Crown. Clauses 33 and 34 provide similar adequate safeguards. The whole substance of the objection of the honourable member, for Warringah is that there is something furtive about an upper l i m it ' of £3,000,000 being placed upon what may be appropriated for the purposes of this bill . The bill merely provides that sums not exceeding £3,000,000 may be advanced to the commission, and safeguards are provided in order to ensure that the amounts advanced shall be applied to'the purposes of the bill. That the Auditor-General will have the right to examine the accounts of the commission, is made perfectly clear. The honourable member for Warringah' has attempted to convince listeners to the debate who have not the bill before them that something objectionable is being done with money contributed to consolidated revenue by the taxpayers. The honourable member, who awarded to himself the title of a cleaner debater than the Minister, in the same way as be assumed the title of lieutenant-colonel, would be well advised to keep such references out of debates of this kind.",63
307,Mr HARRISON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Wentworth) [10.2]. - I have not so far ""entered the l is in this debate. I do so .at this juncture because I consider that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) has not grasped the true significance of the argument of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender). Tbat is quite understandable, because the honourable member for Fremantle is new to . this. chamber. Because of his political ignorance and inexperience, he wouldi not understand fullywhy it is necessary for this chamber to retain control of the For public purse, when it is considering the estimates of revenue and expenditure. It is true that be was elected to this. Parliament during a period of war, when it was necessary for war expenditure to be appropriated in a lump sum. The honourable member for Warringah has pointed out that we are now back to the days of peace, and on that account must observe the procedure that was followed in this Parliament before the outbreak of hostilities. This chamber should once again assert its. right to,control the public.purse. That argument is germane to the clause, which makes it clear that the commission shall prepare estimates, in such a. form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial year, and shall submit those estimates to the Minister. That is as far as the clause goes. But, as the honourable member for. Warringah pointed out, the committee wants to have details of those estimates. If these are not provided, the expenditure is likely to be' shrouded in complete mystery, arid this Parliament w p l not have such information of the trading transactions of the commission ' as will satisfy it that the money is being expended * wisely' and efficiently. Surely there is nothing in that argument which warrants the generation of heat in the debate! Honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber wish to ensure that it will once again have control of the public purse. At the moment, that control reposes in the hands of the Minister. Whilst we hold the honourable gentleman in high regard, we know what use he made of funds provided for post-war education during the last referendum campaign. We wish - to ensure that when estimates of receipts and 'expenditure are submitted, they will be t s "" such as will warrant the approval of this Parliament. That is all the honorParliament able member for Warringah seeks. The honourable member for Fremantle does understand the subtleties of the situation, and we excuse him on that account; but there can be no excuse for the Minister, who knows that this is a time when control ""of the public purse should repose in the hands of the members of this committee. I ask the honourable gentledue man to give consideration to the reprethe sentations of the honorablo member for Warringah.",63
308,Mr BARNARD,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Russ) [10.6] the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison), I have hesitated to intrude in this debate; and I should have done so now, had it not been for his most extraordinary statements. His story about what happens in peace-time, and his attempt to castigate the honorhonorable able member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), Beazley), rather amused me, because I was a member of this Parliament in the days of peace, and I can recall a governbody ment in which the Deputy Leader of Opposition was a Minister, or of which he was a supporter, appropriating milof lions of pounds in a few. minutes under the operation of the "" guillotine"". This clause, on which the honourable ber treated us to an extraordinary tacle, merely provides for a limit of £3,000,000 on expenditure for the purbeen chase of certain assets and shares. Details are not submitted to the ParliaI ment, for the reasons that were so well explained by the honourable member"" Watson (Mr Falstein). Honourable members opposite are agents for private concerns which want to be acquainted with the whole of the details, in order that they may use them for personal and aggrandizement. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made great play in regard to what he has termed the ignorance and inexperience of the honorfrom able member for Fremantle. He is noted for his indulgence in little sharp tricks in this chamber. He has cleverly made use of the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, in an attempt to deceive the people into believing that something sinisment ter is being done by the Government. There is nothing of-the kind in this posal. The Government merely asks the to authorize the appropriation of an upper limit of £3,000,000, with not proper and adequate legislative safeguards. The commission will be responsible for submitting to the Minister detailed estimates of its expenditure at the end of each financial year. As a natural corollary, the Minister will present tliose details to the Parliament in course. In his attempt to castigate honourable member for Fremantle, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition failed badly. It was a most unfair attack on a young member who makes excellent con-Like tributions to our debates.",64

I address the members of this specchamber, and am not particularly interested in the microphones which have installed for the purpose of broadcasting parliamentary debates. In fact, opposed the introduction of the microphones under the conditions in which for they have"" been installed, but I am content to have the merits of the contributions of honourable members on the Opposition side judged by the people in comparison with those gain of supporters of the Government. The honourable member for Fremantle remarked that the bill provided ample protection, and, approaching the matter Olympian heights, he said, ""Look at clause 33 "". This provides that, subject to the act, the moneys of the commission may be applied in payment of expenses and charges and in discharge of. other obligations of the commission, in the payof the remuneration and allowances of the commissioners and the employees proof the commission, and in investment in any securities of or guaranteed by the Government. I do not know what protection that gives to this Parliament, but no doubt the honourable membei will tell us. Clause 34 provides that the commission shall keep its accounts in such form as is approved by the Treasurer. What real protection is given to this chamber or to the people by such a clause? None . whatever. The next clause states that the accounts of the commission shall be subject to inspection and audit,-at least once yearly, by the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth. So are all the accounts of every government, department.' What protection does that give to the Parliament over public finance? I have raised a matter of fundamental importance to the nation. Are estimates to be placed before the Parliament, before the expenditure is incurred ? The honourable member for Bass said he had participated in the debate only because of a remark by a previous speaker. Eitlier he was not in the chamber when clause 29 was under consideration, or he was asleep, because that clause has already been debated. It deals with a. present appropriation, but this clause refers to estimates to be prepared each year in future. The point I am seeking to. make is that this Parliament has a right to demand that estimates shall be placed before it before they are approved. The clause states- ' Tliu Commission shall prepare estimates, such form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial yoar, and shall submit those estimates to the Minister. 1 point out to the honourable member for Eremantle that that gives no control of the .matter to this Parliament. point, is that all estimates should be placed before us, so that, we may determine whether they should be accepted for the ensuing nnanciai year. Therefore, I arn seeking to add to the clause an obligation on the Minister to present the estimates of the commission to the Parliament. I seek the addition of the words:"" which shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as is reasonably possible after tlieir receipt."" Not one word said from the Government side niccts the objection which has been raised by the Opposition. Mr Spender.",64
310,Mr BUEKE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Perth) [10.18] - Ad vantage has been taken of an opportunity 1 for an ill-timed and unjustifiable attack on the honourable .member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). Tha't honourable member has paid close attention to the proceedings ever since his election to this Parliament, and his contributions have considerably improved the standard of the debates. If there is one'mistake which he has made, it is that he has expected honourable members opposite to say what they mean, not realizing that they merely talk to the electors and endeavour to damage the Government by every means at their disposal. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison), in his ill-advised speech, made a poorly delivered attack on the honourable member, whom he described as a new and innocent arrival in this chamber. Comparing . those two honourable nienibers from ""the point, of vicw of political wisdom, the honourable member for Fremantle stands head and shoulders above the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We. are told that the comniission should furnish details of the expenditure proposed to be incurred by it, but it, would be impossible for it to furnish that information. It must be quite obvious that the precise amount cannot be determined until negotiations regarding the purchase price have been conducted between*the parties. It is even more evident, that details of expenditure cannot be estimated, even by the most in competent treasury official, before the commission begins to function. In tliese matters, the honourable , member for Fremantle was correct, and honourable members opposite who criticized him were simply playing to. the gallery-in this instance a much larger gallery than usual, The because the debate is being broadcast. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) referred to the. compensation which was to be paid to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for assets, tangible and. intangible, which it, was proposed to take over. The amonnt, of compensation will depend, first of all, on the value of the physical assets, and, in the second place, upon the value of such intangible assets as rights, privileges and concessions granted to the company by previous governments. A condition should be attached to the granting of a right or a patent that, at some time, it should revert to the giver. It should be within the power of the person or authority, granting the right, to redeem it at some time, and on terms agreed upon. The fact is that rights granted to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited have acquired a value far beyond anything that was contemplated. Leader of the Australian Country party has estimated at £1,200,000 the value of assets to be taken over and when the value of the physical - assets is subtracted, the remainder represents the value of rights enjoyed by the company. If the company has thus been placed in possession of intangible assets of too great a value the responsibility rests squarely upon previous administrations, which attached no condition or limitation to the concession. It certainly does not rest upon the present Government. evident that the rights were conferred without due consideration of their prospective value.",65

Indeed, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) did everything except describe to the listening public the physical setting in which this debate is taking place. He referred to members on this side as, "" You over there on the front bench "". The speech of the honourable member was studded with comments about what was happening in the chamber inan attempt to tickle the' ears of listeners. His effort to have the clause amended was merely a ""slick"" effort' to show that - some matter which is outside the control of the Parliament ought to be brought under its control. He knows that the Government is responsible for the country's finances, and that at the proper time it will make any necessary explanation. I do not think that the honourable member's efforts to win for the Opposition the support of {he listening public will be successful, but we can expect to hear from honourable members opposite many such speeches between now and the general elections. I ask the committee to reject the amendment. I do not know whether honourable members opposite wish to delay the real business of the Parliament by indulging in such speeches, but it is unfortunate that they persist in such an attitude. As for the remarks of the honourable member for Warringah concerning the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr. Beazley), I can only say that my colleague on this side of the chamber has as fine an appreciation of the matters discussed in this place as has the honourable member for Warringah, but I doubt that it will be possible to convince the latter that that is so.

I agree that that is the usual clause serted in measures of this kind; but think that the Minister will admit that, with the increasing activities of Commouvvealth and State governments, property which otherwise would be rateable is being acquired and thereforeremoved from the rateable field. I ask the Minister to give consideration to the making of property held by such bodies as the proposed commission subject to the ordinary rating. If these bodies enjoy benefits provided by local authorities, they should make some contribution to their cost. I know that there is no legal obligation on the part of such bodies to pay for services provided by local municipalities, but it is within their compete.nce to do so a3 a matter of grace.",67
325,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration arid Minister for. Information) [10.35] - This clause is identical with a provision in the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act. The Commonwealth Government does not accept any liability in respect of local rates, or State taxes on land, and so on, but in practice the Australian Broadcasting Commission does make an ex gratia payment to many local governing authorities throughout the Commonwealth, and it will be competent for the proposed commission to do the same. That is a matter for the commission to determine. I have no doubt that when that body has been established its members will read the remarks made by honourable members during the course 'of this debate, in order to ascertain the will of the Parliament in regard to cognate matters which will be subject to their decision. Personally, I have no objection to the suggestion of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender). What has been done by the Australian Broadcasting Commission will probably .be done by the proposed commission also.",67
326,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Barker) [10.36] - I do not think that these matters should be left to the commission the to decide as acts of grace; they should Com- be matters of right. During the war many properties were taken over by Commonwealth and State governments and insemi-governmental bodies, and many I utilities were practically worn out by government departments, yet the bodies and persons concerned have no lawful claim against the Crown in respect of the damage.",67
327,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,That has nothing to do with the clause under consideration.,68
328,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"That is so. I agree that there is no inherent right to collect rates from Commonwealth instrumentalities, although it is well known that in some towns the bestsites are held by the Commonwealth. Local governing bodies have to provide roads, footpaths, &c, to serve these properties, without receiving in return any contribution by the Commonwealth. The present state of affairs will be accentuated if effect bo given to the nationalization policy of the Government. The time has come when the Parliament should take a stand in these matters. I dp not say that that should be done to-night, but Commonwealth instrumentalities should be placed on the same footing as' other property owners who pay rates. Clause agreed to. Clauses 37 to 42 agreed to'. Clause 43The value of any property acquired under this Fart shall be assessed according' to the value of the property on the first day of January last preceding the date of acquisition. Amendment (by Mr Calwell) proposed - That, at the end of the clause, the following words be added:-""o r where an agreement Hs entered into .under Part IV. of this Act as to the compensation payable in respect of the property acquired, on such date as is fixed in the agreement."".",68
329,Mr SPENDER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Warringah) [10.40]. - I know that the clause, as proposed to be amended, is similar to a provision in the Lands Acquisition Act. It means, that if a property is resumed in December, its value is assessed, not as at the date of resumption, but as on the 1st January prior to resumption. Although such a provision appears in the Lands Acquisition Act, I have never been able to ascertain why it was inserted. Has the Minister satisned himself that the Commonwealth, which is obliged under the Constitution to pay just terms of compensation, is entitled to fix any date as the date on which value shall be determined f",68
330,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Inloirmation) [10.41] - The provision made in this clause is similar to that made in other acts under which the Commonwealth acquires property. All it is proposed to do in amending the clause is to make provision that where an agreement is reached the compensation payable in respect of property acquired shall be paid on such date as is fixed in the agreement. I assume that it is competent for the Government to make an agreement, and I take it that it is also competent to fix in the agreement a date at which the money will be payable. That provision in the Lands Acquisition Act was debated fully in the early days of federation. Sitting above this Parliament as an interpretative body, a super legislature, is the High Court, whose' function it is to interpret the laws passed by this Parliament. The High Court recently upheld the very provision to which the honourable member has referred. If the High Court has held that provision to be fair and reasonable, and to be in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, there is nothing we can do about it. to-night. . Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 44 to 47 agreed to. Clause 48 (Patent rights to remain available to the Commission). Mr.'CALWELL (Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information) [10.45] - A re-examination of the matter of patent rights indicates that, in. purchasing. the telecommunication assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the-Commonwealth will' acquire also the use of any patents incorporated in the assets so purchased. In other words, the purchase price of the assets in question will include any ingredients necessary to cover the use of the patents embodied therein. In the circumstances, the clause is no longer necessary, and I ask that it be negatived. Clause negatived Clause 49 agreed to. Clause 50 (Compensation Board).",68
331,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [10.46] - A factor which I believe should be considered in assessing compensation is the contributions the Government has made to Amalgamated Wireless (Austialasia) Limited in the past. I draw specific attention to the fact that the Estiniates for the year ended the 30th June, 1946, show that an amount of £37,950 was paid to the company during the financial year 1944-45 towards the cost of coastal wireless stations, and that the estimated expenditure on that account for the financial year 1945-46 was £38,000. I am afraid that that factor has been completely overlooked. That is obviously so, because the Minister, in reply to the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron) stated that no subsidy had been paid to the company from Treasury resources.",68
332,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,I said on balance.,69
333,Mr SHEEHAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I rise to order. As the clause deals only with the personnel, of the Compensation Board I consider that the Leader of the Australian Country party is not in order in introducing irrelevant matter.",69
334,The CHAIRMAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,I have been waittelecommunication ing for the Leader of the Australian Country party to develop his argument. So far it would appear that the right honourable gentleman is in order.,69
335,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"In assessing the amount of compensation that should be paid, it is obvious that we - should take into ' consideration commitments entered into by the Government in respect of subsidies to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited .

This amendment and the insertion of two additional sub-clauses which I shall propose later are designed for the purpose of allowing the Minister to enter into any agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited on behalf of the Government providing for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the company'sassets. Negotiations are proceeding between the Government and the company in the matter, and it is expected that agreement will be reached at a reasonably early date. The amendments will , therefore, permit of the Minister taking the necessary steps to acquire the assets mentioned, and later upon the establishment of the commission to vest such property in that body.

338,Mr FADDEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [10.54J - I again draw attention to the necessity to take into consideration the subsidies that have been paid by the Government to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. of the year ended the 30th June, 1945, the Government paid to the company the sum of £37,950 towards the cost of coastal wireless stations, and in the financial year ended the 30th June, 1946, the sum of £38,000 was paid for the same purpose. Provision for this payment was made in the Estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department. This shows clearly that the Government is subsidizing Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. That is contrary to the. information that has been given to the conimittee during the debate that no subsidy had been paid to the company. I draw particular attention to that fact.",70
339,Mr CONELAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Griffith) [10.55] The statement just made by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) is not correct. He said that the Government was subsidizing Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, whereas in fact the payment of £37,950 which he mentioned was made in respect of services rendered by the company to the Commonwealth. Those services have proved so valuable that for - the information of the people of Australia. I shall detail them. The company provided a coastal radio watching service which spent more than 1,000,000 manhours listening, during which 500 distress calls from ships were dealt with. Special services provided were for the exchange of naval messages to ships at sea, and the transmission of free weather messages and time signals to ship-wrecked personnel in life boats and the Australian this army in forward areas. A special coast watching service for observing enemy movements enabled vital information to be supplied regarding Japanese warships prior to the Coral Sea battle, and also the approach of enemy aircraft in New Guinea and at Darwin. Mr Archie CAMERON"" - I rise to order. The honourable member for Griffith is reading from documents. I ask that those documents be tabled.",70
340,The CHAIRMAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"So far as the Chair is aware, the honourable member for Griffith is reading from notes.",70
341,Mr CONELAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Every Australian realizes that the Coral Sea battle was the turning point of the Pacific war. But for In the enterprise of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in rendering those services to the Government probably we would not be here today, and honourable members opposite would not have the opportunity to take advantage of the broadcasting of this debate in order to make party political capital. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited also, provided at Port Moresby a service for the outposts of the Army and for the Royal Australian Navy to Canberra. A station was establisbed at general headquarters at Port Moresby. Later, this station was removed to HoIIandia and, subsequently, to Leyte and was used for transmission to Australia of press messages which totalled 7,050,000 words. The service was provided for the people"" of Australia at a cost of £38,000. The Commonwealth Government has not paid any subsidies to the company.",70
342,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Barker) [11.0] - The points raised by the honourable'member for Griffith (Mr Conelan) bave nothing whatever to do with 'the matter. The two matters are entirely distinct. The Royal Australian Navy provides its own wireless service. There are two naval wireless stations almost within sight of this building, - and there are naval wireless stations around the coast. 'The Army provides its own wireless service, as the honourable member will know if he ever looks at the top of Victoria Barracks. The Royal Australian Air Force provides its own wireless service. Therefore, anything that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited may have done at Port Moresby would be entirely outside this proposal. I placed a question on. the notice-paper to-night asking for particulars of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited since it started operations. I will place another question on the notice-paper asking the Minister to state what amounts owing by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited to differentCommonwealth departments have been written off from time to time. The. CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member tb deal with the clause! Mr..'ARCHI E CAMERON - It relates to compensation, and-it is intimately linked up with subsidies, subventions and financial' assistance that the company has - had. from time to .time from the Treasury, and also - with certain, amounts claimed by certain de' partments - the Postmaster-General's Department for one-that have not been collected from the company but have heen written off. These are vital questions, and. X shall expect replies to the questions I - have asked - These matters 1 cannot be laughed off. If the honourable gentleman's-statement, be correct that no question asked is unanswered he will have answer-- to my questions tomorrow.",70
343,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information) [11,3] - The clause provides for the payment of compensation in respect of capital assets taken by the Commonwealth Government from Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. What the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) have talked about relates to the current income of the company. I told honourable gentlemen in my speech, in reply to the ""second-reading debate, that no subsidies, were paid to the company. None is paid to it. It is true that the Commonwealth Government pays £45,000 a year for a service rendered by the company-the transmission of messages to ships at sea ' from coastal stations. If the Government , did not pay the money to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for that service,' it would have to pay it to another company if there were another company performing a like service. Money must ' be paid to some authority which will do the ne'cessary work of protecting life at sea. That payment is not in the form of a subvention or subs'idy. It is a business deal. Such things are not taken into consideration in the assessment of compensation in respect of assets taken from the company. It is most extraordinary that honourable members opposite remain so obtuse, no matter how clearly and lucidly the position is explained to themnot all honourable members opposite, but just a handful of intransigent souls that have frustrated or attempted to frustrate us all night with banalities, generalities and, as I said of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), extraordinary platitudes.",71
344,Mr CONELAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,He is now absent.,71
345,Mr CALWELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Yes - Not so many people listen at 11 o'clock as at 9.30, and . those who'misuse the provision for broadcasting the proceedings have probably gone home to bed, but some. honourable gentlemen opposite, who take an intelligent interest in the bill, have .remained. The figures cited by the Leader of the Australian Country party do not differ from the figures that I gave/ I said > that the Government paid annually £45,000 which it is obliged ,tq pay under theagreement of 1927, which was formulated and passed through Parliament by the parties tp which honourable gentlemen opposite belong. There is provision for the deduction from that amount of 30 per cent, of the revenue from coastal and island radio'- servioes. In the year ended the 30th June, 1945, that sum amounted to £5,743. That is approxi- mately the figure given by the Leader of - the Australian Country party. There is no inconsistency between the two figures. I ask the committee to dismiss from its mind entirely any question of subsidies.

He was informed that the Department of Information would make up a new film at no cost to him, and pay a reasonable proportion and perhaps even the whole of the cost of a three weeks tour which he said would be necessary to enable him to obtain proper background for the film. He was also informed that copies of the completed film would be sent to all Department of Information representatives overseas, with the request that they should try to market it for threatrical use, any financial returns to be split between Dr Thomson and the department in a way that would ensure that the department would recover no more than the cost of making and distributing the film.

361,Mr FORDE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"On the 4th July, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) asked whether reductions were being effected in the staff at the Brighton earhp, Hobart, - and wbetber the services of redundant omcers were being dispensed with. The permanent head of the Department of the Army, Mr F. R. Sinclair, under instructions from me, visited the Brighton camp on the i2th June while on duty in Hobart. He reported that be was satisfied that the staff employed at . the camp at the time was performing essential duties, but that, as a result of the progress of demobilization in Tasmania, considerable reductions of the strength of the Brighton camp were contemplated. Such reductions are now taking place.

The following information has been received from Head-quarters, .Morotai Force concerning an alleged clash between Dutch forces and Australian Imperial Force troops at Morotai:Tliere has been no clash between Dutch and Australian Imperial Force troops at Morotai and there is no feeling of growing tension nor truth whatsoever in the allegations. Dutch armed with, knives and revolvers have not been involved, .in any picture show clash,, but. on one occasion two Dutch soldiers were requested to leave as they were armed. They, complied forthwith, explaining that as they were new-comers to the island they did not know of the regulation. Several months ago the Dutch commanding officer forbade his men carrying^ firearms off duty. No Australians have been killed or wounded. Cordial relations exist between .Dutch officers and Australian Military Force officers, resulting in mutual assistance when required. This report was discussed with Dutch Commanding Officer Nica, who had received similar signal from his head-quarters.' He. agrees that the above facts are correct and has no information concerning . any incidents. As many Dutch attend Royal Australian A i r Force pictures the matter was also discussed with Royal Australian A i r Force but. they have no knowledge of any incidents. i CIGARETTE PAPERS ",75

I have had inquiries made and now inform the honourable member that waste paper, including a small percentage of cigarette paper being offcuts from manufacture of cigarette papers, is purchased by Cellulose Australia Limited, South Australia, through a representative in Western Australia and shipped to the company's mills at Snuggery, South Australia. The total quantity of this waste cigarette paper received over recent months has no.t exceeded 28 lb. in weight. Considerable trouble bas been caused through the bales containing this waste paper being ripped open in transit by unauthorized persons in their search for paper suitable for use as cigarette paper. As a result the company has arranged for the exclusion of any waste cigarette paper f.rom future consignments from Western Australia.
