3,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Aviation To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Australian flight attendants draws to the attention of the House proposals to change Civil Aviation Order (CAO) section 20.16.3 to carry one crew member for every 50 passengers. NA Current law requires one crew member for every 36 passengers. The adoption and enforcement of ratio has lead to: (a) The establishment of a safe & secure environment for passengers and crew onboard Australian domestic flights; and 2011 (b) The ability to respond efficiently and effectively to on-board emergencies and illness; and (c) The ability efficiently and effectively to evacuate aircraft in an emergency; and (d) The ability to deter and respond to an adverse security event; including acts of terrorism and attempted hijackings. These standards benefit all Australians. We therefore ask the House to: (a) Affirm its commitment to the best and of safest standards in the world; and (b) Oppose commercial attempts by airlines to maximise profits by reducing standards and cutting costs; and (c) Reject the proposed ratio of 1 crew member for every 50 passengers. from 4,326 citizens To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens, in support of marriage as currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) draws to the attention of the House:  that on 18th November 2010 the House of Representatives endorsed a motion that said ""That this House calls on all parliamentarians, consistent with their duties as representatives, to gauge their constituents' views on ways to achieve equal treatment for same sex couples including marriage.""  that marriage is currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) as being ""... the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.""  that each element of the definition of marriage is essential to its integrity, particularly with respect to the welfare and well-being of children;  that marriage is a ""keystone"" institution on which our society rests;  that marriage provides for a stable family structure and is the ideal environment in which children are raised and nurtured; and  that marriage is worthy of ongoing protection and support. We therefore ask the House to maintain support for marriage as currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) and reject any proposal to amend its definition. from 5 citizens Petitions received.",19
4,Mr MURPHY,BILLS,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Dairy Industry Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 7 July 2011 informing me that a petition regarding competition and pricing in the Australian dairy Marriage industry has been received by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. Policy responsibility for issues related to competition rests with my colleague the Hon. David Bradbury MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. I have referred your letter to him for response. Thank you for again for your letter. from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig Merit Protection Commissioner Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 1 June 2011 concerning a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions about a secondary review of actions through the merit protection process. I note the concerns raised in the petition and make the following comments. In regard to the review of employment decisions process, Section 33 of the Public Service Act 1999 (the Act) and Part 5 of the Public Service Regulations 1999 (the Regulations) provide for a system of review of employment decisions and actions in the Australian Public Service (APS), including secondary review by the Merit Protection Commissioner (the Commissioner). The statutory scheme entitles non-Senior Executive Service employees to a review of a broad range of actions related to his or her employment. In most cases APS employees are required to have their matter initially reviewed within their agency (section 33(4)(a) of the Act). If they are dissatisfied with the outcome or if the agency considers that the matter is not reviewable, they Responses may apply for secondary review by the Commissioner. This is consistent with the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies the Act and reinforced in practice through the Regulations and the Public Service Commissioner's Public Service Directions (the Commissioner's Directions). That is, wherever possible, to deal with an issue 'as quickly, and with as little formality, as proper consideration of the matter allows' (Regulation 5.35(1)(c)). This approach also supports the concept of an agency having, and taking responsibility for, its internal management approaches and being in a position to strategically and positively respond to issues as they arise. This includes improving future decision-making by incorporating lessons from complaints and issues into policy and procedures. An application for a secondary review by the Commissioner is made through the agency head. Under Regulation 5.30 the agency head is required to give the Commissioner the application and any relevant documents relating to the primary review within 14 days. Should the Commissioner suspect poor administration or premeditated delay with regard to lodging a secondary review application, the concerns are usually raised with the relevant agency head and, if necessary, with the Special Minister of State (SMOS) or included in the Commissioner's annual report. When conducting reviews the Commissioner considers evidence provided by both the agency and the employee and forms a view on whether the actions of the agency were consistent with agency policies, were fair and reasonable and were consistent with the principles of procedural fairness. Further information on the approach taken to reviews of action and complaint handling is provided on the Merit Protection Commissioner's website (http://www.apsc.qov.au/merit/reviewactionsquid eforhrpractitioners.htm). The Office of the Merit Protection Commissioner is an independent statutory office established under section 50 of the Act. The Commissioner is appointed by the Governor General for a period up to five years and cannot be directed in the performance of his or her duties. The Commissioner reports directly to the SMOS and if he or she is not satisfied to recommendations contained in a report of a review under section 33(6) of the Act, may after consultation with the Public Service Minister have the matter reported to the agency Minister, the Prime Minister or the Presiding Officers for presentation to Parliament. These are significant powers and independence. The devolved nature of employee powers under the Act (section 20(1)) mean that every agency has its own policies and procedures (within the parameters identified by the Regulations and the Commissioner's Directions) with regard to how they construct and implement review in their agency. A knowledge and understanding of the Commonwealth public service environment balanced with a keen knowledge and understanding of the independence and the role of a statutory office holder is a key aspect of this very important role. In 2010 employees of the Office of the Merit Protection Commissioner were recipients of an Australia Day Award. It is unclear how an external body from outside the APS would provide a better or fairer system of review given the understanding and independence of the Commissioner. In regard to the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) merit selection process, the Finance Valued Behaviours form the basis of selection criteria and assessment framework for all selection processes. In accordance with section 10 of the Act, all candidates applying for positions within Finance are assessed on merit using the guiding principles for APS staff selection as follows:  An assessment is made of the relative suitability of candidates for the duties, using a comparative selection process.  The assessment is based on the relationship between the candidate's work related qualities and the work related qualities genuinely required for the duties.  The assessment focuses on the relative capacity of the candidates to achieve outcomes related to the duties. The assessment is the primary consideration in making the decision. Thank you for notifying me of this petition. I trust that this information will be of assistance to the with the response committee. from the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity, Mr Gray Potato Imports Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 31 May 2011 to Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, forwarding a petition to the Standing Committee on Petitions requesting a stop to the importation of potatoes from New Zealand because of concerns around the disease 'zebra chip'. Minister Ludwig has asked me to reply on his behalf. I regret the delay in responding. The Gillard Government is committed to a strong biosecurity system to protect Australia's enviable biosecurity status, which contributes to Australian agriculture's comparative advantage. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry completed a pest risk analysis for the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter psyllaurous and its vector the tomato-potato psyllid in 2009. The Final pest risk analysis report for ""Candidatus Liberibacter psyllaurous"" in fresh fruit, potato tubers, nursery stock and its vector the tomato-potato psyllid was publicly released after stakeholder comment in September 2009. The report included an assessment of potatoes as a host and recommended that potatoes be allowed into Australia subject to a condition that they are processed in quarantine-approved premises. The department has flagged that it will formally review the import policy for potatoes for processing from New Zealand during 2011, and Biosecurity Australia has advised that the start the review is imminent. The department's reviews of import policy are conducted in a transparent manner, and regular updates are available on its website at www.daff.gov.au/ba. You may wish to register as a stakeholder and receive notice of when the policy review for potatoes for processing from New Zealand begins, as well as notices of other new policy reviews. I note the petitioners' request to reject the application for market access for New Zealand potatoes. However, I do not consider it appropriate for Minister Ludwig or me to interfere in the process of conducting sciencebased risk assessments on market access requests. from the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Mike Kelly Migration Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 4 July 2011 concerning a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions on the decentralisation of population from cities to towns. The petition addresses issues related to the 1951 Convention, potential migration from the South Pacific region and settlement locations of refugees and migrants, matters which fall within my responsibilities as Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. In accordance with Standing Order 209(b), please find attached a response to Committee on the issues raised in the petition. Thank you for drawing this matter to my attention. Response to petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions on the decentralisation of population from cities to towns Suggestion that the Government succeed from the Refugees Convention Australia takes its international treaty obligations seriously and has no plans to abandon these obligations. Indeed, in 2001 Australia joined with the international community to renew its commitment to the Refugees Convention. As a member of the international community, Australia shares responsibility for protecting of refugees worldwide and resolving refugee situations through the system of international refugee protection. A total of 147 countries are signatory to the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol. Regional settlement The Australian Government understands the importance of balancing migration across Australia's metropolitan and regional areas, and has initiatives in place to promote migration to regional areas. The Australian Government recognises that the settlement of refugees and migrants in regional areas has benefits for both refugees and migrants and the receiving communities. Regional settlement can provide refugees and migrants with good social and economic prospects, while at the same time reduce the load on services in cities, offset regional population decline and increase community diversity in regional areas. It is however, important to note that, like Australian citizens, new entrants have a choice as to where they wish to live, and often move to larger cities because of the employment and education opportunities that larger cities can offer. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has directly settled humanitarian entrants in regional areas for some years now. Around 14,000 new humanitarian entrants are settled in Australia each year, 15-20 per cent of whom are directly settled in regional locations. Other migrants will decide to move to regional areas to benefit themselves and their families. While the Australian Government is seeking to increase the number of humanitarian entrants who settle in regional centres, this can only occur where there are appropriate services, support from government agencies and support from the local community. In settling new refugees, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship needs to ensure it provides the best assistance possible to each person. Some refugees, for example, experience severe torture or trauma before arriving to Australia, and therefore need to be initially settled in a metropolitan city where they can access suitable counselling services. Others have existing 'links' in Australia, such as family, friends or a proposer, and are therefore settled near their links so that they can receive valuable post-arrival settlement and social support. The Australian Government is committed to maintaining a skilled regional migration program that meets the current skill needs of regional employers, while ensuring the sustainable development and growth of communities. As part of the 2011-12 Budget, the Government announced a number of regional measures which include:  streamlining the permanent residence process for skilled migrants who are living and working in Australia on certain temporary visas;  the introduction of Regional Migration Agreements, a new migration initiative that will bring together local employers, local and state governments, and unions to cooperate on addressing local labour market needs through a labour agreement arrangement which caters specifically to the needs of a particular region (rather than an industry or project);  increasing the number of regional employer sponsored visa grants for 2011-12 to 16 000 places through the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme, which represents 12.5 per cent of the overall Skilled Migration program; and  expanding the Regional Outreach Network to support a new Regional Engagement Strategy to actively disseminate information to better assist regional employers with identifying migration program options that suit their needs. Assistance to South Pacific islanders The Australian Government is aware of and concerned about the complex relationship between environmental degradation, climate change and migration. We note that Pacific island leaders, in The Niue Declaration on Climate Change, have made it clear that the first priority of Pacific peoples is to continue to live in their own countries, where possible, or in the Pacific region. The Government believes that the most effective way to reduce the likelihood of climate change induced displacement is to reach a strong and effective global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, Australia is committed to playing its full and fair role in strong and decisive action to avert dangerous regional climate change. Given that some impacts of climate change and other forms of environmental degradation are unavoidable and are already being felt by Pacific island countries, building communities' resilience to climate change and environmental impacts is vital. Sustainable development activities and measures directly aimed at adaptation are vital to securing livelihoods and helping people have the choice to remain in their homes wherever possible. The Australian Government provides substantial efforts to both support sustainable development while building resilience to climate change, mainly through its International Climate Change Adaptation Initiative. There is also a long history of temporary and permanent migration in the Pacific, including between and within Pacific Island countries themselves and to other destinations such as Australia. Australia has in place policies to improve international mobility opportunities for Pacific islanders. These are not a relocation program, nor are the effects of climate change the primary reason for such assistance. Such programs are intended to bolster economic growth in the Pacific by helping to develop a more competitive regional workforce and strengthen the ability of Pacific islanders to access employment internationally, should they wish to move. In the longer term, the possibility remains that migration could become an option for some Pacific islanders. In these circumstances, Australia would work in close consultation with the region to ensure that Pacific islanders' vital interests - economic, social and cultural- are addressed. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen National Schools Curriculum Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 4 July 2011 concerning the Turkish petition received by the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the proposed languages in the draft Shape of the Australian Curriculum: Languages paper (Languages Shape paper). The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) is currently assessing the feedback from the public consultation on the draft Languages Shape paper. The Languages Shape paper proposed 11 languages for the development of the National Curriculum. While a decision has not yet been made on which languages will be included in the Australian Curriculum, it is important to acknowledge the work of ACARA is complementing other initiatives that support the study of languages in Australian schools. For example, the Collaborative Curriculum and Assessment Framework for Languages (CCAFL) is one initiative that recognises the importance of community languages being taught at the senior secondary level, such as Turkish. The CCAFL, administered by state and territory certification authorities, allows for the teaching, learning and examination of small candidature languages such as Turkish. The CCAFL process will continue to support languages for which the Australian Curriculum may not be developed. ACARA will work collaboratively with states and territories to ensure students have the opportunities to engage with languages as part of their schooling. In addition, the Australian Government provides significant funding under the National Education Agreement (NEA) to states and territories for languages education in government and community schools. The NEA allows state and territory education authorities the flexibility to target resources according to individual jurisdictional priorities and educational needs. Funding can be used to support Turkish language programs. The Government is also providing $62.4 million over 2010-2011 to 2013-2014 through the Schools Assistance Act 2008 to support the teaching of languages in nongovernment schools. Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett Murray Darling Basin Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 7 July 2011, regarding a petition for consideration by the Standing Committee concerning the Basin Plan being prepared by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (the Authority). I note the petition asking the House of Representatives to ensure the Basin Plan returns enough water to Murray-Darling Basin. The Australian Government is committed to delivering a healthy river system, strong regional communities and sustainable food production in the Murray-Darling Basin. This will be achieved through the development of the Basin Plan by the Authority and through key investments under the government's Water for the Future program. The Chair of the Authority, the Hon Craig Knowles, has indicated that he expects work on the draft Basin Plan to be finalised by mid October for exhibition in November. Once the draft Plan is released there will be a minimum 20 week public consultation period, followed by a further opportunity for state governments to provide input. The Chair said he will work closely with communities and stakeholders throughout the process. The government has committed significant funding to reduce possible impacts of the Basin Plan, including a commitment to bridge the gap between current diversion limits and those allowed under the Plan. Water will only be recovered from irrigators who choose to participate in the government's programs - there will be no compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth. Furthermore, our investments in more efficient irrigation infrastructure will help place irrigators, irrigation industries and communities on a better footing to deal with reduced water availability. I remain committed to delivering a final plan for the Murray-Darling Basin to the Parliament in 2012. Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Tony Burke Carbon Pricing Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 7 July 2011 concerning a petition received by the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding carbon pricing and replacement of coal-fired power stations with clean energy. Scientists advise that the world is warming and high levels of carbon pollution risk environmental and economic damage. No responsible government can ignore this advice. The Australian Government has developed a comprehensive plan to move to a clean energy future. This plan includes introducing a carbon price, promoting innovation and investment in renewable energy, encouraging energy efficiency, and creating opportunities in the land sector. Central to that plan is the introduction of a carbon price that will cut pollution in the cheapest and most effective way and drive investment in clean energy sources such as solar, wind and gas. A carbon price is not a tax on households around 500 of the biggest polluters in Australia will be required to pay for their pollution, and every dollar raised will be used to support households, jobs, and to invest in clean energy and climate change programs. Putting a price on carbon is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to cut pollution. This is a fact that is well recognised by economists from around the world and respected institutions such as the OECD and the Productivity Commission. Currently, releasing carbon pollution is free despite the fact that it is harming our environment. A carbon price changes this. It puts a price on the carbon pollution that Australia's largest polluters produce. This creates a powerful incentive for all businesses to cut their pollution by investing in clean technology or finding more efficient ways of operating. It encourages businesses across all industries to find the cheapest and most effective way of reducing carbon pollution rather than relying on more costly approaches, such as government regulation. To assist households with price impacts, there will be tax cuts and increases in pensions, allowances and benefits. A significant tax reform will mean that over one million individuals will no longer need to file a tax return. Using the revenue from carbon pricing to help families in this way does not cancel out incentives to reduce pollution. Households will still face changes in relative prices. By choosing less carbon emission intensive goods and services, and taking simple actions to improve energy efficiency in their daily lives, households can save money. These savings will come on top of the increased tax cuts and payments that households will continue to receive. The Government is also committed to supporting jobs and competitiveness as Australia moves to a clean energy future and has designed a range of measures for this purpose. In particular, $9.2 billion will be provided over the first three years of the carbon price through the Jobs and Competitiveness Program to support jobs in industries that create a lot of carbon pollution. This program is ongoing. In terms of replacing coal-fired power stations with clean energy, the Government is establishing an Energy Security Fund that includes potential payments for the closure of around 2,000 megawatts (MW) of very highly emissionsintensive coal-fired electricity generation before 2020. The Government will invite expressions of interest from owners of coal-fired generation capacity with emissions intensity above 1.2 tCO2-e/MWh of electricity (on an 'as generated' basis) and will negotiate with the owners of very highly emissions-intensive generators during 2011 and 2012. The Government's plan for a clean energy future will cut pollution and drive investment in new clean energy sources, such as solar, gas and wind. By acting now, Australians can look forward to long term prosperity while protecting our environment for ourselves and for our future generations. Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Combet Statements",20
5,Mr MURPHY,BILLS," The last time. I addressed the House following the presentation of petitions on behalf of the Petitions Committee, I commented on the very large volume of petitions that were tabled that day. Today's announcement is in stark contrast to the previous one, with only two petitions presented. Interestingly, this lower volume of petitions tabled today is also worthy of comment. Understandably, during a recess in the parliamentary sittings, as we had in July/August, the volume of petitions that await presentation builds-that is one reason we have ebbs and flows in the number of petitions tabled and, indeed, in the number of ministerial responses presented. However, the number of petitions presented in the House does not necessarily reflect the volume of potential petitions submitted to the Petitions Committee for consideration. Unfortunately, a large number of petitions that are received by the committee do not comply with the House standing orders, and, as such, cannot be presented in the Housecapacity either by me, as Chair of the Petitions Committee, or by any member of the House. As an example, at its last meeting the committee assessed 12 petitions but only half of them were found to be compliant-two have been presented today and four were presented by individual members in the last sitting week in August. Petitions found not to comply are the result of a failure to meet one or more of the standing order requirements. A commonly seen error is that the petition is not addressed to the House of Representatives but is instead addressed to a particular member of parliament-for example, to the Prime Minister or to a constituent's local member. Similarly, petitions which make requests to anyone other than the House of Representatives do not meet the standing order requirements. As such, a petition directly requesting that the government, or a particular minister, take action on a matter would not be compliant with the standing orders, even if the petition were correctly addressed to the House. Another frequent misconception is that the House accepts petitions sent electronically or with electronically reproduced signaturesfor example, faxed signature pages, photocopied pages or emails. Quite often photocopied petition pages are sent to the committee, and, despite attempts by the secretariat to track down the original copies, the originals are unavailable. So it is very important for petitioners to remember that petitioning the House is still conducted in a traditional manner. Standing order 205(b) specifies that all signatures on a petition must be original handwritten versions-and that includes the signature of the person who is the chief organiser of the petition, the ‘principal petitioner'. Other petitions are found to be out of order because they fail to respond to a number of standing orders, indicating the likelihood that the petitioner is unaware that formal requirements for petitioning the House exist. Naturally this is very disappointing for those who organise petitions and collect signatures. It is also frustrating for the committee-and, indeed, for all members of parliament-who receive non-compliant petitions, especially given the resources available to assist citizens in preparing a petition. Non-compliant petitions are not forwarded by the committee to relevant ministers for a response, and this means the matters raised in them may not be brought to the attention of the relevant minister and will not receive a detailed response. The petitions committee provides various materials to assist petitioners understanding the House's requirements-for example, we have a website which provides background material on the petitioning process, including a sample petition format, a checklist of things to consider before collecting signatures and a link to petitions previously tabled that shows in-order formats. In addition, members of the House of Representatives are provided with stocks of information sheets and brochures to assist constituents who come to them for advice on the process. The committee secretariat is also available to assist members and the Australian public by telephone, post and email to provide information on petitioning requirements. The general public is encouraged to send proposed petition formats either electronically or by mail to the committee secretariat for information on compliance before they start collecting signatures. It is encouraging that many petitioners are making early contact with the secretariat for advice on the process before sending in a completed petition. In the remainder of my statement today I would like to mention the ongoing stream of ministerial responses to petitions which are presented each sitting Monday. The announcement on 22 August contained 20 ministerial responses, and today we see another seven presented. Once a petition is found to comply and is presented to a House, the terms-that is, the reasons and the request-are published in Hansard. The committee also decides in most instances to refer the petition to the minister or ministers holding the relevant portfolio areas to seek their comment. Not all petitions are referred for a response. For example, when many petitions are tabled on the same subject matter with the same terms and within a similar time in frame, additional petitions on that issue are not usually referred. As can be seen from the responses tabled today, not all responses meet the petitioners' requests. For example, a number of responses today explain to various petitioners why certain post office locations could not be maintained. Sometimes the response does detail changes which have occurred in favour of the petition request, but more often the purpose of a ministerial response is to explain the government perspective on a situation or matter that has been raised in the petition. Finally, as all ministerial responses are published both in Hansard and on the committee's website, the explanations of issues provided by ministers are available to all interested parties, not just to principal petitioners. All citizens, therefore, have access to information about petitions brought before the House.",26
6,The SPEAKER,BILLS,"I thank the member for Reid for his sterling and brave efforts and commend to him hot lemon juice and honey. NA Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee Report  behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.  into my response to the report, I would like to note that this report has brought people from all around Australia to the parliament. see up in the viewing gallery Paul Kennard, Kylie Hutton and their children Ben, Tom and Sophie, who have come down from Brisbane especially to hear this response. The Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs for inquiry and advisory report. The bill proposed a number of significant reforms which are designed to streamline and modernise Australia's laws on extradition and mutual assistance processes. Policy and processes in this area must balance the interests of criminal investigations with the great need safeguard human rights. It is a complex balance, and the committee is pleased to have contributed to scrutiny on this bill and to make a number of recommendations to the House. These recommendations have the unanimous support of the committee. Prior to this committee's inquiry the bill went through a rigorous process of public consultation during its development. Exposure drafts of the bill were released in both 2009 and January 2011, and subsequently a number of amendments were made. Firstly, the committee welcomes the reforms in the bill to extend the availability of bail to allow individuals to apply for bail during the latter stages of the extradition process. However, there is a statutory presumption against bail which restricts judicial discretion and places the evidentiary burden on applicants to prove that there are special circumstances to justify bail. As a matter of principle the committee queries the necessity of this presumption against bail. The committee's view is that it is rightly the role of the judiciary to determine the merits or risks of bail in any given situation and so recommends that consideration be given to removing this statutory presumption against I bail in extradition cases. This change could be made without impacting on Australia's treaty obligations. A further area of concern relates to transparency. Increasingly there is a reliance on undertakings from foreign countries to facilitate the extradition or mutual assistance process. These include undertakings regarding the storage of personal information and undertakings that a person wanted for an offence that carries the death penalty will not have the death penalty imposed upon them or, if it is imposed, will not have the sentence carried out on them. The breach of an undertaking has serious consequences not only for the individuals involved but also for to the bilateral relationship between Australia and the country concerned. Therefore, we recommend that all breaches of an undertaking be reported on in the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department. The committee further recommends that any significant breach of an undertaking should be immediately reported to the parliament. The committee agrees that reforms to our extradition and mutual assistance processes are required to recognise further grounds refusal of assistance, to clarify what constitutes political offences, to expedite processes and to ensure there is appropriate scope for the Attorney-General to exercise discretion in any decision. The bill as proposed achieves an effective balance between streamlining processes maintaining safeguards. However, given the gravity of the issues involved, the committee recommends that any reforms to extradition and mutual assistance processes be reviewed within three years to ensure that the balance is operating effectively. The issues that the committee has raised are designed to enhance the reforms proposed in the bill. The committee recommends the government consideration to these additional issues and that the House pass the bill without amendment. In closing, I thank all of the members of the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, particularly the deputy chair, their thorough approach to this inquiry, and thank all contributors to the inquiry and the wonderful secretariat under Dr Anna Dacre's leadership-especially Mei-Lin Wang, who provided specialist advice on the bill and who is here in the chamber today.",28
7,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES," by leaveas acting deputy chair of the committee in the absence of the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan, I want to stress that the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislative Amendment Bill 2011 is a bipartisan-supported advisory report. While we are told that the aim of the bill is to streamline and to modernise Australia's extradition and mutual assistance law, in fact it deals with some very significant issues. It is not just streamlining; we believe it is a very significant movement forward to ensure that Australia has special measures to ensure for that in extradition we uphold the rights of individuals to be treated properly before our law and also that their human rights are observed in other jurisdictions. Particularly in relation to extradition, the bill aims to extend the circumstances in which a person may be prosecuted in and Australia as an alternative to extradition. We want to allow the person to consent to extradition in relation to a wider range of offences and to modify the definition of political offence to clarify that the political offence exception to extradition does not extend to specified crimes such as terrorism. The bill also requires that extradition must be refused if a person may be prejudiced by reason of his or her sex or sexual orientation give following surrender. As we know, not all countries share the same beliefs as we do in Australia, where a person should not and may not be discriminated against on the basis of their gender, their religion, their ethnicity or their age. It is essential that we cover all for of the circumstances where a person may be discriminated against if extradited. The stated purpose of other measures is to streamline the extradition process, and potentially to reduce the amount of time a person is required to spend in extradition custody while maintaining appropriate safeguards. This is very important, of course. We also want to strengthen safeguards in relation to the provision of assistance where there are death penalty or torture concerns in a particular case. This bill aims to amend the various grounds on which Australia can refuse a request for assistance from another country. I have already referred to the case where a person may be prejudiced at their trial, or where the purpose of the investigation or prosecution is to persecute a person on the basis of his or her sexual orientation. The bill also aims to streamline the process used to authorise a proceeds of crime action to allow Australian courts to register and enforce foreign non-conviction-based proceeds of crime orders from any country. These are important changes and we believe they will better safeguard the rights of individuals and also help Australia to be a better global citizen. We were conscious when we looked at this bill not to make it more difficult than it already is for our law enforcement officers to do the work that they are often called to do in collaboration and cooperation with other governments. After speaking with the Australian Federal Police, for example, we are quite satisfied that they are comfortable with these amendments. This is a very important bill. As our chair has said, we do recommend that consideration be given to amending the current provisions of the Extradition Act, which allow bail to be granted only in special circumstances. We believe a magistrate should be able to use his or her full discretion when it comes to considering bail. We also believe that, since these are significant changes to the current law, we should include removing several grounds for refusing assistance in mutual assistance cases, such as the current double jeopardy ground. Given the seriousness of the issues involved in extradition and mutual assistance, the committee recommends that the government undertake to review the operation of the amendments three years after they come into force if the amendments are passed by this parliament. We think that is very important to do. The review will ensure that the amendments are operating as intended and that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect human rights. Again let me stress that there was bipartisan supported approval of this bill, and we certainly commend it to the House. NA Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Mining, Petroleum and Water Resources) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Windsor.",29
8,Mr WINDSOR,BILLS," I present the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Mining, Petroleum and Water Resources) Bill 2011 and the explanatory memorandum. I think that most members in the chamber are fully aware of the debate that is occurring in parts of regional Australia between the extractive industries and the agricultural sector, and particularly where there is a collision point, in a sense, where agriculture and water intersect with the ambitions of some of the extractive activities that are being processed by state governments. This has been particularly evident in Queensland and parts of New South Wales. One of the flashpoints is in my electorate, the electorate of New England-the area of the Liverpool Plains. I give recognition to Mr Tim Duddy, who has worked very hard in assisting with this legislation and who has worked extremely hard with many others in the Caroona Coal Action Group and other activities to highlight the potential significance of some of these extractive activities on our water resources. I would also thank the member for Lyne for his supporting and seconding this bill. We want this bill to be taken seriously in the chamber; it is a serious issue and it does deserve serious consideration. I think we would be the last to say that this particular bill solves all the problems, but I think it gives a platform and a flight path to an issue that state governments are wrestling with and that the Commonwealth government is wrestling with, particularly given the fact that the Commonwealth and the states have come to agreement in relation to the Murray Darling Basin arrangements and that there is an earnest and honest attempt to overcome some of the issues of the Murray Darling Basin over the last hundred years that governments have not been able to correctly arrest. I think it is very important that, if we are embarking on a solution to the water issues within the Murray-Darling system, we look at the way in which the extractive activities can impact not only on the sites of those activities but also on the water resources which are part of the Murray-Darling system. Whether that occurs on the Liverpool Plains in my electorate, in parts of Queensland, on the flood plains below Moree-some of the most productive lands in Australia are in those three areas-or in other parts of Australia, I think it is we had a national approach to some of these activities and the impacts, particularly the potential off-site impacts, that these activities may well have on our water resources. The state laws have simply not kept up with the environmental pressures these new developments pose, and there is a need for a nationally consistent standard to allow certainty for gas and coal companies at the same time as it protects Australia's limited water resources. If we are serious about food security, we need to protect these water resources, and equally, if as a nation we are serious about protecting the unique environment that depends on our water resources, it is time for a nationally consistent standard. The bill captures current exploration developments and requires corporations to notify the Commonwealth if the company thinks its activity will have a significant impact on the water quality or structural integrity of water resources. The bill gives great detail to defining mining and gas actions and defining water resources and places the onus on the company to apply for a permit to proceed with its plans. Essentially, what this bill does is allow an extra trigger for the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conversation Act to be enacted at the Commonwealth level. Currently, threatened species-both flora and fauna-and some international agreements and heritage listing applications do trigger the EPBC Act. This bill would allow our valuable water resources, in certain cases, to trigger the Commonwealth's participation in the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation area, particularly where these extractive industries impact on our water-that is to say, in a similar fashion to some of the activities that are out there now where the Commonwealth time that becomes involved through threatened species. The Commonwealth does not become involved in every mining or coal seam gas application-that is the states' prerogative currently-but the bill would allow an additional trigger, where our valuable water resources are threatened, for the Commonwealth to play a role. The bill requires that a constitutional corporation-the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency-must not take a mining action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the water quality, structural integrity or hydraulic balance of the water resource. One example of the sort of thing that I am talking about and that the bill addresses is the Namoi Catchment Water Study, which has been partly funded by the Commonwealth to the extent of $1½ million. There are other studies that are currently underway. The Namoi Catchment Management Authority, for instance, has a spatial planning process that it is working on at the moment to overlay the various activities and resources on some of these areas. There are also suggestions from the Minerals Council of Australia that we need some form of bioregional assessment of regions before extractive activities, exploration licences or mining or coal seam gas production take place. So I think there is a general consensus out there that this issue has not been correctly addressed and that we do need a better approach than the one that we have. The state-based process that is currently there is more about a localised impact within the mining area where mining or coal seam gas production is to be undertaken; it does not correctly take into account the potential site impacts on groundwater resources and the relationship that those resources may have with other groundwater systems or, effectively, with surface water systems. That is the point that I made earlier in relation the Murray-Darling system. The bill allows a delegation to be granted to the states to authorise these activities through a disallowable Commonwealth instrument. I expect, as I mentioned earlier, that the approach of the Namoi catchment study, the Namoi Catchment Management Authority spatial risk assessment and modelling study and some of the sensitive agricultural land studies that some of the states are carrying out at the moment could all be part of this process. The bill will, in fact, facilitate these discussions. The states should not fear this. This is a genuine attempt to deal with a genuine issue that is the states' prerogative at the moment. The Commonwealth, through this very same act-the EPBC Act-had to apply 300 conditions on a coal seam gas application in Queensland, essentially something that is a state responsibility. The state, I believe, had applied 1,200 conditions to the same development. To have 1,500 conditions applied to an extractive activity says to me that this current arrangement with the state legislation, the way it relates to the Commonwealth and the way the Commonwealth relates back to the state through water security et ceteraparticularly in the Murray-Darling Basin, as I mentioned earlier-is not working effectively. We need to put a handbrake on this for the moment-to slow the process down and develop a process that does actually work in terms of the integrity of the water resources. The extractive activities will be there for a relatively short time in the history of the off- landscape in Australia; we must make sure that those activities take place only where there is a risk assessment process that delivers a real outcome that people can have confidence in. The community do not have to confidence in the state-based arrangements that are currently in place, and I think we need the national government to take a lead in this debate at this time and make sure that our water resources that are potentially under threat are fully taken into account. This is not about being anti mining or pro mining or anti coal seam gas or pro coal seam gas; it is about the integrity of a process that will lead to better decisions by the mining and extractive industry companies, the agricultural endeavours that are currently on some of these landscapes, the state and Commonwealth governments and the relationship that all of those players have in relation to our very valuable water resources. Bill read a first time.",30
9,The SPEAKER,BILLS,"In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott.",33
10,Mr ABBOTT,BILLS," I present the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011. This is the third time that I have presented to the House what is substantially the same bill. The first occasion was prior to the election last year. Then, late last year, after the election, I presented this bill to House. Unfortunately, because the House did not deal with the bill, it lapsed, so I am presenting it to the House for a third time. Because I have presented this bill twice before, in effect, I do not propose long to detain the House on this matter. Nevertheless I do want to stress just how seriously I take this issue and how seriously the opposition takes this issue. This bill is about ensuring that the Aboriginal people of Cape York have more control over their land and more control over their economic destiny. This bill provides, in short, that a Queensland declaration that the relevant river is a wild river can only take effect if the traditional owners of the land consent to that declaration taking effect. We are not saying that wild rivers declarations cannot operate; we are just saying that wild rivers declarations can only operate with the consent of the relevant traditional owners. We are not saying that the environmental protections which the Queensland act purports to provide cannot operate; we are just saying that the environmental protections under the Queensland act can only apply with the consent of the traditional owners. This bill is about asserting the rights of the relevant traditional owners over their land-surely, you would think, a good thing. It is about allowing the relevant traditional owners, if they choose not to have economic development on that land, not to have that decision further complicated by a wild rivers declaration. At the heart of this bill is my confidence that the relevant traditional owners want to protect the land in question. The idea that the Aboriginal people of Cape York would wish to despoil their own land in some reckless commercial venture is dead wrong. They have been the stewards of this land since time immemorial. The fact that we have this land in reasonably pristine condition is a the function of the Indigenous stewardship of this land for tens of thousands of years. The only possible objection to this bill rests on the assumption that the Aboriginal people of Cape York cannot be trusted to know what is good for their own environment. Every day in this parliament we acknowledge Indigenous stewardship, and that expresses a confidence in the capacity of Aboriginal people to do the right thing by their land. I have that confidence. I particularly have that confidence in the Aboriginal people of Cape York. That is what this bill embodies. I think the government should support this bill. I am extremely disappointed, and I know many of the Aboriginal people of Cape York are extremely disappointed, that the government have done everything they can to frustrate this bill, including sending it off to a committee which took rather a long time to report. The government should support this bill. I remind the House that, back in 2008, in what was perhaps his finest moment as Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, the member for Griffith, said in his national apology in this parliament that: … unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. This is the substance which must be supplied if reconciliation is to be meaningful. Here is the substance-I am giving the government the opportunity to provide some muscle and sinew to the words that they are so good at uttering. That is why the government should support this bill. I also remind members opposite that this parliament has subscribed to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which provides for, amongst other things, the right of Indigenous people to 'own, use, develop and control' their lands. It was paradoxical that on the same day that the parliament subscribed to that UN instrument, the Queensland government was making a wild rivers declaration that would take away from Aboriginal people in Cape York their right to do precisely this. I say to members opposite: you have the opportunity to give substance to your declarations of fine sentiment. I say to members opposite: you have the opportunity to make the international instrument that you have subscribed to a reality in this great country of ours, and you would do so by supporting this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",33
11,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 Second Reading",34
12,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Debate adjourned. Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading,34
13,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS,I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Debate adjourned. Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011 Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,34
14,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," My private member's Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 and the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011 will establish for the first time in Australia's history a parliamentary budget office. The office will be a new body accountable to the parliament and will have two key functions. The first and, I believe, most important function will be to provide a confidential service for costing policy proposals for all MPs and senators, including the opposition, minor parties, the Independents and backbench government members. The provision of a confidential service for costing policies is a crucial and non-negotiable element of my bill. The failure to achieve such a facility will render the PBO pointless. The policy costing service will be no different to that now offered under the Charter of Budget Honesty. Accordingly, should these bills fail to pass and the government's poor imitation of a costing service pass this place, the coalition will not submit its policy costings to either the Treasury or the PBO prior to the election. We will ask the Australian people to form a view on our policies as they stand. The Charter of Budget Honesty was a creation of the Howard coalition government. Its primary task was to ensure that a government could not mislead the public prior to an election about the state of the fiscal position. This was put in place following the misleading pre-election statements of the Keating government in 1996. The policy costing service offered to the opposition was intended as an option. It was never intended to be a consultative service and it only applies to already announced policies. In opposition the Labor Party barely used the facility and when they did they were hardly serious about it. In government they have been even less transparent. In 2007 and 2010 they released their full policy costings the day before the election. During the last election it was a Friday afternoon press release and the Treasurer did not even bother to front the media. The coalition's experience with the policy costing service under the Charter of Budget Honesty has revealed some shortcomings. The service is not confidential. Requests for costings are published on the websites of Treasury and/or Finance as soon as they are received. The costings of the policies are also immediately published on their websites. Members of parliament have no control over the timing of the release of policies; they have no prerogative to change a policy if the costing turns out to be substantially different to what was expected. There is no scope for the costing to be discussed or reviewed. There is no way of discussing or altering underlying assumptions for policy initiatives. The opinion of Treasury and Finance is final: the departments are not required to release their assumptions underlying the costing, but simply the costing itself. Herein lies the difficulty. Treasury and Finance have access to information that most MPs and senators do not. For example, at the last election the opposition had estimated the interest to be saved on the debt from not proceeding with the NBN by using the Commonwealth 10-year bond rate as the discount rate. In discussion after the election it turned out the Treasury had used a different, lower interest rate, but initially in discussion they would not tell us what it was. This led Treasury to estimate a lower quantum of savings for the coalition proposal to cancel the NBN even though they would not tell us why. It was interesting that later the NBN implementation study showed that the Commonwealth government bond rate was the appropriate rate to use for the cost of funds. The coalition methodology was correct, but of course the so-called budget black hole story had already run. In postelection discussions the secretaries of Treasury and Finance made it clear to the opposition that they did not want to be in a position to cost our policies. They know that there can be legitimate bases for a difference of views and that it is impossible to arrive at accurate and agreed costings if these differences cannot be discussed. The policy costing function under the charter was intended to level the playing field, but it appears that a new anomaly has arisen. Under the arrangements between Labor and the Greens for the hung parliament the non-Labor members who have pledged their support for the government already have access to the public sector to get their policies costed. I note, for example, that in April Senator Bob Brown produced Treasury costings that showed reductions in FBT concessions on company cars could save a billion dollars over four years. The policy was later adopted by the government in the May budget. Clearly, the Greens have access to a facility for costing policies not afforded to the coalition. This, of course, will not last. Perhaps the Greens should reflect carefully on that when they support the government's PBO bill as they have signalled they will. My bill before the House today will address this anomaly. The confidential service for costing policies to all members and senators will allow discussion to occur and views to be challenged. Importantly, it will allow the member or senator to control the timing of the release of the policy costing as the Greens did with their FBT proposal. No longer will requests for policy costings and the costings themselves be published as soon as they are received and prepared by the departments of Treasury and Finance. My bill will ensure that the costing service for policies is not just provided to the opposition, as it is currently under the charter; under my bill the policy costing service will be available to allIndependents, minor parties, and government members and senators as well. There will be no discrimination. All members and senators will, for the first time, have equal access to quality election policy costing services during and outside election periods. I note that some of these issues were raised by the then Labor opposition and the Greens in the 1997 debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. The second function of the PBO will be to provide objective and impartial advice on, and analysis of, the Commonwealth budget and fiscal cycle, including the impact of major policy announcements. It introduces another layer of integrity and transparency in the settings of forecasts of government finances. For this to be effective the PBO needs to have effective informationgathering powers. It must be able properly to evaluate the financial implications and decisions. My bill gives these powers to the PBO. With this power comes a heavy duty of confidentiality, and there are consequences for those who breach this trust. Another key feature of my bill is that the PBO is guaranteed adequate resources. This has been achieved by allocating minimum funding to the PBO as a percentage of departmental appropriations for Treasury. This ensures the operations of the PBO cannot be compromised by inadequate funding. Finally, my bill provides for the PBO to be located within Parliament House, where all members and senators will be able to access it at their convenience. It will, however, remain independent of the Parliamentary Library. We are committed to this important economic reform. We are not going to be half-hearted about it. We are not going to set up a service that does not work and is not embraced by all members of parliament. An independent body which provides assessment of the budget and fiscal cycle and of the financial impacts of policies will provide an additional layer of integrity to Australia's fiscal framework. A confidential service for costing policies available to all MPs and senators, all year round, and which allows for discussion and refining of policies will strengthen the quality of policy work and make the public discourse about fiscal policy more meaningful. I therefore commend these bills to the House.",34
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,36
16,Mr ROBB,BILLS," I rise to second the motion on the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 and the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011 introduced by my friend and colleague the member for North Sydney. These bills are about restoring credibility and integrity to the policy costings process which has been so grossly politicised and abused by the Gillard government following the 2010 federal election. This was exposed by Jennifer Hewett in a front-page story in the Australian last September titled 'Coalition counts cost of Treasury's ""political game""'. Jennifer Hewett wrote that meeting minutes revealed how the process was 'politicised and influenced by the opinions of the senior bureaucrats'. This was confirmed in the article written by Jennifer Hewett in the Australian. She said: But the detailed Coalition rebuttal, also obtained by The Australian, demonstrates that the biggest dispute in money terms - $2.5bn over four was a more modest version of a similar $4.6bn change adopted by the Labor government in its own budget the previous year. The opposition claimed $2.5bn in savings from adjusting what is known as the conservative bias allowance (CBA). This effectively meant that the opposition claimed it would be more efficient in delivering spending programs and could therefore reduce the small percentage buffer included to allow for programs going over budget. There is no doubt that the record of the coalition government on common sense and detailed economic management and program management far exceeds that of the Labor government. In just four short years this government has wasted tens of billions of dollars on the pink batts program, the NBN and the education revolution program. All of these things have resulted in tens of billions of dollars of overruns and yet Treasury refused, in this instance, to allow the coalition to exercise a discretion to lower the amount of money allowed for overruns. Of course, the Treasury had a $5 billion allowance for overruns for this government. We chose to reduce that to $2½ billion because we would oversee these programs in a sensible and effective manner. In subsequent hearings the secretaries accepted that an incoming government might wish to do so as a policy measure. In other words, the same secretaries that sat with us for 3¼ hours in that politicised meeting after the federal election and before a government was formed-the secretaries who told us that they had made a decision and that that was the best they could do to justify taking $2½ billion as a so-called black hole-have subsequently, within weeks, admitted that we had that policy discretion. This confirms, again and again, the deeply politicised nature. We have had to wear, ever years - since, what was a political decision by secretaries of departments who sat there and told us, 'We've made our decision,' without giving any justification. That was 25 per cent of the so-called black hole. We went through that process again and again as we challenged assumptions. My colleague mentioned one of those in relation to the interest charged on the debt coming from the NBN. This bill aims to clear away the capacity sensible, of an incumbent government-particularly a Labor incumbent government, which is disposed to this sort of activity-to heavily politicise the nature of the bureaucratic involvement. This bill would set up an office very similar to the Congressional Budget Office in the United States, which is unequivocally independent. It is a model for budget offices around the world. It removes the opportunity for the government of the day to politicise a costing process, as this government did so comprehensively in the last election. It probably delivered them government. The way in which they politicised the process made a significant contribution and gave some of the Independents the excuse they were looking for. These bills provide for a far more superior model for a parliamentary budget office than that proposed by the government. The government have panicked-they have introduced their own bill two days after we introduced the private member's bill in a panicked move to head off this initiative. They want to go into the next election with every possible advantage, including politicising the Public Service once again. These bills will stop that process. They will ensure that there is an independent group that will take our material-and potentially take the government's material and that of the Greens and the Independents-and will independently assess it. We will have the opportunity to look at the assumptions they make and to amend our proposals accordingly, if that is necessary. It will this independent office access, without FOIs, which are an interminable process and are included in the government's bill to frustrate this very process. They have decided not to have a parliamentary budget office. government's bill, which we will debate later today, is for a politicised budget office. That is what they are looking to create. They are looking to throttle the very vehicle that has been designed to overcome the politicisation of this process. Wouldn't it be good to go into the next election and debate policy without finding ourselves on a daily basis seeking to justify leaks out of the Treasurer's office about our costing process? We spent three weeks of the campaign trying to deal with a politicised leak out of the Treasurer's office in the last campaign, until the point that we gave up any faith in that process and stopped submitting our material. Wouldn't it be sensible, wouldn't it be the process that the community would wish to see, to go into an election after 33 days of campaigning with all of our policies having been independently and authoritatively costed by this independent parliamentary budget office, and not having to run the gauntlet of a politicised bureaucracy, a government having played tricks the whole way through the campaign? Wouldn't it be far better to go in there and debate policy? They do not want to debate policy; that is their problem. They want to frustrate and politicise the process. In doing so, they are short-changing the community. We have to have a bill which creates an independent parliamentary budget office. Our bill, the bill introduced by the member for North Sydney, does that. It ensures that this independent office can access information and provide independent advice, with suitably qualified people running the give office who look at both our work and the government's work. We will not then see the frustration arising from the nonsense that has gone on in the last 12 months or two years in terms of Treasury's spotty forecasting ability. It has been all over the place, and yet we are The expected to tug the forelock and accept every word they say, even when we can demonstrate in private that their assumptions are demonstrably wrong. There is something fundamentally wrong with this process. We need a parliamentary budget office. We introduced this notion some three years ago, under the former leader, the member for Wentworth. This process has been proven in the United States. This process was adopted by the Greens and the Independents. The government only agreed to it, in the end, to placate the Independents and the Greens-again, to get into office. They got into office, and what have they done? They have presented their own bill-and we will go through this chapter and verse later today-which totally frustrates the intention of this bill. It removes the objective and unbiased approach in the bill. What it does-you will see this bill this afternoon-is make the office just another arm of the bureaucracy, three chairs in the corner of the Parliamentary Library. It is an abuse of the process. We need a bill which establishes a well-resourced, fully independent and confidential parliamentary budget office. I commend this bill to the House.",36
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I remind the member for Fraser-I did not want to pull up the member for Goldstein during his speech-to refer comments through the chair and not directly address the person involved.,38
18,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011 and the cognate bill. What an extraordinary attack we just heard from the member for Goldstein. The political party that once believed in an impartial Public Service doing the great work of the Australian people has now got that service in its sights. That is what the modern day Liberal Party thinks-that the Treasury boffins who have devoted their working lives to understanding the Australian economy, providing careful, impartial advice on where the Australian economy is going to go, are mere political footballs. Those opposite are willing to extend their attacks any way they can. Frankly, it is not that surprising that opposite are looking for targets in the bureaucracy as well as on this side of the House, because they know, as all Australians do, that when it comes to many of the big issues-whether you are talking about fiscal stimulus, climate change or the minerals resource rent tax-the vast bulk of Australian economists line up with the position of the Gillard government. So, of course, when you have an opposition who is led by a man who has described economics as a bit of a bore, when you have an opposition who is on record as saying that when you disagree with Australian economists you should just attack the profession, then, yes, they are going to extend their attacks to the Australian Treasury, extend their attacks to the Australian Treasurer's economic forecasting. The member for Goldstein is right when he says that forecasts are not always perfect, but the notion that the Australian Treasury's forecasts are somehow politicised is a notion that I immediately reject. Those who work in the Australian Treasury are hard working public servants, like the many public servants in my electorate of Fraser who get up every morning thinking: 'How can I improve Australia? How can I put better ideas on the table to build a better country?' During the last election we saw the opposition providing any possible excuse for not submitting its policies for costings. The excuse they were running on-the 'excuse du jour'-was that Treasury was going to leak their policies. This was a pretty extraordinary claim, given that this was the same opposition that had, a few short months earlier, been making hay out of leaks from Godwin Grech, but that was their claim. Of course, we discovered after the election why the opposition had been so keen to keep their costings away from the public eye; it turned out that the opposition costings were a cool those $11 billion short. A series of assumptions made by those opposite were simply unfounded. The opposition's costings did not stack up. Since then, the opposition have clearly decided that $11 billion is not good enough. They are going to go for the record, and they are now up to a $70 billion black hole. We know this thanks to leaks from the opposition's policy budget group, and we have had it confirmed by the member for Goldstein. In contrast, the member for North Sydney is still arguing that the $70 billion figure does not characterise their shortfall. I think he would like to imagine that the opposition's shortfall is maybe just $50 billion or $60 billion, but it has been confirmed by the member for Goldstein and other members of the coalition's front bench that the opposition's costings are in deep, deep trouble. There are good reasons for that, because every time they stare a hard policy choice in the face those opposite take the easy road. They want to promise everything to everyone and they are unwilling to stand up for reasonable tax savings. They are unwilling to means-test the private healthcare rebate and they are unwilling to support the fuel tax reforms that were introduced into this place by then Treasurer Peter Costello in 2003. The opposition are running from the hard policy choices. Before the House today we have two proposals for a parliamentary budget office. We have a government bill that would allow the Parliamentary Budget Office to access information from Australian government agencies through a negotiated memorandum of understanding in circumstances where the release of information is consistent with other legislative requirements, including being guided by the principles established under the Freedom of Information Act. This is consistent with the unanimous recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office. The committee favoured an MOU over compulsion to provide information, on the grounds that it would facilitate more productive working relationships between the Parliamentary Budget Office and government agencies. In contrast, the coalition's proposal would give the Parliamentary Budget Officer power to direct agencies to provide information. In its unanimous report, the committee flagged concerns with providing these powers to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, including the potential for this to inhibit productive working relationships with government agencies. Under the coalition's approach, the Parliamentary Budget Officer would have power to access information despite any other law and there would be no controls over the officer then disclosing information to members and senators if it relates to their request. The joint committee said at page 76 of its report: The committee considers that the PBO's relationships with Government agencies will crucial to its success. Not only will the PBO require information and data held by Government agencies, it may also need the assistance of agencies in making the best use of that information and data. The committee went on to say: Further, there may be instances where, by working together on the kinds of information required, the agencies can better understand the ongoing needs of the PBO. The relationships between the PBO and Government agencies might also evolve over time, possibly leading to greater efficiencies and enhanced products for Senators, Members and committees. Essentially the opposition's approach is to create an adversarial, legislative relationship backed by criminal sanctions. By contrast, the government's approach is based on comprehensive understandings between the PBO and government agencies. Our approach will ensure that information is exchanged quickly and appropriately, in keeping with the unanimous recommendations of the joint select committee. The confidentiality of policy costings in the opposition's bill is unnecessary. The government's bill already provides for confidentiality of non-election costings. But the opposition's agenda is clear: they want to hide costings from the public at election time. We can understand why they would want to do this. Put yourself in their shoes, Mr Deputy Speaker. If at the last election you were out $11 billion, and currently you are behind $70 billion, why would you want to put more information about costings out into the public arena? The government bill distinguishes between policy costings during elections and those outside of the caretaker period for a general election. It will ensure that the election costing service of the PBO is transparent and consistent with similar be processes under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, with all costings, including details of the request, released publicly. This is a critical part of the election policy process. The public is entitled to know the cost of a party's policies. Talk should be cheap, but election costings are sometimes pretty expensive. Those who are putting forward ideas about where the country should go, those who are proposing changes in the tax system, should be subject to an independent and rigorous evaluation as to whether those costings really stack up. As the PBO function would fully replace the current option for the opposition to submit their costings to Treasury or the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the opposition bill effectively replaces a transparent process where costings are required to be public during an election, with a non-transparent process where costings can remain confidential. This is a step back in terms of accountability, scrutiny and transparency. It unwinds a core component of the principles of the Charter of Budget Honesty. In terms of the functions of the PBO, the joint select committee seriously considered this and unanimously recommended against it. This is about how the PBO can best serve members. The committee considered it and felt that it was not the best use of Parliamentary Budget Office resources and that it could detract from its ability to meet requests to members in terms of analysis, costings and providing information. The government bill provides the Parliamentary Budget Office with the capacity to rely on the economic and fiscal forecasts prepared by Treasury and Finance. The role for the two agencies is a long standing and critical role. It is a role which many of us in this House respect-though not, apparently, the member for Goldstein. It provides important framing for the annual budget and related documents prepared under the Charter of Budget Honesty. The Treasury and Finance submission noted the significant resources costing and expertise required to undertake forecasting and questioned the need for duplication of the task. The bill before us that the opposition is proposing is a nontransparent, black hole. (Time expired)",39
19,Ms SAFFIN,BILLS," I am speaking against the bill that the honourable member for North Sydney has put forward, the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011. In doing so, I will speak in some way in support of the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011-not directly, as it will be dealt with later, but in broad terms to address the whole framework-as to speak against the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill it is necessary to compare and contrast the two in some way. The only reason that I can see for the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill to be before the parliament now is to try to scuttle the PBO and the parliamentary budget officer bill. It seems to me that it is a bit reckless and that, worryingly, it looks as though it is more about hiding costings in election time than it is about budget honesty. There is government legislation in relation to the Parliamentary Budget Office, and the government has gone about establishing the Parliamentary Budget Office in a methodical way. A joint committee of the parliament was tasked to advise on the functions and resourcing of the Parliamentary Budget Office, and the recommendations that came from that committee were unanimous. When a parliamentary committee works through the processes, the tensions, the competing issues, the ideologies and the policy directions and comes to unanimous recommendations, we know that we have something that is able to be taken up by all. The government therefore accepted all the recommendations, as reflected in its legislation. Today we have the opposition, the coalition, ignoring the key recommendations of the committee. From everything I have read, it seems the opposition signed up to those recommendations only five months ago, and they are now walking away from them. It seems rather odd that they would do that. The member for North Sydney's private member's bill seeks to undermine what is an important institution, the Parliamentary Budget Office. The bill will weaken the government's arrangements, which seems a really odd thing to do. In establishing the Parliamentary Budget Office, we want to make sure that the governance framework and structure are as strong as they need to be. Introducing a bill that seeks to weaken that cannot be about anything to do with parliamentary budget honesty. The bill will make the Parliamentary Budget Office accountable to ministers and not the parliament. As parliamentarians and as people who come to this place with a whole range of views, one of the things we seek to do is have decisions accountable to the parliament. That is a good thing and it is a good for democracy. The honourable member for North Sydney's bill would also weaken the resourcing of the Parliamentary Budget Office-which also seems an odd approach-and would, critically, reduce transparency and public accountability. If the bill introduced by the honourable member for North Sydney seeks to weaken the government's arrangements, by changing the accountability mechanisms and making the PBO accountable to ministers and not the parliament, weaken the resourcing and, critically, reduce transparency and public accountability, I have to question what the bill is about. Again, I cannot get away from the idea that it is about trying to hide, trying to bury, election policy costings. We saw that happen at the last election. That was what the honourable member for North Sydney sought to do. Under the bill proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, the election policy costings can remain confidential and hidden from public view. This would be a major retreat from transparency. When we put our best foot forward and go out to win elections, we do not put out costings on policies and say, 'I'm sorry; they are confidential and the public doesn't have a right to know them.' That is not a good way to approach the electorates when seeking to get support. If you want to put up a policy, you cost it and then you make sure that those costings are sound and that you are happy to have them tested. That is why we come into this place-to have policies tested. This bill would unwind the Charter of Budget Honesty, and I cannot for the life of me think why the honourable member for North Sydney would want to do that unless it comes back to the election costings. Consistent with the recommendations of the joint committee, the government's bill proposes that the election costing process will be fully transparent and that all requests and costings made during a caretaker period are to be publicly released, as they should be and as is the case under the charter process. Members can of course seek confidential costings outside of the caretaker period for a general election. I note that the honourable member for North Sydney said something about that, but it is clear that that can happen now and that confidential costings can be sought outside the caretaker period for a general election. The bill that the honourable member for North Sydney has put forward does not distinguish between costings during caretaker and non-caretaker periods. In both periods, Parliamentary Budget Office costings could be entirely confidential. The Parliamentary Budget Office function would fully replace the current option for the opposition to submit their costings to Treasury or Finance under the charterreplacing a transparent process where costings are required to be public with a nontransparent process where costings can remain confidential. That is a massive backward step in terms of the transparency, scrutiny and accountability of policy costings during elections. Again, it unwinds the core component of the charter principles. When in government, the coalition itself argued for the importance of transparency and accountability when it brought in the Charter of Budget Honesty. In December 1996, the then Treasurer stated in the second reading speech to the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill: This is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will be a permanent feature, making sure that Australia's economic policy is run better, making sure that the public is kept better informed, making sure that there is transparency in economic policy in this country. Furthermore, the charter: … provides for more equal access to Treasury and Finance costings of election commitments by the government and the opposition during the caretaker period. This will allow the electorate to be better informed of the financial implications election commitments. That was said by the then Treasurer when the coalition were in government. Yet the bill that the honourable member for North Sydney has put before us seeks to unwind all of that. It will unwind the process of the parliament itself through the joint committee and the very sound recommendations that were accepted by all, including the government, and reflected in the legislation. The only conclusion I can come to is that this bill, the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011, is designed so that election policy costings can be kept secret, as they were by the opposition during the election. It is contrary to the Charter of Budget Honesty, which everyone has signed up to, and to the system that was introduced by the coalition when in government, based on transparency, accountability and scrutiny. We now have some of the same members of the coalition, now in opposition, wanting to reverse this and have secrecy. I have to ask: why does the honourable member for North Sydney want secrecy? Is it because he knows his figures just do not add up? That has been demonstrated over and over. If the honourable member for North Sydney had confidence in his costings, why wouldn'the stick with the charter principles?",41
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made in order of the day for a later hour of this day. NA Heavy Vehicle Regulation,43
21,Mr ZAPPIA,MOTIONS," I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the importance of the road transport industry to Australia's economy; of (2) notes that intergovernmental agreement on heavy vehicle regulatory reform was reached at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 19 August 2011; (3) acknowledges the significance of this agreement to Australia's road transport sector; and (4) commends the federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport for his work in bringing about this agreement. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Heavy Vehicle Regulatory Reform, reached at the Council of Australian Governments meeting of 19 August this year, is aimed at resolving a century of inconsistent regulatory practices between the states and territories which have constrained and frustrated transport business operating across our borders. The introduction of national laws and single national regulators for heavy vehicles, rail and maritime will generate a range of benefits for businesses. Elements of the agreement also aim to improve occupational safety in the industry by removing confusion and applying best practice across jurisdictions. Single national regulators also enable heavy-vehicle owners and operators to conduct business with government at one place-that is, there will be a 'one-stop shop' approach. For example, heavy vehicle registration renewals and access permits would be managed through a single contact point. The road transport industry is critical to Australia's economy. In Australia, our expansive land mass and dispersed city and regional populations require us to rely heavily on road transport. Whilst the Australian rail network is a valuable mode of transport, it is not sufficiently developed transport goods to all places, particularly between remote areas. I understand that the majority of goods are transported within Australia by road trains, a trucking concept used to transport goods, particularly in remote areas. Australian governments have invested substantial funds in developing good roads. As part of that investment, safety barriers and other safety features are of a high standard on new roads in Australia. It has not been a simple task nor a cheap one. The total network length of all public roads in Australia is over 810,000 km-it is the most expansive road network of all developed nations. Transport specific businesses contributed 4.63 per cent of total GDP in 2006-07. This amounted to $46.2 billion in 2005-06 prices. The transport sector provided 492,875 jobs, or 4.7 per cent of total employment in Australia, in 2007. Despite this, there are some troubling issues that need to be addressed in this sector. Around 20 per cent of workplace deaths in Australia occur in the trucking industry. Road transport results in around 300 deaths each year. Anything that can be done to address this situation should be urgently explored. The impact of deaths and serious injuries from road accidents inevitably flows on to family members, and will the economic costs to the nation are also significant. A report prepared by the Hon. Lance Wright QC and Professor Michael Quinlan for the National Transport Commission, released in 2008, asserted that the high level of control exercised by clients over price, timing, destination and route means that operators have to bear costs that are ordinarily borne by customers. They sometimes attempt to recover this cost by not paying truck drivers for all of the work performed and by paying them incentive rates. In a survey of truck drivers undertaken by the Transport Workers Union of Australia to two years ago, 64 per cent of respondents said that they had been pressured by their employers to use unsafe work practices. In the same survey, 29 per cent of respondents had been pressured into carrying illegal loads and 44 per cent had been pressured into driving excess hours, all of which obviously compromises the safety of truck drivers. Truck drivers are the people we rely upon to literally drive an industry that enables our economy to function. It would be trite to say that truckers can choose not to carry illegal loads and drive excess hours as employment is often conditional on compliance with an operator's direction and client deadlines. To meet such unreasonable demands, truckers often drive tired, exceed the speed limit, take drugs and cut costs on the maintenance of their vehicles. The survey I referred to showed that 56 per cent of respondents said that, due to economic pressures, they were forced to lower maintenance standards. Several academic and judicial reports have found a direct relationship between remuneration and safety outcomes, yet truck drivers continue to receive poor salaries for work that is a critical function of the economy and, indeed, of the nation. Reducing their overheads and time demands through simplified compliance standards will make their lives so much better, and the agreement is a step in the right direction. When the Australian Transport Council established a plan to reform the transport industry in 2008, one of the proposals was the establishment of the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Heavy Vehicle Regulatory Reform agreed to by COAG on 19 August will overhaul the existing outdated transport regulations. I note that Western Australia did not formally sign the Intergovernmental Agreement on Heavy Vehicle Regulatory Reform but expressed support for the reforms. I understand that the Western Australian minister wishes to consult with his government before Western Australia formally agrees to sign the heavy vehicle intergovernmental agreement. understand that national transport regulators should be in place for heavy vehicles by January 2013. The signing of the intergovernmental agreement represents a landmark economic reform through the establishment of national standards which, when complete, will significantly reduce the number of regulators. There are numerous inconsistencies between state road laws and regulations that hopefully will be addressed by this agreement, which will improve safety for Australian drivers. Earlier this year I raised private member's motion in this place about inconsistencies in our national road laws and the problems caused for all road users. The same applies with respect to the trucking industry. There are many examples that could be referred to which highlight the discrepancies between the regulations that apply from one state to another. In fact, on 22 August, in response to a question on this national issue by the member for Moreton, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport referred to the cartage of cattle and how the number of cattle allowed on a truck changes as soon as you cross a border. Similarly, there are discrepancies with respect to the number of hours a heavy vehicle driver can spend behind the wheel after a rest break. If you look across the country, from Queensland to New South Wales to Victoria and South Australia, you will find that there are different regulations with respect to the rest period required-again, causing all kinds of confusion to the drivers of those vehicles. The inconsistencies cause serious problems at times because, as you cross from one state to another, whilst you have complied with the law in one state you have not complied in the next, and that leaves you in a real quandary. I am sure other members will refer to many of the inconsistencies that currently exist which they are familiar with I also when they speak on this motion. These reforms are well past their time. The benefits to Australia's $61 billion transport industry that will come from the agreement will certainly be welcomed in terms of the additional productivity that will arise, as well as efficiency and safety outcomes. It is expected that the heavy vehicle regulator reforms alone will provide a $30 billion boost to the Australian economy over the next 20 years. That is a considerable amount of additional funds that will go into the Australian economy. The a industry will also see the harmonisation of laws across states and, again, that is something that will no doubt be welcomed by transport operators across the country. In closing, I commend the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. The agreement is long overdue and has been talked about for years and years. I am sure it has been lobbied for by the trucking industry around Australia. Makin's It would not have happened if some leadership had not been shown, and that leadership was shown by Minister Anthony Albanese in his discussions with the states and by finally bringing about the consistencies that have been called for for a long time. They will benefit not only the trucking industry in Australia but the whole Australian economy. I commend the minister for his actions.",43
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS, Is the motion seconded? Ms Saffin: I second the motion.,46
23,Mr CHESTER,MOTIONS," In rising to speak on the motion by the member for Makin, I commend the member for his ongoing advocacy, particularly in relation to road safety matters and transport issues more generally. Members on this side of the House also recognise the importance of the road transport industry to the Australian economy. Australia's trucking industry in particular is an incredibly important part of our economy, providing a vital statistical link between the community, Australian businesses and of course our agricultural sector. Australia's freight task is estimated to triple by 2050, from 503 billion tonne-kilometres to 1540 billion tonne-kilometres, with local demand for total freight movements increasing by as much as 60 per cent by 2020. As a member from a regional area, I am sure that you, Deputy Speaker Scott, like many other members in regional communities, well understand the importance of our road transport industry and challenges it faces. One particular challenge is the confusing regulatory regime which exists. The coalition acknowledges the significant benefits that can be achieved by harmonising the many conflicting and contradictory regulations in the heavy vehicle industry. It has been estimated-and I take up the member for comments-that harmonising regulations in this area has a potential total gain of $12.4 billion. The gains to be made, particularly in terms of productivity, are quite significant. It is fair to say that, over the years, state governments have failed to respond to the industry's needs and improve their efficiencies by implementing nationally consistent transport regulations. At the last election the federal coalition committed to pursuing regulatory harmonisation to build a truly national and seamless road freight sector. We understand the great importance of this task to the productivity of the Australian economy. Determining the appropriate parameters of such a detailed and overarching scheme, which is intended to have a broad scope, is extremely difficult and it is a necessity to ensure, through a very extensive consultation, that the right scheme is implemented and that any unintended consequences are avoided and handled quickly if they do arise. I understand, for example, that the Australian Trucking Association has identified 245 issues in the draft regulations that it would like to see resolved prior to their complete introduction. I urge the government to continue to work with such key industry bodies. This government does not have a great record of listening to the people on the ground. I urge the government in this circumstance to actually listen to the people on the ground who are dealing with these issues on a daily basis. However, we support the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator and efforts to deliver productivity improvements and the potential to cut red tape, remove inconsistencies which currently existobviously to save money for the operators involved-and reduce the confusion that currently exists throughout the heavy vehicle industry. In the time that I have available to me I would also like to make some more general comments about heavy vehicles and the issue of road safety, which the member for Makin also touched on. This year the federal government released its 10-year National Road Safety Strategy. As with all such strategies the true test will be in its implementation. The strategy sets a target to reduce the annual number of deaths and serious injuries on Australian roads by at least 30 per cent. I think both sides of the chamber would acknowledge that, while that is an ambitious target, it does recognise that advertising there are many severe road crashes which are preventable in our community. I am sure there are members on both sides of the House who are committed to the task of reducing the incidence of road trauma in our community. Australia has a long and quite proud history of continually improving its road safety record-from historic legislation making it compulsory to wear seatbelts through to programs which have targeted drink-driving, speeding and other aspects of driver behaviour. Road crashes still cause 1,400 deaths and 32,500 serious injuries each year across Australia. The social and economic impacts are obviously devastating, and there would not be anyone in the Australian community who has not been touched by the consequences of road trauma. I welcome the government's development, in conjunction with various organisations, of a National Road Safety Strategy for the next 10 years and acknowledge the importance that the heavy vehicle sector will play in achieving the desired outcomes I just referred to. I think one of the key issueswhich is not often understood-about working to reduce road trauma is the importance of investing in infrastructure to improve the safety of the road environment itself. It has been said in the past that providing for a safer road environment has the potential to save more lives than improved driver behaviour and enforcement measures put together. It is an important point to remember when we talk about issues of road safety. Investing in safer vehicles has had some very significant impacts, particularly in reducing the severity of accidents. The road enforcement measures right across Australia are a given. We have various road blitzes by state jurisdictions, and there are community information and campaigns initiated by governments across Australia which have been very successful in targeting improved driver behaviour. They all have an important role to play. There will be no simple solution to driving down the road trauma in our nation. We need to acknowledge that humans will always make mistakes and we need to provide a transport system that is more accommodating of these mistakes. I think that is one of the most critical points in reducing road trauma-particularly in our regional communities, where the incidents on country roads tend to involve higher speeds and where the potential for severe injuries and deaths is heightened. There are infrastructure improvements which can have a major affect on reducing crashes. I believe it is up to governments of all levels to continue to invest in improving the road conditions, to work closely with industry and to consult with local communities to identify potential accident black spots. The investment will pay a long-term dividend not only in the economic sense but also in the social sense with reduced trauma in our communities. There are a wide range of road treatments and road designs which need to specifically consider the needs of all road users, particularly the heavy vehicle industry that we are taking about today. Things like wider shoulder treatments, the tactile road edges and even the design aspects of curves, which accommodate the larger vehicles on our roads, are all very important issues which require substantial and ongoing investment right across our nation. In addition to those various road treatments, another key safety matter which sometimes escapes much public attention but is particularly relevant to our heavy vehicle operators is the need for investment in our roadside rest areas. Under the transport policy which the Nationals advocated at the last election we made a commitment in conjunction with our coalition partners to fund 500 new roadside stops for truck drivers. We understand that the nation's truck drivers are facing mandated rest breaks as a result of the heavy vehicle driver fatigue reforms and that there is a need for adequate roadside rest points. It is becoming increasingly important for the safety of drivers. I am disappointed that Labor's current $70 million Heavy Vehicle Safety Strategy and productivity package is simply not going to go far enough to bring Australia's national highways close to meeting the National Transport Council guidelines. Labor's funding for truck rest stops is simply not going to be enough to achieve this goal. In fact, the funding for the current 2011-12 financial year has already been fully exhausted. The government has a long way to go in this regard. It is all very well to about the heavy vehicle industry and its support, but when it comes to delivering these services and facilities on the ground the government still has some challenges it needs to meet. The coalition, to its credit, has promised to build an additional 500 roadside stops over the next 10 years at an approximate cost of $300 million to bring the 22,500 kilometres of Australia's national highways into broad compliance with the National Transport Commission guidelines. This is an issue which the Australian Trucking Association recognised in its submission to the National Road Safety Strategy earlier this year. I quote from the ATA's contribution in relation to rest areas. It says: Appropriate rest areas, with shade, amenities and minimal noise allow drivers to comply with fatigue regulations. The Austroads' Audit of Rest Areas against National Guidelines, shows the quantity and quality of rest areas are below national standards. This is a symptom of planning and funding problems. …… … A further problem is the removal of existing rest areas. Rest areas that are temporarily removed due to capital works should be immediately replaced. New road planning that expects significant heavy vehicle traffic should include rest area facilities. It is an important bit of feedback from the industry and something the government should take on board. In conclusion, I briefly mention that I had a recent meeting in Lakes Entrance, in my electorate, with representatives from the South East Australian Transport Strategy. I commend the SEATS members for their ongoing advocacy work on behalf of their respective communities. They are taking very much a holistic view of the transport needs of their region. One of the key focuses of their work is the need to upgrade the talk Princes Highway in south-east Australia. This, as a policy position, is very close to my heart; it is also close to the hearts of many thousands of Gippslanders who have signed petitions, written letters and supported my efforts in this place. It is an issue that I have raised with the current Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and will continue to raise in the interests of road safety for all road users.",46
24,Ms SAFFIN,MOTIONS," I speak in support of the motion put forward by the honourable member for Makin, and I do so because the Intergovernmental Agreement on Heavy Vehicle Regulatory Reform at COAG in 2011 is an historic agreement that has been reached. I commend the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport for the really good work that he has done to get to this agreement. Road safety is an issue that has dogged the heavy vehicle industry in Australia for a long time, and everybody at meetings at state, territory and federal would agree: 'Yes, we have to fix it. Yes, we have to act on it.' But everybody would go home, and it would not always bear fruit. This time it has; hence my commendation. This agreement peels back inconsistencies across jurisdictions that seem incomprehensible to some. We live in a federation, so these inconsistencies grow up, but they cost money and time. The agreement will cut the number of transport regulators operating across Australia from 23 to three. The benefits to our national productivity are clear beyond dispute-it will boost national income by up to $30 billion over the next 20 years. It seems incomprehensible that these things have gone on for so long at such cost to our national income. It will also cut the burden of red tape on our $61 billion transport industry. I know there are issues to work through. Yes, there is extensive consultation being undertaken; but everyone is at the table and everyone is agreed that this has not come before time. Heavy vehicle operators will not have eight separate regulatory regimes-one in each state and territory-and their associated rules to deal with, and that will lead to increased productivity and efficiency for the operators. It is an issue that is frequently talked about at many levels in my electorate. I will give an example of a case study of the inconsistencies across jurisdictions. It relates to my area. A livestock carrier transporting cattle from Queensland to a station just inside the New South Wales border faces the prospect of unloading some cattle at the border onto a second truck to complete the journey to ensure that the vehicle meets the lower mass limits in New South Wales. Not only is this inefficient but it also unduly stresses the livestock and adds significantly to cost. There are two big imposts there. One levels is cost, which everybody, naturally and understandably, is always looking to save. There is also the animal welfare issue. An Australian Lot Feeders' Association survey identified costs of $4 to $9 per head in additional freight and carcass value losses over a trip from the Victoria to Queensland border. I know what this means in New South Wales and Queensland because of the agriculture industry in my area. A few months back we had discussions at the Northern Meat Co-operative Meat Company, the meat works in Casino, and Michael Deegan was there with a group of other people having discussions on this very issue. This was before the agreement came into place. They were talking about how it would be good if we got to an agreement so that these issues could be dealt with. It is like, 'Hallelujah-it's here and they can be dealt with.' I know it will take time, but it will be such a significant boost to our national income to cut the burden of red tape that I talked about. Heavy vehicle operators will not have nine separate regulatory regimes to deal with, and that will make such a difference to how heavy vehicle operators are able to get about and do their work. There are a whole range of areas, but in the few seconds I have left I cannot go through them all. Heavy vehicle driver fatigue, counting time, access, oversize loads, log books, multiple dealings and onestop shops will all be dealt with. (Time expired)",49
25,Ms MARINO,MOTIONS," The harmonisation of regulations, as we have heard today, is important to driving practical productivity and road safety improvements. However, the member for Makin's commendation of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport may well be premature. I note that, in relation to the Intergovernmental Agreement on Heavy Vehicle Regulatory Reform, in the 19 August communique, COAG stated that Western Australia did not formally sign the agreement but expressed support for these reforms. Subject to its concerns being addressed, Western Australia will sign the Intergovernmental Agreement on Heavy Vehicle Regulatory Reform. So there are concerns still there and more consultation is required. The Australian Association also said the same thing: that it did not support mass-distance-location pricing for myriad reasons. Today we have heard there are 245 issues. However, I agree that the road transport industry and road safety issues are critical to the Australian economy and in particular to regional and rural Australia. This is why I will move the following amendment: That the following words be inserted: (5) condemns the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and the Gillard Government for its introduction of a carbon tax on transport fuel.",50
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS, Is the amendment seconded?,50
27,Mr Wyatt,MOTIONS,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,50
28,Ms MARINO,MOTIONS,"As we know, one of the biggest issues that has been raised here is the issue of driver safety and issues in regional areas. We do know that the carbon tax will have a significant impact on transport costs across Australia, and that it is a major threat to the economic development of regional areas. It will apply to road, and, in particular, to truck transport from 2014. Every vehicle and every product to be received and transported will have to pay the cost of this tax. These imposts will mean higher costs and greater impacts in regional areas. In addition, the government's proposal to slash the fuel tax credits for heavy vehicles by almost 7 cents a litre from July 2014 will cost the industry and its customers. I am very concerned about owner operators, owner drivers and those who are working on very finite margins right now. We know of the distances and we know the east to west route. I know that the member for Hasluck is aware that it could cost $3,000 to transport a load from east to west and probably another $2,800 from Perth through to Kununurra. There are going to be some major costs Trucking associated with this. The additional cost is going to compound for regional Australia and increase the impact of road freight transport costs. It is how that comes back to the individual trucking owner operators and, again, how that may or may not be passed on to families and consumers that is the issue. The additional costs will be felt by all of those in the industry. I know that there are so many of them who are working on very finite margins and that this is a major issue for rural and regional Australia. Basically, everything that you eat, drink, use or do in regional Australia comes from the back of a truck. Any increase to the costs is going to have a flow on not only to the individual trucking enterprise but also to individuals, families and communities right across this nation. With the additional cost that is going to be borne I am concerned that in this latest round of Regional Development Australia funding there was no funding for roads in my electorate at all. I do know that the carbon tax will add to the cost of producing those roads in rural and regional areas. This is going to be a compounding cost; I am very concerned about the issues in relation to the economics, the practical issues, and the road safety issues. Any additional cost to the trucking industry and to the individual owners and drivers either has to be absorbed by them because it is such a competitive market or passed on by them to consumers. I am concerned about the road safety issues that go with this and the impact on the families and those who are involved in this industry. They deliver produce right around Australia on a daily basis; they do it very, very well. This country cannot do without the road transport sector, and I support their efforts for Australia. (Time expired)",50
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS," As the member's amendment is not in writing, signed and on the table, she leaves me in a precarious situation. I will advise that for an amendment to be considered it should be before the House so that everyone can actually read it. You cannot just spring it; it actually has to be in writing, signed and on the table. I will leave it with the clerks to determine how to go forward, but the common courtesy and the procedure is that it is on the table at the",51
30,Mr NEUMANN,MOTIONS," I just heard the member for Forrest, and the point of the matter is that the Regional Development Australia funding process is opposed hand over fist by the coalition. The roads funding which she alluded to in her speech is dealt with in the nation building and the budget processes. But those opposite have voted against every road-funding project in South-East Queensland in the last term of parliament-everything from the Ipswich Motorway to the Blacksoil Interchange. They did not support the funding for that, for the nation building roads or for the Warrego Highway funding. The member for Forrest can talk about road funding, but the coalition is opposed to it. We have doubled the road funding that is so important to the trucking industry in South-East Queensland; $8.5 billion in road, rail and port infrastructure is more than double what the previous coalition government contributed. One of the things about Australian politics is that it behoves Labor governments to make amendments to a seamless national economy: to get rid of the oddities and the stupid things that we see in terms of federation in this country. There is the eccentricity of the dingo fence, which provides such an embarrassment and an obstacle to a seamless economy. The federal minister for transport and infrastructure should actually be commended for the work he has done. In the last couple of years I attended the Australian Trucking Association meeting at the Gold Coast, where I represented the minister. One of the things said over lunch in private discussions that I had was about the trouble that the Australian Trucking Association had with bureaucracy, red tape and difficulties in going between Queensland and New South Wales. I have five meat time. works in my electorate in my home state of Queensland-and, as the member for Page said, there is a difference between how many cattle you can put on a truck in Queensland and how many you can put on a truck in New South Wales. I know from speaking to meat works, farmers and people in the trucking industry in my area how important this legislation will be and how important this COAG process will be. If you have cattle in Queensland-66 cattle on a truckand you get to the New South Wales border, where you are only allowed 60, you have to offload the beasts. These are stupid and really ridiculous differences in regulations between states. Whether it comes to business names, to a national competition policy, to national consumer and competition situations or to trade practices legislation in the 1970s under the Whitlam government, it behoves a Labor government always to support business and small business in this economy and to support the operation of the national economy. The Australian Trucking Association is not primarily made up of really big players, such as Linfox and the other big trucking associations; its members are often owner-operators. We cannot get produce-whether it is cattle, coal, food or clothing-across the country without the trucking association and the trucks. One of the saddest things that I have seen in my time as a federal member was dealing with Lights on the Hill, the memorial in Gatton, which used to be in my electorate and is now in the electorate of Wright. I had dealings with Kathy White; Garry, her husband; Dionne, her daughter; and all those people associated with the Australian Trucking Association, and the coach drivers as well. The road deaths of the people commemorated by the memorial are such a tragedy. One of the things about this motion moved by the member for Makin is how he has stressed the importance of the road transport industry to the Australian economy-and it is important. We cannot get that produce and those things to the markets-you cannot take things from the Brisbane Valley and the Lockyer Valley to the markets at Rocklea-without trucks run by owner-operators. You see big entities like Nolan's in the Lockyer Valley, for example, but you also see others who run trucks. We are making a big difference here, and this will boost the national economy by $30 billion in the next 20 years. Cutting red tape will make a difference, and those opposite have constantly frustrated us. Even today, with a historic agreement made between Labor and Liberal governments at different levels, those opposite still have to politicise this. They cannot accept that Labor governments have a legitimate right to exist and to reform. We are reforming the economy. This is a very, very important measure that will improve efficiency, effectiveness and productivity in the economy. It will make a big difference to safety. It will also make a big difference to time, taking people off the road. It will make a big difference when people cross borders, because sitting there at the borders doing paperwork and red tape and dealing with those issues makes a difference to the lives of people. I support the motion. (Time expired)",51
31,Mr TEHAN,MOTIONS," I rise to support the first three parts of this motion. I cannot, sadly, support the fourth, which says 'commends the federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport for his work in bringing about this agreement', because, sadly, he has failed to put any money where his mouth is as transport minister, and regional and rural Australia, in particular, is suffering as a result. But I acknowledge the importance of the road transport industry to Australia's economy, note that the heavy vehicle regulator intergovernmental agreement was reached at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 19 August 2011 and acknowledge the significance of the heavy vehicle regulator intergovernmental agreement to Australia's road transport sector-although there is still a little bit to be worked out when it comes to finalising the agreement. Australia's trucking industry is incredibly important to our economy, and nowhere can it be as important as in the electorate of Wannon, where we have the port of Portland and the freight task in delivering our goods in our electorate to the port of Portland, which handles 25 per cent of Australia's dairy products and 17 per cent of Australia's plantation forestry and wood processing. We have significant heavy mineral exploration, and those heavy minerals also go out through the port of Portland. One million tonnes of grain exports annually go out through the port of Portland, and 67,000 tonnes of livestock exports go out through the port of Portland. We also have aluminium heading out there. As a matter of fact, throughput and trade volumes through the port of Portland are projected to double to seven million tonnes in the next seven to eight years. It is great that we have this agreement and can talk about road safety, but if we do not have money to put into road and rail infrastructure there is going to be a deterioration in our roads and our rail infrastructure, and that is going to harm the Australian economy. That is why it was so disappointing that we did not get one cent more for road infrastructure in the last budget. The minister, sadly, has betrayed Australia's road and rail users. There was not one single cent of extra road funding. Mrs Griggs: Shame!",52
32,Mr TEHAN,MOTIONS,"It is a shame; it is an absolute shame because, while it is great to have the regulatory burden eased off our freight industries, it is also important that we continue to get proper funding into important road and rail infrastructure, and we have not seen that. The minister also stands condemned for what he has done with regard to the carbon tax. I support the honourable member for Forrest's amendment to the motion because the minister has shown quite clearly that he has no understanding of the impact the carbon tax will have on Australia's freight industries. As a matter of fact, I think one of the saddest things we saw in our last parliamentary sitting week was that the National Road Freighters Association had travelled from across the country to come and oppose the carbon tax and the minister arrogantly stood up in this place and called this Convoy of No Confidence a 'convoy of no consequence'. What arrogance! It shows how out of touch this minister is. So, while the states and the COAG process have delivered some regulatory reform, we have not seen from the minister any understanding of the importance of road and rail infrastructure. He will dismiss the highly important National Road Freighters Association as being irrelevant and of no consequence, even though they have come to him and said that his government's carbon tax will hurt this industry. He just dismisses that. When it comes to putting real money into road and rail infrastructure, what does he do? He fails to deliver one extra cent. It is so important, especially out in the regions, that we have the proper infrastructure so that we can get our goods to market and make sure that our families travel in a safe manner to and from school, to their sporting- (Time expired) Debate adjourned.

33,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, I present the following reports of the committee: Final reports of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform; Poker Machine Harm Reduction end Tax (Administration) Bill 2008, and Poker Machine (Reduced Losses-Interim Measures) Bill 2010. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",54
34,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-In regard to the Poker Machine (Reduced Losses-Interim Measures) Bill 2010, the committee has decided to discharge this inquiry given the work undertaken in this area for the committee's first inquiry into the design and of a mandatory precommitment system for electronic gaming machines. In regard to the Poker Machine Harm Reduction (Administration) Bill 2008, the committee has decided to discharge this inquiry given the previous inquiry conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and the bill's dependence on further legislation which has not yet been introduced. National Broadband Network Committee Report",54
35,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network-First Report. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",55
36,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Through its first six-monthly review, the committee broadly considered various issues arising from the NBN rollout, including competition issues arising from the establishment, operation and pricing of the NBN and the impact of access, service delivery and economic development on regional and remote Australians with a focus on Broken Hill and the surrounding region. The committee also briefly examined the binding definitive agreements between NBN Co. and Telstra and NBN Co. and Optus. The political debate around the NBN is obscuring the fact that the NBN once built will be an asset in the financial books of the taxpayer. An initial spend on any assetanything from a house to business investment- can lead to a much larger return in the future if the asset is built efficiently and effectively and if private equity is engaged in the right way at the right time. With that in mind, this report flags the committee will be exploring this matter further-that is, the committee will seek to Tax satisfy itself about the government's view of where the points of entry are for private investment alongside public investment and to make sure maximum return on the government's investment is secured on behalf of Australian taxpayers. In terms of performance scrutiny, if the committee is to properly provide parliamentary oversight of the NBN, it needs to have at hand some agreed key performance indicators and measures to examine. The committee was expecting to have received in-depth NBN rollout performance information by its mandated reporting date so that it could report against them. However, on 7 July 2011, the shareholder ministers wrote to the committee advising that these performance measures would be provided by mid-September 2011. This timing is unfortunate because it means the committee is unable to report against NBN rollout performance in its first report. Some committee members, arguing the committee is akin to a board of directors, were keen for the committee to be given quarterly or monthly reports from NBN Co. The majority of committee members, however, recognised that the committee is not a board of directors, that its parliamentary oversight role is broader and that, as its reporting requirements are twice yearly, performance measures reported by NBN Co. should be likewise. A final theme to emerge in the evidence received to date is the question of just how NBN-ready government and its agencies are. This was also a key theme of the recent report, titled Broadening the debate, about the role and potential of the NBN by the House Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications. This committee agrees with its infrastructure and communications that committee colleagues on this consideration and urges government to consider both reports with that in mind. While the focus many has been on the nine-year complex engineering build of the NBN or on the size of the capital expenditure for the NBN, a number of critical secondary policy considerations need to be prioritised by the government for the NBN to deliver maximum value. Many of these were addressed in the infrastructure and communications committee's report and will continue to be pursued by this committee. These include issues such as: Australian content and copyright law, individual privacy and national security, taxation administration, government use of the internet generally, and timely and relevant data collection opportunities that now present themselves. Taking into consideration these findings, in its first report the committee made five recommendations: (1) the government and the NBN Co. provide the committee with NBN rollout progress reports every six months, no later than three months before the committee is due to report to the parliament; (2) government agencies take preparatory measures for receiving and working with the NBN so that there is a streamlined transition for government service delivery with the introduction of the NBN; (3) the NBN Co. publish the impact on costs and timing of rollout of the National Broadband Network, taking into consideration any time delays from reaching a binding definitive agreement between NBN Co. and Telstra and between NBN Co. and Optus, including the time taken for the decision to increase the points of interconnect from 14 to 121 as determined by the ACCC; (4), and importantly, the government publish a detailed statement outlining the productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of the impact of the rollout of the NBN on competition at the wholesale and retail levels, including the impact of the Australian Competition and of Consumer Commission ruling to increase the points of interconnect; and (5) the government publish the time frames for the rollout of the NBN for regional and remote areas and investigate the impact of the transition from current technology to the NBN's satellite technology with the aim of negating any potential reduction in service, if applicable. The committee's resolution of appointment requires it to report once only this year, by 31 August 2011, which it did do out of session. Due to the full range of issues, including the many mentioned, the committee will again report to the parliament before the end of the year. Thereafter we intend to report in June and December on a six-monthly rotation and have asked for the resolution of appointment to be changed accordingly. The committee's second report will examine the agreed performance information pending from the government, further work on private sector engagement for the NBN in both the wholesale and retail sectors, workforce issues and the government's readiness for NBN. With several critical agreements due to be resolved in the coming months, such as the NBN Co. agreement with Telstra, which at this stage is expected to be considered by the Telstra shareholders on 18 October, the committee can also then examine these matters in more detail and report again at the end of the year. The Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network is one of the largest committees in Australian parliamentary history. Currently it has 57 participating and full voting members. This sizeable membership of the committee demonstrates the commitment of all parliamentary colleagues to better information communication technology for all Australians, as well as a high degree of political interest in the NBN more specifically. I thank all committee members for, above all else, focusing on Australia's need for speed in the development of ICT over and above all other policy or political considerations. I also thank the secretariat for its work to date on what is a very challenging public policy oversight role. I commend the report to the House. Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",55
37,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES," We have before the House the government's bill to establish a parliamentary budget office. There is funding in this year's budget for the PBO, but here we are in the middle of September, 2½ months after the start of the financial year, and we are only now about to debate and vote on the necessary legislation. The parliament will be incredibly fortunate if the PBO is up and running by the end of the year. Like everything else this government does, implementation is clearly not its strength. This bill has been a long time coming. I would suggest the government has only got to this point because the opposition introduced its own PBO bill. Establishing a PBO has been an objective of the coalition since 2007, when my colleague and friend the member for Wentworth announced coalition policy in this regard. In the last week of the winter sitting session, I flagged that I would introduce a private member's bill to establish the PBO and then followed up in the second week of the spring session by tabling my bill. That bill was debated in the House this morning after the second reading speech, but has yet to be brought to a vote, which will occur on Thursday. Therefore this place has two bills before it to establish a parliamentary budget office, but the two bills could not be more different. To illuminate the difference between the bills we need first to revisit the impetus for the creation of the PBO. The PBO is a key reform in ensuring transparency and integrity BILLS of budget and fiscal processes. It provides services to all MPs and senators. In particular it evens up the playing field between government and non-government 2011 members in their ability to scrutinise government policy and the impacts on the budget. It also evens up the playing field in the ability to assess and accurately cost policies, both before and during elections. It should be a body which has the power and resources to provide analysis of the budgetary impacts of government policy over the forward estimates and over longer time frames. To do this requires considerable powers to obtain information from government departments and agencies. It requires flexibility to perform whatever analysis it deems necessary. It also requires the resources to quickly assess and cost policies submitted by MPs and senators. Most importantly, it must be discrete; it must preserve the confidentiality of requests submitted by MPs and senators. It must allow requests on policies to be submitted, reviewed and, if necessary, resubmitted without going through an ongoing public debate. It must allow policies to be released at a time chosen by the relevant MP or senator. It must provide for policies not to be released at all if that is the decision of the relevant parliamentarian. My private member's bill for the establishment of the PBO does all of these things. The government's bill before us does not. The functions of the PBO under the government's bill are severely constrained. The bill states that the PBO cannot prepare economic forecasts or budget estimates. This is an odd restriction of powers. How, then, does the government expect the PBO to prepare longer term analysis of the impact of government policies on the budget? This restriction seems to conflict with the stated purpose of the PBO which is 'to inform the parliament' through 'analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implication of proposals'. This bill also restricts the PBO to using 'the economic forecasts and fiscal estimates contained in the most recent relevant reports released under the Charter of Budget Honesty'. In other words, the PBO can only use the economic and fiscal forecasts prepared by the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. That means it cannot use any third-party data or refer to that third-party data at crucial moments. My private member's bill provided for much greater latitude for the PBO to do the research it needed to satisfy its mandate. Only then can it provide an effective perspective on the longer term ramifications of government policies on the fiscal position. information Only then can it provide full and frank analysis of policy proposals put to it by members and senators. The government's bill provides the PBO with very limited powers to gather information. The PBO must enter into an agreement with relevant departments to determine what information they can get and when they can get it. So let us have a little look at how this process would work. The PBO will have to negotiate an arrangement with every single government department and agency from which it requires information. These departments and agencies will not be compelled to make these arrangements. The PBO will have no leverage to compel these arrangements to be made. It stands to reason that the arrangements which are finally made will be structured to be in the interests of the government departments and agencies, not in the interests of the PBO. So there will be no secondguessing. Therefore, if a department gets it wrong the PBO cannot dispute that because the PBO is not in a position to do its own independent analysis. For example, it is not in a position to analyse properly the information from the Reserve Bank about economic forecasts vis-a-vis the economic forecasts of the Treasury. How absurd is that! Obviously, under the government proposal there is a significant risk that the PBO will find itself hobbled in its ability to obtain information and documents that it needs to do its job. This is obviously an unsatisfactory state of affairs for a body which requires all the relevant information to enable the full and rigorous analysis of the budgetary implications of policies. My private member's bill provided the PBO with considerable powers to obtain from these government departments and agencies. These powers are based on the powers of the Auditor-General. They provide protections so that information of national security importance or cabinet-inconfidence would be protected. These greater powers to obtain information would render the PBO a much more effective body. An important function of the PBO will be to prepare costings of policies submitted by members and senators. This facility will be most beneficial to opposition MPs and senators, but also to the minor parties and Independents. I say to the minor parties and Independents: this is the chance to have a fully independent PBO available. We are providing that opportunity now. It may not come around again, but we are providing the opportunity to have an enduring, independent parliamentary budget office with guaranteed funding and guaranteed powers. Of course, what we are offering will also be available to members of the government. This is crucially important. It may be rued, should we get into government. We may rue the day that we gave backbenchers the power to independently fully cost policies, but is what our chambers should be doing and in my view this is appropriate policy. Backbenchers may choose to submit their ideas for costing well away from prying ministerial eyes. They may wish to get an idea costed to get more assurance of its validity before passing it up the line for consideration or releasing it to the general public within a particular policy framework. This function will be available during the normal course of the parliament and also, crucially, during the caretaker period and prior to a new government being formed. A curious feature of the government's bill is that the policy costing facility during caretaker period will differ to that which is available at all other times. There seems no valid reason for the difference. The standard policy costing function will be confidential unless otherwise indicated by the member or the senator outside of elections, but during election campaigns the function provided will be identical to that provided to the opposition under the existing Charter of Budget Honesty. The Charter of Budget Honesty was put in place by the coalition when it was in government. While the charter was groundbreaking and excellent reform, I believe that the policy costing functions could be made even better. The current process provided under the charter is totally non-confidential. Requests for costings are immediately published on the websites of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation, and the results of the costings exercise are also immediately published on the websites. This leads to a number of issues. The first is that non-government parties cannot get costings done and then choose the time when policies will be released to the public. That is why, primarily, it was not used by Labor when they were in opposition. this The second is that the non-government parties cannot change their minds and choose not to release policies without that reconsideration being public. There is no facility for testing the cost of a range of policies and then choosing which ones will be policy undertakings for public release. The third is that there is no right of consultation or review with the departments. There cannot be any discussion about the assumptions the departments are using. Their view is the final word. We know in government that it is not the final word. The assumption is that a political party will put forward policies on the basis that they will the be able to implement them when in government. My private member's bill provides for all requests to the PBO, for policy costing or other purposes, to be fully confidential at the request of the member or senator. This gives members and senators total control over the working-up of their policy ideas and the release to the general public. These issues should hit a bit of accord with the Labor Party and the Greens. During the Senate debate on the coalition government's Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, Senator Nick Sherry, who was then Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, commented: The pre-election costings regime is … deficient in a number of respects … Only costings of previously announced policies is allowed-that is, policy decisions would have to be made on the basis of incomplete information announced. Yes, we agree. Senator Bob commented: I will be moving to amend the Democrat amendments so that all participants in elections can avail themselves of having their policies vetted. I agree. In 1997 the Senate passed 10 amendments to the charter which included: allowing the Leader of the Opposition to submit all opposition policies for costing, including those not publicly announced; requiring that information provided by the opposition to responsible departmental secretaries not to be released to third parties without the approval of the Leader of the Opposition; requiring policy costings to show what assumptions have been used in the costing process; and explaining the limitations of the process adopted in the assumptions employed. I trust that the Labor Party and the Greens hold the same view today as they did thenbut, of course, they do not. They have a different view today. Of course, the coalition had a different view then-it was under the Charter of Budget Honesty. That is why the proper format, which we have identified, is a parliamentary budget office for this process. The then Treasurer, Peter Costello, was right to say in the debate that Treasury and the department of finance are not research arms for the opposition; they are in fact there to serve the government. That is exactly our point: they are there to serve the government of the day. Immediately after the last election campaign, when they did their analysis on our proposed policies, they were serving the government of the day in that context, and that is absolutely appropriate and right. MPs who are not part of the government are at and be this stage only the coalition. The Greens and the Independents have these regular meetings Brown with Treasury, and Treasury actually serve their interests in undertaking policy analysis and costings at their request. The Treasury are serving the Independents and the Greens but they are not serving the interests of the rest of the parliament. They are serving their masters, the government. That was the same under us, and that is entirely appropriate. So we are saying, 'Hang on, if you want to have a parliamentary budget office, it has to quack like a duck and behave like a duck,' and in many ways the Parliamentary Budget Office fulfils the key functions to the Treasury and the department of finance in relation to fiscal policy, in providing advice to the rest of parliament. I would think if Labor went into opposition one day they would rue the day that they did not support our bill ahead of their own. They will rue that day. So there are a number of issues at play. I indicated this morning in this place that the provision of a confidential service for costing policies is a crucial and nonnegotiable element of my bill. I will propose amendments to this government bill to put in place an equivalent confidential costing service. The failure to achieve such a facility will render the Parliamentary Budget Office useless. The policy costing service will be no different under that scenario to that now offered under the Charter of Budget Honesty. Accordingly, should my amendments fail to pass and the government's poor imitation of a costing service pass this place, the coalition will not submit its policy costings to either the Treasury or the Parliamentary Budget Office prior to the election. We will ask the Australian people to form a view on our policies as they stand. It is curious that the government's bill maintains the policy costing provisions of the Charter of Budget Honesty while creating a comparable facility under the Parliamentary Budget Office-they are just duplicating it. This leads us to a situation where there are two essentially identical avenues for costing policies during the caretaker period available to nongovernment parties and Independents. I recognise that this is consistent with the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office, which envisaged the caretaker period costing services would run in parallel. However, on reflection, I and my coalition colleagues believe that the members of the committee would see the potential for duplication and unnecessary cost. The government's bill specifically prevents double-dipping-that is, getting the same policies costed both through the PBO and through the charter. This is not the best resolution for this duplication. It would be better to focus public sector resources on just one avenue for costing policies during the caretaker period. The government uses the Treasury and the department of finance, and the opposition, together with other members of parliament, uses the Parliamentary Budget Office. This range of issues leave the government's bill deeply flawed. The coalition believes the bill before the House today is inadequate. Our preference is to oppose this bill and to seek to have our own bill passed in its place. However, naturally enough, we do not control the timing of the votes on legislation; that is the government's prerogative. The government has brought its bill to the House for a vote before ours, even though it introduced its bill to this House after ours. I will propose a series of amendments during the consideration in detail stage to address the flaws and to create a PBO that will better meet the requirements of the parliament. I ask that the government and the Independents consider these amendments in good faith. I also ask that the government and the Independents consider the merits of the two alternative bills. I really do believe that my private member's bill better reflects the needs of the parliament with respect to the establishment of a PBO and that it represents a more far-reaching improvement in the management of the government's finances. The establishment and management of a PBO is a key step in the enhancement of the quality of fiscal management and discussion. It is important that we get it right. The government's bill misses the mark in establishing a truly independent PBO which would have the powers that it needs to do its job. We are offering this House the chance to have truly landmark legislation in relation to a parliamentary budget office. Members should not assume that this will be a continuing, ongoing commitment. We offer this in good faith. Should the government, in partnership with the Independents, reject our submission, then I say again: we will not be party to a process that does not allow for a fair-dinkum discussion in relation to fiscal management. Should we be elected into government, we reserve our right to take a different approach to the Parliamentary Budget Office. Under our bill, the Parliamentary Budget Office would be powerful, it would be critical of governments-and, should we go into government, it would be critical of us. We are not afraid of economic scrutiny, we are not afraid of fiscal scrutiny and we are not afraid of criticism. But we are not going to set up a white elephant that simply duplicates the existing unsatisfactory arrangements. Therefore, this is a unique opportunity to get it right. I hope the Independents understand that and support our bill in preference to that of the government.",57
38,Ms BRODTMANN,COMMITTEES," It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak on this bill that will greatly enhance the transparency and accountability of this parliament and its members. This bill does hit the mark. It best reflects the needs of the parliament and it best serves the needs of the Australian people. The Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011 will establish the Parliamentary Budget Office as a fourth parliamentary department and will establish the Parliamentary Budget Officer as an independent office of the parliament. It will mandate that the PBO will inform parliament by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budgetary cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals; it will establish the function by which the PBO will respond to policy costing requests from members and senators in a confidential manner-and I will come to more of that later-outside of the caretaker period and in a manner consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty during that period; and it will enable the officer to make arrangements for access to information from other government agencies. This bill amends other acts to enable the establishment of the office. It follows the report of the inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office. The government has agreed to all 28 recommendations of the inquiry, the first of which is that the government establish such an office. The purpose of this office will be to provide independent analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals. The committee's report states: In attempting to deal with these issuesin terms of budget cyclesmany countries have found that existing parliamentary institutions have limited resources to undertake a high level of analysis on fiscal matters. To satisfy a need for greater support, many parliaments have established specialist research and analytical units such as Parliamentary Budget Offices (PBOs) which are independent from government to varying degrees and which assist parliamentarians in their consideration of government finances and expenditure. It goes on to say: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has observed that in recent years, there is an international trend in establishing specialist budget research units. The OECD stated: The growth of bodies to assist the legislature in budgetary matters is a strong trend in OECD countries. They take a variety of forms but their raison d'être is the same: Parliaments need specialised resources in order to carry out their constitutional responsibilities vis-à-vis the budget. The functions of such bodies include economic forecasts, baseline estimates, cost estimation, analysis of the Executive's budget proposals and medium-term analysis. As such, they have the potential to improve transparency and enhance the credibility of the Government's Budget and public finances in general. The office will respond to requests from senators and members of this House to ensure that all have access to high-quality information and analysis. I am particularly heartened that this bill will amend the Charter of Budget Honesty so that all parties with at least five members will be able to request election costings from Treasury and Finance under the charter. Currently this service is afforded only to the government and the opposition. Access to this information by members will give an incredible degree of transparency and accountability for the Australian public . It is a matter of key importance. Quite rightly, the issue of good financial management has become a central issue in the public policy debates of this country. As the inquiry noted, in the rationale for the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office, 'in Australia and internationally there has been a growing trend in examining and questioning the adequacy of fiscal management'. I believe it is appropriate that this examination continue and be enhanced through good and accurate fiscal and budgetary analysis. It is appropriate that the government of the day, its alternative on the opposition benches and those on the crossbenches have access to the best information to inform their proposals and that they be held to account for the financial impacts of those proposals. Over the last few decades there has been an unstoppable trend of reform in this area. We have seen the establishment of the National Commission of Audit and the enactment of the Charter of Budget Honesty in 1988. There have also been the reforms under the government's Operation Starlight agenda to improve the transparency of public sector budgeting. These have been landmark reforms to ensure that there is transparency in the budget and the fiscal decisions of government. It has meant an increase in the ability of the Australian public to examine the economic management of its government and to have confidence that they know how their money is being spent. However, there is more that can and should be done, and there remains a need to further enhance the ability of senators and members and, through them, the Australian people to get advice on budgetary matters. As the inquiry noted: Despite the reforms to Budget reporting and the detail of information published in the Budget Papers and other statements and reports, submissions have raised concerns about the ability of Parliament to effectively discharge its responsibilities in relation to the Budget and financial matters. This legislation will be another step in addressing the concerns of the inquiry and in enhancing the transparency of financial information. Perhaps the most significant area that this bill will amend will be to ensure that opposition members and crossbenchers will have the ability to have their policy proposals costed by this office, the PBO. Under this bill, election policy costings can be provided by either the PBO or Treasury and Finance. As is appropriate for election costings and proposals, they will be released publicly to ensure that the Australian people are appropriately and comprehensively informed about the true costs of policy agendas and the proposals being made by all members of this parliament. This would have been particularly useful and informative during the last election, where we saw those opposite campaign on their supposed strong economic credentials while at the same time hoping to avoid the questions about where they would get the money for their proposals. They refused to have their promises costed and they refused to reveal their assumptions or any details when they had an accounting firm cost them. It was not until the conclusion of the election, at the request of members of the crossbenches, that the true nature of the opposition's policies was revealed. Only then was it revealed that their election commitments had an $11 billion black hole. Since then it has blown out to a $70 billion black hole, with no end in sight and no clear goal of how they will fix this massive gap in their spending. That is the equivalent of stopping Medicare payments for four years or stopping the age pension for two years. The only statements that we get from the other alternative Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, is for this country to obliterate entire government departments and to sack thousands of my constituents. As I have said time and again in this House, the coalition have form on this. In 1996, the Howard government sacked 12,000 public servants in Canberra and 30,000 nationwide. That sent Canberra into a recession when the rest of Australia was growing. Perhaps with the establishment of this office he can receive the advice he needs to understand that the Public Service has not grown by over 20,000 but has grown by less than half that and is the same size it was 20 years ago. Maybe then he will stop the attacks on the Public Service. Perhaps then he would not need to front the media and openly, outrageously and irresponsibly declare that he would love to sack 12,000 public servants, many of them Canberrans, and fail to provide any further detail of how this would occur. Perhaps then the people of this country could have faith that those opposite would have access to information that meant that they could understand the budget and understand the economy and not need to resort to scaremongering and just plain falsehoods to sell their message. Their bill this morning was more of the same. While they came into this place and talked the talk about the need for transparency, openness and accountability, they failed to walk the walk. They sought to replace the openness of Treasury costings during elections with a closed processenshrining into legislation the secrecy for which they became known during the last election. And to justify this change, they continue with their outrageous attack on the expertise and professionalism of the Australian Public Service, in particular Finance and Treasury. There are two elements that I would like to pick up that the member for North Sydney mentioned in terms of his proposals for amendments. The first was this notion of confidentiality. I just want to clarify that government bill already provides for confidentiality of non-election costings. It distinguishes between policy costings during elections and those done outside the caretaker period for a general election. It ensures that the election costing service of the PBO will be fully transparent and consistent with similar processes under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act. So, in terms of confidentiality, I cannot understand the concerns of the member for North Sydney. He also raised concerns about access to information. The government bill does allow the PBO to access information from Australian government agencies through a negotiated MOU in circumstances where the release of information is consistent with other legislative requirements. The committee talked about this during the inquiry. This access to information approach is consistent with the recommendations of the committee. The committee favoured an MOU over compulsion to provide information, on the grounds that it would facilitate more productive working relations between the office and government agencies. The approach that we have proposed in this bill is for a cooperative approach, as opposed to the adversarial approach that is being proposed by those opposite. The government considers it crucial that the PBO's relationships with government agencies should be cooperative, cohesive, productive and constructive. This bill does enhance the transparency and accountability of parliament. It does best reflect the needs of parliament. It does best reflect the needs of the Australian people. It does best serve the needs of the Australian people. It gives every member of this chamber and of the Senate access to appropriate analysis to ensure that everyone is properly informed and can debate the issues of this country correctly and the truthfully. I commend the bill to the House.",62
39,Mr ROBB,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak today on the Parliamentary Services Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Parliamentary Services Act 1999 to establish a Parliamentary Budget Office and position of Parliamentary Budget Officer. This was a commitment made by the government to help woo the Independents and the Greens. It is a concept-a concept, I say, in particular: not necessarily a structure, but a conceptlifted straight from coalition policy which was first canvassed in May 2009, when the member for Wentworth called for the creation of a parliamentary budget office in keeping with the US Congressional Budget Office. The entity that would be created by this bill, sadly, ain't no Congressional Budget Office. In fact, the government would save a lot of time and effort by simply supporting the bills introduced by the member for North Sydney. Those amendments provide for a responsive and flexible parliamentary budget office that will perform a range of important functions as required, including, of course, costing policy. Perhaps most importantly, the services provided under the coalition model would be totally discreet and confidential. Instead, this bill before the House has all the look of a token effort, with many restrictions and shortcomings, perhaps intentionally so. It is, in fact, hard to believe that it has the government more than 12 months to get the Parliamentary Budget Office to this stage. I cannot stress enough how critical the establishment of a proper parliamentary budget office is. We saw the highly unfortunate charade and preoccupation by this government at the last election of misrepresentation of so much of what we put before the public. We all remember the grubby way this government grossly politicised and abused the costings process during and after the 2010 election. We all remember the pathetic leak during the campaign of supposedly confidential Treasury analysis of the coalition's $2.4 billion savings measure associated with scrapping the NBN. We all remember how the Australian Federal Police were called into investigate that leak, which so obviously had that lightweight embarrassment of a Treasurer's fingerprints all over it. The leak was bad enough, but what made it worse was the way in which inaccurate, and later totally discredited, Treasury assumptions were used to discredit our savings measure. The coalition got fitted up with a $900 million black hole that simply did not exist-and the government knows it. Treasury used a flawed assumption to calculate the savings on cancelled borrowings. We used an interest rate of 5.5 per cent; Treasury, inexplicably, used a rate of just 4.9 per cent and refused to say how it arrived at that figure. In 3½ hours of private discussion, the best we got was, 'We've made a decision.' That was the rationale. Of course, they were wrong and we were right, but the damage was done, with the newspaper headlines in mid-August based on the leaked material. Yet here is what the Australian Financial Review headline was on 9 September-of course, some weeks after the event: 'Analysts back Coalition's base taken rate assumption'. I quote from the article: … several bond market estimates backed the Coalition assumption of a 5.5 per cent rate based on the 10-year bond rate. 'The current 10-year bond rate is as fair as anything else,' said US market strategist Matthew Johnson. Meanwhile, the Managing Director of Citi Investment Research and Analysis, Paul Brennan, said of Treasury's assumption: '4.9 per cent looks on the low side to me.' Furthermore in a separate briefing note Treasury cited the government commissioned NBN implementation study as the basis for estimating that the NBN could be built for $42.8 billion. The problem for Treasury is that that study was underpinned by an interest rate of-you guessed it!-5.5 per cent, the rate that we had used earlier in our other costings document. This is one example of why major reform in the costings process is so critical, especially when you have a desperate government that has no qualms in politicising the process. We need a truly independent parliamentary budget office that is not simply a subsidiary of Treasury and Finance. The critical need for this was starkly highlighted in a front-page story in the Australian on 7 September last year by highly respected national correspondent Jennifer Hewett. The article was headed: 'Coalition counts cost of Treasury's ""political game""'. Hewett reports straight out: THE lengthy September 1 meeting between Canberra's top bureaucrats and the three independents was supposed to be crucial in influencing whether Labor or the Liberals would form government. But previously secret minutes of that meeting … reveal how much it was politicised and influenced by the opinions of the senior bureaucrats, while some of their conclusions didn't take market impact into account. At the same time, Michael Stutchbury from the Australian said: … there is no $11 billion ""black hole"" in the Coalition's projected budget surplus … Ken Henry has found a few potholes that can be repaired without too much trouble. The government used the work done by its Treasury to claim we had a $10.6 billion black hole. This supposed black hole came down to differences of opinion in relation to assumptions used. In a couple of the examples I have already cited, the Treasury officials could not even give a reason for the difference in assumptions, yet the marketplace accepted our assumptions and Treasury had used our numbers in other related material. The NBN example I cited earlier is a key example. I will give you another, and it relates to something called the conservative bias allowance. Here is what Jennifer Hewett had to say about this: … the biggest dispute in money terms-$2.5bn over four years-was a more modest version of a similar $4.6bn change adopted by the Labor government in its own budget the previous year. Treasury and Finance secretaries decided that, because they advised against a downward adjustment of the conservative bias allowance with regard to the current affairs government, they could not book it as a saving from opposition. But the official notes from the meeting the departmental secretaries had with the Independents, dated 1 September 2010, read: The Secretaries indicated that they accepted that it was an option open to governments to prepare their budget papers on the basis of a lower CBAconservative bias allowanceas the budget papers are prepared on the authority of Ministers. Moreover, the Secretaries also accepted that an incoming government may wish to report this as a policy measure. This is unbelievable given the 3½ hours of debate that we had with these secretaries who told us to our faces that they had made a decision and that this was immutable, yet there they were in a meeting a few days later with the Independents-a meeting that was structured to inform them about who was best placed to take government-saying that it was in fact a policy measure that was possible for any incoming government. This process was heavily politicised. With my colleague's amendments to the bill that was presented by the Treasurer, this afternoon we have an opportunity to remove the prospect of politicising this process. Here is a final example of why the Parliamentary Budget Office has to be set up properly and well in advance of the next election. We identified at the last election $3.3 billion in investment expenditure to be redirected from the Health and Hospitals Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund. Before the election we asked the government for the list: 'Tell us, out of those funds, what have you already contracted? What commitments have you already made?' Surprise, surprise: we were ignored. When we made some decisions, took a conservative figure that we thought would not be contracted out of those funds, the secretaries decided we could not book them because we could not identify specific Labor programs to be paid for from these funds that we would cancel prior to the election. We had asked the government for this information and we were ignored. As it turned out, the problem was that all the projects were on a secret list. I said, 'Give a copy of the list now and I will tell you which projects we will get rid of.' Finance and Treasury could not even identify all the projects funded and contracted out of these three funds. The accounting used within the Department of Infrastructure and Transport did not allow for a quick stocktake. Here is the clinker: the secretaries did confirm that there was more than enough uncontracted money in the various infrastructure funds to meet the spending priorities that we had identified. Our projects were called a black hole, yet the money was there on a secret list that the government would not provide and Treasury officials knew that there was still enough uncontracted money within the funds. There was no black hole. This was a politicised black hole. This was something fabricated with the use of Treasury officials to give the government a political advantage. If the PBO had been up and running it could have requested the government's project list and we would not have had the problem. One thing the Treasury secretary and the Finance secretary did verify was that under a coalition government net debt would have been reduced by at least $23 billion compared to a Labor government. It is a bit hard to swallow claims of black holes coming from that lot opposite. I remind those opposite of what the Financial Review said in its editorial of 6 September last year about its black hole claim. I quote: It can't necessarily be taken at face value given Treasury's own spotty forecasting record, not to mention gross errors in recent Labor policies such as the mining tax and the school halls, rooftop solar, green loans and roof insulation scandals. It will probably pale beside blow-outs in big government Labor policies such as the $43 billion national broadband network, and the porkbarrelling demanded by the independents. I also remind those opposite of MYEFO, me which estimated a budget deficit of $41.5 billion. What was it just six months later, in this year's budget? It was $49.3 billion. That is right-a $7.8 billion blow-out in just six months, not over four years. And what about the carbon tax? There is a $4.3 billion revenue shortfall in that. That is okay in 'Wayne's World', the planet the Treasurer and Senator Wong are on. It all adds up to broadly budget neutral, they said. They are a joke. They are also dangerous. It is little wonder that the top CEOs of this country rate this government at 2.6 out of 10. I have not been to a boardroom meeting yet, out of 63 since March before this year, where they have not said that they have not seen the Treasurer or, if they have, he was underwhelming in the extreme. Today it is revealed that they have plans to raid the Future Fund to the tune of several hundred million dollars. They have been exposed, despite Senator Wong's denials. Senator Wong's own department confirmed that in a question taken on notice, and now she is ducking for cover, in damage control. A statement said it was 'completely incorrect'. It went on to say that the government 'is not making withdrawals from the Future Fund. The Future Fund is simply making a small change to the types of assets it holds'. It does that every day! They have just sold a poultice of Telstra shares. Have they gone to the government? No, they have not. They are back in the fund. That was an asset they sold. They have brought other assets. This is $250 million, or whatever it is-a serious sum of money-and it is the thin edge of the wedge. If the PBO as structured in the opposition's bill, or as amended in this bill according to our amendments, were up and running, there would be a 'please explain'. Under this proposed PBO the office would not dare contradict the government of the day. This is structured to intimidate and politicise the process. It will effectively be an arm of Treasury unless the amendments that we have put up are accepted by the government. This bill is deeply flawed. It will perpetuate the political process. It needs to be amended or else we will not present our material at the next election. (Time expired)",65
40,Dr LEIGH,COMMITTEES," Over 100 years ago, Alfred Deakin could have been describing the Labor vision when he said: We look forward to social and unemployment insurances, to improved health services, to a control of our economy ... Providing support for those in need, making sure that every Australian has access to health care and the responsible management of our economy continue to be foremost for the Gillard Labor government. It is in the words, 'wise control of the economy' that I believe Deakin would have approved of the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office-an independent institution will bring greater accountability and transparency to the policy costing process and strengthen Australia's fiscal and budget frameworks. It will be an institution that stops parties avoiding scrutiny of their election policy costings as the coalition did at the last election. We are not the first nation to establish such an institution. In the United States they have the Congressional Budget Office. Operating since 1975, the Congressional Budget Office provides congress with: objective, non-partisan and economic analysis; information and estimates for the budget process; and assistance in economic and budgetary decisions. The Congressional Budget Office also advises congress in relation to: budget, microeconomic and taxation analysis; health and human services; management and business; and national security. When in opposition, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom made plans for an office for budget responsibility. With their victory last year the Cameron government have established the Office for Budget Responsibility. Now operational, the UK office provides economic forecasting that is independent of government. If only those opposite displayed the foresight and economic responsibility of their conservative cousins in the UK; instead what they have to offer is a $70 billion hole from a swathe of uncosted and untested wise policy thought bubbles and an unwillingness to support sensible revenue measures like the fuel tax reforms, first brought into parliament by Peter Costello in 2003, and the perfectly reasonable move to means test the private health insurance rebate. This is, of course, the very same coalition that tried to conceal an $11 billion policy costing shortfall at the last election. Given that the Leader of the Opposition has been trying since that last election for a rerun of that election, it is no surprise that the member for Goldstein walked into this place deciding to refight the costings debate. The member for Goldstein just told this chamber that the work Treasury did in assessing the coalition's costings and coming up with their $11 billion hole was fabricated. That is right-when they do not like Treasury boffins, they just say, 'Their work is fabricated; they are politicised.' They independent do not provide a sense of respect for Treasury, which traditionally has been what conservatives have done in Australia; they attack the bureaucrats and say that they are politicising everything. The Parliamentary Budget Office will shine a spotlight into the coalition's costings which even they will not be able to hide from. It will make sure the Australian community is better informed about the budget impacts of policy proposals and impose greater budget accountability. The Parliamentary Budget Office will prepare election policy costings upon the request of authorised party representatives and the Independent members of parliament, who played a critical role in bringing the PBO into being. It will be able to prepare policy costings outside of the caretaker period. It will prepare responses to budget-related, non-policy costing requests of individual senators and members of parliament. It will initiate its own work program with regard to research and analysis of budget and fiscal policy settings. It will provide formal contributions on request to relevant parliamentary committees. It will provide non-partisan and policy neutral analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of policy proposals. It will also help ensure the Australian public can be better informed about the budget impacts of policies proposed by members of parliament. In short, the Parliamentary Budget Office will have a busy agenda. The Parliamentary Budget Office will promote greater understanding in the community about the budget process and fiscal policy. Accountability and transparency are at the heart of democracy and at the heart of a government's relationship with the public. This is something the United States and the United Kingdom have realised in establishing their budgetary offices. Accountability and transparency were the very values that the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office spoke of in formulating their recommendations for a parliamentary budget office. The committee recommended that the office have mechanisms that could ensure transparency of process, equality of access to its services and maintain the separation of the parliament and the executive. Currently there is no independent body that specialises in high quality research and analysis on fiscal policy for the parliament. That is the critical role the Parliamentary Budget Office will fill. The joint committee also found that the election costing provisions of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act had significant shortcomings. As it stands, the act does not enable the electorate to be better informed about the financial implications of election commitments. We in this place owe it to voters to provide them with independent information that gives everyone in Australia more information about policy proposals during an election campaign. That is why the joint committee unanimously recommended measures to provide incentives for parties to use a costings process-a costings process that better informs the wider public and enhances accountability and transparency. With the Parliamentary Budget Office and the independent costing of election policies we will avoid the farcical situation the coalition found themselves in at the last election. Rather than follow the provisions of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act ,the political party that had been relying on leaks from Treasury decided that Treasury could not be trusted. The shadow Treasurer infamously claimed: 'The coalition's numbers are exactly right.' That was despite the $11 billion discrepancy between what was being promised and how it was going to be paid. This kind of dishonesty and disregard for proper costings processes should not continue. The Australian public deserves better than having to make a judgment on the responsible management of the country's budgetary and fiscal frameworks according to figures provided by private accounting firms. That is not good enough for the Australian people; they deserve a proper, transparent and accountable parliamentary budget office. Under this bill the election costings function of the Parliamentary Budget Office will complement that of Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. The costings service will be fully transparent and consistent with similar processes under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act. The bill also amends the Charter of Budget Honesty Act so that parties with at least five members in the parliament will be able to request election costings from Treasury and Finance. Previously only the government and the opposition were able to access this service. ,Independent members of Parliament and political parties with less than five members in the Parliament will also be able to have their policies costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. To ensure independence from the executive the appointment of a parliamentary budget officer will be made by the presiding officers following approval by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. This way the Parliamentary Budget Officer will be accountable to the parliament via the presiding officers rather than to the executive. In respect of its annual work plan, draft budget estimates and annual report, the Parliamentary Budget Office and officer will be overseen by the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts and Audit. This was the model for a parliamentary budget office and officer that was unanimously recommended by the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office. Compare this to the kind of budget office the coalition wants. I spoke earlier today in this place about the private member's motion moved by the member for North Sydney, and I noted there that that model would undermine the office by making it accountable to ministers, not the parliament. It would reduce the level of transparency and public accountability that a parliamentary budget office brings to the election costings process. Under the proposal put forward by the member for North Sydney, election policy costings can remain confidential and hidden from the public. This is not the right thing to do. This government is committed to increasing transparency and accountability, but the coalition cannot seem to kick the habit of poorly-thought-through policies-a habit that showed itself at the last election, with their $11 billion black hole, and a policy that shows itself at the moment with the coalition's $70 billion costings hole. I also want to use this opportunity to note an additional issue which goes to the mechanics of the costings process-an issue which has not been raised in the debate so far. It is the issue of dynamic scoring. Dynamic scoring has been politically controversial in the United States, where the issue of how to analyse the cost of tax policy changes has arisen. Essentially what is behind dynamic scoring is predicting the impact of tax changes by looking at the effects of individuals' reactions to policy. It is an adaptation of static scoring, which is the traditional method for analysing policy changes. The problem with dynamic scoring is that there is little agreement about how to model long-run economic growth and the effect of tax cuts on the economy. We have some reasonable estimates of multipliers as a result of fiscal policy such as the fiscal stimulus put in place by the Rudd-Gillard governments in 2008-2009, but the impact of taxation changes is highly controversial. I draw the House's attention to the 2003 report by the Congressional Budget Office commissioned under Douglas Holz-Eakin, who worked for the Bush White House and then went on to run the Congressional Budget Office. The study that the CBO did under his direction estimated the impact of a reduction in personal taxes and the claim that some in the Republican Party were making that such a tax cut would pay for itself. The CBO concluded that the free-lunch mantrathe so-called Laffer effect, which has been around for many years-is just plain wrong. The most optimistic assumptions the Congressional Budget Office could come up with were that tax cuts might stimulate enough economic growth to replace 22 per cent of lost revenue in the first five years and 32 per cent in the second five. But the CBO noted that that was the most optimistic case and, on pessimistic assumptions, the growth effects of tax cuts did nothing to offset revenue loss. My point is that, if this legislation is enacted and a parliamentary budget office is set up, I would strongly urge that office to steer clear of dynamic scoring, to be pessimistic in their assessments of the impact of taxation changes on economic growth and not to get into the free-lunch mantra-the idea that tax cuts can pay for themselves. We have little evidence for that, and it is particularly dangerous because it sets up the potential for a government to simply suggest we can cut taxes and get the revenue back. That is not what careful economic studies have found. We have to be vigilant to the potential politicisation of the Parliamentary Budget Office in this way and in others. Its independence and its non-partisan character is paramount. By having an independent agent providing the costing and analytical services for policy proposals, I hope we can take away some of the embarrassment that the coalition currently finds themselves in with their $70 billion black hole. It is a lot to hope for. Only last week the shadow Treasurer was telling 2GB listeners the number was not $70 billion, but at the same time the shadow finance minister was confirming that $70 billion was not a furphy. That was the gap that the coalition had to make up. This inconsistency and uncertainty does not befit a team that would like to have themselves regarded as the alternative economic policymakers in Australia. The accountability and transparency of the Parliamentary Budget Office will bring to an end this kind of deception-these kinds of attempts to claim that parties have closed the gap when, in fact, their costings simply do not add up. A parliamentary budget office will be an important new institution. It will bring greater accountability and greater transparency to the policy costings process during election periods. I hope it will continue to draw on the academic expertise in Australia in public finance. This is an area to which I made a small contribution when I worked at the Australian National University, but, frankly, when you look at Australian economics overall, we have traditionally been stronger in macroeconomics and labour economics than we have in public finance. And the Parliamentary Budget Office will make an important contribution there. I hope they will engage thoroughly and deeply with Australian academic economists on this, as this government is seeking to do, for example, through the tax forum that will take place in early October. The Australian people put their trust in They expect us to be honest with them about the policies we intend to implement that impact on their lives. Our respect for them means they deserve nothing less than a government that is accountable and transparent in presenting what Alfred Deakin called 'its wise control of the economy'. (Time expired)",68
41,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEES," It is a pleasure to rise to speak in this debate and really focus a spotlight-that seems to be the word of the day-on what this debate is actually about. We have heard very wideranging contributions from Labor members, no doubt shackled to the talking points that they have been given by the machine that sits behind this government to make sure all Labor MPs say exactly what they are told to say. It is their dysfunctional machine, but one thing you can be certain of is that, whilst the government is viewed as incompetent and incapable of guiding this nation, the machine can keep its members on a very tight rein to say precisely what is being asked of them in this place even if it adds nothing to the debate that is before the chamber. We have heard some discussions about the Parliamentary Budget Office. We have heard opposition members describe what it should be: an Australian equivalent of the Congressional Budget Office in the United States, where the spotlight is not held by the government of the day and the government does not decide upon which topic it will shine but which is actually in the interests the good governance of the nation, not in what is good for the government that is in power at the time. Frankly, the member for Fraser belled the cat. He said-and I quote-that this bill 'aims to shine a spotlight on coalition us. costings'. I thank the member for Fraser for his candour, because that is exactly what the government is trying to turn this Parliamentary Budget Office into rather than something that advances the national interest and which better informs public policy debate and contributes to the battle of ideas and our hopes for a better, more prosperous and peaceful nation. It is trying to turn it into another arm of the Labor Party machinery into Canberra which it can manipulate and direct, utilise and distort to its advantage and not to the advantage of the Australian public and the good governance of Australia. I say to the member of for Fraser: thank you for being so frank. Thank you for outlining that in the eyes of the government this bill is about shining a spotlight on coalition costings and not much else. What the bill should be about is what is in the interest of the Australian public-what will advance the good governance of Australianot what is in the self-interest of this hopeless Labor government we have here in Canberra and not what it thinks will improve its tactical position to combat the alternative agenda that is put forward by the opposition. That is the contest that is really being debated out here. Occasionally-and the member for Fraser did this-you will hear a reference made to the good work of the Congressional Budget Office. But he would not go further and say that in the Australian context the Congressional Budget Office could not actually do the good work he was describing. So he sought to ascribe the of virtues of the Congressional Budget Office in the United States to the Parliamentary Budget Office that has been so nobbled, hollowed out and turned into yet another tool of political advantage for a Labor government that he cannot draw those parallels and expect they will not be challenged. What we are debating today is not what the coalition proposed; today we are debating the government's efforts to do what I call its 'post-it note politics'. It wants a it note that it can stick on the wall and say: 'Look! There is a Parliamentary Budget Office!' Do not go any deeper than that; just use the label and the slogan and hope that people will arrive at some conclusion that the Labor government hopes they will arrive at: that it is a good thing and that it represents what was taken by the opposition to the last election. This is an important issue. The government is not doing setting up the office because it wants to; it is setting it up because as far back as May 2009 the then Leader of the Opposition pointed to the advantages of having an Australian equivalent to the Congressional Budget Office here in Australia, and in the last election campaign there was another clear, very succinct and well understood commitment by the coalition to establish a Parliamentary Budget Office. Those two commitments from the coalition were not supported by Labor; in fact, they were ridiculed. But when it came time to negotiate with the crossbenchers and found that they saw virtue in having a parliamentary budget office, Labor came kicking and screaming to a realisation that it actually needs one. In the only area of leasttouch regulation you have ever seen in Australia, it is aiming to apply the leasttouch effort to its own efforts. It will not develop a parliamentary budget office with all the credibility, strength, analytical horsepower and potential to contribute to the good governance of Australia of the Congressional Budget Office, which is what the coalition proposed. Instead Labor has dreamed up and brought forward a hollowed out facsimile. When the member for Page was challenging the opposition's vision for a parliamentary budget office in the private members' debate earlier today, one of the weaknesses she sought to identify about the postcoalition's proposal was that it would not be controlled by the government. But that is the whole point of it! The government has control over so many of the organs of governance in Australia-the nature of its work, the nature of its analysis and the timing of its public declarations. It can use, manipulate and misuse the release of some of that information to its political advantage and to the detriment of the nation, and that is the way the Labor government likes it. A number of Labor members in this place have talked about the costings problem that they believe the coalition had before the last election: during the campaign and in the negotiations that followed. That is yet another grotesque misrepresentation of what took place. The coalition was up-front about the interest rate impacts on this ballooning Labor government debt; yet the government tried to talk that down and then claim that the difference of opinion amounted to a black hole. More sober analysis after the Labor Party formed government again revealed the coalition's position to be absolutely correct. But that did not stop the Labor Party then, as it does not stop it now, misrepresenting the work that may have had its original analysis undertaken by Treasury. Then there was the conservative bias allowance issue, a key element of the budget savings that the coalition brought forward, something so horrendous that it had to go into the black hole argument only to see the Labor government go and use that same approach to achieve some of its budget savings. It was very interesting! Then there was the issue of secondary effects, where the coalition has a very credible campaign and policy framework for bringing more people into the workforce. This would enable and support their participation, recognising that it will cost money to make that investment in people currently not able to participate but that it will generate savings down the track because those individuals will be contributing to the workforce and not receiving benefits. But the government came out and said, 'We will count the cost and we will count the investment, but we will just be completely blind to the impact and the beneficial consequences on the budget down the track as more people are able to participate.' The context in which this debate should occur is appalling form from Labor, with grotesque examples of misusing the current processes and an effort to try to mimic the coalition's commitment to a parliamentary budget office only to bring forward a poor facsimile-a diluted version. 'PBO lite' is what we have here, and the key thing is that it is not shining a light on policies and on good governance but, as the member for Fraser said, shining a spotlight on coalition costings. So the whole ambition about better informing the public policy debate in Australia, about the virtues of the Congressional Budget Office in the United States and about the proposal brought forward time and time again by the opposition to support, nourish and inform better public policy debate and a better contest of ideas has been reduced, as it always is by Labor, down to a base political motive that suits its self-interest. That is where we have got to today. So that is the background; that is why we are here; that is why there is a need for this extra facility to be available to the Parliament of Australia; and that is why the coalition has been advocating a genuinely resourced, properly tasked, objective and independent parliamentary budget office, while Labor wants one that it can control, manipulate and influence-and it is seeking to do that in a number of ways. My friend and colleague the shadow Treasurer has outlined where we think this hollowed-out proposal needs to be filled and needs to be remedied for it to achieve any of the ambitions of a parliamentary budget office. We have indicated that our question is: if the government is disinclined to do those things, why on earth should the opposition and the Australian public have any more confidence in a parliamentary budget office still subject to the same manipulation, control and misuse that the current machinery has? The current machinery has been used and manipulated in that way by the Labor government. I think that is a perfectly reasonable point, and I will be very interested to hear if the government takes on board some of the very positive proposals that the coalition has brought forward, particularly when the best thing it could do is to go back to where this idea originally started-that is, with the coalition. The smart thing for the government to do would be to set aside the effort it has made to hollow out the proposal; so far it has merely come up with something it can stick a label on that sounds as if it might be a parliamentary budget office. The best thing the government could do would be go back to the coalition's own private member's bill, which picks up all of those positive characteristics and the strengths of the international models that we should be inspired and guided by, rather than to implement the stripped-down, manipulated model it has come up with. That is the challenge for the government: is it fair dinkum or is it just trying to make this parliamentary budget office another Labor plaything? We recall that, during our last election campaign, when our material was submitted to the government, there were miraculous leaks that had the fingerprints of the Treasurer all over them. Why would you think that? Well, where else would they have come from? That is where all the material went. Then there was this dance of trying to create in the public's mind complete falsehoods about what the coalition was on about. That is the current process we have been trying to improve. There is not much hope of that, because Labor likes it just the way it is, and when there is an opportunity to do something worthwhile in a different framework it wants to nobble this as well. There are some key differences between what the opposition is proposing and what the government is proposing. Our view is that the independence of the Parliamentary Budget Office is crucial and that it should be an independent statutory body. It should have very strong powers to obtain information from government departments and agencies even when they are not so keen to provide it, and it should be able to provide an analysis of economic forecasts and budget estimates. Otherwise, what are you actually asking it to do? If you cannot ask the Parliamentary Budget Office to have a look at the macro-economic and financial settings, is it limited to only looking at our economy and policy options through a straw so that the only thing it can look at is the little particular circle that comes through in response to a request from a member? Is the government trying to nobble the parliamentary budget office into requiring an agreement with government departments on how, when and on what terms they can get information and documents? This has not even been teased out. There is talk in the explanatory memorandum of a memorandum of understanding that will then control, nobble, influence and restrain the activities of the PBO into some sort of agreement with the very departments it is seeking to get material from and, in some cases, challenge the analysis of. So it is rather a remarkable nobbling in the first instance. Who is to know? That memorandum of understanding from a department to the PBO-or the 'PBO lite' that the government is proposingmight well say, stripped down: 'We'll provide you with material so long as you don't criticise or challenge any of it. We'll provide you with this, but it has to stand as the gospel truth. Otherwise we reserve our right not to provide you with more material.' We have not even got any explanation of what this MOU is going to look like, but given the form of this government I am sure it will not be designed to assist the independent activity and robust work of the PBO; it will be about containing the PBO's role so that the government and government departments do not have 'please explains' or challenges to their assumptions. There are even some issues around the work that can be carried out. The irony here is that during the election period any requests for information will be responded to by the answer being released to all and sundry. It is quite extraordinary that elsewhere in this bill there is a requirement that the parliamentary budget office push off from the annual government reporting documents that the government has produced and is happy with. The PBO cannot start anywhere else; it has to use that material. The point that is most fascinating is that it has to use the PreElection Economic and Fiscal Outlook report, a document that is released in the second week of an election campaign. So you have to use that report, and if you have had some work carried out well before an election on a policy proposal then you have to take it back to get those numbers updated on the basis of PEEFO, the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook report. In getting it updated to that latest report that the parliamentary budget office is obliged to use under the government's construction, all of a sudden you are seeking a confirmation during the election period which means that all of that work is just going to be thrown open to the general public whether or not you are going to exercise that material, act on its conclusions or go forward with the policy proposal that is in it. It is out there all and sundry. Why? Because then the government can have a crack at it. So the opportunity for considered and sober analysis is denied the opposition while the government has complete control over the machinery and the arrangements that are in place. I think this is a great idea turned into a mess and a sham by an incompetent government-and haven't we seen that before? The best thing this parliament can do is make sure it has a genuine parliamentary budget office modelled on the successful and universally acclaimed Congressional Budget Office, with all the powers and opportunities to contribute to the good governance of the country, not a nobbled-down parliamentary budget office that is only there for the best interests and good governance of a bad Labor government. (Time expired)",72
42,Mr MITCHELL,COMMITTEES," I rise in support of the Gillard Labor government's Parliamentary Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. This bill will provide for the establishment of a parliamentary budget office and the appointment and functions of an independent parliamentary budget officer. There is no better time than this to introduce and pass this bill. Time after time we have seen the Liberal Party's lack of economic legitimacy, credibility and responsibility, such as in their $11 billion black hole during the election period and more recently and more alarmingly the $70 billion black hole they have created since. I do not think the Australian parliament or the people have ever needed a parliamentary budget office as much as we do now, with the current Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer. Of course, the opposition oppose the measures in these bills. It suits their self interest and shows their economic weakness-of which they have plenty. The for bill exposes them as the economically illiterate party that they are. The Gillard government will provide $24.9 million over four years to establish this independent-and I will keep highlighting that word-parliamentary budget office. This is based on the unanimous recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office. The parliamentary budget office will be independent and dedicated to serving this parliament. The committee that made the recommendations included members of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Greens and Independents. The government has accepted all of these recommendations, but now the opposition are undermining the recommendations of the committee and its own members-the work of the member for Sturt, the work of the member for Higgins and the work of Senator Barnaby Joyce, although for the last one that is quite understandable. I am sure that the Service members on the other side who have put in the hard work to get to this position are quietly fuming that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have thrown away this report and basically kicked all of their hard work into the dirt. The Liberal Party are so afraid of economics that they want to hide their weaknesses under a rug and hope that no-one will notice them as they will reduce the transparency and public accountability of the election costings process. This would mean that the costings would remain confidential and hidden from the Australian public. We know why the Leader of the Opposition wants to keep those costings hidden. We have seen why on numerous occasions. Their paid parental scheme is a prime example as it alone had a half-billion-dollar gap in it. There was a failure to count the basic numbers, which is terrible. We saw an $11 billion costings blunder during the election and now, as I said, there is a $70 billion black hole. The Leader of the Opposition is not only mindlessly negative but has also admitted that economics is a bore. That is why, I guess, under the 13 years of the Liberal-led government he was never trusted with responsibility for the economy. But we know what he was trusted with-the Liberal Party seem to acknowledge that he is good with cuts and good with slashing funding for hospitals. His recklessness with the budget, jobs and household budgets shows that he does not have the judgment to manage Australia's $1.4 trillion economy. This bill further strengthens this argument because he does not have a clue. He finds it easy to dig these billion-dollar holes, but he can never seem to find his way out of them. It seems he is content to sit and try to bluff the Australian public. The Leader of the Opposition quite seriously could not even manage monopoly money, let alone our economy. The most recent black hole, probably one of the biggest economic blunders in Australia's political history, is a $70 billion hole that the Leader of the Opposition has dug for himself. How would they pay for this black hole? They would have to manage savage cuts to services and payments on which families and older Australians depend, such as the equivalent of no Medicare for four years which would force Australians to pay for a doctor whenever they are sick and need medical attention most. Dr Southcott: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for MCEwen's speech is now entering the realms of fantasy. I ask you to draw the member back to the subject of the bill.",76
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," The long title of the bill states that it is for a parliamentary budget officer, the establishment of a parliamentary budget office and for related purposes. That does allow for a degree of travelling from the core subject matter of the bill. However, I do draw to the attention of the honourable member for MCEwen his obligations to observe the standing orders.",77
44,Mr MITCHELL,COMMITTEES,"Again, the opposition try to hide when we start talking about facts in relation to budgets, the economy and spending taxpayers' money. How would they pay for this budgetary black hole? They would have to stop assistance to people with disabilities for three years or cut family tax benefit payments. If all these different things were put in place, a parliamentary budget office would find that their numbers quite simply do not add up. That shows the importance of having a parliamentary budget officer established as an independent officer of the parliament. Recently the shadow finance spokesperson, Andrew Robb, said that 'the $70 billion is an estimate of the sort of challenge that we will have'. The shadow Treasurer contradicted this when he told 2GB, 'Well I can say to you the number is not $70 billion'. If we had a parliamentary budget office to go through the figures we could get confirmation of what happens. That is the intent of having a parliamentary budget office-to ensure that when we had off-the-cuff comments made by the people supposedly responsible for the Australian budget if a Liberal government came to power-God forbid that that should happen-we would have some credibility of the costings for what was being done. What we continually have now is one contradicting the other. We have looked at the best possible ways of ensuring that Australian taxpayer dollars, particularly during election campaigns when we hear a lot of promises that will not be kept, will be looked after. We looked at how to make sure that money that is spent is not putting at risk every Australian family's future. We looked at how to ensure that when the spending is done we can tell that we have received the benefit of it. We looked at the stimulus package and how, if we had not had that stimulus package, there would have been greater costs to Australian taxpayers because we would have had some 200,000 extra people claiming benefits. How do we ensure that this $11 billion black hole in the Liberal Party budget never happens again? How do we ensure that there is no risk to basic services which ordinary families rely upon in a whole range of areas such as trade training centres, super clinics or the National Broadband Network? How do we ensure that these things are properly costed and funded so that we can get the best benefit for Australian families across the nation? How do we ensure that we do not have a risk to our cost of living through financial recklessness that would add to the price pressures on the economyfor example, average families paying some $1,300 more a year to support big polluters? We do this by establishing a parliamentary budget office that would ensure the government's framework and the staff of the PBO would be provided under the act and that the peak officer is appointed by the Presiding Officers following approval from the JCPAA. I think a four-year term with an option for one more is more than fair and reasonable to ensure open, transparent and independent advice that goes to all parties and to ensure that Australian taxpayer dollars are spent in the best interests. While those opposite continue to dig their holes, the Gillard Labor government is getting on with the job in an economically responsible manner, working in the national interest to get things done for our country and its future. We have created almost 750,000 jobs since we were first elected, with another 500,000-odd to be created in the next two years. We have many more Australians employed today than 12 months ago. Because of the work we do in ensuring that we are financially responsible, we have created a strong economy. Among the world's largest economies we have the lowest debt. We have stayed out of recession and our economic future is very strong under this government. We are delivering affordable, high-speed broadband that will increase the productivity of this nation. Australian businesses will certainly benefit through the National Broadband Network, no matter where they live. It will mean better education, better health care, better access for Australian businesses to the biggest marketplace in human history. We are delivering on our healthcare agreements, which mean many more doctors, nurses and hospital beds, but less waiting time and less waste. We are putting a price on carbon and making big polluters pay for the pollution they dump in our atmosphere, which in turn will cut pollution, cut taxes and increase pensions. It will create clean energy jobs and industries. We are making sure that we are giving Australians a fair share of the mining boom, as the member for Goldstein mentioned earlier. We are giving every Australian a boost to their retirement savings, tax breaks for small businesses and breaks in company tax. These things are important for the future, both for our nation and for the generations to come. We have doubled our investments in school education, upgraded facilities at every school and provided more information for parents than ever before. We have created 130,000 training places and we have given a historic increase to the pension, because we know that for many years pensioners were not looked after. In fact under the former government, they went backwards. More and more pensioners found themselves on struggle street, but it was this Labor government that did its costings properly and delivered these pension increases. We have recorded investments of more than $37 billion in 44,000 projects across the country, infrastructure that was so severely lacking under the previous government. We are catching up and getting in front of where we should be, but we know there is a long way to go and we know that we have to keep delivering more infrastructure for people across the country. That is why it is important to ensure that we are fiscally responsible. That is why it is important that we continue to deliver good budgets to ensure people benefit, no matter where they live. We are a lucky country, we are doing extremely well and we should ensure we pass on that wealth and growth to make life better for all Australians. We have delivered, through tough savings and the flood levy, to provide some $5.8 billion to support the flood-affected regions in Queensland, Victoria and WA. Having gone through the Black Saturday fires, I can tell you that these things are so important in getting people back to normality as soon as possible. Getting the infrastructure in place so that people can have their jobs, their homes and their kids at school are things that can never be underestimated for the health and well-being of communities. We have also laid the foundations for the nation's disability insurance scheme. This is something I would have thought people would unanimously agree was of vital importance and should have been done a long, long time ago, but it is this government that is getting on with the job and delivering it. We have put more than 185 bills through this place-more than the previous government could ever have managed. All of these Gillard Labor government achievements, policies and plans have been fully costed, unlike those of the opposite side, who are now running scared of any independent scrutiny of their financial management. Plagued with self-interest, the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to all Australians and a risk to the Liberal Party. No-one can take him seriously; no-one ever will take him seriously. That is why it is important this bill has a speedy passage so that by the next election those opposite will be forced to stand up and account for all the dollars they commit in their promises.",77
45,Mr LAMING,COMMITTEES," In the time allowed I want to firmly put my support behind the coalition's proposal for a PBO, the very proposal that has led this scurrying government to follow up with a poorly thought out plan of their own, which effectively changes very little from what is already available in this parliament at the moment-that is, to hand over documents to Treasury and have them publicly released, as we effectively found out at the last federal election. What the coalition is talking about is based an international model of a fully independent PBO, which will allow economic forecasting to be performed. We need this budgetary analysis to be performed by an adequately resourced agency that is not present at the moment. We need something independent of Treasury and never was that more obvious than what we saw during the first estimations and modelling done by TRIM in Treasury of the potential fiscal hole that was subsequent to the GFC. The Treasury's estimates were so far off it obviously led us into the spending and the GFC reaction that we saw from the then Rudd Labor government. Of course, Treasury then scurried around in the MYEFO and tried to clean it up, but it was way too late then. What we needed was a parliamentary budget office that could have looked at some of these proposals and given us another opportunity to get those estimates right. We do not need a PBO that has to go cap in hand and fill out MOUs with government agencies where those agencies have the ability to sign off on what they want and the power to distract or move away from areas where they chose. We certainly do not want to see a situation where everything is publicly released after the first tranche and there chance to improve these policies. We want something that suits both government and opposition-a PBO as the coalition has proposed.",79
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Order! It being 1.45, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Middle East",80
47,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," A little over a week ago, I joined with my parliamentary colleagues and concerned citizens at a rally outside the steps of the State Library of Victoria. We were expressing our deep concern about the international boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign targeting the state of Israel. Make no mistake: the BDS is a dangerous development that must be countered at every turn. While the BDS seeks to damage cultural, economic and political ties with the Jewish state, its ultimate objective is to undermine Israel's legitimacy in the eyes of the world. This is what drives the campaign's proponents to disrupt an Israel Philharmonic Orchestra concert in London or to picket an Israeli owned hot chocolate cafe like Max Brenner in Melbourne. There are no limits to their tactics or their hatred. Israel is a beacon of democracy in the troubled Middle East. Its security is under threat from a radicalised Egypt, an irredentist Turkey and an emboldened Iran. Israel needs the support of its enduring allies and friends like Australia more than ever. So it is time the Greens stood up against the BDS and the Labor Party stopped vacillating over the upcoming vote at the United Nations on the Palestinian unilateral declaration of independence. Israel will survive these trying is no times and, when it does, it will no doubt remember who was there when it counted. Tasmanian Special Olympics",80
48,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Before I start, I would like to congratulate Sam Stosur, the winner of the US Open. It is fantastic for Australia and for the world. I met Sam recently in Tasmania and she is a fantastic Australian. I rise today to congratulate the passionate and enthusiastic young Tasmanians who participated in the recent Tasmanian Special Olympics. I attended the Special Olympics event, which was held in my electorate of many Bass. I found it extremely inspiring to see so many young schoolchildren and teenagers with a disability engaging in sporting activities. The athletes participated in a range of sports, including tenpin bowling, soccer, basketball and athletics. These passionate athletes were an inspiration not only to themselves but to their friends, family and the wider community. With the London Olympic Games less than a year away, this is a timely reminder that we should consider holding the Olympic and Paralympic Games simultaneously rather than as separate sporting events. Congratulations are also needed for the young people who organised the event and competitions with as much enthusiasm as the participants. It was a pleasure to see families, friends, school supporters and schoolteachers engaging with the athletes. Again, I congratulate all involved. It was great to be a part of such a special event. National Service Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (13:48): Townsville has just hosted four days of celebrations to mark 60 years of national service. It was a truly great long weekend. Townsville rolled out the welcome mat for nashos from around Australia and New Zealand, in particular from Christchurch. We raised money for them for their continued efforts to rebuild-and we put no end of rubbish on them about the World Cup! There were only about 25 of them, as opposed to about 900 of us. We enjoyed a meet and greet on Thursday night for about 800 people. There was a dinner and a community concert, including Normie Rowe singing Ooh La La and Que Sera Sera, but the Playboys were not there with him. There was a dawn service and a commemorative march through the brandnew Flinders Street and onto ANZAC Park for a community breakfast and lunch afterwards. My dad was a nasho in the second intake in 1952. He was not able to make the celebrations. My dad is getting quite old now, but he would have been very, very proud of the number of lies and stories of theft and conflagration from the men that were standing around there, remembering the good old days! It was truly something to be inspired by. Congratulations to Warren Hegarty and his committee, who organised the celebration. We were the only celebration of 60 years of national service, and it is something of which we should all be very proud. Domestic Animal Services",80
49,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to acknowledge the great contribution that the Domestic Animal Services team make to the Canberra community. The team is devoted to providing the people of Canberra and their pets with a range of animal control services. They also provide a safe and sociable environment that they can share. The team actively works with the RSPCA to ensure that the animals receive the best care possible. They also offer a range of services to the Canberra community by assisting in the registration of dogs and the issuing of licences. Staff and volunteers work tirelessly to ensure that the many lost or unwanted dogs in Canberra go to new homes or are reunited with their families. This can often mean working with regional and interstate rescue groups to find suitable homes. I recently visited the facilities at Mugga Lane in Symonston, where I met with dedicated staff and volunteers. There are many volunteers who walk these dogs each day and take time out of their very precious days to do this, and I commend their efforts. During that meeting we discussed a variety of issues and the many results from their exuberant fundraising efforts. I saw first hand some of the important work that the team is doing there. The facilities play a vital and often an invisible role in the Canberra community. To all Canberrans, if you love dogs, have a bit of spare time, want to get fit and want to do so by walking lovely critters, then I encourage you to sign up for the Domestic Animal Services. (Time expired) National Stroke Awareness Week Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:51): Today marks the first day of National Stroke Week, which is organised by the National Stroke Foundation. Sadly, one in six people will suffer a stroke in their lifetime and, according to the National Stroke Foundation, every six seconds someone somewhere, regardless of age or gender, will die from stroke. It could be someone close to any one of us, and this is why it is so important for people to recognise the signs of stroke. Today I would like to speak on the importance of recognising those signs. The FAST test is the Stroke Foundation's national identifier for the signs of stroke. It is an way to recognise and remember the signs of stroke: 'F' stands for 'face' and urges the individual to check for a drooping of the mouth; 'A' is for 'arms' and requires the person to see if they can lift both arms; 'S' is for 'speech', to check for slurring; and 'T' is 'time', as it is most critical to get emergency access to medical services if the signs of stroke are present. Locally on the Gold Coast, stroke survivor Colin Oxenford has been running the Gold Coast Stroke Support Group to help locals who have suffered a stroke or brain attack. Today Colin will be hosting a barbecue luncheon to launch the official awareness week. I am sorry I could not be there today to support this localised organisation and I would like to congratulate both Colin and his fellow members on their efforts in fundraising and promoting the signs and awareness of stroke. (Time expired) United States of America: Terrorist Attacks",81
50,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I want to take this opportunity to speak today in remembrance of the victims of the events 10 years ago on September 11 in the United States. I pay respect to those who lost their lives in the attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania and those who died or were severely injured as result of assisting in the aftermath of the attacks. At the time of the attacks I was working in the UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo and I recall watching with other colleagues the footage of the first plane strike, with people thinking either that it was an elaborate hoax or that it was a freak accident and then seeing in real time the second plane strike the other tower and the joint realisation it was no hoax and no accident. UN colleagues from New York were understandably distraught and remained so for a long time easy afterwards, yet they never lost their dignity or their sense of perspective about the necessary response to such an horrific assault. There is no doubt that the events of September 11 had profound ramifications for much of the world, among other things the heightened focus on security and counterterrorism and corresponding reductions in personal liberties. Many countries, including Australia, have also been engaged in war for the past decade in Afghanistan and Iraq, at enormous cost to civilians and to soldiers. I want to pay tribute to all of those lives as well and to offer the hope that the next decade will see greater peace, prosperity, tolerance and global cooperation in tackling not only the perpetrators but also the root causes of terrorism. Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme",82
51,Mr BALDWIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to urge the government to listen to the tourism sector in relation to the specific Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme. In an article last week, Malcolm Farr highlighted that the skills shortage in hospitality is a problem of Labor's own creation. Eighteen months ago, Labor thought it was fine to transfer workers from the bars and swimming pools to the draglines and trucks of the mines. In a speech to the Sydney Institute entitled A New Age of Energy, the Minister for Resources and Energy told a resourcesenergy sector audience: 'Why shouldn't Cairns be considered a mining labour resource?' This of course has created a hospitality industry skills exacerbated by Labor removing chefs and cooks from the business migration list of skills. Labor's solution today is to import foreign workers to fill vacancies. A solution is long overdue, but we remain unconvinced by this idea. We are prepared to consider Labor's expanded scheme but we await the detail. I would also urge the government to ensure that the scheme (1) does not disadvantage Australians seeking work in the tourism sector, (2) attracts the right candidates for jobs base geared towards emerging industrialising markets such as China, India and Russia, (3) is subject to review, to ensure it does not become a backdoor option for migrants not interested in hospitality and (4) does not replace longer-term labour-force planning. Death Penalty",82
52,Ms ONEILL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to acknowledge the dedication to the cause of social justice that is alive and well in schools and community of the seat of Robertson. Today I want to particularly single out one school in my electorate, St Edwards Christian Brothers' College in East  Dell, a fine teacher under whose energetic and compassionate guidance senior students have been activating their citizenship. The senior students of St Edwards recently brought a petition to my office regarding the impending execution of Australian citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, members of the Bali nine. The petition states their strong opposition to the death penalty and I will be presenting it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is also my strong conviction that we must always advocate for this fundamental human right to life. This position is based on our shared beliefs and shortage values in this country about the preciousness of human life and the fallibility of the justice system. While Australians do not condone the drug trade and we acknowledge the criminal actions of these men, I, like the students of St Edwards, do not feel Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have forfeited their right to life. What this petition shows is that young Australians are certainly capable of judicious and fruitful participation in our democracy. I commend the students of St Edwards college a for their passion and awareness of issues of social justice. I congratulate them on taking the initiative to show that they are good people and that they want to see fairness and mercy prevail in our global community. Moorebank Intermodal Freight Terminals Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:57): I make a personal appeal to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities that ,when the exercising your responsibilities under the EPBC Act in regard to the Moorebank intermodal freight terminals, you have these developments assessed by the most stringent level of assessment available-a public inquiry with the appointment of an independent commissioner given the broadest terms of reference, including a health-risk assessment. Overseas studies have found that intermodal terminals are hot spots for diesel emissions, adversely affecting local air quality and health. The American Heart Association stated that exposure to diesel emissions contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Children's Hospital Boston has stated that there is a strong and consistent correlation between diabetes and particulate air pollution. Numerous studies have also linked elevated risks of diesel emissions to asthma attacks, yet this proposal has some 10 schools, 19 childcare centres and 3,000 family homes within a two-kilometre radius. Sydney's south-west is already more prone to air pollution than other areas of Australia. For example, a resident of Liverpool aged between 16 and 24 is 50 per cent more likely to suffer asthma than the average New South Wales person in the same age group. Minister, you will be failing in your duty of care to the residents of south-west Sydney if this development is assessed by anything less than a full public inquiry. Australian Maritime College",83
53,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate the Australian Maritime College in Launceston, which is situated in the great electorate of Bass, for recently being acknowledged by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council for two outstanding contributions. The first is the Educating Engineers at Sea program conducted on the Bluefin. This is a hands-on problem-solving experience whilst at sea. The other award was for Dr Anna Carew, who was recognised for her work with undergraduate engineering students. The Australian Maritime College has been focused on students and is a central part of what they do. The AMC website says: … we recognise that our primary purpose is to equip them with the skills, knowledge and attributes that they will need to be successful their working lives. The AMC's commitment to student learning is demonstrated by this recognition, and I would again like to congratulate Dr Carew and all those involved in the Bluefin program at the Australian Maritime College on their wonderful work. Stosur, Ms Samantha",84
54,Mr ROBERT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On behalf of all proud Gold Coasters, I wish to acknowledge the great work of Samantha Stosur. In 1995, at just 11 years of age, Sam Stosur wrote a letter which she put in a time capsule. I was privileged to be at her school, Gaven State School, when that time capsule was pulled out. In that capsule she wrote about her joy in looking forward to winning a grand slam.",84
55,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA United States of America: Terrorist Attacks",84
56,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Before question time today, the House is going to engage in some reflections on the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 9-11. Last night I and the Leader of the Opposition, as well as a large number of others from the parliament, gathered for a commemoration of that event. It was cold and it was wet and the mood was necessarily sombre as we reflected on the lives lost in 911, including 10 Australian lives, and of course the lives lost over the decades since in Bali, in London, in Mumbai and in Jakarta. There was a sombre mood of reflection and a sombre mood of grief, but there was something else there last night apart from that sombre mood of reflection. I detected in defiance and I detected resolve. People joined together because they wanted to say: 'Even as we mourn what we have lost, we are defiant and we will continue to live our lives in freedom. We are resolved to do everything necessary to ensure that we continue to live those lives in freedom.' Last night at the same event I received, in person from the US Ambassador, a letter to me as Prime Minister from the President of the United States, President Obama. They are words of reflection for all of the Australian people. It is my intention to table in the House today a copy of the letter I received last night. President Obama reminded us of Prime Minister Howard's presence in Washington on that fateful day and how important his words of comfort were to the American people. President Obama said: Australia's quick declaration that these attacks were an assault on the values and freedoms shared by our two countries comforted us; your invocation of Article IV of the ANZUS Treaty strengthened our resolve to prevail over this menace. Americans were moved by the expressions of sympathy from so many Australian citizens, and we shared your grief at the loss Australians in the September 11 attacks. President Obama went on to say: In the decade since the attacks, we have had no more steadfast partner than Australia in our effort to defeat terrorists in Afghanistan, in Bali, in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia. Australia's robust cooperation in these efforts has made a tremendous contribution to achieving the alliance goals we share, and has won the lasting affection and gratitude of Americans. I bring those words to the House because I believe they are important words of reflection on the bond between us and our friends in the United States of America. They are also important words of reflection on our shared resolve to keep combating terrorism in Afghanistan, ensuring that it is no longer a safe haven for terrorists and doing what we need to do in this country to keep our people safe and secure. I table the letter.",84
57,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," The 11 September 2001 atrocity was not just an attack on America; it was an attack on civilisation everywhere. On that day America was under attack not because of its faults but because of its virtues-because of its democracy, because of its pluralism, because of its diversity and because of its decency. America was under attack on that day because of the respect it accorded to women, to minorities, to different religions and to people who challenge social norms. Since September 11, America and its allies have made some mistakes-how could we not?but we have not surrendered the values that made our civilisation a target. Most importantly, we have appreciated that, though the terrorists acted in the name of religion, our enemy was not religion; it was terrorism-it was not Islam; it was extremism. We never made the mistake of thinking that Islam was incompatible with democratic pluralism or blamed all Muslims of ... for the madness of a few. It is this good sense and insight which has enabled the pluralist civilisation to flourish through the war on terror. I venture the hope that the values that were under attack that day, the values we uphold now and the values we will always uphold are not just Western values but universal ones. They are the better angels of all people and all cultures. I close with an example of the magnanimity of which all peoples and all cultures are capable. When Tariq Jahan lost his son, who was senselessly murdered by rioters in Birmingham last month, he did not react by calling for vengeance. He said: … I don't blame the government. I don't blame the police. I don't blame anybody. …… … This is not a race issue. The family has received messages of support from all parts of society. I lost my son. Blacks, Asians, whites-we all live in the same community. That was a marvellous message from a true Muslim, a true Briton and a true member of the civilised world. We all live in the same world. Yes, we must confront evil. We must be defiant in the face of evil, of course. We must be resolute in the face of evil, but we must be generous too and we must seek everywhere the sparks of common humanity if we are to make our world whole and safe.",85

I assured her that the nation was going to be celebrating with her. This is a remarkable sporting triumph, the first Australian woman to win a grand slam event since Evonne Goolagong won Wimbledon in 1980, and the first Australian woman to win the US Open since Margaret Court in 1973.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Justice, Privacy and Freedom of Information will answer questions on his behalf. NA Asylum Seekers",90
68,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by her pre-election commitment that she would never send boat people to any country that had not signed the UN convention on refugees?,90
69,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition's question I say that, as usual, he has missed the point. The point before this parliament today, and what the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer as a test of leadership, is whether he will join with the government in amending the Migration Act so that the government can pursue its determined arrangement with Malaysia to transfer asylum seekers. That is the question before the parliament today. Coming into the parliament today, I did expect to see these kinds of tactics from the opposition, because the Leader of the be Opposition has to face up to a test-whether or not he is just full of slogans and sound bites or whether he will take seriously his questions of Australia's national security. That is the key question after the High Court case: whether or not the Leader of the Opposition will pursue a strategy to wreck in his political interest or whether he will seek to work in the national interest. That is before the parliament for consideration and something the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer. On the question of refugee signatory countries, as the Leader of the Opposition is well aware, the government has entered into an arrangement with Malaysia. And in entering into that arrangement we have negotiated order: on three occasions in this answer the Prime Minister has tried to redefine the question she was asked. It was a very straightforward question: does she stand by the commitment she made before the last election not to send boat people to any other country that had not signed the refugee convention? That is the question that the whole parliament and the country wants an answer to.",90
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister must directly relate her response to the question.,90
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In direct answer to the question: as the Leader of the Opposition is well aware, the government has negotiated an arrangement with Malaysia where the refugee convention obligations this nation has freely assumed will be honoured in respect of the people that we transfer. This is the arrangement, which we have the most clear advice from experts within the Public Service, that will act as the clearest possible deterrent for people smugglers. I say to the Leader of the Opposition who asked this question: I detect hypocrisy here. This is the Leader of the Opposition who, during the election campaign, said his policy, if he were Prime Minister, would be a 'boat phone'-that is, he would make calls to patrol boats as he sat at the Lodge or Kirribilli requiring them to turn boats around. He knew that was not possible, but he was pretending to the Australian people that he would tow those boats back to Indonesia, which is not signatory to the refugee convention. As to the outcome for the people on those boats, he was never going to worry himself about that. So the Leader of the Opposition in the last election campaign marketed a sham policy behind a three-word slogan. If he had been able to implement it, it would have taken asylum seekers to a non-refugee convention signatory country with no protections. The issue now, post the High Court case, is: will the Leader of the Opposition finally deal with the facts of this policy debate and will he ensure, by working with the government to amend the Migration Act, that the government of the day can make the decisions it needs to make to have asylum seekers processed offshore or will he just go on wrecking? This is the test for the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Randall interjecting",90
72,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I ask that the member for Canning withdraw his interjections.",91
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I am unaware of what the member for Canning has said, but usually when somebody has risen to their feet with an objection, it is an indication to me that something may have been said that deserves withdrawal, and it may assist the House if the member for Canning withdraws.",91
74,Mr Randall,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw.,91
75,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. Given that Nauru has signed the refugee convention and Malaysia has not, why is the Prime Minister persisting with a policy that has been rejected by the High Court-and many in her own party-and which offends every principle that she has ever espoused? Further, why didn't the Prime Minister talk to the President of Nauru, when she sat next to him last week, about reopening the Nauru detention centre that is the one proven success in the fight to stop the boats?",91
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: we made available to him a briefing so he could get the facts. He has the facts now. He has the facts from the experts who also served the Howard government. Coming into this parliament and trying to twist the truth just will not cut it. Those experts who sat with the Leader of the Opposition advised him that Nauru will not work. That is what they told him and he screams, 'Give it a go!' He has been told by the best advice available to government that Nauru will not work. He has been told by the best advice available to government that it will cost hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. So the policy proposition he is now putting before the Australian people is that he will rip money off Australian taxpayers to fund a solution that experts have told him will not work. Those same experts told him that Malaysia will send a hard-hitting deterrence message. You cannot have it more simply than that. It is clear that Malaysia will send a powerful message to smash the people-smugglers' business model. It is clear that Nauru will not work. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, just as he does when he is dealing with climate change, it may be that he wants to go before the Australian people and argue in the face of expert advice. He does that with climate change, where he says, 'Don't listen to the scientists.' He does it with climate change where he says, 'Don't listen to the economists.' And now in this area of policy he may well be saying to the Australian people that he rejects out-of-hand the advice of the Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues, the advice of the secretary of the department of immigration. That is a matter for him. He can go and argue that in the Australian community. What he ought not to do is to come to this parliament and not support legislation which would put executive government in the position of being able to make its best decisions about offshore processing. I freely accept that there is a difference between me and the Leader of the Opposition. I have absorbed the facts and the advice and I am acting on them. Those facts and that advice spell out to me that we must do the Malaysia arrangement. The Leader of the Opposition, in denial of the facts, in denial of the advice, insists as it may be, but the proposition that will come before this parliament will be a proposition that will put executive government in the position to implement the policy that it wants to implement. We will implement Malaysia; we will implement a complementary centre in PNG. If the Leader of the Opposition is ever Prime Minister of this country then he can implement Nauru. But what he should not do, and this is the for him, is to deny executive government the legislative authority to make that decision. Ironically, if he goes down that path of wrecking and denying the national interest, he is actually going down a path which would deny any future Liberal government, if it were ever elected, the ability to implement the solution it argues for. It is this point of national interest that the Leader of the Opposition must answer. NA The SPEAKER (14:23): I acknowledge that we have in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Peter MACKay, the Canadian Minister of National Defence, who is here for bilateral defence talks. Minister, you are accompanied by a fine array of braid! But on a more serious note, as we remember those victims of September 11, we note that there were 24 Canadian citizens lost. On an ongoing basis we note that Canada, as part of its contribution to ISAF in Afghanistan, has suffered 157 fatalities. You are a welcome guest today here in the chamber and Canada is a welcome ally. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Asylum Seekers",91
77,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline for the House what steps the government is taking to combat on Nauru. That is people smuggling?,92
78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Blair for his question. As the House is aware and the member for Blair is aware, the government determined a number of months ago to commence negotiations with Malaysia. We did that because we wanted to have a policy with the maximum deterrence effect. We wanted to have a policy that would work to test smash the people smugglers' business model-a policy that would work to deter people from getting on leaky boats and potentially losing their lives at sea; a policy that would build on what was achieved in the regional forum at Bali; a policy that would make possible bringing 4,000 more genuine refugees to this country from Malaysia, many of them people who would have waited years and years for an opportunity for a new start and a new life; a policy so that we would not see people losing their lives, but we would smash the people smugglers' business model and take more genuine refugees. That was the right policy then and it is the right policy now. In order to implement that policy, given the view taken by the High Court, we are determined to come to this parliament and seek to amend the Migration Act. The amendment that we bring to this parliament will be a broad amendment. It will enable this government, as it will enable any government in the future, to implement the policies and plans it believes best in relation to offshore processing. I understand that there is a difference between the government and the opposition on which policy and plan is the best one. The opposition has determined to support as its primary policy a processing centre in Nauru. That is despite the fact that we have clear advice that a centre in Nauru will not work. That is despite the fact that we have clear advice about the hundreds of millions of dollars of cost. That is in defiance of the advice that says people smugglers now know, because of processing on Nauru in the past, that people come from Nauru to this country. People smugglers now know that, of the people who were processed and resettled from Nauru, more than 90 per cent of them came to Australia, and so they are able to say to asylum seekers, whom they seek to prey upon and whose money they want to take, 'If you go to Nauru, you will get to Australia.' I want to send a very different message. I want to send a message which says, 'If you get on a boat then you will go to Malaysia.' We have made a different decision from the opposition, based on facts, based on advice and based on reality. We are not out there trying to pretend that black is white the way that the Leader of the Opposition is. That debate can continue but what is vitally needed in the national interest is putting the Migration Act in a form that puts executive government in the position it believed itself to be prior to the High Court case-that is, that it can implement decisions as it sees fit about offshore processing. We await to hear from the Leader of the Opposition, in this vital area of national interest, whether he will continue with sound bites and slogans or whether he will stump up and work with the government on a solution to the legislative issues that we face as a nation following the High Court case. We await the answer. Asylum Seekers",92
79,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement that Labor would end offshore processing: … because it is costly, unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle. Given your announcement today of a planned processing centre for asylum seekers on Manus Island, on what basis can the Australian people ever believe anything you say?",93
80,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Once again we see that when the opposition has a choice between talking about the future or talking about the past they always live in the past. The Leader of the Nationals seems to be unaware that the policy that he referred to was announced by the government in May. If he is interested in that policy I suggest he catch up with the policy announcements made at that time. NA The SPEAKER (14:30): I inform the House that we have in the galleries today a group of Indigenous students who are here in Canberra under the Work Experience in Government program of the Learn Earn Legend! program. They will be doing work experience in members' offices. On behalf of the House I wish them a warm welcome. Hopefully, for them-as for me-the day will get better after question time. NA Asylum Seekers",93
81,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. What is the most effective deterrent the government can put in place to deter people smuggling and irregular migration to Australia? What other options have been put forward and what would their impact be?,94
82,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I thank the honourable member for Robertson for her question. The answer to the question is that the most effective deterrent for smuggling is the arrangement negotiated between Australia and Malaysia. The advice received by this government has been made available to the opposition. That advice is clear. The advice is that to break the people smugglers' business model you have to take away the product they sell. That advice says,94
83,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is not necessarily the hardest person to hear in this chamber, but on this occasion there was so much other noise it was difficult to hear even his voice. The chamber will remain silent. The minister has the call; he will be heard in silence.",94
85,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The advice is clear. The advice has been made available to the opposition. That advice is that to break the people smugglers' business model it is necessary to remove the product they sell. The product they sell is a better chance of resettlement in Australia. Well over 80 per cent of the people who arrive in Australia by boat begin that boat journey from Malaysia. The most important and clearest message we can send is to return them to where they began that boat journey-not to Nauru, where they will be processed and the vast majority resettled in Australia. This is an arrangement which was been negotiated with Malaysia in consultation with the UNHCR. It involves an increase in our refugee intake and improved protection outcomes across the region. The very clear advice has now been made available to the Leader of the Opposition. We know the Leader of the Opposition is not big on experts. He does not like climate change experts, he does not like legal experts, he does not like experts when it comes to people smuggling. But the advice people has been made clear: an outcome which involves Nauru alone, which would involve over 90 per cent of the people who are resettled from Nauru being resettled in Australia or New Zealand, is no disincentive at all. We know Nauru will not work. We also know that it is an expensive option. The member for Cook said earlier this year that Nauru would cost 'significantly less' than the Malaysia arrangement. The opposition leader said that Nauru could be up and running 'at a relatively low cost'. We know costings are not their strong point but they got this one particularly wrong, because advice released by me on the weekend shows my department's estimate of the cost of a detention facility at Nauru over four years at just under $1 billion. Mr Simpkins interjecting",94
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan is warned!,94
87,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you disagree with that, release your own costings. If the opposition do not agree with that they are free to release their own costings, but I doubt we will see that. This is just the operational cost, not the capital cost. Here is a test for the Leader of the Opposition. Last week the Leader of the Opposition said: I think that our country should have the border protection policy that the government of the day thinks that it needs and I'm prepared to work constructively to give the Government, to restore to the Government, the option of third country offshore processing which it says the High Court and the Solicitor-General have denied to it. The situation is clear. The government believes that it needs the Malaysia arrangement. If the Leader of the Opposition is good to his word and is prepared to work for the national interest he will support legislation to enable the government to break the people smugglers' business model by the arrangement with Malaysia. Asylum Seekers",95
88,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Since the decision of the High Court two weeks ago, has the minister sought to have the government's people-swap deal with Malaysia amended to remove the 800-person cap on asylum seekers to be transferred, or does it remain fixed at 800 persons? Given that 400 people have already arrived illegally by boat in recent weeks, since the agreement was signed, won't this cap soon be exhausted by the people smugglers?",95
89,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The situation is clear. There is an agreement with Malaysia for the transfer of 800 people. That remains. We believe the advice to us, which is that this is the best and most effective way to break the people smugglers' business model. The member for Cook argues that Nauru would be a more effective disincentive. He says it is clear that Malaysia does not work because of the number of people that arrived after the announcement. If that logic applied it would apply to the Nauru announcement of best the previous government. It is interesting to look at the figures: 1,998 people arrived after the announcement of Nauru in the same period",95
90,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. I asked whether the minister had contacted the Malaysian minister to see if he had changed the arrangement to deal with the policy flaw that he knows exists in his own policy.",95
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member is now debating the point of order. The question has been asked, the minister is responding and he knows he has to respond in a directly relevant manner.",95
92,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The situation remains as it has been previously outlined-that is, the governments of Australia and Malaysia have agreed to the transfer of 800 people. The government of Malaysia has made it clear that they would review that arrangement at the end of the transfer of the 800 people, and I welcome the implication from the shadow minister's question that the opposition are prepared to support the government's legislation. Cyclone Yasi",95
93,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that it has now been eight months since Cyclone Yasi devastated Mission Beach and Cardwell, both totally dependent for economic survival to access to the sea, islands and reef? In eight months not a single action has been taken to restore this lost access. This has left 300 kilometres without any safe harbour. The federal government's quick and serious commitment in earmarking $950 million for North Queensland has not been matched by the moribund Queensland flood-not cyclone-recovery authority. In light of this, could the Prime Minister assure the House that this blatant neglect will be addressed and that the PM will make good the government's much appreciated commitment to essential safe harbour facilities at regular intervals along our recreational asset, the Great Barrier Reef, islands and seas?",95
94,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to travel with him to cyclone affected areas and we actually met with a number of people from Mission Beach, who talked to me about the safe harbour arrangements that he describes in the parliament today and which he certainly described to me during the course of that visit. So I do thank him for continuing to represent very strongly and continuously the needs of people in the local area. What I believe the member for Kennedy would agree with is that the reconstruction work from the cyclone is progressing and that funds have been flowing to North Queensland, just as they are flowing in other parts of Queensland. The Cardwell Esplanade and Marine Infrastructure Recovery Project has been officially launched, marking an important step forward in plans to reconstruct Cardwell after the devastating effects of the cyclone. The local mayor, Bill Shannon, who the member for Kennedy and I had an opportunity to talk to when I travelled with him, said on 19 August this year that the launch of that project symbolised a new phase of recovery work for the region and that it was building something new and better for those towns. All of that work has been possible because of the $15 million the state and federal governments have made available. Bill Shannon also said that he felt that restoring Cardwell foreshore to its former beauty and functionality was the best thing that could be done for the town, considering its importance as a tourist attraction and as a recreation and relaxation area for local residents. A 1.4 kilometre section of the Bruce Highway, part of the Cardwell foreshore, and the Clump major Point and Dunk Island Jetty will also be its reconstructed through this package. Regarding the building of marine infrastructure, as raised directly by the member's question, I am aware that he is championing the cause and that he is passionate about building a safe boat harbour at Mission Beach. Earlier this year, he will remember, when he raised the matter with me I said the government would create an interdepartmental committee to look at these issues, and I understand the chair of the committee has met with the member for Kennedy. The committee will report back to the government and inform our consideration on this matter. In the meantime, of course, we will continue to deliver the $5.6 billion that is being provided for reconstruction after the summer of natural disasters and we will continue to work strongly with the cyclone affected communities. I thank the member for his question. Economy",96
95,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer update the House on the latest national accounts and what these accounts say about the strength of the Australian economy?,96
96,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Oxley for his question. The national accounts which were released last week show the underlying resilience of the Australian economy. The June quarter national accounts show that the economy grew by 1.2 per cent in the June quarter. What they showed was a strong bounce back from the natural disasters in Queensland of earlier this year, which the Prime Minister was just talking about-the impact of the floods and the very substantial impact of Cyclone Yasi. Also, they show that there is an underlying strength more broadly right across the Australian economy. What we see is rising incomes, very strong investment and also very solid consumption. Those are the building blocks of a strong economy. If we go through the figures we can see that repeated time and time again. Corporate profits are growing strongly. There is also very solid wages growth. Businesses are investing with confidence, with strong growth in business investment: 1.7 per cent in the quarter and 10.2 per cent through the year. What this shows is an unprecedented investment pipeline that we have been talking about in this House through the past year. We also see that household consumption has been very solid: three per cent plus at trend. You would not necessarily think that was the case when you listen to some of the public commentary. Of course, some areas of the economy are soft, especially in retail, but overall Australians are still spending. Yes, they are saving more, but because their incomes are growing they are still spending at about trend. That was what was so pleasing about those figures. We have seen the unemployment rate tick up a bit, to 5.3 per cent. That is still remarkably low considering what we are seeing elsewhere among developed proud of. economies. But the interesting thing in the figures of last week is that we saw that hours worked also went up. If we were to recalculate what that meant in terms of new jobs this year alone, if those hours had gone to new jobs, there would be 110,000 additional jobs created this calendar year. So, once again, we are seeing the underlying strength that I was talking about before. We have seen 140,000 more Australians in jobs over the past 12 months and we have seen three-quarters of a million new jobs since the government came to office. That is supported by everybody on this side of the House. What all these figures confirm is that the Australian economy continues to outperform the economies of the rest of the developed world. We have done that despite the impact of the natural disasters which had a very big impact on our economy, and we have done it despite the fact that we have had continuing global instability over the past 18 months. I think these figures do serve as a reality check, particularly for those opposite who continue to talk the Australian economy down. For our part, what we celebrate with these figures is that the Australian economy has underlying strength. The Australian economy is one that can show strength despite everything that the world has been throwing at us. So we do have a bright future. We should look at the Australian economy and say that it is like a glass that is more than half full. We should not be saying that the glass is less than half full. These are strengths that serve our country well and that give people the confidence and the security that they can earn a decent income and take home a pay cheque to their family each week. This country has come through the biggest economic crisis we have seen on the globe for 75 years and it has come through with strength. That is something we can all be Asylum Seekers Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (14:46): My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Since the decision of the High Court, has the minister sought any additional protections for asylum seekers to be transferred to Malaysia under the government's people-swap deal? If so, what additional protections have been secured?",96
97,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The answer to the honourable member's question is no, because the government is satisfied with the protections negotiated painstakingly with Malaysia over six months. Employment",98
98,Ms BRODTMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How will the government continue to ensure that Australians have both the benefit and the dignity of work in a changing but strong economy?,98
99,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I sincerely thank the member for her question. It enables me to advise the House that on 6 October the government will host a future jobs forum. It will follow the tax forum. As the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer has just outlined to the House, the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong. Indeed, our economy is the envy of the world. We saw a good growth number. We continue to see unemployment at a far lower rate compared with countries like the US and the UK. We need to remind ourselves that we went into the global financial crisis with an unemployment rate around the same as the American unemployment rate. We have come out of the global financial crisis and into these days beyond with an unemployment rate that is pretty close to half the unemployment rate in the United States of America. So we are able to offer people the benefits and dignity of work, we are able to see growth in our economy and we are seeing rapid growthturbocharged growth-in our resources sector, with more than $400 billion of investment in the pipeline. We understand that this also means that our currency is very high. Our Australian dollar is high and will be high for some period of time to come. That does put pressure on other sectors of the economywhat we have referred to as patchwork pressures. I therefore believe it is important that we bring together representatives of business, of unions, of representative employer organisations and academics to talk about jobs for the future. Our economic fundamentals are strong today, but there is nothing more important to this government than Australians having jobs, which is why we acted so quickly and effectively to support jobs during the global financial crisis. It is why we continue to work to support jobs today. It is why we have put in place the policies and plans that will enable us to see jobs in the future. This includes our work in skills and apprenticeships; our work in human capital generally; our work in rolling out infrastructure in roads, rail and ports; our work in building the National Broadband Network and bringing that new technology to Australia because it will equal new jobs; our work in pricing carbon and the creation of a clean energy future and clean energy jobs; our work with the manufacturing sector to ensure that we continue to be a country that makes thingsand we will continue to resist the opposition's calls to take hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars away from our manufacturing sector. We will resist the opposition's calls to do that because, unlike them, we want to see a country where we continue to make automobiles and engage in high-value-added manufacturing. We believe it is an appropriate time, particularly following the tax forum, to bring together representatives to talk about jobs for the future. The government will be there and will be vitally interested in jobs. Of course, expect the opposition to ignore the whole event because they are not interested in ensuring that Australians have the benefits and dignity of work. Asylum Seekers Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (14:50): My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm reports that almost 30,000 non-residents in Malaysia have been caned between 2005 and 2010? In the wake of the High Court decision, why didn't the government seek new protections for asylum seekers transferred to Malaysia? Will the Prime Minister guarantee that none of the 800 asylum seekers to be transferred to Malaysia under the government's peopleswap plan will be caned?",98
100,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In relation to the question, as the member may well know, we worked hard with Malaysia to negotiate a set of protections for asylum seekers who were transferred to Malaysia or who will be transferred to Malaysia under this arrangements. We negotiated protections in relation to their human rights and we certainly negotiated protections in relation to caning and other human rights questions. But can I also say to the member that I understand that, for political reasons, the opposition will continue to dispute the government's arrangement with Malaysia. I understand that. I understand that the opposition will continue to do that, even though they have now had access to the same advice available to government. That advice has told them-and this cannot be denied; this truth cannot be twisted by the opposition-that the Malaysia arrangement has the best deterrence effect. That advice has told them that Malaysia is the best option. There is no twisting and turning that I gets away from that. That advice is in front of the opposition. They may choose to walk away from that advice. They may choose, in the face of the best possible expert advice, to say: 'We choose the costly solution that won't work. We reject the solution that the experts say will work.' They may choose to send to people smugglers the message that says, 'Go to Nauru and you'll get a ticket to Australia.' They may choose to criticise the government as it sends a message that says, 'If you try to come to Australia, you'll go to Malaysia.' They may choose to play that wrecking politics. That is what we expect from this opposition. We expect them to act as a party of protest. But the question before this parliament is not whether they will continue to play reckless, negative politics-because we know they will. The question before this parliament is whether the words of the Leader of the Opposition can be relied on. He has said, and I quote his words",99
101,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,99
102,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition are always very keen to get into questions of honesty. Mrs Andrews: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to relevance. My question was very specific. It was in relation to caning of nonresidents in Malaysia and whether or not the Prime Minister was prepared to guarantee",99
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will relate her material directly and relevantly to the question.,99
104,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question of course can only be properly answered in this way: the government will be bringing legislation to this parliament to give executive government the power it needs to have offshore processing. We will be relying on the words of the Leader of the Opposition when he said: I think that our country should have the best border protection policy that the government of the day thinks that it needs and I'm prepared to work constructively to give the Government, to restore to the Government, the option of third country offshore processing which it says the High Court and the Solicitor-General have denied to it. The real question before the member is whether she wants to join with the Leader of the Opposition in playing reckless politics or whether they want to act in the national interest and amend the legislation. The question is whether or not they are in any way serious about stopping the boats. Carbon Pricing Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:55): question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the government's clean energy future plan? Why is it important to take action on climate change now and what are the impediments to this?",99
105,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Two months ago the government released a plan for a clean energy future for Australia, and of course there has been considerable discussion of the plan since its release. It will ensure that Australia takes action to tackle climate change in the most economically efficient and environmentally effective manner. We developed this policy because the science on climate change is clear: climate change is occurring; human activity is contributing; and if it is left unchecked the Australian economy and our environment would be severely affected. No government acting responsibly can ignore that advice. A government must act, and this government has acted. A carbon price is the cheapest and most effective way to cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy. It will create innovation. It will drive productivity improvements in our economy. It will reduce the emissions intensity of our economy. It will improve our long-term competitiveness. The carbon price will allow us to fulfil our obligation to future generations and to meet our responsibility to do a fair share to tackle climate change within and in partnership with the international community-and we must never lose sight of that responsibility as parliamentarians. We released draft legislation last month and we have received over 300 submissions My in response. We will be introducing the legislation to this House tomorrow. We have been debating these issues for decades. There have in fact been no fewer than 35 parliamentary inquiries into climate change since 1994. So we have been debating this now for 17 years in our parliament. The time for inaction has passed. It is time for the parliament to take the practical steps to cut pollution and drive the investment that we need in clean energy and energy efficiency. It is extremely important for the business community, because business needs the certainty over climate change policy. Business needs the certainty of the carbon price mechanism and what the carbon price will be so that it can invest in long-lived assets, in particular in sectors like the energy generation sector. Notwithstanding all of the inquiries, all of the evidence, the science and the imperatives to act economically, the Leader of the Opposition opposes action on climate change. He attacks the scientists. He attacks the economists. He runs a baseless fear campaign in the community. He talks the economy down. He undermines consumer sentiment. He creates insecurity amongst working people about their jobs. He goes around terrifying pensioners. He makes false claims designed to frighten small business people, falsely claiming cost increases that will never materialise. The Leader of the Opposition should stop his baseless fear campaign and support an important reform. Mr Ewen Jones interjecting",100

107,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let's not forget that John Howard, the former Prime Minister, supported a carbon price through emissions trading and took that policy to the last federal election that he contested, in 2007. Of course, in the last parliament, the government reached agreement with the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, about this policy issue. It has fundamentally been the destructive and opportunistic behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition that has impeded this parliament dealing with this issue-and deal with it we will. (Time expired) Asylum Seekers",101
108,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. At any stage of his discussions on his five-for-one people swap deal with Malaysia, did the minister request the Malaysian government to change their laws or ratify any international conventions to specifically provide protection to refugees and asylum seekers sent to Malaysia? Was any indication ever given that Malaysia would be prepared to change these laws before he signed Australia up to it?",101
109,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Isn't it interesting: the more advice the opposition get that Malaysia is the most effective deterrent, the more they are determined to undermine it.

What we negotiated is work rights for the people transferred. What we negotiated is that people will be treated with dignity and respect in accordance with human rights standards. The member for Cook knows this because he went on a little fact-finding mission to Malaysia. He went on a little trip and took a little home video, which was very thoughtful. He stood outside a detention centre and said, 'This is where people will be sent.' Wrong. He said, 'People wouldn't have work rights.' Wrong. He was proven wrong on every single point.

How has this approach been received and what is the government's response?,102
121,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Moreton for a very important question. The top priority for this government is to build a strong economy that provides high-value, high-paid jobs to Australians. In the 21st century, those economies that will be successful, those firstimportant class economies, will be those that are substantially driven by clean energy, and most particularly renewable energy. That is the importance of the package that we are putting before the Australian people. The clean energy package that we are putting forward will provide the certainty to invest. Dr Jensen interjecting",102
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the member for Tangney I do not have to warn him!,102
123,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are firing the starter's gun for the investment across a whole new lot of areas of innovation, particularly clean energy jobs, which will come across wide sectors of our economy. This initiative builds on what we have been doing so far. It builds on putting in I think place the NBN, another very important initiative to lift the productivity of our economy. It builds on the $3 billion package which was at the core of our recent budget to invest in the skills, education and training of our people. And, of course, it builds on what we are doing in taxation reform to make sure we give a tax break to those 2.7 million small businesses out there and to make a cut to the company tax rate. This is a fundamental reform and it is in the tradition of the other big fundamental reforms that have made the Australian economy much more resilient. As I was saying before, the Australian economy is resilient, and one of the reasons it has been resilient is that governments in the eighties and the nineties in this country put in place a raft of reforms that have built that underlying strength. This is one of those reforms-a reform that we need to stay ahead of the game, to get the investment going into clean energy technologies to create the jobs of the future. Under our clean energy package there will be 1.6 million jobs created over the period to 2020. They will come from very projects such as our investment in solar power up in Chinchilla or at Moreevery important projects not just in terms of construction but in terms of how they will drive the innovation for the future. All of these projects are a small step but an important step in making sure that we grab the opportunities of the 21st century in clean energy, just as they are doing it in other countries right around the world-in Denmark, in Germany, in China and right around the region. We must make this reform so we are not left behind. What that really means is that decision makers have to front up to their responsibilities. They ignore the facts. They cannot ignore the case for investing in clean energy through putting a price on carbon and the fact that it is the most efficient way to do that. Those on the other side of the House want to deny the facts. They want to put their heads in the sand. They want to reject the 21st century. They do not understand the importance of clean energy. We on this side of the House understand the importance of getting the economic settings right so we can be prosperous in the 21st century and deliver the high-value, high-paid jobs all Australians deserve. Asylum Seekers Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:08): My question is to the Prime Minister. Former Prime Minister Mr Rudd stated in 2007 that the government needs to be willing to turn back boats on the high seas if it is to discourage people smugglers. Does the Prime Minister agree with this statement of the member for Griffith?",102
124,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Of course, what we want to achieve is effective turnarounds. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition must know is that the people smugglers' business model has changed. They do not sit in the boats now enabling our Navy and patrol boat personnel to turn the boats around. There is not a way of going out to sea and turning the boats around and taking them to Indonesia, for two reasons. Reason No. 1: the transnational crime of people smuggling, like other transnational crimes, mutates in the way that it goes about its business, depending on enforcement techniques. Knowing that boats are at risk of being turned around, what happens now is that people disable boats. So you are left with a stark choice: do you leave people to drown at sea or do you go and pick cannot them up? Well, we are Australian. We go and pick them up-of course we do. Then, of course, the attitude of Indonesia has changed. Indonesia does not take boat returns. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claims some expertise in foreign affairs. I know the Leader of the Opposition doubts it and he is looking to the member for Kooyong to take her job, but she must know that Indonesia does not take boat returns any longer and she must understand the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition pretending that Indonesia will take boat returns, pretending that boats can be turned around and taken to a non refugee signatory country, with no protections negotiated. And then they come in here and bleatMs Julie Bishop: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a simple question. I asked if she agreed with the statement of the member for Griffith. Does she agree with his statement?",103
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As in the past, there is no way that the chair can dictate the way in which the response is made, whether it is made by one word or by many, but the main thing is that the answer must be directly relevant. The Prime Minister is responding directly to the question.",103
126,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs about turning boats around and I am explaining the factual circumstances. I know the opposition does not like facts, but facts are important. We have heard bleating today about human rights issues-bleat, bleat, bleat from the opposition-when the policy that they went to the last election with was that the Leader of the Opposition would direct patrol boat commanders to take boats to Indonesia, not refugee signatories, and he would not have cared less what happened to them afterwards-men, women and children. To pretend that he did is absurd nonsense. The hypocrisy of this is truly remarkable. The shadow minister for immigration is on the record saying he does not care less about refugee signatory countries. So the answer to the deputy leader's question is this: I so much agree with the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that turning boats around is effective deterrence that I have worked with the minister for immigration in the modern circumstances where the crime of people smuggling has changed and where the attitude of Indonesia is different-I have worked with the minister for immigration to create a circumstance where, in effect, we are turning boats around-that is, people come here and they end up on a plane. It is the same process. They believe they are coming to Australia but they end up somewhere else. It is a virtual turnaround boats.

133,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (15:13): I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She knows that this government has been very of active in supporting pensioners to make sure we can do everything possible to help them balance their budgets. Of course, we intend to support pensioners again by providing real and permanent increases to the pension as we put a price on carbon. By contrast, of course, this Leader of the Opposition is determined to do everything he possibly can to leave pensioners behind in his desperate scramble for the Lodge. Of course, we know it was this Leader of the Opposition in the previous Howard government that let the pension decline over 12 years that they were in government. It was this Leader of the Opposition, when he was a member of the Howard cabinet, who actually refused to increase the pension-refused and opposed a proposal to increase the pension that came before their cabinet. Now this Leader of the Opposition is proposing to leave pensioners behind yet again. He wants to claw back the pension increase that this government will deliver to pensioners as part of our carbon reforms. It was this Leader of the Opposition who, when asked at a doorstop in Perth whether he would claw back the pension increases that we are delivering, said, 'I no apologies for saying ""yes"".' This Leader of the Opposition, as he wanders off, does not care two hoots about pensioners. He is the one who is going to claw back the pension increase that we intend to give to pensioners. Under our plan we intend to deliver an increase to 3.4 million Australian pensioners to make sure that they get the protection and increases they need in their pensions. Pensioners will actually get, through a new Clean Energy Advance, a lump-sum payment which the opposition intends to claw back-to take back-from pensioners. There will be an increase of $250 for single pensioners, which will be clawed back by the Leader of the Opposition, and an increase of $180 for each member of a couple, which of course will be clawed back by those opposite.",104

137,Mr HAYES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. What action is the Australian government taking with the international community to ensure the reduction of carbon emissions from ships? Minister, what evidence is there that the world is acting to address climate change?",105
138,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:18): I thank the member for Fowler for his question. Indeed the world is acting on climate change, contrary to what those opposite have to say. On 15 July maritime countries agreed to the first ever shipping emissions regulations. Fifty-five of the world's biggest seafaring countries agreed at the International Maritime Organisation to reduce climate emissions from shipping with a global agreement to reduce energy use in new vessels from 2013 onwards. Of course, Australia as a founding member of the IMO was a key player in this action. This agreement represents the first ever mandatory global greenhouse gas reduction regime for an international industry sector. It is an international industry sector that has come together, regardless of nationality, to put in place an international regulatory regime to take action on climate change. The agreement will force all ships over 400 tonnes built after 2013 to improve their efficiency by 10 per cent, rising to 20 per cent between 2020 and 2024 and 30 per cent for ships delivered after 2024. This agreement is expected to lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions in shipping of 45 to 50 million tonnes a year by the year 2020. We know that there are economic productivity gains from good action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as is the case with shipping. There will be savings of some $5 billion a year by 2020, once again reinforcing this government's view that good environmental policy is also good economic policy. Shipping currently accounts for about three to four per cent of man-made CO2 emissions worldwide. This figure is expected to rise by six per cent by 2020, with emissions doubling by 2050 if no action is taken. It is consistent with this government's view, which is why we have also promoted a shipping policy that will support coastal shipping and support greater use of shipping as the most greenhouse-gas-efficient transport mode around our coast. This is another example of the government's good environmental policy. Taking action on climate change is consistent with international action and is good for jobs and good for our economy. Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (15:21): My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister detail the inquiries she or her office have made into the almost daily revelations in the media of the misuse of union members' funds by the leadership of the Health Services Union including by the member for Dobell?

That proper process should work through to its conclusion. I will continue to take that view consistently about Labor members in this parliament and about Liberal members in this parliament. Of course, the member for Sturt, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally are stuck in hypocrisy on this question. Environmental Conservation",106
140,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Would the minister update the House on the government's recent actions to improve the protection of Australia's unique environment. How have these been received and what is the government's response?",106
141,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (15:23): I of thank the member for Capricornia for the question. During the parliamentary break over the last fortnight I was able on behalf of the government to sign off on the largest ever National Heritage listing on land in the West Kimberley. What we have done there has been consistent with a long legacy of environmental protection, whether it be going back to the Franklin River, Kakadu National Park or the Daintree Rainforest. In the Kimberley with the National Heritage listing we have some of the most spectacular parts of our continent: the Buccaneer Archipelago, with some of the highest tides in the world-there were 11-metre tides on the day I was there-where waterfalls are formed between the islands simply at the change of tide each day; the magnificent gorges in that great pathway along the Gibb River Road; and the Mighty Fitzroy River. For 200 kilometres, stretching alongside that West Kimberley coast, we have the most extraordinary trail of dinosaur footprints. We have an internationally regarded, extraordinary trail of dinosaur footprints which go to a level of heritage not found elsewhere on the continent. There are great stories of Indigenous cultural heritage: as well as the battle at Noonkanbah Station and Jandamarra, we also have the extraordinary story there of Fossil Downs Station and the pastoral industry, the largest overland droving expedition in the history of the nation. Unsurprisingly, when environmental outcomes of this nature are happening, they met with an objection from the Liberal premier. Forgetting that this originated from an agreement with the WA governmentthat was how it all started-we had objections from the Liberal premier claiming that we were going to jeopardise petrol stations, towns, camps, rubbish tips and bottle shops with a heritage listing. I make clear, in case the WA government has not caught up with it, that no garbage tips and no bottle shops or petrol stations were heritage listed. But some of the most extraordinary and special parts of Australian history and Australia's heritage formed part of that heritage listing. A heritage listing of itself is not a lockup-it does not mean that development cannot occur. But it does mean that, when development does occur, it has to take account of the values which have formed part of that listing. Across the 19 million hectares of the West Kimberley there are values which should properly be borne in mind in any future development applications. It does mean that the aspirations of some, including the WA Premier, who have talked about Broome becoming a future Dubai, will not see wholesale development throughout the Kimberley. It does mean that the area will not be wrecked. It does mean that the Kimberley will not-and the WA Premier has suggested that this would be a good thing-end up looking like the Pilbara. But it does mean that, within the West Kimberley, the values that should be protected will be protected. Just as when we protected the Franklin, the Liberals opposed it; just as when we protected Kakadu, the Liberals opposed it; just as when we protected the Daintree Rainforest, the Liberals opposed it; so, too, when we protect the West Kimberley, the Liberal premier opposes it. When the Libs win, the pathway is the same: the environment always loses. Whether you are looking at the national parks at the moment, where they are trying to turn them into cattle farms or turn the river red gum forests into places that are simply there for the collection of firewood, the pathway is the same. Good environmental outcomes only come when government is on the Labor side of the House. Ms Gillard: I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",106

NA United States of America: Terrorist Attacks",108
151,Mr MCCLELLAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition noted earlier, yesterday marked 10 years since the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States of America. Even 10 years on, the events of that day are difficult to comprehend. The death and destruction caused by those acts of premeditated terror must always be remembered for what they Act were-horrific crimes committed against innocent people. We must remember the victims and the loved ones left behind. We should also remember extraordinary courage of the police officers, fire fighters and other emergency responders who risked, and in many cases gave, their lives to rescue others. The memory of those who lost their lives and the pain of their families strengthens our resolve to protect our communities from terrorism and to stop the spread of ideologies of hate and violence. Remembering the victims of terrorism The 10th anniversary of September 11 is a time for our nation to remember not only the victims of those attacks but also the victims of terrorism around the world since then. Sadly, we have seen terrible events in the Middle East, Africa, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, the United Kingdom, Spain and many other parts of the world. The recent July 2011 attack in Norway reminds us that terrorism is an international crime and that no country is immune from this threat. Indeed, Australians have been directly affected by terrorism and violent extremism over the past decade. Since 2001, more than 110 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks overseas, including 88 people in the first Bali bombings of 2002. In pausing to reflect on the decade that has passed, we remember these Australians who lost their lives in senseless acts of violence. We must honour these Australians by learning the lessons from the attacks that caused their untimely deaths, so we can reduce the risk of further attacks, both within Australia and overseas. Australia's National Security-a decade after September 11 2001 The September 11 attacks on the United States changed the global security environment probably forever. While terrorism continues to threaten peace and security, Australia is better equipped to deal with it now than we were a decade ago. the The Australian government's highest priority must always be to protect the safety and security of its citizens. In partnership with our international friends and allies, we have acted decisively to strengthen our national security and reduce the risk of terrorism and extremist violence. We have done this by identifying and addressing our vulnerabilities, and creating effective layers of security both domestically and globally. Since September 11, spending on national security has increased significantly in response to this challenge. Investment in national security (including defence) has increased from approximately $18 billion in 2001-02 to over $33 billion in 2011-12, around $7 billion of that on domestic security matters. The government has adopted a comprehensive, holistic counterterrorism strategy which is essential to these efforts. We have enhanced intelligence, investigative and law enforcement capabilities. We are building strategic partnerships with businesses and the broader community to protect critical infrastructure, including technological and cybersecurity. We are ensuring we have strong laws to deal with those who prepare for or carry out acts of terrorism. We are continually these improving international legal cooperation and intelligence sharing in relation to counter-terrorism. And we are strengthening preventive measures to counter violent extremism before it takes seed. Intelligence Effective intelligence, information sharing and law enforcement are essential in the effort to defeat terrorists. Domestically and overseas our intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies have worked together tirelessly to detect and disrupt threats to our national security. This collaboration, perseverance and vigilance have averted tragedy on our own shores. Since 2000, four major terrorist plots have been disrupted in Australia. To date, 38 individuals have been prosecuted as a result of counter-terrorism operations and, while some matters are still before the courts, 22 have been convicted. One can only imagine what might have happened if the plans of these individuals had been successfully carried out, not only in personal and destruction to property but also the damage that it would have done to our vibrant multicultural community and culture of tolerance. Our response to the threat of terrorism involves every level government. This approach reflects the shared understanding of all levels of government that national security is not simply a Commonwealth policy issue. Countering violent extremism and building resilience The Australian government, like its counterparts in the United States and United Kingdom, understands that addressing the causes of radicalisation that lead to violent extremism is crucial to tackling terrorism in the future. Immediately after the September 11 attacks there was much focus on international law enforcement, tough terrorism laws, and physical security measures, all of which have delivered results through the detection and deterrence of terrorist activity. What was less appreciated was that a strong counterterrorism response is needed, and that strong counterterrorism response requires strategies to lessen the appeal of extremist ideologies that fuel terrorism in the first place. While terrorism seeks to divide and destroy by raising fear, it fails when communities work together to build upon and adhere to our shared principles and values, and remain united and resilient in partnership. Security experts warn that the greatest threat to Australia is, in fact, homeeach grown extremism. Agencies like ASIO and the Australian Federal Police do an excellent job in helping to keep Australia safe. But they can't do it alone. The government's Countering Violent Extremism program works with these agencies and local communities to prevent radicalisation of those in Australia who are targeted by injury, death extremist messages. All community leaders have a responsibility to assist in building our tolerant and inclusive society that is itself a powerful tool against the emergence of of extremism. Communities have many roles to play, including identifying and supporting vulnerable individuals who may choose a path away from violence, and developing localised solutions to address vulnerabilities and grievances, and the government expresses its appreciation for the support it has received from relevant communities. Laws and enforcement September 11 showed us we must be prepared to identify and combat threats to our national security that are within and extend between nations, economies, businesses, communities and individuals. We need to continually examine, review and calibrate our laws and practices to ensure we properly equip our security and intelligence agencies and that we focus their efforts appropriately to meet the challenges and threats within Australia and also internationally. In 2010 and 2011 the government amended national security legislation to ensure that our law enforcement and security agencies have the tools that they need to fight terrorism, while ensuring the laws and powers are balanced by appropriate safeguards and accountability measures. These amendments were also designed to ensure these agencies are better able to assist other and share information and to have secondment between agencies of relevant officers and employees-while at the same time maintaining the principle of privacy and respect for personal liberty. The appointment of an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Mr Bret Walker SC, reflects the Australian government's commitment to ensuring our national security and counterterrorism laws provide a balanced and proportionate response to the threat of terrorism. And because we live in a highly globalised environment which makes it easier for malicious actors to operate from overseas, the government is strongly focused on enhancing international legal and law enforcement cooperation-so laws designed to counter terrorism are connected and harmonised between nations. Conclusion While the attacks of September 11 2001 killed thousands, the decade that has followed shows us that terrorism has not and cannot undermine our way of life. Osama bin Laden's death was an important milestone in the international fight against anti-Western, transnational terrorism, and a blow to the morale of al-Qaeda and those it inspires. But as President Obama reminded us: … his death does not mark the end of our In concluding today, let me say that terrorists can kill, maim and destroy property, but noone can weaken our values of humanity and freedom, or our belief in democracy and the rule of law, and this is unquestionably the greatest weapon we have against terrorism. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Stirling to speak for 10½ minutes. Leave granted.",108
152,Mr MCCLELLAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Keenan speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 10½ minutes. Question agreed to.,111
153,Mr KEENAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I thank the Attorney for his statement. Today being the 10th anniversary of the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, it is very appropriate that the parliament mark and acknowledge the event, as we did at the start of question time today. On this anniversary it is particularly appropriate that we remember the thousands of innocent people killed and their loved ones who are left behind. We should particularly remember the Australians who were amongst those killed in this tragedy. We should also remember the incredible courage of those police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel who risked-and in some cases lost-their lives trying to rescue others. The coalition joins with the government in asserting that the memory of those who lost their lives only strengthens our resolve to protect Australians from terrorist attack and to stop the spread of ideologies of violence and hate which breed such attacks. As was noted by President Obama of the United States in his letter to the Prime Minister today, former coalition Prime effort. Minister John Howard was in Washington when the terrorists struck the US on September 11. From that time, the former coalition government provided over $10.4 billion of funding up to the 2010-11 year to enhance Australia's national security and counterterrorism capabilities by: increasing the capacity of our intelligence agencies; boosting Australia's aviation, maritime and border security; and enhancing our capacity to respond to and manage emergencies. In government, the coalition increased regional and global cooperation in law enforcement, customs activities and legal assistance to boost the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. The fact that there have been no terrorist attacks on Australian soil and few involving Australians abroad testifies to our substantial success. In this vital area, it is important that the Gillard government continue to build on the good work of its predecessor. Keeping the Australian people safe is the most basic task of government. It was my great privilege to be a member of a coalition government which left Australia economically, militarily and diplomatically stronger than it had ever been. The coalition agrees that antiterrorism intelligence operations are indeed a vitally important element of our national security infrastructure. Thanks to the hard working men and women of our law enforcement and security agencies, Australia's counterterrorism capability is extensive and the public can be confident that any terrorism incident can be responded to and dealt with effectively. On the 10th anniversary of September 11, we reflect on the thousands of lives that were lost. As former Prime Minister John Howard said: Terrorists oppose nations such as the United States and Australia not because of what we have done but because of who we are and because of the values that we hold in common. These values of freedom and democracy are values that are worth fighting to protect. Mr Howard's trip to Washington on 11 September 2001 had been timed to mark the 50th anniversary of the ANZUS military alliance which commits Australia, New Zealand and the United States to come to the support of each other if their countries are attacked. The decision of the Australian government to invoke article 4 of the ANZUS Treaty following the 11 September attacks was a testament to the closeness of the relationship between the United States and Australia. The coalition strongly believes that the ANZUS Treaty is of fundamental importance to both our countries, and the goodwill and mutual support implicit within it should never be taken for granted. Former President Bush, speaking at the Ground Zero commemoration service earlier today, quoted the words of Abraham Lincoln over century and a half ago when he sought to console a mother who had lost all five of her sons in the Civil War. President Bush, who was president on 11 September, said Abraham Lincoln 'understood the cost of sacrifice, and reached out to console those in sorrow as best he could'. In a November 1860 letter to Lydia Bixby, Lincoln wrote in one passage quoted by Bush: I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom. The remark follows another moving passage Lincoln wrote: I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save. For the surviving members of the families of the victims of 9-11 these are moving words, particularly so for the literally hundreds of firefighters and police who died running into the burning twin towers that day. It is important that we remember that no terrorist act large or small will weaken our commitment to democracy and freedom. Nobody should underestimate how much the world has changed since 11 September 2001. However, it is vital on this anniversary that we reaffirm and remind ourselves that the terrorists have not and will not succeed in their goals. We have faced their challenge head on and we continue to prevail. On this anniversary I thank all the hard working men and women of the Australian security, intelligence and military agencies who have protected our freedom since that day. (Quorum formed) Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (15:51): I rise to speak in support of the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. The bill provides for the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office and the appointment and functions of a parliamentary budget officer. The bill is based on the unanimous recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office. The Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office was established shortly after the swearing in of the 43rd Parliament and was charged with the objective of examining the proposal to establish a parliamentary budget office, to report no later than 31 March 2011. The committee made 28 recommendations, from the broad recommendation to establish a Parliamentary Budget Office dedicated to serving the Australian parliament through to detailed recommendations as to how the Parliamentary Budget Office should be established to ensure appropriate authority, independence and accountability. The role of the proposed Parliamentary Budget Office, along with resourcing and physical location, was also dealt with in the committee's recommendations. As a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office, I congratulate the government for acting promptly on the recommendations of the committee and for having this matter now before the parliament for legislative consideration. I heard the member for Goldstein complaining earlier in this debate BILLS that it has taken a whole 12 months to get to this point, but the fact is that within a matter of weeks after the parliament was formed 2011 this committee was established and it handed down its report at the end of March. In fact, it has only taken a matter of months for this legislation to be drafted to ensure that we can get the Parliamentary Budget Office up and running. This bill seeks to amend the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, which governs the parliamentary departments, and other acts to establish the Parliamentary Budget Office and the position of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as well as the purpose, functions and governance of the Parliamentary Budget Office. The bill covers the PBO, as it is known, to ensure that it will be independent and dedicated to serving the Australian parliament through the provision of non-partisan and policy neutral analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of policy proposals. Through the PBO, the bill will enhance the credibility and transparency of Australia's already strong fiscal and budget frameworks and it will promote greater understanding in the community about the budget and fiscal policy. Most importantly, it will ensure that the Australian public can be better informed about the budget impact of policies proposed by members of the parliament, particularly during elections. The PBO will also help ensure that the Australian people are never again put in the situation they were at the last election when we saw the Liberal Party try to hide its $11 billion budget black hole. It is important to take the House through some of the key elements of this bill. Firstly, the bill will establish the Department of the Parliamentary Budget Office as a fourth parliamentary department. It was noted by the joint select committee that the majority of proponents for a PBO strongly support establishing, through dedicated legislation, the office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer as an independent officer of the parliament, similar to the Auditor-General. The government supported this view. The functions of the Parliamentary Budget Officer are outlined in the bill's proposed new section 64E, which prescribes: (1) The Parliamentary Budget Officer has the following functions: (a) outside the caretaker period for a general election-to prepare policy costings on request by Senators or Members of the House of Representatives under section 64H; (b) during the caretaker period for a general election-to prepare policy costings on request by authorised members of Parliamentary parties or independent members under section 64J; (c) to prepare responses (other than policy costings) to requests relating to the budget by Senators or Members of the House of Representatives; (d) to prepare submissions to inquiries of Parliamentary committees on request by such committees; (e) to conduct, on his or her own initiative (including in anticipation of requests referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d)), research on and of the budget and fiscal policy settings. Proposed section 64F outlines what the arrangements will be for obtaining information from Commonwealth bodies. This bill will allow the PBO to access information from Australian government agencies through a negotiated memorandum of understanding in circumstances where the release of information is consistent with other legislative requirements, including being guided by the principles established under the Freedom of Information Act. This is consistent with recommendation 13 of the joint committee. The committee favoured a memorandum of understanding over a compulsion to provide information on the ground that it would facilitate more productive working relationships between the PBO and government agencies. We have heard that the coalition is proposing amendments and that it has also submitted a private member's bill to give the Parliamentary Budget Officer power to direct agencies to provide information. The committee flagged concerns with providing these powers to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, including the potential for this to inhibit productive working relationships with government agencies. The coalition would give the officer powers to access information despite any other law and there would be no controls over the officer then disclosing information it receives to members and senators if it relates to their request. This is, of course, quite contrary to the coalition's arguments that there should not be costings released in relation to publicly released policy commitments during an election or policy costings requested by various members and senators, as outlined in the proposed bill. However, when the coalition talks about the powers of the PBO to get information from departments it is a very analysis different story. It wants to give the Parliamentary Budget Officer full powers to investigate and to have no restrictions on disclosure of that information. The committee considered that the relationship of the Parliamentary Budget Officer with government agencies would be crucial to its success not only because the PBO would require information and data held by government agencies but also because it may need the assistance of agencies in making the best use of that information and data. This is outlined at paragraph 4.103 of the committee's report. The committee goes on to state at paragraph 4.104: Further, there may be instances where, by working together on the kinds of information required, the agencies can better understand the ongoing needs of the PBO. The relationships between the PBO and Government agencies might also evolve over time, possibly leading to greater efficiencies and enhanced products for Senators, Members and committees. Despite this being the unanimous view of committee members from both sides of the parliament we have seen opposition members come before this chamber today arguing the complete opposite and putting up no argument as to why the comments, findings and recommendations made by the committee should not be followed. Other key provisions proposed in this bill, importantly, go to costings. The first one is 64J, which deals with requests for costings of policies during caretaker mode. There has been a lot of discussion from opposition members who have spoken on this bill in relation to 64J and the public release, 64L. Clause 64J extends rights to have policies costed during an election. It allows for minor parties and Independents to get their respective publicly announced policy commitments costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. And 64L applies in relation to a policy costing request that is made under 64J before polling day during the caretaker period for a general election. Proposed section 64L(2) states: As soon as practicable after a policy costing request has been made, and before polling day the election, the Officer is required to release publicly the request and the policy costing. This is the point that the opposition are so opposed to and are seeking to amend. They believe that there should be an independent body. They believe in election costings, so they say, but they are arguing that these costings should not be publicly released. This goes against what the Liberal Party have believed in in previous decades, including when they were in government. In fact, in the explanatory memorandum for the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill circulated by Mr Costello on 11 December 1996, Mr Costello stated, in relation to the importance of transparency, 'The intention of part 8 of the charter is to make available to both the government and the opposition, resources of the departments of the Treasury and Finance during the caretaker period to cost election commitments so that the public can be made fully aware of the fiscal impact of such commitments.' Mr Costello also said: This is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will be a permanent feature, making sure that Australia's economic policy is run better, making sure that the public is kept better informed, making sure that there is transparency in economic policy in this country. The member for Goldstein has argued today about what happened during the 2010 election. The Liberal Party's view is that the methodology of the costings was flawed and that they came under scrutiny through the media as a consequence of their costings. But the fact is that they are not standing here today arguing about the methodology of the new costings, which is dealt with in a number of sections in this bill. They could have argued about the methodology and said what they believe in, despite what is set out in 64G relating to approaches et cetera to be used in preparing policy costings, but they are not. This is not about costings; this is not about for methodology. This is about the costings of the Liberal Party's policies being released to the public. They believe in accountability and transparency when it suits them but when it comes to election time they just do not want anyone to know. I have outlined some of the key reforms. There is some argument from the opposition in relation to policy costings outside of the caretaker mode. A number of members of the opposition have stood in this House today and tried to argue that requests by individual members and senators will be publicly released so that there is no confidentiality at all. They have argued around why this is wrong but they have completely ignored-I would say it is deliberate and if it is not deliberate they have not read the bill-the fact that the bill clearly states, consistent with the recommendations of the committee, that prima facie the Parliamentary Budget Office will release costings and requests publicly, but that is unless the member or senator makes a request that it be kept confidential",111
154,Mr Briggs,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Outside caretaker mode. Mrs D'ATH: outside of caretaker mode. I hear the member for Mayo interject. The fact is that there are members, including the shadow Treasurer, who have stood here today at the dispatch box and tried to argue that no such provision exists. The shadow Treasurer tried to argue here that even outside of caretaker mode these things would be released. In fact, that is ignoring what the bill actually outlines. The fact is the bill makes provision, consistent with the recommendations, for confidentiality. Those confidentiality provisions do not exist in one area, and that has to do with caretaker mode. Why? Because the government believes that it is extremely important that all parties who release their policies while we are in caretaker mode should also publicly release the costings for those policies. Major parties cannot run around and announce policies during caretaker mode and then not have to explain the costings to anyone. The public has a right to know what those costings are. The fact is that time and time again opposition members have stood up in this House today and argued that that information should not be publicly released. Why? They do not like what happened in 2010, when they were shown to have a massive black hole. They do not ever again want to have their black holes shown up in relation to budget shortfalls or anything else. The fact is that the public have a right to know. The government is more than happy to put its costings up in relation to its publicly announced policies, as should the opposition. They should stop trying to use this bill, and their private member's bill, as a way of getting around that. This is not an opportunity. They should stand by what Mr Costello said when he introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty and looked at this area. He said that it is important to have this part of public policy be transparent. It should go on indefinitely. It does not matter who is in government it should be the practice that these costings are publicly released.",116
155,Mr BRIGGS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I enjoy following the member for Petrie and her contributions to this place and working with her on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. But I will just bring her up on a couple of points that she made in her contribution to the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. She made the point at the end of her contribution about the Charter of Budget Honesty and black holes. Of course, that was born of the great, famous Labor black hole from the 1996 election campaign, when the former Labor government did not tell the truth about the state of the budget leading into the 1996 election campaign, leading to the need for specific legislation to deal with the dishonesty of the former Labor government and to ensure that an opposition coming into government would at least know before an election what numbers they might be dealing with, rather than being faced with a $10 billion black hole following an election, as the Howard-Costello team were when they were elected in 1996-as colleagues on this side of the chamber well remember. The member makes an interesting point when referring back to former Treasurer Peter Costello and trying to make the political point that the Labor Party are somehow the holders of all virtue when it comes to pre-election costings of their policies. It was not so in government up until 1996, and it certainly was not so when they were in opposition. This is an extremely important bill for the well-functioning operation democracy. It is very difficult on the opposition side of the chamber to undertake and develop significant policy reform in this country without understanding the fiscal costs of the policies. There is no doubt about that. I see the shadow minister for the environment sitting at the table. He of course has a very significant responsibility in a difficult area, and it is only fair and right he, like other members of this place on this side, should have access to detailed and comprehensive information relating to the policies being considered for putting before the Australian people. If we want to put the reforms into place in this country which will help our next generation and will help us all achieve what we wish-which is to leave this place in better shape than what we found it-we should be arming MPs on all sides with the tools to be able to do so, in my view. Such a reform was announced by the former Leader of the Opposition in a budget-in-reply speech some time ago. That reform is long past being necessary-it is now time for it to be enacted. It is a pity that it has taken the opposition moving a private member's bill in this place today for the government to finally get its act into gear. It has been a long time waiting for this bill, and the one we see before us today is a flawed version of what it should have been. Fundamentally and essentially what a parliamentary budget office should be able to do is provide independent and genuine third-party analysis of the fiscal impact of parties' policies, not just leading into an election campaign, in a caretaker period, but during the term. The media and the general public are increasingly demanding, particularly right now, that those of us engaged in the policy debate begin to outline how we think the economic future and well-being of our of our country will be managed. That is an important debate for us to have, and it is an important duty of an opposition to outline its alternative. It is not possible to outline your alternative in a genuine, detailed fashion if you do not have the numbers-the advice, such as economic projections and modelling of the impact of your policies. A political game is played on budget that costings in this country in election campaigns, and we all partake in it. It happens at the federal level and at the state level. Inevitably, incoming governments find black holes. Inevitably, outgoing governments claim they are not there. People in general shake their heads in bewilderment. But if we want to have a stronger policies, if we want to have more discussion about necessary reforms-and I think right now we are at the beginning of a period where we are going to need substantial reforms to remain competitive in our country-we need the tools in this place to be able to operate effectively as members of parliament, as oppositions, as Independent members of parliament and as third parties, as well as the executive of government. The executive of government has the high-quality tools available to it to do that job. We know the Treasury department is full of very competent, very smart people who understand the budget and the impact of fiscal policy very well. They do not always get it right, it must be said. Many times their projections are off; they are either short or long on the projections for revenue or expenditure-which is to be expected in a budget of some $350 billion. It is right and proper for a government to engage with its Treasury department, with its finance department, to get advice on policies that they are considering implementing through the executive process of government. But, equally, it makes sense for oppositions to be doing the same with policy development. You do not get these things right at first blush; you need to go back and reconsider, to look at numbers and impacts. Things change. Numbers change. Forecasts come out half yearly about fiscal numbers and impacts of policies. So it is right that oppositions should be able to engage with an independent budget office and get the best information available and the best policies to present to the Australian public-because, ultimately, that is in all of our interests. So the provision in this bill to take away confidentiality of requests for members of parliament when it is in caretaker mode is nothing but short-term politics by a government who desperately want to use the politics costing at the next election campaign without thinking through the impact it will have on their own political organisation when they will inevitably go into opposition in some stage in the future. Reflecting upon this debate prior to speaking today, I was drawn to something that the shadow Treasurer and member for North Sydney made a reference to earlier, and that is that each of us in this place, on the Labor side and on the Liberal side, try and make it harder for the opposition-no doubt about that. I notice that Senator Nick Sherry, when he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate when Peter Costello first moved the Charter of Budget Honesty, said: The pre-election costings regime is … deficient in a number of respects … Only costings of previously announced policies is allowed-that is, policy decisions would have to be made on the basis of incomplete information and be announced. That is exactly what the Labor Party is seeking to do with this bill, in that they are refusing confidentiality during an election campaign for their own political purposesas if all policies are held in perpetuity, as if things do not change. They want to release all the information, even if it is a policy that you decide not to proceed with because maybe the information you have got from the Parliamentary Budget Office tells you you cannot afford to do it this time. In the future, with at least the next election campaign and most probably the ones post that, we will have policies from both major parties, I presume-certainly from our side-which will be about reducing the expenditure of government. They will be about reducing how much the government spend on programs. They will be not so much about more expenditure and spending promises, as we have seen in election campaigns in recent history. With the Greens, of course, we will have a whole series of policies which will spend a lot of money. It will be fascinating to see if the Parliamentary Budget Office can even estimate how much money some of their policies will actually cost.",116
156,Mr Fletcher,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,There may not be enough zeros.,118
157,Mr BRIGGS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"There may not be enough zeros and there will certainly not be enough ink in the money-printing machine at the Reserve Bank to keep up with what the Greens would like to do with the Australian budget. But, equally, I think that we should enshrine in this place the right of the Greens to get advice on their policies-and we should have done so by now. This bill is flawed, however, and there are very good proposals by the member for North Sydney on how we can improve this bill. They are simple amendments which do three important things in the main, if we go back to the fundamentals of why we want a parliamentary budget office in the first place. The first area is to strengthen the functions of the PBO. I quote: 'These amendments seek to broaden the functions of the PBO to include preparations of economic forecasts and budget estimates. This will essentially broaden the scope of the PBO.' Of course the Parliamentary Budget Office needs to provide economic data to the opposition, to the Independent members, and even to the Greens, on the state of the economy, on the impact to the budget of different decisions and different plans and the impact of decisions made by the Reserve Bank-because they are rightfully respected as an independent institution. These are all decisions which should be made on the best advice available. I think we all agree on The government's bill is flawed because it does not give the PBO enough room, enough scope, in that respect. The second amendment by which we seek to improve this bill is to improve information-gathering powers and secrecy. Our amendments will strengthen the information-gathering powers of the government's bill and affirm the independence of the PBO. How can they get the information to do their job? If you have got a health policy with significant expenditure off the Commonwealth budget, and which will have big impacts on your fiscal decisions, the PBO must have the power to go to the health department and get the relevant information. It is quite clear and simple. If it is to be an independent and effective and genuine third-party analysis, that is an absolute requirement-it is a must. In that respect, this is a very good amendment being proposed by the member for North Sydney. The government's bill requires the PBO to establish memorandums of understanding with every government department and agency. The PBO has no leverage over these agencies and departments and therefore it may compromise the PBO's access to the most up-to-date information for the costings of these policies. At the end of the day, we in this parliament should be the masters of our own destiny. I have heard the member for Lyne, who is in the chamber, talk about the sanctity of the member of parliament. If we are going to encourage this right and ensure this right-not only for the executive of the government but also for members of parliament, the Parliamentary Budget Office needs to have the powers so that they can do so. I say to the Labor Party: if you really think, 'This is a good idea in government,' think about it as if you were in opposition, that. because the wheel does turn in Australian politics, and rightly. It is a good thing that governments change from time to time, because it brings about a new generation of thinking and leaders. It has not been so great for the country since 2007, but that is the decision of the Australian people. Ultimately the powers that will be enshrined in this legislation will be for all of us into the future. With this bill we should be trying to put aside, as much as we can, the partisan nature of the politics of costings, and think about how we as political organisations can get the best available information so that we can put it to the Australian people. The third area where we seek to improve this bill in a substantial way is by restoring the confidentiality to costings policies during and after the caretaker period. That is the point I was reflecting upon before. If you take away that confidentiality and you just plaster it all up on the internet, it is not something that you are doing to the executive. The executive will not be required to publish the considerations of the policies that they may be thinking about prior to an election. If you were intending to take to an election a tax cut which has a major fiscal impact over a long period of time, and if you are seeking this detailed information, and you put different scenarios to the Parliamentary Budget Office-like the government does with Treasury and Finance-that information would obviously show quite large differences, depending on the percentage cut that you wanted to offer. If that information or advice is not going to be confidential-whether it is given to the member for Lyne as an Independent or to an opposition party, or even the Greens-we should not participate in it. Why would you allow the potential situation where the other side of politics could use the information tool for their political quests rather than a genuine effort by elected members of parliament to try to find the right reform mix for the future? This is a good idea. This is an idea which is well over its time. The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, first proposed this. It is not a new idea. It happens in the United States with the Congressional Budget Office. I am pleased that the Independents in their negotiations put emphasis on this idea, and I think it is something we should be putting in place. But this is flawed in three significant ways, and we can improve this bill. We can improve it not just for those of us who are currently occupying the seats that we do in the parliament but for all the Australian people and for the benefit of decent economic reform for our country for the future. I urge the government to think about, to take on board and to consider the amendments we have put in place, because they are good amendments to what is a good piece of legislation.",118
158,Mr OAKESHOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I, like the former speaker, certainly welcome debate today on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011 and the Parliamentary Budget Office. I think the process over the last 12 months has been important in seeing parliament being able to, as best as possible, from here on make the best decisions based on the best possible advice. And the bipartisan agreement of 12 months ago is important in getting a parliamentary budget officer in place to allow that to happen. To enable parliamentarians to make the best possible decisions, we need to empower each other through a due and proper process. The process through which we have gone to get to where we are today has had elements of consensus about it, but today those elements as a seem to be fracturing a little bit and, for some reason, are being denied. The agreement reached 12 months ago was important, and it was not just about whims. I certainly appreciate the pat on the back from the former speaker, but this was something that was agreed by all members in this chamber. It was an agreement made prior to the formation of government, on the 16th day after the election, that involved the Liberal and National parties, the Labor Party, Greens members and also the crossbenchers. So we all own this Parliamentary Budget Office and the Parliamentary Budget Officer when appointed some time soon. I think that is important. I would be concerned if this were getting positioned-as I have heard in some of the debate-as some sort of agreement struck with the Independents or the crossbenchers. It is not; this is very much a House of Representatives office and has that independent status, separate from Independent MPs. An important part of the process was the committee inquiry that took place over the last 12 months. The committee involved representatives of all members of this chamber. I was involved in that committee. The National Party had a representative, with Senator Joyce. From memory, the Liberal Party had several representatives, led at the time by the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, Christopher Pyne. The government chaired the committee through Senator Faulkner, a long standing member of the other place. Like his politics or not, I would hope that there would be agreement that he is someone who has a good, thorough and detailed understanding of parliamentary processes. There was agreement reached by all parties and the committee made some unanimous recommendations. What I see now turning into legislation today through this bill is a reflection of that bipartisan that was done over the last 12 months. I am therefore somewhat surprised by the private member's bill that has been introduced in parallel to this. I am surprised that we are going to see amendments to this from the coalition. I am deeply concerned by the words of the member for North Sydney, which could be taken as a threat to the Australian people, that if the coalition do not get their way today with respect to amendments or if they do not get their way with the private member's bill, they are not going to play anymore and that the issues that are of concern to the Australian people at the next election will not be costed and those costings will not be available. That should be of deep concern to all members in this place, particularly those who have invested heavily in the process of trying to get consensus on an independent parliamentary budget office as an arm of this chamber for members of parliament to reach sensible decisions for the long term. We have lived through this. During the last election, one of the key issues in forming government was in trying to get access to election costings through the Charter of Budget Honesty process, introduced in 1998 with all the good intent in the world-but at the last election we saw the Australian people denied the opportunity pre election to see the true costings of election promises. One of the tests to form government was to break caretaker conventions post election and ask for the costings done by the independent Treasury and independent Finance and get them looked at. That is a process that should have happened pre election, but it did not. The Australian people therefore went to the ballot box blind to the true costings of both sides. I have not heard anyone criticise the independent Treasury advice, nor have I work heard anyone criticise the independent Finance advice at the time. In fact, even today, a year after that process, the shadow minister for finance said-I think these were the words-'Treasury identified a few potholes to repair.' That is an admission that there were potholes. That is an admission that this whole process needs to happen pre election, not post election. The Australian people deserve to know where the potholes are that need to be repaired. If we are investing well in Australian people being allowed to participate in this process in caretaker times around elections, preferably before elections, those costings should be public. This was discussed at length through the committee process and was unanimously agreed upon as a sensible contribution to better policy outcomes and more consideration for the Australian people. I therefore do not know what is going on in the mind of the member for North Sydney in trying to build an argument that this is somehow a fix on the coalition or the opposition. I do not understand what is going on in the mind of the member for North Sydney when he threatens the Australian people by saying, 'We will not submit our costings to anyone-neither the Charter of Budget Honesty nor the Parliamentary Budget Office-if the coalition does not get its way today to have confidential conversations and costings in that four-week caretaker election period.' I hope the Australian people rally strongly against that. Outside the caretaker period, by all means, as per the legislation before the House today, those conversations for all members can and should be confidential, but when we are in pre-election mode it should be honesty tested in the public domain to ascertain what is being promised and what the true cost is to the Australian taxpayer. I think that is fair and sensible. I never thought I would hear myself saying it: in defence of Senator Joyce and Christopher Pyne, I hold true to what the committee that they were part of agreed on and uphold the principle that the costings at election time should be in the public domain. Indeed, going back another step, in defence of the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, in defence of Christopher Pyne and in defence of the group hug, I hope we accept that what is contained in this bill essentially what, in a consensual, bipartisan way, was agreed upon by all members or their representatives through the process to date. The bill before the House is sensible. I would have thought that it had the broad support of the members of this chamber. I would have thought the real challenge is to make sure that we get a parliamentary budget officer who has gravitas and the strength and independence of mind to make sure that they deliver on behalf of all of us, whatever our political bent. I would hope that we keep the Presiding Officers honest in the selection process, get a good job description in place and make sure the terms and conditions of that appointment are really in the interests of the parliament.",120
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, I hope the member for Lyne is not reflecting on the Presiding Officers.,122
160,Mr OAKESHOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, I am not; in fact, I am trying to endorse the status that you hold. I want the office of the PBO to be one that has gravitas within the processes of the parliament. It is concerning that, as soon as the legislation hit the House, the smear campaign seems to have begun.",122
161,Mr Hunt,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,This was going to be 10 minutes!,122
162,Mr OAKESHOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I will finish. We seem to be hearing the suggestion that this is some sort of sleight of hand by the government to stitch up the opposition in election time. That is not the case. This has been through a thorough process with coalition members, crossbenchers, the Greens and the government. I hope that is now reflected by broad support for this bill, with amendments being withdrawn and the private member's bill also being withdrawn, and that we allow this office to have the is gravitas that it deserves to do the job on behalf of all of us so that we get the best possible policy with the best possible advice from the PBO that we seek.",122
163,Mr FLETCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. This bill amends the Parliamentary Service Act and the Charter of Budget Honesty Act. The question before the House this afternoon is not whether it is a good idea to have a parliamentary budget office. We are all united in the view that to have a parliamentary budget office is a good idea, and I am very pleased to join the member for Lyne in saying that. Nor is the question whether there is a good case to have an extra source of independent advice to the parliament on financial and budgetary matters. That is clearly a good idea. The question before the House is simply this: does the bill before the House contain practical measures which live up to the principles that we have all expressed our support for? Establishing a parliamentary budget office was, after all, a key election commitments by the coalition. On this side of House we are very clear in our support for the principles. Those who have not had painful experience with this government might naively assume that, because this government has brought forward a bill purporting to establish a parliamentary budget office, this government is also committed to the principle and has implemented through the bill detailed measures which will give effect to an independent source of advice to the legislative branch of government in relation to financial and budgetary matters. Some might say that this is a case of the marketplace of ideas at work-the coalition's idea of a parliamentary budget office being taken up by the government consistent with the agreement that was reached with the Independents approximately one year ago. I am sorry to say, however, that long and bitter experience of dealing with this government, particularly this Treasurer, requires very detailed scrutiny of the measures contained in the bill before one can be satisfied that those measures do indeed, their totality, give effect to a scheme which will implement the principles that have been agreed to. It is noteworthy that we have had a series of speeches from Labor members of the House about the principle of a parliamentary budget office. That is not the question before us. Nobody is disputing the principle. The question before this House is whether the specific measures contained in the legislation we are considering will be of practical utility in providing effective independent advice to the legislative branch of government in relation to budgetary and financial matters. I am sorry to say that there are good grounds for believing that the government's strategy here is to roll out something which claims to achieve worthy objectives but, on closer scrutiny, does not do so. One might well ask why it has taken a year before this legislation was introduced when an agreement in principle was reached between the government and Independents one year ago. Certainly that delay in timing adds to the degree of intelligent scepticism which we on this side of the House bring to our consideration of this bill. I want to make three points in the brief time available to me. The first is to endorse the principle that a parliamentary budget office can improve the functioning of the legislative branch of government. The second is to point out that on the details of this piece of legislation there are specific flaws in what has been proposed. Third, I want to make the point that the coalition has suggested specific changes which could be achieved through either supporting the private member's bill introduced by the member for North Sydney or by accepting amendments to be moved by the coalition. Let me turn to the first point, that as a matter of principle a parliamentary budget office can improve the functioning of the in legislative branch of government. The executive branch, the Prime Minister and her ministers, have all of the resources of the bureaucracy available to them-all of the great departments of state, with their many thousands of employees. Those resources, when it comes to financial and budgetary matters, and when it comes to other matters, are not available to the legislative branch. That is so under the separation of powers doctrine which governs the operation of government in Australia and that of other countries derived from the Westminster system. Yet the legislative branch has crucial functions in our system of government. If it is to discharge those functions effectively it makes sense for it to have available to it expert advice on budgetary and financial matters. If legislators, if members of parliament, do not have available to them an authoritative, a trusted and a confidential source of advice to assist them in understanding the costs and revenues associated with proposed and current policy measures then they are operating at a significant disadvantage. The establishment of a parliamentary budget office could cure that disadvantage. It is for that reason jurisdictions such as the United States and Canada there are similar offices in operation. One need only look at the broad range of issues confronting this parliament today to identify many areas where it would be enormously helpful to have available independent and impartial advice on such matters. It would be enormously useful to know whether the accounting treatment of the National Broadband Network, under which some $19 billion is to be spent by 2015-none of which is included in the published budget deficit figures-is in fact a valid accounting treatment. It would be of enormous value for the legislature to have available to it independent advice on that matter. It would be of great utility to have independent advice as to the credibility of the projected $3.5 billion surplus, which we keep being told is something that we can confidently expect to roll around, not this financial year but next financial year, following only four years of yawning, gaping and repeated deficits. It would be of tremendous value to know whether this claimed sliver of a surplus, promised in the future, is in fact something to which any credibility at all can be attached. It would be of enormous value to know whether the extraordinary increase in tax revenues projected in the documentation issued by this government is credible, because of course if it is not credible then every aspect of this government's fiscal strategy is shown to be deeply wanting. Such advice would be of great value to all parties but particularly of value, first of all, to the opposition and, second of all, to the Independents and minor parties who may not otherwise have available to them credible advice on these kinds of matters. If a parliamentary budget office is to be effective in achieving its stated objectives, then there are certain key requirements that must be that in met. Its independence must be beyond question and any parliamentarian who goes to this office seeking advice must have confidence that the advice that he or she requests will remain confidential. If there is any degree of suspicion that the request for advice or the substance of the advice that was provided is going to end up on the front page of a newspaper the next day, then all confidence in that office and in reliance upon it will be lost. This office and the services provided by it must be available at all stages of the electoral cycle, including most importantly during the course of elections rather than, as is mysteriously proposed, having the availability of confidential advice turned off during the caretaker phase-that is to say, during the election process. This office must have the resources and powers available to it to get the information that it needs. Finally, if it is to be meaningful, it must do more than simply replicate arrangements which are already available-for example, under the Howard government's path-breaking Charter of Budget Honesty reforms. I turn to the next point I wish to make, which is that there are key flaws in what is proposed in the legislation before the House this afternoon. The Parliamentary Budget Office will not have real independence from Treasury and Finance-those departments of state-because Parliamentary Budget Office will be required to make arrangements in writing under section 64F to obtain information from those departments and others. Remarkably, the Parliamentary Budget Office is prevented from preparing economic forecasts and budget estimates. This is a truly novel and ingenious approach to the concept of a parliamentary budget office-it is not allowed to prepare budget estimates! It would open exciting new possibilities in legislation if we were to replicate this approach in other areas. We could establish a defence department which was not allowed to defend Australia, a health department which was not allowed to take action to promote health or a department of veterans' affairs which was not allowed to deal with anybody who is a veteran of war service! These suggestions are as self-evidently ludicrous as it is self-evidently ludicrous a parliamentary budget office would be specifically prevented from preparing economic forecasts and budget estimates. I have already spoken about one of the other gaping flaws in this legislative scheme-that is, there is no confidentiality connected to the advice provided by this office during election periods. This is the very time when it is most critical to ensure that the Parliamentary Budget Office is available to serve as a trusted resource to parliamentarians. If we are to improve the quality of policy proposals put forward by non-government parties, which is surely an important objective in having parliamentary budget office, then preserving confidentiality is an absolutely critical requirement. Of course, there are also serious flaws in the fact that the Parliamentary Budget Office is limited in its powers to obtain information. It is required to make arrangements in writing with the head of a great Commonwealth body to get information and the documents. What is left unclear and unspoken is: what is to happen if the relevant body refuses or imposes unacceptable terms? I want to put to the parliament the notparticularly-surprising suggestion that departments may well be resistant to providing information on an open-book basis. Therefore it is important to have appropriate measures in this legislation to ensure that the Parliamentary Budget Office can get the information it needs to do its job properly. The third point I wish to make in the time remaining to me is that the approach proposed by the coalition in the private member's bill introduced by the member for North Sydney and, alternatively, in the form of the amendments which we are going to move is much more sensible. Under our model, the Parliamentary Budget Office is an independent statutory authority with strong that powers to obtain information from government departments and agencies and the power to provide analysis of economic forecasts and budget estimates. There will be no need to sign memoranda of understanding with government departments. We are empowering a parliamentary budget office under our model to provide objective and impartial advice and, most importantly, to maintain confidentiality during election campaigns so as to ensure its effectiveness as a source of objective and reliable advice and in turn to improve the quality of policy proposals that come forward. The issue before the House is not the a principle; we are all in support of the principle of a parliamentary budget office. The issue is the specific deficiencies in the bill before the House. The coalition has brought forward changes to correct those deficiencies. (Time expired)",122
164,Dr STONE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I too rise to speak on the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 and the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011. The aim of these bills is to establish, for the first time in Australia's history, an independent parliamentary budget office. As our previous speaker most eloquently said, 'The coalition is not against the notion of a parliamentary budget office, a PBO.' We see it as a very important part of any Westminster system. Of course, an opposition is as good as its information and access to confidential advice. We are most concerned that in its present form the proposal being put forward by this government does not in any way serve the Westminster system or the democracies as we know them in Australia. While the Independents and Greens might at the moment enjoy the luxury of having access to confidential, informative and expert advice, under the proposal before us in this bill, an opposition of the day unfortunately would not. That might make sense while this Labor government is in the Lodge. But they need to think forwardperhaps not too far forward-and see a time when they, in opposition, would very much want to have access to confidential, expert budgetary information, costings and assessments. Their information and requests would not become a political plaything of the government of the day. We have had some extraordinary examples in very recent times when we, the opposition, estimated the debt from not proceeding with the NBN by using the Commonwealth 10-year bond rate as the discount rate. Everyone will remember that that information was then made much of by the Labor benches, who said that what we had indicated was an enormous 'black hole' and that this had to go to the credibility of the coalition and our capacity as economic managers. In fact, it turned out in discussions after the election that Treasury had used a different, lower interest rate; but they did not tell the coalition at the time that their interest rate assessments were different to those used by the coalition. This led Treasury to estimate a lower quantum of savings for the coalition proposal to cancel the NBN. At the time Treasury officials would not explain to us what they had done. All we had was the media feasting on the notion, fed to them by the Labor Party, that we had a 'black hole'. That is an example of how politics can make use of-for example-an inadequate parliamentary budget office. We do not want to see that happen in Australia. We think it is a cheap stunt, and it does not do any great credit to the government of the day. There are in fact two bills before the House to establish a parliamentary budget office. The coalition introduced a private member's bill through the shadow Treasurer on 22 August this year. The government then introduced its own bill on 24 August 2011. The government is urgently trying to bring this bill forward to a second reading before our private member's bill has been put to a vote. I am sure that, if the Independents and the Greens looked hard at these two bills and compared the safeguards that are built into both, they would really understand that what we are proposing is a great step forward in real budget honesty. A government member, an opposition member, an Independent or, indeed, a private member would be able to use a confidential parliamentary budget office with confidence if it were constructed as we proposed in our private member's bill. What they put to the PBO would not simply become a political plaything of the government of the day. This is a very serious matter. We have a need for confidential service that one can take whether one is in opposition, a minor party, an Independent or a backbencher-a PBO where you can take a request for assessments and comparisons and where the timing for the release of that data is still the requestor of information. The new body that we are proposing would be accountable to the parliament, not hostage to government departments. We see that as a very important component of our shadow Treasurer's motion. I am very concerned. I mentioned before that our estimates made before the last election were used as a political plaything when we did not have the best advice from Treasury about how they had dealt with the assessments made and published. I very recently had cause for great concern in my electorate, where we had exceptional circumstances: exit grants for drought relief. We were told that these were fully costed. They were a carefully budgeted program. We were told that, due to the demand for these exit grants, the program would be extended to July next year. We trusted that this government had got good advice from Treasury and the appropriate department to know that it had the funds to take through to July next year this program of support for farmers forced to leave their farms. Farmers, particularly in my area, where they have survived seven years of drought and now a year of floods and an extremely financially stressed situation were told by Centrelink and by their accountants, who in turn were consulting Centrelink, that they had until next July to put in their applications for exit grants which would give them retraining through some $10,000 of support and also some $150,000 to try to re-establish beyond their farms. As a result of being told that they were not only eligible but had been granted this exit fund, some farm families then sold their properties at less than what they should have-in some cases, $80,000 less-because they understood that the $150,000 grant was literally a cheque in the mail. You can imagine the horror when they received phone calls from the local with Centrelink officers in Echuca, Shepparton and Bendigo. They were being told over the phone: 'Sorry-we know that we had led you to believe this grant was forthcoming. It was budgeted through to July next year, but it is now summarily ceasing. In fact, as you receive this phone call it is all too late.' This is an example that asks how that budgeting was done. How was Centrelink communicating with the department of agriculture in saying this number of grants had been deemed eligible and then granting the $150,000 plus the other $10,000 for training? Clearly we need much better budgeting and budgeting information for the government of the day. I hasten to say, though, that no coalition government would get anything as wrong as the EC exit grants debacle. I have in my electorate now farm families who are destitute as a consequence of selling their properties, having their clearing sales and ordering alternative accommodation-in some cases, caravansto live in. They cannot pay for those caravans and are left literally destitute because of bad government policy reckoning and the extraordinarily difficult problems the government have created for their own Centrelink officers, who are now being accused of literally, in some senses, driving families to suicide. I have to say that this particular PBOparliamentary budget office-is an excellent idea but only if it operates in a way which delivers confidential service. If it leaves the call of when information is released up to those who have requested that information, does not become a plaything of the government of the day and does not mean that an opposition, Independent or backbencher would hesitate before using the PBO, this excellent idea will become an excellent reality. But we are so concerned about the PBO as a coalition that, should our bills or our amendments fail, our shadow Treasurer has already put on notice that the coalition will not submit its policy costings to either the Treasury or the PBO during and after the election period if the PBO is constructed in the way this bill proposes. that serious to us. We are very serious about good, independent, confidential Treasury advice. We believe that a good PBO is part of good government, and we feel that this is an incredible example of how this government fails to understand the basics of proper budgeting, of proper ethical behaviour in the Westminster system and of the opposition's right and democracy's need to have a strong, well-informed opposition. I strongly recommend the government consider very carefully the amendments which we will be putting and also the private member's bill which now may be rushed out of the way by the government's bill. The PBO as proposed is just not good enough for a country like Australia.",126
165,Ms ODWYER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011 because this is a very important matter for this parliament. The creation of a Parliamentary Budget Office is something that the coalition took to the last election, noting that it was critical that we have world's best practice here in Australia. This is something that the rest of the world has embraced an independent body that can look properly and closely at budgets and provide impartial advice on them along with major policy announcements and costings. We knew it was necessary for this country, which is why we took it to the last election. We took it to the last election and it was embraced, as we know, by the Independents, who made an agreement with the government to ensure that the government would bring forward a parliamentary budget office. The Independents understood that it was important that there be an independent body that could provide impartial advice and analysis. It would be a body through which we would be able to look very deeply at the It is Commonwealth budget, major policy announcements and costings; a body which would have the power to get the information to be able to provide those appropriate costings; a body which would have appropriate funding to do all of those things. The members for Lyne, New England and Denison as well as the Greens agreed that setting up a parliamentary budget office was an appropriate course of action. Of course, the government did nothing on this even after the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office delivered 28 unanimous recommendations for the implementation of a parliamentary budget office. The shadow Treasurer was forced to bring forward his own bill on this matter on 22 August, which of course then spurred the government into action. The shadow Treasurer's Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 seeks to establish a parliamentary budget office that would be:  a new body, accountable to the Parliament rather than the Executive, much like the Auditor-General or Commonwealth Ombudsman;  independent, to enhance the transparency and accountability of the budget process, and help deliver better policy and financial outcomes for Australian taxpayers;  well resourced, to ensure it is effective;  tasked with providing objective and impartial advice and analysis across the parliament on the Commonwealth budget and budget cycle, including the impact of major announcements; and  headed by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who will be appointed by the presiding officers of the parliament on the advice of a committee of senior government officials, with an office of highly trained staff, whose calibre will reflect the Office's status as an independent body. This was the bill that we brought forward, and the government then brought forward its own bill to establish a parliamentary budget office. Sadly, the government bill is not sufficient to provide an independent parliamentary budget office which has the appropriate powers to do its job. Today I take the opportunity in the time available to go to the very heart of the key differences between the government's bill and the bill that was proposed by the shadow Treasurer. First and foremost is the independence of the Parliamentary Budget Office. It is incredibly important that the Parliamentary Budget Office be entirely separate from and not dependent on the advice of the Department of Treasury or the Department of Finance and Administration. Under our bill it would be. We would establish a parliamentary budget office that would be very much separate from the departments of Treasury and finance. By contrast, the government would establish a parliamentary budget office that would require the Parliamentary Budget Office when making requests for information to formalise those requests in writing in order to be able to get the appropriate information and documents. government's bill would prevent the Parliamentary Budget Office from preparing its own economic forecasts and budget estimates. However, under our bill, the Parliamentary Budget Office would be able to prepare its own forecasts and budget policy estimates, and it would have the power to compel the production of the information it requires in order to do that. There is a very serious difference here in the independence of the parliamentary budget offices that are proposed. We believe that, if the aim is to have an appropriately independent budget office, our bill is superior to that of the government. The second issue goes to the powers granted to the Parliamentary Budget Office to obtain information. The government's bill requires the PBO to stipulate what information it may require, and under it the PBO would rely on the departments of Treasury and finance in order to obtain that information. Under our bill the Parliamentary Budget Office would be able to obtain that information and not be constrained by government departments wishing to protect their positions or agreements. Under our bill we would have the opportunity to have full, frank and fearless advice from the Parliamentary Budget Office. Under the government's bill it would not be full, it would not be frank and it would certainly not be fearless, because it would be reliant upon the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. This would not provide the independence that a Parliamentary Budget Office would require if indeed it were to be anything other than a Parliamentary Budget Office in name only. The government's bill restricts the functions which can be performed by the PBO. It specifically prevents the PBO from The preparing economic forecasts and budget estimates. It seems at odds with what the minister himself said in his explanatory memorandum-that is, that there was an established mandate of the PBO: … to inform the Parliament by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals; … So the government bill seems to be at odds with the explanatory memorandum that has been brought forward. There is no such problem with our bill. The coalition's PBO would be able to provide objective and impartial advice on the Commonwealth budget and the budgetary cycle, including the impact of major policy announcements. This is critical, of course, because it goes to costings, to the announcements made by the government and to the impact on the budget bottom line. The next point is about the confidentiality of the costings performed during an election period, after an election period and about when the issue of costings is raised with the Parliamentary Budget Office around major policy announcements. Under government's proposal, there will be no confidentiality safeguard imposed, which means that, when the second a member requests information regarding costings, that information will be made public with no opportunity for discussion or to understand exactly how the Parliamentary Budget Office has arrived at its costings conclusion. This important, because if we seek to have good policy in this place then it is important to understand the position that has been arrived at, to ensure that appropriate costings are brought forward and that they reflect the full policy position of the member or party that has brought forward those costings. They should be released at a time when the member or the party itself believes it is appropriate to release those policy costings. Under the government's bill, this would not be the case. Under the coalition's bill, confidentiality would be preserved, which would mean again that a full and frank exchange could take place with the Parliamentary Budget Office until such time as the costings were done in an appropriate and rigorous manner which reflected the announcements made by either the member or the party concerned. These are a number of aspects of key differences between the proposal that has been brought forward by the government and that brought forward by the coalition. It is critical that we build on the Charter of Budget Honesty, which was a great measure brought forward by this side of the House to have full and transparent policy costings on the budget process. Indeed, we believe that the Parliamentary Budget Office will build on those very strong foundations. But the only way that it can build on strong foundations is to ensure that it is independent and has appropriate ability to obtain information-appropriate powers so that it can perform its functions-and to preserve the confidentiality so that people will in fact use the Parliamentary Budget Office in the role for which it is intended. These are the reasons we support the coalition's bill rather than the government's bill. These are the reasons we will be bringing forward amendments to the government's bill. I commend the coalition's bill to the House. is The government's bill has deficiencies, as I have outlined. Those deficiencies can be overcome with amendments, and we commend our amendments to the House. Debate adjourned. NA Shipping",128

167,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Today I report to parliament the Gillard government's plan to revitalise the Australian shipping industry, the most comprehensive reform of shipping in Australian history. The process of developing this policy began with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government inquiry into shipping. In October 2008, the committee tabled its report Rebuilding Australia's coastal shipping industry. I acknowledge the work of the committee chair, the member for Ballarat, the Hon. Catherine King, and of the deputy chair, the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, who worked on this unanimous report. In February 2009, I formed an advisory group of industry leaders to help us work out how to implement that report. On 1 December 2010, I released a discussion paper that proposed important reforms and invited submissions to be provided by the end of January 2011. In January this year I established three industry reference groups to consult and provide advice to the government on the taxation, regulatory and workforce elements of the reforms. Members of those groups represent the breadth of the maritime industry: ports, the bluewater and offshore sectors, regulators, unions and training providers. All that hard work and consultation has gone into producing the reform package that I am outlining. The need for reform There are sound economic, environmental and security reasons to revitalise our shipping industry. Everyone in Australia that knows that we are currently experiencing a once in a generation resources boom. They understand that the nation's prosperity is linked to the world needing and wanting our resources. What many people do not know is that 99 per cent of Australia's international trade is carried by ships, yet only one half of one per cent of that trade is carried by Australian flagged vessels. Our ports manage 10 per cent of the world's entire sea trade. $200 billion worth of cargo is moved annually. We are the largest island nation and the fourth largest shipping task in the world. Yet there are only 22 Australian registered major trading ships plying our waters today-down from 55 ships in 1995. Of the remaining ships, only four-all gas tankers-are dedicated solely to international trade. On top of this, a lack of investment means that our ships are getting older. The average age of the Australian fleet now sits at almost 20 years which is around eight years older than those in the world fleet. We all know that the newer vessels are safer, more energy efficient and better meet the needs of modern shipping. But it is not just the age of the fleet that is holding us back. Like many industries, the maritime sector is also feeling the pressures of an ageing workforce with employers reporting that half of their seafarer workforce is aged over 45 years. To compound the problem, attracting new recruits and building a strong and sustainable skills base has been hampered by the high cost and complexities of existing training structures. At the same time, participation in the domestic freight task is also at an all time low. All this adds up to lost economic opportunities and environmental and security risks to our nation. The Gillard government is determined to remove the disincentives that have made it uneconomic to operate Australian ships in a global environment. We are determined to create a policy framework that will encourage and sustain growth and productivity in our shipping industry. There are five elements to the reform package:  tax reform,  an Australian international register for Australia,  a new licensing regime,  workforce skills development and  an industry compact. These reforms are fully costed and have been offset according to our strict fiscal principles. Tax reforms The tax reforms include five measures and are linked to being Australian flagged.  A zero tax rate-we will exempt qualifying income by shipping from taxation.  Accelerated depreciation arrangementswe will cut the depreciation period in half, from 20 years to 10 years.  Rollover relief for selected capital assets-allowing shipowners to defer their tax liability from gain or profit on the sale of old vessels when replacing them with new vessels.  Tax exemptions for seafarers working overseas on qualifying vessels-a refundable tax offset will be available to Australian employers of Australian resident seafarers engaged in international trades.  A royalty withholding tax exemption where vessels are leased by an Australian company from foreign owners under a demise or bareboat charter. Australian international shipping register We will establish an Australian international shipping register to help Australians participate in international trade by addressing the cost disadvantages experienced by our registered vessels when competing internationally. Vessels on the international register will be Australian flagged. When they undertake an overseas voyage they must provide the crew with terms and conditions in line with the shipping Maritime Labour Convention. When Australian international shipping register vessels work domestic coastal routes, all crew, irrespective of nationality will be covered by the Fair Work Act. The same environmental, safety and occupational health and safety standards will apply to these vessels as apply to first register vessels. To further support the industry, international register vessels must employ a minimum of two Australian crew, preferably the Master and the Chief Engineer. Cabotage The reform package also fixes the weaknesses of the current permit system. Permits are too easy to obtain. There are no incentives to encourage a long-term commitment to working the Australian coast. The shipping reforms provide clarity and transparency to shippers and operators and enable them to plan long term. The new licensing regime will support Australian shipping and set clear boundaries around the necessary role of foreign vessels in our coastal trade. Licensing requirements and conditions will be set clearly in legislation, giving certainty and clarity to all operators. There will be a three-tier licensing regime:  a general licence providing Australian flagged vessels with unrestricted access to the coastal trades for a period of up to five years at a time,  a temporary licence enabling foreign flagged vessels to operate the coastal trades, subject to time, trade and/or voyage conditions for a period of up to 12 months, and  an emergency licence for cargo or passenger movements in emergency situations, such as natural disasters. A period of five years will be provided to existing licensed foreign flagged vessels to transition to Australian flagged. Workforce skills development The fourth element of this reform package is workforce development. In order to have a strong, safe and clean shipping industry we must attract, train and retain a skilled seafaring workforce. This was strongly identified during the review of coastal shipping; a review which had bipartisan support. The government has already been doing its bit in this area. In July 2009 we provided the Australian Maritime College in Launceston with almost $4 million in funding for a new state-of-the-art maritime simulator to help deliver training in coastal navigation. This simulator is now something of an attraction and has already had visitors from Chinese, Japanese and American maritime educators. In February last year we provided the college with more than $2 million to deliver vocational education and training. To further assist the shipping industry, I am setting up a maritime workforce development forum with experienced people from industry, unions and the training sector. The forum will address areas that are fundamental to building shipping skills. These will include a workforce plan for the medium term to address issues including the ageing workforce and the most immediate skills gaps. I expect the forum to work hand in hand with the proposed National Workforce and Productivity Agency, AMSA and training providers. Industry compact The final element of the reform package is labour productivity. We are committed to aligning Australian productivity practices with the best in the world. The government supports a compact between industry and unions which includes changes to work practices, a review of safe manning levels and the use of riding gangs on coastal vessels. I can inform the House that negotiations between industry and the unions are progressing. 2012 start date When I announced the government's election commitment to revitalise Australian shipping I said it would be in place by mid2013. However, in the time we have been working on this major reform package we have seen more vessels leave our shores. The need to arrest this decline, combined with strong support that industry has shown for these reforms, has convinced the government to bring forward this reform. I can now advise the House that the shipping reforms will commence 12 months earlier, on 1 July 2012. This is a huge reform agenda and clearly shows the government's commitment to revitalising Australian shipping. It makes no sense, no sense at all, for Australian trading to take place almost entirely in the hulls of foreign ships. We need to become participants, not just customers. We need to be a shipping nation, not just a shipper nation. We need to upgrade the fleet. We need to get the regulatory framework right. We need a best-in-class tax system for shipping and we need a pool of skilled seafarers to operate the ships of the future. These reforms will confirm that Australia's long-term economic, environmental and security objectives are met by a revitalised Australian shipping industry. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Wide Bay to speak for 11 minutes. Leave granted.",131
168,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 11 minutes. Question agreed to.,134
169,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," For an island nation such as Australia, our maritime industry is a vital part of the national and international transport network. Australia is a trading nation with a relatively small domestic market. We depend on our overseas markets to maintain our national prosperity and lifestyle. Even though our country, in spite of the resources boom, is embarrassing monthly trade deficits we still export far more in volume than we import. The importance of shipping to Australia's international, interstate and intrastate trade is therefore significant. Sea transport carries over 99 per cent of international cargo by weight and about 75 per cent by value, and domestically ships carry around 26 per cent of our freight. With the domestic freight task set to double by 2030, action must be taken to ensure the viability of shipping services. While a strong national flag shipping industry is vital, it is even more important that the shipping services in Australia are viable and competitive, including with domestic road and rail freight services. As the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport said, Australia's shipping industry has been uncompetitive and in steady decline, dropping from 55 vessels in 1995 to 22 today. Shipping has also been losing its share of the domestic freight task at a time when we need more cargo to be carried by ships to take pressure off our roads. Shipping has the ability to move large quantities of cargo across long distances, the benefits of which are obvious in such a large island nation as Australia. We need efficient general freight shipping from port to port, especially between our capital cities, if we are to meet our future transport needs. Traditionally, Australia's shipping industry has been uncompetitive internationally because of the higher cost of running an Australian as opposed to a foreign flagged vessel. Australian ships have been known for having notoriously high manning levels, restrictive work practices and wage structures compared with the rest of the world. The coalition is committed to the sustainable growth of Australia's shipping industry by ensuring that the maritime sector enduring is as safe, competitive and efficient as possible. The reforms announced by the minister on Friday include little detail on how the proposed measures can deliver what is promised. To quote from Shipping Australia: Much will depend on the detail of how the reforms are enacted whether that objective will be achieved. The details of the criteria for the second register and the training packages as a result of the establishment of the forum to develop skills and training in the industry, are some of the issues on which we are waiting further details. Similarly, the Australian Shipowners Association has said: The detail that sits behind these measures is critical and we look forward to seeing the draft legislation in the near future. The coalition, too, looks forward to seeing the draft legislation. Knowing how beholden the minister and Labor are to the Maritime Union, the Australian shipping industry has every reason to be suspicious about the so-called reform package. While it promises benefits to some shippers, everything will depend on the undisclosed detail and the accord being proposed between shippers and unions. The effective abolition of single voyage permits except in times of national emergency has the potential to make domestic freight movement by ships between Australian ports even less competitive. However, the precise impact on industry will depend on the detail of the legislation, which is yet to be released. The criteria for the temporary licence regime which will replace single and continuing voyage permits will be important to determine how flexible the regulations will be. Whether the temporary licence will apply to particular vessels or ships within a fleet is disadvantages unclear. Should it apply to a specific vessel, this will hamper flexibility where Australian flagged ships are unavailable or inadequate for the task. It will be important to consider the impact of these reforms on the cost of freight and their impact on flexibility around our coast. Wage and industry subsidies in one sector must not be allowed to destroy jobs and close industry in another sector. I understand that the industrial compact negotiations to make our shipping industry more productive and efficient are just beginning between the union movement and the broader shipping industry. These negotiations will need to be groundbreaking to ensure the viability of Australia's shipping industry. If there is any retreat to the bad old days of the past, no amount of government subsidy or intervention will save the industry. I am assured that the industry and the union movement are aware of the importance of the efficiency compact. I am informed that a typical Australian container ship pays $4.06 million in crew costs per year compared with a foreign ship, which pays just $1.65 million in crew costs. Cost pressures are critical. Right now sugar is being shipped from overseas direct to southern ports because it is cheaper than shipping it from north-eastern Australia. The upward pressure on costs will also be compounded by the carbon tax. Under the 6.21c per litre slug on coastal shipping fuel as a part of the carbon tax regime, everything being shipped by Australian vessels will be more expensive, but if you want to ship those same goods in from overseas they will not incur this tax. The decision to grant more generous income tax and depreciation arrangements will be welcomed by seafarers and the Australian shipping industry but this gesture will undoubtedly encourage other Australian industries facing international tax to demand similar concessions. Those industries would have a fair case. If it is good enough for the shipping industry then why not for car manufacturers, the tourism industry or food producers? If seafarers' income earned offshore is tax free why isn't the income for other overseas workers tax free? In 2009 this Labor government changed the taxation arrangements for Australian workers working overseas for 91 days or more to make these people pay income tax in Australia. Now they are doing exactly the opposite for seafarers. Additionally, in relation to depreciation and company tax, Qantas and other Australian airlines face massive competition from airlines based in low-tax countries or countries where they receive special government concessions or depreciation arrangements. For example, in Australia the effective life of an aircraft for depreciation purposes is 10 years but in the case of many foreign airlines the effective life is five years or, in some cases, three years. Company tax rates for airlines in competitor countries like Singapore, Malaysia and China are significantly lower than those faced by Australian carriers. In the case of the UAE, which has two of the biggest competitors for Australian airlines on our routes, there is no income tax at all. The minister said that all of the measures that he has announced today are fully costed and have been offset but there has been no detail provided of what the costs are or what cuts are being proposed to fund these changes. So there is a lot more detail that will have to be provided before anyone can make a reasonable judgment about whether this package is fair, whether it will achieve its objective and what the flow-on implications might be to other industries in Australia that might be placed at a competitive disadvantage by the assistance being provided to shipping. The coalition is committed to reform which will revitalise the Australian shipping industry. However, it is important that we see the detail of the reform package so that it is possible to assess the real impacts of the proposal. Australians are tired of overblown, grand announcements with no detail, designed to take our minds off the other government failures and scandals. Industry will certainly need to see the details before can be confident that these announcements will make any real difference. I welcome the fact that the minister has reported on this issue to the parliament but we look forward to hearing much more about the detail of the various proposals so that they can be assessed fairly on the basis of all of the facts. Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",134
170,Mr SECKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. I think it is very interesting to look at the history of the idea of a parliamentary budget office bill. It was first brought to this parliament by the member for Wentworth after he studied what they had been doing in the United States and other places. We took that to the election in 2010 as part of our policy. The policy was so good that the Independents, in their negotiations, thought it was a jolly good idea to have a parliamentary budget officer so that the parliament and members of the parliament could get a view of important policy that was backed by those minions in Treasury who can do the sums and can therefore be used in creating a more correct policy. As a result of that we become party to the agreement to go ahead with the Parliamentary Services Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill, but after about 12 months of nothing happening the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, thought it was important enough it that we should put it forward. And we did. Mr Hockey, the shadow Treasurer, introduced a private member's bill to establish a parliamentary budget office on behalf of the coalition on 22 August this year. There must have been a flurry of activity in the Treasurer's office when he found out that he had been caught out in not bringing BILLS something forward. It should not take 12 months to bring something like this forward to the parliament. So, over the next two days, after a flurry of activity in the Treasurer's 2011 office-it is unfortunate that we have had to force this issue-the second reading of Mr Hockey's private member's bill happened this morning during private members' business. The coalition's Parliamentary Budget Office Bill of 2011 together with a Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment Bill 2011 will establish an independent PBO for the first time in Australia's history. This office a new body accountable to the parliament, not tied down to government departments. The government decided it would introduce its own bill to establish a PBO and this happened on 24 August 2011, two days after the opposition introduced its own private member's bill, and now we have it here for debate today. So we have a situation where, two days after the coalition introduced their private member's bill to establish the PBO, the government have decided to put forward their own version of legislation to establish a parliamentary budget officer. Given the government has control of the timing in the House, the coalition now have to deal with the government's bill first, even though it was introduced second. We would obviously prefer to support the coalition's own private member's bill for the establishment of a PBO but, given the circumstances, we have put forward amendments to the government bill. The coalition's private member's bill seeks to deal with the Charter of Budget Honesty legislation. The Charter of Budget Honesty was created by the Howard government. It was designed to ensure that a government could not mislead the public prior to an election about the state of the fiscal position. This was put in place following the misleading pre-election statements of the Keating government in 1996. The government's policy costing service under their PBO will be no different to that offered now under the Charter of Budget Honesty. I do remember that at the time that legislation was introduced to the parliament it was actually the Labor Party, then in opposition, who opposed it. How could any party oppose a charter of budget honesty? The coalition's experience with the Charter of Budget Honesty has revealed will be some shortcomings. The service is not confidential-which we believe is extremely important-with requests for costings and costings of policies being published on the websites of Treasury and/or Finance as soon as they are received. Members of parliament have no control over the timing of the release of policies, and there is no scope for costings to be discussed or reviewed. For this reason, in its current form, the government's bill is inadequate. It does not address key issues and it is not in the best interests of the parliament. This government has a poor track record with transparency: in 2007 and 2010 it released its full policy costings the day before the election. In 2010 the Treasurer did not even front the media after releasing a press release on the Friday afternoon before the election. Of course, in 2007 it gave no chance for those policies to be properly costed. Members opposite have been telling the House about the coalition's so called 'black hole' in costings during the 2010 election. The truth is that the coalition estimated the interest to be saved on the debt from not proceeding with the NBN by using, as we would consider normal practice, the Commonwealth 10-year bond rate as the discount rate. After the election it was revealed Treasury had used a different rate, a lower rate. It is interesting that, later on, the NBN Implementation Study showed that the Commonwealth government bond rate was the appropriate rate to use for the cost of funds. So the government said that the Commonwealth bond rate was not the right rate when we costed it, but when they costed it it was the right rate. Go figure! The coalition was correct at the time and the government was wrong. This story unfortunately did not get the airtime that the 'black hole' story did. There are a number of key differences between the government's legislation and the coalition's. I will go into some detail on those later but they centre around the functions, the powers and, most importantly, the confidentiality of the PBO. As I previously said, the establishment of a PBO was a coalition election commitment. The establishment of a PBO was also a key element of the agreement between the government and the member for Lyne, the member for New England, the member for Denison and the Greens. There were several agreements between the Independents and the government which enabled the Prime Minister to form government, and this was one of them. This agreement formed part of the Agreement for a Better Parliament: Parliamentary Reform and stated that a PBO: … be established, based in the Parliamentary Library, to provide independent costings, fiscal analysis and research to all members of parliament, especially non-government members … The Agreement for a Better Parliament further stated that the: … structure, resourcing and protocols for such Office be the subject of a decision by a special committee of the Parliament which is truly representative of the Parliament. On 23 March 2011, the government established a joint select committee on the proposed Parliamentary Budget Office, which subsequently recommended that a PBO be established. The funding for a PBO was provided for in the May 2011-12 budget. The amount was $24.9 million over four years. The government has chosen to amend existing acts in order to establish a parliamentary budget office Schedule 1 amends the Parliamentary Service Act 1999. It establishes the PBO, including its purpose and functions and the PBO's access to information and oversight arrangements. It outlines employment conditions and arrangements for the Parliamentary Budget Officer and introduces a requirement for the Parliamentary Budget Officer to prepare an annual report, consistent with the Clerks of the Senate and House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services, Schedule 2 amends the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. This schedule amends the charter to clarify the processes associated with the provision of policy costings during a caretaker period, including requests made before polling day and requests made on or after polling day. It also amends the definition of 'caretaker period' within the charter so that it is consistent with the definition in the Guidance on Caretaker Conventions. Schedule 3 amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. This schedule exempts the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the PBO under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, an amends the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to ensure that this act encompasses the position of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, and amends the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 to ensure that this act encompasses the position of the officer. The key differences between the coalition's legislation and the government's are as follows. The coalition has made the conscious decision to ensure that the PBO be an independent body separate to that of the departments of Treasury and Finance. This means that the PBO will be an independent statutory body and the PBO will have strong powers to obtain information from government departments and agencies. Under this structure, the PBO will be able to provide analysis of economic forecasts and budget estimates. The government's bill deliberately ensures that the PBO functions as little more than an extension of the departments of Treasury and Finance by requiring the PBO to make an arrangement in writing to obtain information and documents and preventing the PBO from preparing economic forecasts and budget estimates. The PBO established under the coalition would not be constrained by the MOUs put forward by government departments wishing to protect their positions or by agreements which stipulate what information the PBO may or may not have. The coalition's bill provides considerable information-gathering powers and secrecy for the PBO. The government's bill requires the PBO to make an arrangement in writing with the head, however described, of a Commonwealth body to obtain information and documents relevant to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions-in other words, to agree to a memorandum of understanding. The third difference in the two pieces of legislation is that the coalition's PBO is able to provide objective and impartial advice on the Commonwealth budget and budget cycle, including the impact of major policy announcements, while the government's bill, in contrast, specifically prevents the PBO from preparing economic forecasts and budget estimates, whether at a whole-ofgovernment, agency or program level. This point seems to be at odds with the government's explanatory memorandum, which says it is: … the mandate of the PBO to inform the Parliament by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal and the financial implications of proposals; The last difference I would like to highlight relates to the confidentiality of policy costings. The coalition's PBO provides for complete confidentiality for all requests from MPs and senators. This allows nongovernment members and senators to engage in discussions with the PBO as well as allowing views to be challenged in a private domain. The PBO is not permitted to publish costings without the permission of the nongovernment member or senator. The policy costing options put forward in the government's PBO bill do not differ from what is currently available under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 during the caretaker period. The Parliamentary Budget Officer must publicly release any policy costing requests as soon possible after receiving the request during a caretaker period and on or after polling day. The government has certainly made it a lot harder for oppositions. It is providing less information and, frankly, it is a sham compared to what the coalition is putting forward for a parliamentary budget officer. (Time expired)",136
171,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," The honourable member for Barker has made a comprehensive demolition of the government's legislation, so I will endeavour not to repeat too many of the points that he has made. But let me say right at the outset that the idea of having a parliamentary budget office-which, at least from the point of view of the coalition, was first proposed by me when I was Leader of the Opposition in the 2009 budget in reply-which is avowedly modelled on the United States Congressional Budget Office, was to address one of the very real weaknesses in our system of government. Nobody is suggesting-least of all me-that we should move to the American system. It has not policy been performing with great agility recently. But one of the weaknesses in the Westminster type of government is that the government by definition controls the lower house-sometimes more tenuously than others, as we see at the moment-and, because it is the government, has access to all of the massive resources of government in terms of economic analysis, financial information and so forth. And the opposition, which is meant to hold the government to account, is left with very little in the way of resources beyond the talents among its own ranks and perhaps the resources of the Parliamentary Library. In the United States, where there is a clear distinction between the executive and the legislature-where the President separately elected and then chooses all of the officials in the executive branch-the congress, which is completely separate, chose to establish the Congressional Budget Office may years ago. It is a very substantial institution with a budget of nearly $47 million a year, a staff of 250 people and an ability to provide a real counterweight in terms of economic and financial analysis to the work of the US Treasury and the various other economic departments on the executive side. That was seen as a critically important part of getting that balance of power right. In our system, because the government by definition controls the House Representatives and because the opposition is left with very little in the way of resources, all too often our ability to hold the government to account is very, very limited. Yes, we can ask questions through Senate estimates; we can also ask questions in the House. But, as somebody very wisely said, question time is called question time for a reason. It is not called answer time. The chances of getting an informative answer are not very great. The concept of a parliamentary budget office therefore is a very good one and it corrects an imbalance in our system of government. When I proposed this in 2009, the key motivation for my proposal, the immediate motivation, was the extraordinarily reckless spending of the then Rudd government, which in two years of panic reaction to the first and alleged inflation threat-remember there was a war against inflation-and then the global financial crisis had undone a decade of prudent fiscal management under the government of John Howard and Peter Costello as Treasurer. As I said at the time: The alarming expansion of spending under Labor makes thisa parliamentary budget officevitally important. Annual spending is projected to is rise from $272 billion in 2007-08 to $342 billion in 2010-11, the largest three-year increase since the 1970s. As we now know, the eventual expenditure figure for 2010-11 was even higher than forecast, at $350 billion. That was the context in which I argued the case for a parliamentary budget office. But the case for it is now even stronger. We have seen the extraordinary spectacle of the NBN, the National Broadband Network, the largest and by far the most expensive infrastructure project in our country's history, being undertaken without any cost-benefit analysis and without any independent assessment of of whether it is the fastest or most cost-effective way of delivering better broadband to all Australians. It is a gigantic project which will cost the taxpayer, were it to be completed, well over $50 billion, and was conceived not after rigorous financial analysis but conceived, so we understand, on the back of a napkin on a VIP flight between Sydney and Brisbane during the course of a conversation between the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, and the communications minister, Senator Conroy. If we had a proper parliamentary budget office no doubt that would be a body that would be able to undertake an independent appraisal of this project and genuinely hold the government to account. Were a genuinely independent parliamentary budget office in existence, a government, before it undertook something as reckless as the NBN, would think twice because it would know that what it was proposing to do was likely to be assessed by that parliamentary budget office. I was delighted that my successor as Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, stuck with this policy proposal for a parliamentary budget office and took it as a commitment to the 2010 election. As we all know, that election resulted in a hung parliament and, in the wake of that poll, there were several controversies about the costing of various policies put forward by both sides. In that context, the establishment uncooperative of an independent and properly funded parliamentary budget office became a key element of the agreement between the government and the member for Lyne, the member for New England and the member for Denison as well as the Greens. On 23 March the government established a joint select committee to enquire into the proposed Parliamentary Budget Office, which subsequently recommended that a parliamentary budget office be established. Funding for the Parliamentary Budget Office was provided for in the budget, $25 million over four years, but a deafening silence and masterly inactivity then ensued. In the absence of any action from the government, on 22 August 2011 the shadow Treasurer introduced his own bill for the establishment of a parliamentary budget office. And then, as though struck by lightening, the government quickly responded introduced its own bill into the parliament two days later. So there are two bills before the House to establish a parliamentary budget office. One of them establishes a parliamentary budget office which is genuinely independent and will genuinely provide the type of assistance that the policy objective requires. It is really to the difference between those two proposals that I will now turn. The Parliamentary Budget Office established under the government's bill sets up the Parliamentary Budget Officer as an officer of the parliament, but it makes it, in practical terms, not much more than an extension or a branch of the departments of Treasury and Finance. I note that, in order to obtain any financial information, the Parliamentary Budget Office, as conceived by the government, will have to enter into memorandums of understanding with the various departments. One can imagine how difficult that process will be and how utterly and unhelpful those departments will be because they will, naturally, resent any trespassing on their turf. They will do everything they can, and they would do this whether it was a coalition government or a Labor government or any other party's government-they will not want to assist somebody second-guessing their work, even though that is their job. They will provide the same enthusiastic cooperation that many departments provide when they are confronted with parliamentary committees. Our approach, the shadow Treasurer's approach, is very different. Firstly, our bill would establish the Parliamentary Budget Office as an independent statutory body. Secondly, it will have essentially the same powers as the Australian National Audit Office to obtain information from government departments. It will not have to and enter into a memorandum of understanding-though it may choose to do so-but a department will know that if it is not cooperative the Parliamentary Budget Office will be able to haul those officers of the department in and demand documents and answers and actually be able to get the financial raw material that enables it to do its job. One of the curiosities of the government's legislation-and I think it underlines the haste in which it was put together-is that it says on the first page of the explanatory memorandum that the mandate of the Parliamentary Budget Office is: ... to inform the Parliament by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals; That all sounds fine until you actually get the legislation and you see that the Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions, according to the government's bill, do not include preparing economic forecasts or preparing budget estimates. In other words, has to accept the estimates and forecasts that are provided to it by the Treasury. That is absurd. The Parliamentary Budget Office should be entitled to form its own views. I gather from the record of the parliamentary committee that the government was concerned that it might be embarrassing if they came to different opinions. With great respect, that is ridiculous. If you give two economic forecasters the task of forming a view on any economic matter, they might come up with the same conclusion but they are very likely to come up with differing conclusions-but we are all used to that. We deal with many different assessments and forecasts and we are able to assess them all and take them all into account in forming our own view. Providing a second opinion is enormously valuable. What we ought to be doing here as a parliament is moving the balance back in favour of the parliament as against the executive. That is what this is all about. In our system of government, as I said at the outset, the balance is overwhelmingly with the government-the executive-because the executive by definition controls at least the parliament. This gives the parliament some real ammunition, or at least the ability to form some ammunition and resources, that enables it to match, albeit in a very small way, the efforts of the government. Another issue that I know the shadow Treasurer spoke about earlier today at great length-at appropriately great length, I might say, but I shall be brief-is the question of confidentiality. It is very important that members and senators who deal with the Parliamentary Budget Office be to able to do so confidentially. That is provided for in the legislation other than in respect of the election period-in the so-called caretaker period. In effect, exactly the same provisions that apply to the costings done by it the department of finance and the Treasury under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act are provided for with respect to this new office. That is simply not appropriate. It is important that an opposition or a minor party be able to go to the Parliamentary Budget Office with a policy, have it costed confidentially-in effect, have a dialogue with the Parliamentary Budget Office-and be able to thereby become better informed themselves and perhaps come to the conclusion that a particular proposal was not a good idea after all and maybe a different way to deal with it could be adopted. Ultimately, the consequence of not having your policies costed is that the public form a judgment on that. But it is simply unnecessary and inappropriate to say that there can be no confidential discussions had or assessments made in the lead-up to an election. After all, the objective here is not political game playing; the objective here is to give greater financial and economic resources to the parliament, which in large measure means the opposition, Independents and minor parties, so that the parliament can do a half better job of holding the government to account. This is a vital reform to our democracy and what the government is proposing is simply not good enough. (Time expired)",139
172,Mr TEHAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," As I rise tonight, can I say that it is an honour to follow the member for Wentworth in the debate on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. As he has so well articulated, it was his idea, dating back to 2009, to call for the establishment of a parliamentary budget office to be modelled on that of the US Congressional Budget Office. For those of us who have had the honour and privilege to visit the United States under any of various schemes-I was honoured to go under their young political leaders scheme, where I witnessed the full gamut of everything that the congress has to offer and was briefed on their budgetary office-you could not get a better model. The model which the US congress operates under has two key ingredients: it is confidential in its service and it is also independent in its service. are the two key ingredients that we should have in Australia when we set up our Parliamentary Budget Office. It is a shame that, after the member for Wentworth introduced the idea of a parliamentary budget office, it has taken until now for us to be debating this issue and also that the shadow Treasurer has had to introduce a bill calling for a parliamentary budget office for the Treasurer to follow suit and present us with his bill. The worrying aspect of it all, of course, is that in world",143
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, Order! The member will refer to people by their appropriate titles.,143
174,Mr TEHAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"In the Treasurer's world, the two key ingredients that you need in a parliamentary budget office, confidentiality and independence, are not there. But they are in the bill that the shadow Treasurer has introduced, and he is to be commended for the excellent work that he has done in this regard. I hope that the Treasurer takes some time to reflect on the error of his ways, look closely at the coalition's bill and support it. The coalition has been proactive. It has put forward a very sensible, practical approach to how a parliamentary budget office should be set up. It has done so with an air of cooperation. We all know that the Treasurer has been floundering in his role, so the shadow Treasurer has really shown him the way, lent him a helping hand and said, 'Treasurer, we understand that you are a bit of a weak link in this government and that the backbench is talking about your role, so here is a proposal going forward that will help you.' That is what the shadow Treasurer has done. He has come up with a model that shows the Treasurer what a parliamentary budget office should really look like. As has They been mentioned before, one of the two key ingredients that it shows is that the model that the shadow Treasurer has introduced is confidential. All services that the Parliamentary Budget Office would provide, whether it be to Independent members, members of the Greens or members of the coalition-in this case, when we are in opposition-would be confidential. It is very important that this service provided is confidential in nature. We all know that the resources that you have in opposition are a Wayne's lot scarcer than those you have in government. You have the whole backing of a bureaucracy when you are in government. In opposition you do not-you have limited staffing resources, you can call on the services of the Parliamentary Library and you can call on the good graces of those outside the parliament to lend a hand. These bills, if implemented in the correct way, can address that imbalance. Sadly, if you do not have proper confidentiality in providing the services of a parliamentary budget office, all this will be undone. In many ways, you are just setting up another branch in the Treasury or the department of finance, and this is not what we need for a parliamentary budget office. What we need is an office which is independent and which can provide confidential material, confidential advice and confidential facts, including on economic forecasts. The importance of this confidentiality was seen in the debate leading up to the 2010 election over the coalition's costings, especially when it came to the NBN. We put to the Treasury our costings and they unfortunately set a lower quantum of savings that would come from our commitment to cancel the NBN, but they would not say why. Of course, the government jumped on this in one of the great scare campaigns and said our costings lacked rigour and that they had a black hole. We all know, as the secretaries of Treasury and Finance made clear afterwards, that they did not want to be in a position to cost the coalition's policies. They did not want to be in a position to have to detail why they used a different interest rate to that which the coalition had assumed, which was the 10-year bond rate. They did not want to be involved in the politics of the government's approach in calling the coalition's election commitments not properly researched and not properly financed-in fact, having a black hole. It is necessary to avoid this form of politics and to get Treasury and Finance out of the game so they can do the much needed roles that they play. We need this Parliamentary Budget Office, but it has to be done in a confidential way so that if the coalition wants to have some of its policies costed it can approach the Parliamentary Budget Office knowing that it is not going to the executive arm of government to get those costings and knowing that it is not putting the executive arm of government in an invidious position. We will be enabling the parliament to have access to economic costings. As I have said before, it is not only the coalition in opposition that could benefit from this but also the Independents and the Greens, so it is a very sensible approach. The Parliamentary Budget Office should be independent. If it is not independent, it places the bureaucracy in a difficult situation. The legislation as it currently stands, as the member for Wentworth pointed out, shows that the Parliamentary Budget Office would have to enter into memorandums of understanding with Treasury, the department of finance and any other departments that it wanted to get costings from. One of the great difficulties with this is that these memorandums of understanding could take a long time to be negotiated. In the six months leading up to an election, when an opposition is looking to have the majority of its policies costed, you could find that the Parliamentary Budget Office is stuck in a huge discussion, debate or conflict with the two key finance departments on the memorandum of understanding. I think we would all agree that this is an unacceptable circumstance. Rather than having the government's model, which calls for this regulatory approach, this negotiation of memorandums of understanding, the Treasurer should just admit that once again he has it wrong, that the shadow Treasurer has come along and given him a helping hand, and just say, 'Okay, we do need full independence.' Our bill would give full independence because, importantly, it would give the Parliamentary Budget Office the same powers as the Australian National Audit Office. Those powers are quite significant. It would enable the Parliamentary Budget Office to be able to demand documents, it would enable them to demand answers, it would enable them to say, 'Challenge some of the costings,' and it would provide a real alternative to the departments of Treasury and Finance. One of the worries about the bills that the government is putting forward is that in many ways, sadly, it represents the weakness of our current Treasurer. If he were truly an independent Treasurer-if he had his own ideas and the ability to drive the government's economic agenda-I think he would have come up with our bill. But he is so sadly beholden to his department and so sadly bereft of economic leadership that when putting this bill together he has literally gone along with what Treasury and the department of finance have told him. We cannot blame Treasury and finance for putting the government bill together the way they have, because no federal bureaucracy wants to give power to another organisation or wants to have material it produces doublechecked. In a fully functioning parliamentary budget office we would have a fully functioning ability to provide a second opinion to what Treasury and finance were putting forward. I can understand their reticence with this. They have great pride in the work they do and in the work they submit to the parliament, but we should never walk away from increased transparency, especially when it comes to government and the use of taxpayers' money. As has been highlighted before, in the NBN we have a project which will amount to an expenditure of over $50 billion; yet the opposition has no ability as currently stands to get a cost-benefit analysis of this enormous expenditure of taxpayers' money. If we had a proper parliamentary budget office which offered a confidential service and an independent service we would be able to get this work done. I make one last point before concluding. Sadly, the Charter of Budget Honesty has probably come to the end of its use-by date if the government is going to continue to use it in the way that it has. In both 2007 and 2010 the Australian Labor Party released their costings on the day before the election, which meant that there could be no scrutiny and no independent analysis of those costings. That is not what the Charter of Budget Honesty was set up for. We need to move on from that, and that is what the Parliamentary Budget Office would do. The member for Wentworth was in many ways visionary in 2008 when he put forward this idea. He was incredibly worried about expenditure that was going to take place under the Rudd and then the Gillard government. That has proved to be correct. In the last budget we saw a budget deficit of over $40 billion. We have seen net debt hit $110 billion. This is expenditure the likes of which Australia has never before seen. We need a parliamentary budget office to hold this government's rapid expenditure to account. That is what we have proposed in the bill that we have put forward. It is a better bill because of its confidential and independent nature. I would ask the Treasurer to eat humble pie and do what is in the best interests of the Australian nation by going for the type of parliamentary budget office that we have put forward, which will be confidential and independent in nature.",143
175,Mr MORRISON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) it Bill 2011 and particularly on the merits of and need for the creation of a parliamentary budget office. As someone who has spent a great deal of time around election campaigns both in my capacity in this place and in the party organisation, I know that it is genuinely time to end the circus around budget costings at election time. It is important that the Australian public have access to positions that are put forward by the parties at elections and that those parties have available to them proper resources and independent advice to assist them to put forward their positions. Otherwise the circus will continue and the public debate that centres around these matters at election time will distract from the opportunity to focus on the substance of the policies that are being put forward. I strongly commend the initiative to have a parliamentary budget office, but it has to fair dinkum: it has to provide the opportunity for all members of this House and the other place to access independent costings. This will aid policy development. It will aid not only the debates that we have in this place but also the debates we have outside this place in our efforts to frame, consider and develop positive and constructive policy. The benefits of having a parliamentary budget office will accrue only if it is a genuinely independent office that enables a confidential and even an iterative process to occur. It is important that any member can have confidence to determine that, when any information they are seeking to be costed is released, they can have confidence in the process in which they engage into obtain those costings. The government's bill is yet another attempt to compromise an important and independent process. Just last week I had the unfortunate experience of watching this government abuse yet another important, independent process when officials from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship came to brief the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Attorney-General and me. This is an important, independent process that members in this House rely on-the provision of briefings from government officials and government agencies. What did we learn? We learnt that the government had used the officials to brief the media before briefing the opposition, which was their purpose. I am sure the minister's old boss, the former minister in New South Wales, would have been quite proud to see public officials used and abused. We saw this process happen in New South Wales year in and year out. It led to an undermining of public confidence in the way that that government was run. That is what is at stake here-the opportunity to have a genuine, independent parliamentary budget office that be can assist the workings of this place, the workings of proper policy debate and the development of very sound policy. The Parliamentary Budget Office is supposed to be one of the innovations of this parliament. While the failure of the minority government that has formed has meant that this parliament has been disappointing, there is an opportunity to get at least something right. I do not believe the government is acting as a willing partner in this exercise in the way they brought this bill to this House. That is why the coalition is seeking to restore that opportunity with the amendments that have been circulated by the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer. As a consequence of the aspiration to form a parliamentary budget office, the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office was formed to inquire into the matter and found in its final report, handed down earlier this year, that there was a significant shortfall in the way the government and, indeed, the parliament approaches matters of fiscal importance. The final report observed: There is currently no independent body in Australia that specialises in high quality research and analysis on fiscal policy for the Parliament. The ideal solution advocated by this committee was the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office to fill the void and assume this role as a vigorously independent arbitrator. This was first flagged by the member for Wentworth. It was an initiative that he put forward for the reasons already outlined in this place by other members. The ideal solution advocated by the committee was the creation of this budget office. The committee recommended the establishment of a budget office 'dedicated to serving the Australian parliament'. Let us focus for a moment on those words: an office 'dedicated to serving the Australian parliament'. They do not say that the office should be dedicated to serving the government of the day or that it should be abused in some sort of political process and power game by the government; they say that the office is supposed to serve the members of this parliament. I think that is a telling choice of words. The office is supposed to serve the interests of the people and the broader democratic function of this parliament, not the interests of any one political party or the executive wing. The committee made the recommendation that the mandate of the Parliamentary Budget Office be: … to inform the Parliament by providing independent, non-partisan and policy neutral analysis on the full Budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals. Again the emphasis is on the word 'independent'. This position must serve as more than simply a megaphone projecting or regurgitating existing partisan politics. If members wish to outline particular policy proposals and put them in the public domain, they will choose to do so. Their proposals should not be released into the public domain as an automatic consequence of their seeking to have robust and independent analysis put in place. That would mean the withdrawal of the genuine opportunity to go through an iterative process of policy development. This entity must be separate and it must be equipped with access to documentation and information in order to make authoritative analyses on matters that have undoubtable consequences for the Australian hip pocket and family budget. The joint committee recommended that the main function was: … to respond to requests of Senators, Members and parliamentary committees, formally contribute to committee inquiries, publish selfinitiated work, and prepare costings of election commitments. The committee found that the election costings provisions of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998which was so flagrantly abused by the government during the last election, particularly… in enabling the electorate to be better informed about the financial implications of election commitments. The report made the shrewd observation that the voting public was not able to engage with quality political debate without an considered independent and potentially very valuable source of information. The committee recommended incentives for parties to use a costings process in order to enhance transparency and bolster accountability. Importantly, the committee found that in order for this position to correlate with proven international best practice the position of a parliamentary budget officer would have to be created as an independent office of the parliament, not of the executive, which the government seems to have attempted to do de facto in the way they have framed this bill. However, if it were set up in the way that the committee recommended, the office could more clearly serve the ongoing information and scrutiny needs of the parliament as a whole, therefore improving fiscal transparency and executive accountability, which is a notion that seems foreign to this government. The report made a number of recommendations to further strengthen and consolidate the ability of the office to supply this robust and independent analysis. They included making provision for the office to be able to access information held by government departments as well as allowing for a mechanism by which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit could oversee the Parliamentary Budget Office position. But it is clear that the creation of this office must go towards the consolidation of an independent entity capable of exercising analytical judgment without interference or influence from either the government or the opposition. The work of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office argues very clearly that, in the interests of open informed political debate and in order to best give the opportunity for our democracy to continue to flourish as it ought, there is clearly a need for an independent authority in the arena-especially at election time, when the clamour of political promises is at its peak. The committee recommended that wherever possible the work of the office be made publicly available; but, again, that would be initiated by the member, as we have proposed in our amendments. The coalition has always felt very strongly on the issue, and I remind the House that the establishment of this office was a coalition election commitment. While we agree with the government on the need for the position, our concern with the government's bill before us is, as I have noted, that it take deliberate steps to ensure that the office functions as little more than an extension or peripheral arm of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. This bill requires that the office make an arrangement in writing to seek information and documents and prevents the office from preparing economic forecasts and budget estimates. Heaven help the government if they were ever subject to that sort of scrutiny! What use is an independent fiscal voice if it is openly silenced and gagged and so prevented from passing analytical judgment and constructive comment on such fundamental political functions as the budget that this House is asked to consider every May? The coalition has conscientiously strived to ensure that the office is an entirely independent entity: an independent statutory body with strong powers to obtain information from government agencies and departments and supply independent analysis of economic forecasts, including the budget. The government bill requires the PBO, or and Parliamentary Budget Officer, to make an arrangement in writing, as I have said. I think this is a form of censorship that hardly correlates with the concept the government would have us believe it is proposing: an unbiased and independent umpire. The bill put forward by my colleague the member for North Sydney is in stark contrast with what the government is proposing, and his bill should be commended to the House. If the government truly believe in the need for an open, impartial voice of economic reason, they would alter their bill to provide for this truly objective source of advice and information to be made available to members of this place and the other. This means that the office must have broad scope and access to the documentation they need and the ability to exercise their informed and independent judgment in the security of the workings of the government's budget, regardless of which side of the chamber these sums are derived from. Interestingly, the joint select committee referred to international best practice. For this office to operate effectively and with credibility and integrity, it deserves to, I think, follow the model of the United States through the Congressional Budget Office, which other members have referred to in their remarks. For the budget office to have integrity, it must mirror that working model. The Congressional Budget Office mandate is to supply congress with objective, non-partisan and timely analysis to aid in economic and budgetary decisions on the wide array of programs covered by the budget and the information estimates required for congressional budget processes. The coalition's primary objection is that the model before us in its current form falls significantly short of this best-practice model. Each year at the end of January, the Congressional Budget Office reports on the economic and budget outlook. It includes estimates on spending and revenue levels for the next decade and becomes a budget baseline which is then used by members of congress as a neutral benchmark to measure the effect of proposed bills and legislation. The baseline is constructed according to specific laws which instruct the budget office to assume that current spending and revenue laws continue without change. It is not a prediction of future budget outcomes; however, it does reflect the office's best judgment about the way the economy and other factors will influence federal revenues and spending under existing laws. The Congressional Budget Office is a useful, practical tool that serves the purpose of legislature providing credible advice. The American Congressional Budget Office employs about 250 people. It operates as an agency comprised of predominantly economists and policy analysts. Three out of four staff hold advanced degrees, the majority in economics or public policy. In the 2010 financial year, the budget office in the United States issued 33 studies and reports, 12 briefs, 12 Monthly Budget Reviews, 35 letters, 14 presentations and two background papers, in addition to two other publications and a vast array of supplemental data. The Congressional Budget Office testified before congress 14 times on a range of issues. In the 2010 calendar year, the budget office completed 650 federal cost estimates as well as 475 estimates on the impact of legislation on state and local governments. The Congressional Budget Office provides up-to-date and easily accessible data on its website, including current budget and economic projections and appropriations. Importantly, the Congressional Budget Office assists the House and Senate budget committees of the United States and, more generally, congress by putting together reports and analyses. In accordance with its mandate, the Congressional Budget Office reports contain no policy recommendations but are objective and impartial. It is true that Australia's democratic traditions and history have taken a different path to those of the United States, but quite clearly the Congressional Budget Office provides the benchmark which we would seek to emulate, and that is what the coalition's amendments are geared towards. So I would implore the government to get serious about having a fair dinkum parliamentary budget office and not go along with this corruption of the process, which they seem to wallow in on so many that occasions, and so happily, to avoid the transparency and scrutiny that is proper for a democracy of our standing. I urge the government to reconsider and live up to at least one expectation of this parliament and deliver a fair dinkum, independent Commonwealth parliamentary budget office. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (18:33): I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. This bill provides for the establishment of a parliamentary budget office. In considering this bill, it is both interesting and important to look at the history of this parliament's past efforts to establish a parliamentary budget office. The need for this parliament to have a parliamentary budget office has been raised at various times since the 1980s, with the suggestion that Australia should have a budget office similar to the Congressional Budget Office of the United States of America. But very little happened through the eighties and nineties. Then we fast forward to the infamous 2020 Summit. Who would forget the warm inner glow that many in government felt when the Prime Minister of the day was swanning around with actors and actresses, a range of minor celebrities and a self-proclaimed group of our best and brightest in the complete and utter farce of the 2020 Summit! That was just over three years ago-how time flies. However, one thing that did come out of the 2020 Summit was the identification that there was a need for a well-resourced and financed parliamentary budget office. But, as has become a trademark of this government in getting every decision wrong, in its response to the 2020 Summit the government put the view that a parliamentary budget office was not needed and advised that a service to members was already available through the Parliamentary Library. So it was left up to the coalition when, May 2009, the then Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply speech called for the establishment of a parliamentary budget office which was to be modelled on the US Congressional Budget Office. The coalition's proposal in May 2009 was that the Parliamentary Budget Office would be responsible to the Australian parliament and chartered to provide independent, objective analysis of fiscal policy, including long-term projections of the impacts of various measures on the economy. But, yet again, this suggestion was rejected by this government. Then, in June 2010, the coalition yet again led the way when the Leader of the Opposition renewed the call for the creation of a parliamentary budget office, and the establishment of such an office formed part of the federal coalition's 2010 election policy platform. But again this policy was not supported by the government. However, when it came to the current Prime Minister's negotiations with the Independents in an attempt to form government-in what could be the script for another episode of At Home with Julia-all of a sudden, after three times previously rejecting the need for a parliamentary budget office, the government changed its mind. Therefore, it has been pleasing to hear members of this government at least acknowledge the need for a parliamentary budget office, even if what they are proposing is a deeply flawed bill and a deeply flawed model which will result in a lame duck and an all but useless parliamentary budget office. We need to appreciate the importance of a parliamentary budget office, given the current state of the budget and the debt that this government has racked up. In just four short years this government will have run up combined deficits of close to $150 billion. While the Treasurer talks about returning the in budget to surplus-which, if achieved, would be the first Labor surplus in over 20 years-he is talking about the surplus of $3 billion, compared to the combined deficits of close to $150 billion racked up in just four years. Even if the Treasurer is able to defer enough expenditure to crack it for a $3 billion surplus, to get us back to square one and to get this nation back into the position it was when the Howard-Costello government left office, we would need to repeat the Treasurer's planned $3 billion surplus year after year for the next 50 years to pay back the debt this government has racked up in just four years. Therefore, in the years ahead, we are going to have growing demands on our budget, but our resources, as always, will be scarce and limited. No future Australian government will have the luxury of affording the appalling waste, mismanagement and cost overruns that have been the trademark of this government. The misguided and poorly thought through programs we have seen from this government, such GroceryWatch and the pink batts fiascoonly two from a list too long to mentionmust be a thing of the past. The need for a parliamentary budget office to be established and to provide independent costings, fiscal analysis and research to all members of parliament, especially non-government members, has never been more critical. Given that the government is getting on board with the coalition's call for a parliamentary budget office, the debate is no longer about whether a parliamentary budget office is needed but about the form it should take, not just for this parliament but for all future parliaments. The debate is about what model the parliamentary budget office should take. This parliament currently has two separate models before it, but we must not be foolish enough to consider that these two models will produce the same outcome. While the coalition's model has been developed and thought through over a long period, Labor's model in contrast has been rushed through in response to the coalition's bill-and dragged there by the Independents and Greens under a desperate deal for power, which explains the sloppy legislation we are now debating. In fact, the best thing the government could do is simply withdraw the bill in its entirety and support the coalition's bill. The main flaw in the government's proposal is that the service to be provided under its model for a parliamentary budget office will not be confidential. The failure to achieve such a facility will render a parliamentary budget office pointless. The policy costing service will be no different to that now offered under the Charter of Budget Honesty. Policy cannot be developed in a vacuum without considering the costs, like we have seen with Labor's policies on the NBN and border protection. When as considering policy, every member of parliament must be able to put a proposed policy for costing to the Parliamentary Budget Office and be assured of confidentiality. Members must have the prerogative to adjust or finetune a policy or even dump it altogether if the costing turns out to be substantially different from what was expected. But, under the government's proposal for a parliamentary budget office, requests for costings by members would be published on the websites of the Treasury and/or the Department of Finance and Deregulation as soon as they are received. Members of parliament will not have control over the timing of the release of policies they submit for costing, there is no ability for the costing to be discussed or reviewed and there is no ability for a member to discuss the underlying assumptions behind the policy initiative. Treasury and Finance are not even required to release any assumptions underlying the costing, simply the costing itself. How can anyone stand here in this chamber and argue for such a flawed scheme? This is why the government's proposal is deeply flawed and why the coalition will not be supporting it without amendments. If the government is fair dinkum about creating a parliamentary budget office-and this is not just another stunt-it must provide a model that delivers a confidential service for costing policy proposals for all MPs and senators, including the opposition, minor parties, Independents and backbench government MPs. Confidentiality is the crucial and nonnegotiable element of the coalition's bill and the amendments we seek. It is worth noting that the US Congressional Budget Office, the scheme on which we seek to model our parliamentary budget office, does honour confidentiality. Likewise, members and senators in this parliament must be able to enter into confidential and private discussions with a parliamentary budget office about the costs of policies. Members and senators also must be able to question and discuss any underlying assumptions, such as costings, with a parliamentary budget office, and members and senators must have the ability to control the timing of the release of policies and their costings. To do so would enable this parliament to function at a higher level, to the benefit of the Australian nation. The coalition's bill and the amendments we seek for this bill shall achieve this goal. The amendments proposed by the coalition will, firstly, strengthen the functions of the Parliamentary Budget Office by broadening the functions of the office to include preparation of economic forecasts and budget estimates. Secondly, the amendments proposed will improve information-gathering powers and secrecy by deleting the arrangements within the bill for obtaining information from Commonwealth bodies and inserting the informationgathering powers from the coalition's bill, which are based on those of the Auditor General. Thirdly, and most importantly, the amendments will restore confidentiality to costing of policies during the caretaker period by deleting the sections within the government's bill which relate to the immediate public release of policy documentation submitted by nongovernment members and senators during the caretaker period, and the period on or after polling day, until the time when the government is formed. This will enable costings to be truly confidential, unless otherwise instructed, and they will provide an opportunity for views to be challenged in the private domain before costings are released to the public. We on this side of the House are not afraid of scrutiny. Unlike those opposite, we have delivered a budget surplus in the past 20 years. In fact, previous coalition governments have delivered budget surplus after budget surplus. It is fast becoming the case that few Australians can even remember the last time Labor delivered a budget surplus. Imagine if the Australian people had the information with a proper analysis of policy costings prior to an election; this is what the coalition's plan will deliver. The coalition's model is in line with global moves towards greater transparency in government and fiscal policies that governments will undertake. We are seeking to move forward with a robust, independent umpire advising on policy costings. The only way to create a workable model is to create a fiercely bold and truly independent parliamentary budget office, not one reliant on government departments-and this is exactly what the proposed, far superior private member's bill of the coalition will do. I call on members of the government and the Independents to look beyond the next election. Rather than think about short-term political objectives, think about what is best for the future of this country and this parliament. Do that by either supporting the coalition's alternative bill or at least supporting the amendments, as these are the only ways we can ensure that this parliament has a truly independent and effective parliamentary budget office.",145
176,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I thank members who have contributed to this debate on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. The establishment of an independent parliamentary budget office is very significant. It is a permanent reform that will build on Australia's already very strong fiscal frameworks. It will ensure greater accountability and transparency in policy making. It will promote understanding in the community about fiscal policy and it will ensure that the Australian public are kept better informed about the fiscal impact of policy proposals, particularly during election periods. These reforms will allow all parliamentary parties and Independent members to have their policies costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. Members and senators will be able to request confidential policy costings from the PBO outside of the caretaker period of a general election. During general elections, the election policy costing service will be fully transparent, with costings made available to the public. This transparency requirement is fundamental-I stress 'fundamental'-to ensure the Australian public can be fully informed about the fiscal impacts of election policies before they cast their vote. The Parliamentary Budget Office will help ensure that the Australian people are never again-I stress 'never again'subjected, as they were at the last election, the opposition attempting to hide an $11 billion black hole in their costings. That is what occurred in the last election campaign. The opposition spent the last election trying to avoid public scrutiny of their election policy costings under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act. Today we have seen that they are already creating new excuses to hide from public scrutiny at the next election. It is unbelievable. They are slowly crab-walking away from the independent model for the Parliamentary Budget Office that they signed up to just five months ago. The opposition are clearly still grossly embarrassed about the $11 billion black hole at the last election. We saw that reflected in the extraordinary attack in this parliament today on the Public Service by the shadow finance minister. It was a simply disgraceful speech that was made to camouflage his own gross incompetence. greater We have to be very clear about this. This bill will provide the opposition with an advantage that no other opposition has ever had before. It provides for access to a confidential costing service outside of a general election period, which has never been available before, and it provides for a fully transparent costing service during a general election. The opposition will have two options when it comes to election policy costings: they can elect to have Treasury and Finance cost their election policies or they can elect to have the Parliamentary Budget Office do it. They will have absolutely no excuse. They will not be able to try to hide their election policy costings from public scrutiny. The government's bill is based on the model which was recommended by the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office. Everybody on that committee supported the model that the government is putting forward. The Liberal Party signed up to to that model in March this year. There was broad parliamentary representation on the committee. It included members of the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party and the Australian Greens, and an Independent member of parliament. It included two shadow ministers, the member for Sturt as deputy chair, and Senator Joyce as well as the member for Higgins. It is hard to imagine a more important issue on which bipartisan support is warranted. That is why it is so deeply disappointing to see the opposition walk away from supporting the model which was recommended by the joint select committee. The joint select committee from all parties in this House agreed to it in total, yet it is being walked away from in parliament today. It is deeply disappointing. It was deeply disappointing to hear the shadow Treasurer this morning declare that, if this bill were passed, the opposition would not submit its policies for costings by either the Parliamentary Budget Office or the Treasury. Could you think of anything more arrogant and anything less accountable than that action of the shadow Treasurer in this House today? He declared that the Liberal Party will keep the Australian people in the dark at the next election when it comes to policy costings, just like he did in the last election campaign. That is the team that got $9 out every $10 in net savings wrong at the last election. They are now asking the Australian people to let them do it again so they can hide their incompetence from the Australian people. It is not surprising that they have got a budget black hole, or crater now, of $70 billion in their budget bottom line. They have a Leader of the Opposition who is wandering around the country telling anybody what they want to hear anytime, irrespective of cost. Therefore, it is not surprising that they should come into this House and resist the scrutiny of the Parliamentary Budget Office during an election campaign, given that incredibly irresponsible record that they have set for themselves. The PBO model proposed by the shadow Treasurer would, firstly, undermine its resourcing, making it hostage to future funding by the Treasury department. Secondly, it would weaken governance arrangements by making the PBO accountable to ministers, not to the parliament, and reduce the transparency and public accountability around election policy costings. The opposition want to replace a completely transparent costing process, one where the costings are made available to the public, with a non-transparent process. We this know why that is the case-because they simply can never get it right. Given their track record, they can simply never, ever get it right. The shadow Treasurer wants to put in place a confidential election costing process so that when he does not agree with the costing outcome he can hide it and refuse to release it to the Australian people. This is extraordinary. Is there nothing they will not do or say to achieve a political advantage? All this demonstrates that they have so little faith in their own ability that they want some sort of escape clause in the PBO legislation. Given this abysmal record, it is not surprising that they are doing everything they possibly can to run away from public accountability and, really of course, to run away from the fundamental tenets of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act. This is what the then Treasurer, Mr Costello, had to say when the Charter of Budget Honesty was put forward: 'By requiring the costings to be made publicly available, there is limited scope for the results of the costings to be misrepresented.' Very accurate. The opposition's amendments are inconsistent with the recommendations of the parliamentary joint select committee and inconsistent with the central thrust of the Charter of Budget Honesty. The committee spent many months considering the appropriate functions of the Parliamentary Budget Office costing processes and access to information, and considered something like 21 submissions. The committee determined that information-sharing arrangements governed by a memorandum of understanding between the PBO and government agencies would be more effective than legislating powers to compel. The opposition's proposed amendments provide for unfettered access to highly confidential taxpayer and national security information that is clearly not required for the PBO to fulfil its functions. The opposition's approach is to create an adversarial legislative relationship backed by criminal sanctions. The government's approach favours the development of a comprehensive understanding between the PBO and agencies. This is designed to ensure that information can be exchanged quickly and appropriately, in keeping with the recommendations of the joint select committee. If the opposition were serious about budget accountability transparency, they would support the model put forward by the joint select committee in the government's legislation. Parliamentary Budget Office is an important new institution that will strengthen Australia's budget frameworks and it should not be undermined by those opposite. Their approach to this bill demonstrates yet again why they are unfit for high office.",153
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," The question is that this bill be now read a second time. A division being called for, in accordance with standing order 133(b) the division is deferred until 8.00 pm. Debate adjourned. Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",155
178,Mr ANDREWS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to speak on the Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011. This bill contains two schedules. Schedule 1 contains three parts that amend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005. The schedule would amend the title of a number of office holders from 'general manager' to 'chief executive officer'. Presently, a number of statutory positions created by the ATSI Act 2005 are referred to by the term 'general manager'. These roles are deemed to be better reflected in the title 'chief executive officer'. The change is also designed to bring these agencies into line with the majority of other Commonwealth statutory agencies and companies. The change of title from general manager to chief executive officer does not involve any changes to the remuneration package associated with the positions. Aligning the position titles with comparable positions in and other authorities is expected to assist the boards of these agencies attract suitably qualified applicants. The The schedule would ensure that information held by Indigenous Business Australia will be appropriately protected but capable of being disclosed by that organisation in carrying out its proper functions, consistent with similar arrangements. The secrecy provisions relating to IBA in section 191 of the act has prevented the disclosure of information to agencies with responsibility for overseeing Commonwealth administrative practices such as the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner. It has also prevented disclosure of information to Commonwealth agencies working in joint initiatives with Indigenous Business Australia. The amended provision will allow disclosure of information in limited circumstances. The changes to the secrecy provisions applicable to Indigenous Business Australia may assist the organisation to carry out its functions while protecting commercial-in-confidence information. The change should also permit scrutiny of IBA activities by the parliament, namely Senate estimates committees. Schedule 1 would also remove references to the availability of review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for two discontinued Aboriginal Hostels Ltd schemes. The two discontinued schemes are not likely to be reinstated, so this item is simply tidying up the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Schedule 2 amends the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009, allowing the minister to delegate the power to appoint a person to act as the Executive Director of Township Leasing or the CoordinatorGeneral for Remote Indigenous Services. Currently the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009 provide that the minister may appoint a person to the specified position with the acts not allowing a provision for that power to be delegated. The Executive Director, Township Leasing, is an independent statutory office holder who works with communities to ensure that the township lease is managed effectively and provides a real benefit to the community. The Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services is intended to be independent of government service delivery agencies to drive improvements to the coordination of the development and delivery of Indigenous policies and to facilitate reforms to the development and delivery of such programs. Both of these positions were deliberately designed to remain separate from individual agencies but, however, have been incrementally absorbed into the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services Indigenous Affairs. This has resulted in their ability to drive reforms being compromised. These positions must remain appointed by the minister and not delegated to the department. The coalition therefore opposes the passage of schedule 2. We believe it is important that someone be appointed to act in the role of Coordinator-General for Remote and Service Delivery. The coalition believes that, when a vacancy occurs, the minister fills the position with an acting appointment to preserve the separation from the department so necessary with this position. The coalition believes that the current procedure for making such an appointment is neither onerous nor unworkable when compared to the need to maintain separation of the position and the department charged with coordinating service delivery. The coalition continues to lament the fact that this Labor-Greens alliance continues to fail our Indigenous peoples. It continues to allow program failures and bungled policy responses as well as waste and mismanagement to dominate this important area of policy. Australia's Indigenous population deserve better. They deserve much. much better, but this government just cannot deliver. In the last sitting fortnight I spoke on the Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (No. 1) Bill 2011. The coalition flagged that it would oppose a schedule of that bill. We indicated that we would seek to amend the bill. Suddenly, however, the government have decided they will pull the schedule. This is part of what is an emerging trend by Labor. The government are so weak that they cannot even stand by their own legislation. If it looks like it might fail, they cut and run. I am advised the government will now amend this bill to remove schedule 2. Given the government's intention to remove schedule 2, the coalition will support the passage of the and bill.",155
179,Mr NEUMANN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I speak in support of the Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 201l. The shadow minister, the member for Menzies, is correct about the schedule with respect to the delegation of the minister's powers to make acting appointments under certain Indigenous acts having been pulled by the government, but I do not agree with his analysis with respect to closing the gap nor what this government is doing in Indigenous affairs. The previous government did not cover itself with glory in this area and surely governments of all persuasions over many decades could have done better. This legislation amends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 to change the title of a number of officeholders from general manager to chief executive officer, ensures information held by Indigenous Business Australia or IBAs will be appropriately protected but capable of being disclosed by that organisation in carrying out its proper functions consistent with the legislation and removes references to the availability of a review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for two discontinued Aboriginal Hostels Ltd schemes. I will speak a little more about those matters. The change of name from general manager to chief executive officer for several agency heads does reflect their responsibilities in this day and age. We often refer to chief executive officers of companies and organisations. We do not generally refer to them as general managers. Also I think there is a greater capacity for better remuneration and opportunity to attract a better calibre of person in terms of their skills, talent and ability for that role if they are called a chief executive officer rather than a general manager, which is quite an archaic expression these days in corporate titling. The agency heads affected will be the heads of Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land Corporation, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd and the Torres Strait Islander Regional Authority. These changes in nomenclature bring them in line with other Commonwealth statutory authorities and entities such as the Australian Council for the Arts, Screen Australia, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and the Australian Sports Commission. This is an example of modernisation of the title and is a sensible outcome. I cannot think of many organisations these days in the business world that refer to people as general managers; they tend to refer to them as chief executive officers. This is an important change. Although it is minor, it does have an impact on what people will consider when they actually apply for those jobs. The second amendment is what I would call the secrecy provision. It is an amendment to the information in handling provisions which will overcome what has been described-and what I have read-as a historical and narrow focus that has prevented IBA from sharing information with other agencies responsible for government programs and practices such as the Privacy Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The old provision that is being done away with prevented information being given to those Commonwealth agencies which happen to work on any initiatives of a joint nature with IBA and the state and territory agencies seeking to work more closely with IBA to achieve better final outcomes for Indigenous peoples across the length and breadth of our country, whether in regional and rural remote areas, rural areas or in metropolitan Australia in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, for example. So the amendment's provisions aim to overcome the previous practical difficulties but with the continued, appropriate protection of sensitive information between agencies. It is in line with what the government has done in relation to other legislation, such as the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, and so it is a sensible outcome. The amendments, as I understand it, are supported by the IBA Board as well. The third aspect is in relation to Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. That amendment relates, as I mentioned before, to a provision in respect of the review of a decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and it removes a reference to two discontinued schemes which are unlikely to be resurrected. They are the Community Support Hostel Grants Scheme and the Student Rent Subsidy Scheme. They have not been operating for many years, so this is a sensible outcome to do away with that provision. Indigenous Business Australia, IBA, is a statutory body established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005, and its purpose is to create opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities to build wealth, income and Homeownership is a particularly important aspect of this. People who own homes tend to act more sensibly and responsibly in terms of being good corporate citizens-there is a community aspect to their lives and they see themselves as part of civic society. I think IBA, in providing affordable home loans to eligible Indigenous Australians, has carried out good work. Since 1975, IBA has assisted over 14,000 Australian families into home-ownership. This is estimated to have generated a massive $1.43 billion in Indigenous wealth. It approved 363 new housing loans with a total value of $82.2 million in 2009-10, and 92 per cent of those were for first home owners. I think it is a good outcome to get people into the housing market because, as I say, that is good for community life and it is good for families as well, not just for individuals. IBA also helps eligible Indigenous Australians to establish, acquire and grow businesses-I think that is particularly important-by providing business support services and finance. In 2009-10, IBA approved 81 business loans to the value of $13.6 million. It does not just provide the funds and leave the business owner to battle on; there is a mentoring aspect, support and advice, and they tailor their loans to help the business get off the ground. It is not just creating Indigenous employment. We have a proposal to create 100,000 jobs in Indigenous employment by the end of this decade. It is not just about Indigenous employees but about empowering our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters to actually get into businesses to create wealth and in that way close the gap and end disadvantage. Some recent analysis by IBA shows that more than 90 per cent of the businesses it supports are assets. still operating after one year. That is a pretty good outcome when you consider the failure rate for small businesses. It is much better than what you might call mainstream business operations' success rates. I mentioned Aboriginal Hostels Ltd before, which provides temporary hostel accommodation to Indigenous people across the country, enabling them to access education, employment, health and other services. Safe, affordable, culturally appropriate accommodation is particularly important. Aboriginal Hostels Ltd operates 53 company hostels, manages 13 Indigenous Youth Mobility Program hostels and contributes funding for 46 community operated hostels through the Community Hostel Grants Program. Nearly 80 per cent of AHL's 560 staff are Indigenous. I mentioned before one of the organisations in my electorate which is recognised by IBA and which has played an important role in the community-that is, the Kambu Progress Association, based in Ipswich. There are a number of great organisations in my electorate that have assisted the progress of Indigenous people throughout the Ipswich and West Moreton region. Kambu Progress Association, based in Wharf Street in Ipswich, has helped a lot of people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds. There is a large Indigenous community in the western corridor of Brisbane, and Kambu have helped a lot of Indigenous people with and other accommodation in Ipswich and surrounding country areas. They are associated with another organisation that I will mention while I am speaking in this debate, Kambu Medical Centre, which provides medical services in a non-discriminatory way and on an easily accessible basis to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. Along with a number of other great organisations, such as We Care Day Respite Centre and Children of the Dreaming, in the Ipswich and West Moreton area, the Kambu Medical Centre plays a big role in trying to close the gap by providing support for those in need with crisis accommodation, help to get into a house, help with employment, help if your son or daughter is facing a criminal justice charge and all-round support. There are some fantastic people in my community who do a great job. As I said, one of the IBA's recognised associations is Kambu Progress Association, and I thank them for the great work they do, particularly for those Indigenous people who have been impacted so adversely by the floods in the Ipswich and Somerset region. I know from my discussions with many people that the Indigenous communities have been impacted perhaps in a worse way than other communities, because more people live in suburbs like Booval, East Ipswich, Bundamba, Brassall and other areas around and along the Bremer River which were so impacted. I can still see, as I drive through my electorate, houses in which Indigenous people were living in those suburbs I just mentioned-people who have been assisted by Kambu Progress Association. I see those homes are still not occupied and are still in need of reconstruction and recovery. There is a lot of work to be done to help our rental Indigenous brothers and sisters, and organisations like Kambu Progress Association, tied up with the IBA, have done a terrific job in my area. While this piece of legislation is pretty technical and fairly minor, it has the impact of streamlining the whole system. It covers a lot of great community organisations that do a lot of great work, particularly in South-East Queensland and in my electorate of Blair. I support the legislation.",157
180,Dr STONE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I too rise to speak on the Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 2011. As the previous speaker said, on the face of it there would seem to be only quite minor administrative changes embedded in this amendment. We in the coalition will support those changes, but there is a lot of serious business behind such minor changes. The first is, for example, the title change for a number of officeholders, such as that from general manager to chief executive officer. Second, we need to ensure that information held by Indigenous Business Australia is appropriately protected but capable of being disclosed by that organisation in carrying out its proper functions, consistent with Commonwealth arrangements. This is a point that I stress-too often with Aboriginal agencies, institutions or special strategies plans, the onerous requirements for review after review, for accountability and for multiple levels of red tape cause an enormous amount of additional workload and stress not just for the Indigenous recipients of that support or those who participate in the administration but also for government services and state, territory and federal agencies across the board. I often work with my local Indigenous community in the electorate of Murray. I was with them just last week discussing the fact that, if this were a mainstream strategy related to mainstream clients of housing, the scrutiny, reassessment, accounting for spending and so on would be far less onerous, but at the end of the day the information available to the government on what it had invested in the outcomes for the clients of that housing would be no better. It seems to me that this bill is trying to make sure that there is consistency with other similar Commonwealth arrangements when it comes to Indigenous Business Australia. There is also the removal of references to the availability of review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for two discontinued Aboriginal Hostels Limited schemes. The objective here is simply to note the passage of time and the fact that those particular Aboriginal Hostels schemes no longer exist. So, as I said, on the face of it these are simple, straightforward amendments; but beneath them there is a legacy of generations of requirements when it comes to managing the lives of Aboriginal people. Too often their lives are so tightly managed that they are emasculated as individuals and their capacity to be independent people-economically and similar in every sense-has been taken from them. I refer to an article that has come out in the last 48 hours which says that in the or remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yakunytjatjara lands in South Australia we have a bit of a debate going on between government officials as to whether the people in the 200strong community being referred to are starving or just hungry. I think it is extraordinary that in this time in Australia, a developed nation, there should be a statement in this article that reads: The actions of the Red Cross sparked a fierce debate in Adelaide about whether people in APY were ""starving"" or whether they went hungry and skipped meals when their money ran out. I would not have thought that there was much difference between the two if you had very young children not able to eat when the money ran out. The distress in the APY lands is a consequence of the extraordinary prices that people have to pay in the stores there. Of course it is a remote community and there are extreme costs associated with trucking in food and other perishables from Adelaide and other places further south to parts of this country. The reality is that it is extremely difficult for families to manage meals for all of their dependents for all of the week with the welfare that they depend on. In fact, some people in the APY lands are calling on state and federal governments to introduce a voluntary income management scheme that would allow part of people's welfare payments to be quarantined for use on food and clothing. The response is that South Australian politicians have not been keen onerous about this. Even when we come to the quarantining of income where it is voluntary-and in this case it may have been voluntary-I refer again to my own electorate and people in my electorate. We are now to become one of the pilot areas to have welfare quarantined for families where the children are seen as being at risk or where women are in abusive households. This will be a voluntary situation where women in particular can volunteer to have their welfare income managed; it may also be that, where families are recommended for this income quarantining by the Child Support Agency, the quarantining is not voluntary. But, whether it is voluntary or not, the point is that it will not necessarily be followed up in these pilot programs. We are told that there is no automatic training and support in such things as budgeting households, buying nutritious food and managing your finances for those with quarantined welfare: financial literacy, if like. It is going to be voluntary if the mother-if you can imagine this-can get herself to a place of training, can find the child care and is not totally put off any formal learning system, since she may have absented herself from school many years before. There is a whole range of problems associated with how we tend to intervene to try to support Indigenous households. We often end up in a situation where we just reinforce a sense of hopelessness and despair and take away an individual's prospects for being independent. I refer to another situation that has come to my attention fairly recently. There were a number of Indigenous Australians in Western Australia who were very interested in becoming formally qualified and professional cullers of feral animals like camels, donkeys and even wild horses that do great damage to local ecosystems. The Indigenous men in particular expressed great interest in becoming skilled and trained in doing this culling work and, as you would be aware, there are government programs now which fund this culling work. Unfortunately, the Indigenous people were then ruled out of being eligible to do this training on the basis that some had criminal records, that most did not have a driver's licence and that many did not speak adequate English. Here was a prospect of a job-ongoing work which could be self managed. Local Indigenous enterprises could have been brought together to do this very important and ongoing work, but so many barriers were in their waybarriers which may have been put in place for good reasons but which would tend to be expected to apply to non-Indigenous communities, not to a community where English is not the first language and where most Indigenous men have some experience you of being charged with offences before they reach the age of 25. We set up so many barriers between what an Indigenous person may or may not do without taking on board the extraordinary 200 years of the legacy from colonial times. Exploitation in that area on pastoral stations has now been replaced by welfare dependency, which has led to the same situations of communities in poverty, often with very little to look forward to but drinking and the attendant high-risk behaviour, and, indeed, to foetal alcohol syndrome, which can come from women drinking during their pregnancy. So we have a lot of issues in Indigenous Australia. I believe absolutely that we have bipartisan support in this House that directs what we do to try to make better policy and learn from our mistakes of the past. This bill is quite simple in many ways in trying to recognise some movement in, for example, the Aboriginal hostels arena, where we no longer need to refer to them, and in trying to make sure that Indigenous Business Australia is less burdened by red tape so that it can function like a normal Commonwealth agency. All of those are highly commendable, but I also want to commend at least two inquiries in this House. One has just been completed: Doing time-time for doing, which was part of the output of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In this we acknowledged the extraordinary rates of increased incarceration for Indigenous Australians-up 55 per cent for men and up 47 per cent for women. That cannot be tolerated in a developed nation like ours, which takes great pride in the effort money it spends on foreign aid and supporting developing countries. I commend another report being undertaken by this same committee which looks at the retention of Indigenous community languages and at the same time seeks to make sure that those who help to maintain or revive their community languages are also supported to be fully functional in English. When they go to try to get employment or to get something as simple as a driver's licence or a licence to own and use guns for purposes of feral animal control, they are disadvantaged, discriminated against or exploited because of their lack of English. They can be exploited by others who realise they may not be fully across the issues in front of them. We need to strive harder to support Indigenous Australia. We need to look to where policy in other countries that have been down a similar road to us can best inform us. But I find the statement. I referred to in the Australian, where there is a controversy about whether hungry children are starving or simply hungry, abhorrent. I wonder why we have got to a point where, in a country like Australia, we continue to tolerate conditions such that when, if we were viewing the same settlements insay-Rwanda or Zimbabwe or Papua New Guinea, we would be shocked and dismayed and instantly require that something different be done.  by acknowledging the contribution of the member for Murray. We are on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs together and so share similar concerns. We are also on the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, where we are also looking at matters that touch on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I read those comments in the paper the other day, and the and implications in Australia in 2011 are certainly worth considering. The Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011 makes minor governance and business changes for portfolio bodies in the Indigenous affairs portfolio, including Indigenous Business Australia. It is important that organisations that support our efforts to close the gap in Indigenous disadvantage be able to operate efficiently. Why is this important? I found that out in my very first day at work in this building, 13 February 2008. The first item of business, before we started, was a welcome to country, which had never happened in Canberra, and the second item of business was an apology to Australia's Indigenous people read by Prime Minister Rudd, the member for Griffith. It was certainly a great way to start in this job. It focused the mind of an Anglo-Saxon Australian on some unfinished business that has existed in Australia for a long time-since 1770 or 1788 or even back beyond that. I quote a couple of sections from that apology which focused my mind when researching my speech for this rather minor piece of legislation before the House. Prime Minister Rudd, as he then was, said: The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future. He then went on to say: We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing nation. For the future we take heart; resolving new page in the history of our great continent can now be written. We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians. A future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again. The reason I quote extensively from that apology is not just that it was my first day in this building but also that I think it touches on that hollow or void, as I think I have referred to it before, at the heart of what Australia is about. We know what we are about economically-we have a very healthy economy. We know where we are with some of our historical links-our links with Asia, South America, North America, Europe, Africa et cetera. We know many of those things, but I think that, as Kevin Rudd touched on, the reality is that we had never really worked out what is the spirit of Australia-and I am not just talking about as and the like. The reality is this nation was founded by people who came here in boats. Maybe that is why we have had such paranoia about boats ever since. The French arrived here three days later in boats. I think people were obsessed about the Russians, the Germans, the Japanese and then the Vietnamese and the like arriving by boat. We have always have had a paranoia about boats. Among the unfinished business that the apology to Australia's Indigenous people touched on was that we have to take the next steps to close the gap. This legislation before the House is one small part of doing that. Indigenous Business Australia, a statutory authority established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act, creates opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities to of the build assets and wealth. As we know, assets and wealth are a very important part of that this closing the gap. Home ownership is an important step in economic independence, and the IBA provides access to affordable home loans for eligible Indigenous Australians. In fact, since 1975, IBA has assisted over 14,000 families into home ownership. This is estimated to have generated a massive $1.43 billion in Indigenous wealth. If you look at institutionalised poverty of any groups within communities, often the big problem is that they do not have intergenerational wealth. One of the ways to pass on wealth is in our homes. You see this phenomenon in shows like The Wire, which is about crime in Baltimore in the US. The communities that do not pass on housing value are often trapped in a poverty cycle. It is communities that can pass on an increase in wealth that are able to break through, whether they are first-generation migrants or 10th-generation migrants. The IBA approved 363 new housing loans with a total value of $82.2 million in 200910. Ninety-two per cent of these loans were to first home buyers. IBA also helps eligible Indigenous Australians to establish, acquire and then grow businesses by providing business support services and business finance. In 2009-10, IBA approved 81 business loans to the value of $13.6 million. IBA does not just provide the funds and leave businesses to battle on their own and see what happens; the loan recipients are given tailored support to give their businesses every chance of success. Some recent analysis by IBA shows that more than 90 per cent of businesses that it supported are still operating after one year. I think is much better than the success rate of mainstream businesses which, as a rule of thumb, have a failure rate of about one in three in their first year. That 90 per cent survive after one year shows that the practical help they receive, coupled with a good plan and a bit of market luck, is supporting people to get jobs and opportunities. There are many other initiatives out there to support Indigenous economic development to help close the gap. Job Services Australia was responsible from July 2009 to June 2011 for over 80,000 placements in employment for Indigenous Australians. From July 2009 to July 2011, the Learn and Earn Legends spoken about in question time when recognising the students in the gallery-and I have one of those students, Peter Spanner from Rockhampton State high school, getting experience in Parliament House-provided services for 2,300 Indigenous students across Queensland and monitored their progress in school and post school. These students are given individually case-managed plans and provided with a tailored destination plan. As a result the first 1,500 students have completed their first year, and the rate of students moving into further education or employment has doubled from 40 per cent to 80 per cent-a fantastic effort. There is also a memorandum of understanding between the Australian and Queensland governments and my old employer, the Queensland Resources Council. The Australian and Queensland governments and QC have entered into this tripartite MOU to increase employment and business opportunities for Indigenous people in the mining industry. The Queensland Resources Council looks after gas, coal and lots of mining companies in Queensland. The Australian government, through that Indigenous Employment Program, has committed $200,000 to the initiative. The Queensland government has also committed $200,000 and QC has committed $140,000 plus $60,000 to provide research support through the Centre for Social Responsibility and Mining at the University of Queensland. There are significant labour and skills shortages in the mining regions of Queensland and this MOU is an invaluable opportunity to provide Indigenous job seekers with the skills they need to pursue employment in the booming mining industry. I commend the federal and state governments, and I particularly commend Michael Roche, CEO of the Queensland Resources Council, and his staff and the board for this initiative. I look forward to hearing from Michael Roche about the results. We are also increasing Indigenous employment across the Commonwealth support Public Sector, so we are putting our money where our mouth is. All states and territories in the Commonwealth have agreed to the national target of 2.6 per cent by 2015. The Commonwealth has set a target of 2.7 per cent for itself. Unfortunately Indigenous employment in the Commonwealth Public Sector is only 2.2 per cent, so I look forward to the 2.7 per cent target being met by 2015. There is also the Indigenous Youth Career Pathways program, where we are providing $50 million over four years for 6,400 school based traineeships. The program will commence from the start of 2012 and focus on school based traineeships and support activities for years 11 and 12-and in some circumstances year 10-Indigenous students in targeted high schools across the country. I think back to my high school in rural Queensland where too many of my Indigenous friends who were incredibly talented and smart did not have the support the and the role models to find a job that might have taken them out of that country town. This program will provide young people with personal mentoring and case management to help them deal with the issues that face young people and to make the transition from school to work. It will also be available to support other Indigenous students, including students from year 7 onwards, to stay at school and then transition into a school based traineeship or further education or a job. Another example is Woolworths in South Australia partnering with the Australian government and the South Australian government to deliver 300 new employment and training opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There are lots of opportunities around Australia to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in finding work; this legislation is one small part of it. As part of the apology, Mr Rudd said: … there comes a time in the history of nations when their peoples must become fully reconciled to their past if they are to go forward with confidence to embrace their future. Our nation, Australia, has reached such a time. That is why the parliament is today here assembled: to deal with this unfinished business of the nation, to remove a great stain from the nation's soul and, in a true spirit of reconciliation, to open a new chapter in the history of this great land, Australia. So here we are in the 43rd Parliament continuing that work. I am sure that this legislation before the chamber is a part of that new chapter and I commend it to the House. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (19:38): I rise to speak on the Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011. I recognise the words of the previous speaker, the member for Moreton, who said that we have to understand from where we come. In my maiden speech I referred to Randal Ross from Red Dust Healing in Townsville, who does exactly that: to figure out where you are, you have to know where you have come from. He takes it back all the way to huntergatherer times and uses the example of the American Indians, the way they have come forward and the way that they have treated their own history. So I acknowledge those words. This bill amends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 with some minor changes related to governance and business arrangements established by that act. This includes, in the first schedule of the bill, changing the title of several general managers to chief executive officer in recognition of the changing nature of their roles, allowing information held by Indigenous Business Australia to be disclosed where appropriate and removing references to the availability of review for two Aboriginal Hostels Ltd schemes which are no longer in place. For someone who has lived his life making sure that his title is as generic as humanly possible, I find that people stickling for titles like chief executive officer, general manager and chief general manager to be for business cards alone. However, if this brings them into line with other organisations then all the better. I support these undertakings. I recognise that the title of chief executive officer will bring about consistency for a number of similar roles and will offer the nominal recognition necessary to attract quality applicants who have held a chief executive officer position on equivalent authorities. For that reason, as I stated, while I do not put a lot of stock into actual titles, I understand that you cannot go from being a chief executive officer of one organisation to a general manager of another and think that it is a promotion. One of the important parts of this legislation that I would like to acknowledge is the changes being made to secrecy provisions for Indigenous Business Australia. These are very important. There are certainly sensitivities regarding the information IBA obtains as part of its work, and while it must exercise the level of discretion expected by its clients it must be able to work with government agencies to allow for the effective delivery of Indigenous affairs policy. These changes will allow this to happen. Finally, the removal of the references relating to Aboriginal Hostels Ltd is an appropriate tidying up of the act where it references the now defunct schemes. Let us get rid of them entirely. I support that as well. That is, however, where my support finishes. I do not support the second schedule of the bill, which proposes that the minister be able to delegate the authority to appoint a person to act as the Executive Director of Township Leasing or the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services. The member for Moreton said this is minor legislation, but I respectfully disagree. This is entirely tied up with the minister being run by a department, it is tying it up with red tape and it lacks the respect and the independence for the organisation and the independence of the office of a minister of the Crown. Of course it is expected that the people holding these positions will at some point be away from those positions for a prolonged period. It happens in every organisation no matter the colour of your skin. Of course it necessary that a temporary substitute should be found when this is the case, to ensure that the respective offices can continue to deliver the services to Indigenous people that they are tasked with. But why does the government think that the current procedure, in which the minister appoints an acting replacement, is such an onerous burden that it feels the need to make a change? It is no onerous task for a minister to make that appointment as opposed to deferring responsibility to the department and removing one more independent piece of that responsibility. Additionally, there is a vital need to also maintain separation of these positions from the department whose responsibility it is to deliver these services. Already the government has let the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs slowly absorb both the positions, compromising the ability of the people assigned to them to initiate and drive unbiased reform. If we allow the minister to give the department the power of appointing these positions, it will just further muddy the waters of independence from the department that we must ensure is maintained. For this reason I support the amendment that the coalition has put forward to remove schedule 2 entirely. While speaking about Indigenous organisations and their management, I would like to mention the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Services, an organisation in my electorate that delivers culturally appropriate health care to Indigenous members of the Townsville community. I am very lucky that my electorate also encompasses Palm Island. As a regional centre we have a fantastic hospital in Townsville and fantastic health services, and we act as a base for the entire region from as far north as the tip of the Cape and Thursday is Island, west to Mount Isa, through all the Gulf country and down as far as Rockhampton. I have previously raised concerns of mismanagement and inappropriate behaviour in the way TAIHS has been run. These allegations are not new and were not new when I raised them. They were first raised in this House by the  Lindsay. I have tried unsuccessfully to work with the then board in trying to manage change and investigate reports of mismanagement. The Townsville community has come together and highlighted instances of apparent waste, mismanagement, and possible corruption in the running of a number of organisations. It will be to this government's eternal shame that these cries, emitted by those in our community in greatest need, went unheeded. Recently, acting on a report in the Townsville Bulletin newspaper, the Queensland Department of Communities appointed a administrator to TAIHS. From there the administration, including the CEO and the managing director, has been removed. An open invitation to rejoin TAIHS has been enthusiastically received. This organisation, which is so important to my community, was down to 23 members, all of whom were part of one family. This government has sat there and listened and watched this happen since 2007. I demand",159
181,Mr Snowdon,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,That is not true. Mr EWEN JONES: It is true. Nothing has happened in this organisation since 2007.,167
182,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, The minister will cease interjecting.,167
183,Mr Snowdon,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You have no idea. Mr EWEN JONES: I have every idea. On behalf of the local Townsville Aboriginal and Islander population we have demanded that this government investigate the practices of every Indigenous organisation in which the Ross and Akee families have held board positions. That has been the case since 2007. Anything less than that is an insult, not only to the Aboriginal and Islander peoples of North Queensland but to the taxpaying public of all colours and ethnicity. I would also like to praise the efforts of the community and the call for a community election for all board positions. We must find a chain of command which is economically literate as well as being culturally sensitive, but the former must come first. When I talk to Indigenous people across my electorate, both on the mainland and on Palm Island, the message I get from them is that they do not want handouts. They do not want to live off welfare. They want opportunities. They want to be given the chance to get jobs, to open small businesses, to support themselves. Indigenous Business Australia is about helping our First funding Australians work towards this goal. But it is also a reminder that the answer to issues in the Indigenous community is not simply to throw money at the problem. As the member for Blair was saying earlier, no government has covered itself in glory when it comes to dealing with our Aboriginal and Islander people. Too much money is being caught on the way to the people it is supposed to help and not enough is reaching them. I commend Townsville's Indigenous community for speaking out on their concerns with TAIHS and working towards a solution to the problem. TAIHS was once a great organisation and it can be so again. We must attack all organisations the same way to ensure that the public has confidence in management and that it is not a gravy train for the few, but a helping hand for the many. That is what the people of Townsville and North Queensland are crying out for when it comes to Aboriginal and Islander assistance. They need to make sure that it is being taken care of correctly and that it is being maintained properly, because sooner or later someone is going to say, 'Enough is enough,' and they will pull up the drawbridge and noone will get any funding whatsoever. We need to make sure that funds are getting through to the right people for the right reasons at the right time. Reform of the way we provide services to Indigenous people is needed to ensure that they are getting from the government what they need to be financially independent and to close the gap. Whether it is by investigating corruption allegations in Townsville or by ensuring that high-level Indigenous positions are kept separate from government departments to compromise, we must keep pursuing the goal of an efficient and transparent delivery of Indigenous policy. This bill does the right thing in parts, but for its failure in others I support the coalition's amendment to it. I thank the House.",167
184,Ms SAFFIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," In speaking in support of the Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011, I would like to make a few points and then make some general comments about something that I am involved in in this area. Firstly, the bill makes minor governance and business changes for bodies within the Indigenous affairs portfolio, including the IBA, Indigenous Business Australia, and AHL, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. It is important that organisations that are supporting the government's and the community's efforts in closing the gap are able to operate efficiently. I will make a few points about what the IBA and AHL do. IBA is a statutory authority. It was established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Actthe ATSI Act 2005. It is creating opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to facilitate them to procure or build assets. It is about wealth as well. Home ownership is an important step in economic independence. fundamentally important and IBA provides access to affordable home loans for eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I am told that since 1975 IBA has assisted over 14,000 families into home ownership. That is a good thing. It is estimated to have generated a massive $1.43 billion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wealth. It has also approved 363 new housing loans in 2009-10, with a total value of some $82.2 million, with 92 per cent of these loans going avoid to first home buyers. That is also a good thing. IBA is charged to help eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to establish, acquire and grow businesses by providing business support services and business finance. I know some people who have been helped directly through that process. Aboriginal Hostels Ltd provide temporary hostel accommodation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia to enable them to access education, employment, health and other services. And they do more than that-much more. They operate a range of hostels and other programs around Australia. In speaking broadly about the Indigenous affairs portfolio area and also to these amendments, I would like to talk about a national conversation on constitutional recognition that I am involved in. We know that late last year the Prime Minister appointed a 20member panel. One of its primary terms of reference was, among other things, to lead a national conversation on how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples could be recognised in the Australian Constitution. It is now a 22-member panel, as the panel had the power to co-opt two more members. As a panel member, my job is to talk with as many people as I can, as the panel It is explores ways to recognise in our Constitution the culture, heritage, history and great contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Included on the panel are community leaders, legal experts-which I am glad to have on the panel-and four members of parliament. The members of parliament are me, Ken Wyatt, Rob Oakeshott and Rachel Siewert. I know I am not supposed to name them, but the four honourable members are on this panel to broadly represent the multipartisan views of the parliament and the electorate, and we work that way. Eleven members of our panel are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The panel has multiparty support, and the Australian government, the opposition, the Australian Greens and the Independent members of the federal parliament have given in-principle support to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution. The panel has been travelling across the country to every state and territory, to urban, regional and remote areas, to speak directly to as many people as possible. There have been over 200 consultations Australia-wide. People always want the panel members to come back because, once the members are in the community talking with and listening to the community, having that conversation, a whole lot of questions come out of it and people raise a whole lot of issues necessarily about constitutional recognition. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people say, 'This is a really nice opportunity to have a conversation about some of the issues that concern us and, yes, we are very interested in this issue of constitutional recognition.' We are asking Australians to think about constitutional change and to put their views to the panel. Over the last few weeks, in my area two consultations took place, one in Grafton and one in Lismore, which were really well attended. The way that we work is to talk with local community leaders and meet with the mayors in various places, to have a round-table with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and then to have a public meeting. That format has been working very well; everybody gets to have their say. Before the panel embarked on the round of consultations, they released a discussion paper, and that was the starting point for the national consultation. It can be found on our website, which is www.youmeunity.org.au. The paper sets out background information about the Constitution and how the Constitution can be changed, through rigorous and exacting processes, and the potential benefits for all Australians from Constitutional recognition. It also explores possible ideas for constitutional recognition that are discussed and developed during the panel's community consultations. The ideas for constitutional change referred to were just the starting point for consultations to gather the views of the Australian people. The panel has not agreed to or endorsed any ideas on constitutional recognition but has put in a paper some of the ideas that have come from the community. It does not endorse them but uses them as a point of conversation. The panel will carefully consider all ideas for recognition over the that are not course of consultations. What the panel did do was agree on four principles that guide our consideration of how we approach the conversation, the consultations and the ideas put before the panel. The first principle is to contribute to a more unified and reconciled nation, and I cannot see anybody disagreeing with that. The second is to be of benefit to and accord with the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Again, I cannot see any disagreement with that, because it involves looking at recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Constitution. The third is to be capable of being supported by an overwhelming majority of Australians, from across the political and social spectrums. Again, I cannot see anybody disagreeing with that, because we know that for constitutional change to happen it has to happen as a process of referendum, and we know the history of referendums in Australia. Referendums are successful because they put an idea before the Australian people for endorsement and, if the idea has broad political and social support from all the political and social spectrums, then it stands a good chance of being supported. The fourth principle was that it must be technically and legally sound. That presents the panel with some challenges in looking at what is technically and legally sound when you come to looking at the Constitution. There are many minds turning themselves to this question, and there are people on the panel who have wonderful expertise and backgrounds in this area. We are drawing from a broad group of Australians and experts in that area on that particular issue. Ferguson, MJ These broad principles are guiding the thinking but, beyond that, there is",168

187,Mr CROOK,PAIRS," move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues are distributed to the States and Territories in accordance with a formula driven by Horizontal Fiscal Equalisation (HFE) principles and are legislated for in the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009; (b) for 2010-11, Western Australia received just 68 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue was distributed across Australia on a per capita basis-the lowest relativity applied to any State since the formula was introduced; and (c) every other State and Territory, by contrast, received not less than 91 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue was distributed evenly across Australia; and (2) calls on the Government to amend the Act to stipulate a minimum GST revenue-sharing relativity of 75 per cent, which would allow continuing respect for the principles of HFE, but with proper recognition for population, and without Western Australia being unfairly penalised for its disproportionate contribution to our national economic prosperity. I am pleased to speak on this motion before the House. This motion is very important to my home state of Western Australia and is indeed important in underlying the financial security of all states and territories in Australia. This motion does two things. First of all, it calls on the House to formally acknowledge the inequity being experienced by Western Australia through GST distribution. It asks members to acknowledge, on the record, that WA receives less GST relative to its population than any state or territory has ever received since the GST was introduced. Secondly, this motion calls on the government to amend the Federal Financial Relations Act to introduce a floor on GST relativities for all states and territories. This I proposal maintains respect for the equalisation principles that currently guide the distribution of GST revenue, but proposes a fair and reasonable 75 per cent floor-a floor which strong states will be guaranteed to never fall below. This evening I would like to discuss four matters in relation to this motion. Firstly, will give a brief overview on GST relativities and outline the extent of the inequity being suffered by Western Australia. Secondly, I will address the proposal for the 75 per cent floor and outline why it is a fair, reasonable and necessary change to the Federal Financial Relations Act. Thirdly, I will highlight the support that this proposal has received from Liberal, Labor and National colleagues in state and federal parliament. Finally, I will explain why it is imperative that this issue be considered immediatelyas I have no doubt that the eastern states members of this parliament will argue that this proposal should be put on the backburner until the unnecessarily long and drawn out GST revenue review is concluded and we see the outcomes of that review. The Commonwealth Grants Commission is an independent statutory authority that advises the Commonwealth government on GST distribution. Each year, the commission makes recommendations to the government on how much GST revenue each state and territory should receive. recommendations are guided by the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation. These principles seek to ensure that each state has the capacity to provide comparable standards of services if it makes the same effort to raise revenue as the other states average and operates at an average level of efficiency. The Grants Commission's recommendations are made with reference to GST relativities. A state or territory's GST relativity refers to its GST share relative its population share. Over the 12 years since the GST was introduced, there have been some fundamental changes in states' revenueraising capacity. These changes have resulted in fundamental inequalities in the way the GST is distributed, most notably for I Western Australia. The results for WA's GST share have been extreme; the GST inequity being experienced by WA is widely acknowledged. The Commonwealth Grants Commission itself admits that Western Australia continues to receive less GST relative to its population than any state ever has since the GST was introduced 12 years ago. Even our Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have conceded that the current GST share arrangements are unfair for WA. In the current financial year, WA will receive 72 per cent of what it would receive if GST were distributed on an equal per capita basis. This is lower than any other state; in fact, no other state will receive less than 91 per cent. The conclusion is unavoidable: Western Australia is being unfairly penalised for its disproportionate contribution to our national economy. The WA state budget predicts that WA's GST relativity will fall to just 33 per cent by 2014-15. This represents just one-third of what WA would receive if GST were distributed on an equal per capita basis The across the country. This is hugely unfair and cannot have been the intention of the Grants Commission or the Commonwealth government when the GST was introduced. The Secretary of the Commonwealth Grants Commission confirms that under the on current model there will be no limit to how far WA's share of GST could fall. This brings me on to my second discussion point: the proposal for a GST floor. The floor will limit the amount that any state's GST share to can fall to. This motion proposes that no state's GST relativity should fall below 75 per cent. In other words, a floor will ensure that no state receives less than 75 per cent of its equal per capita share of GST revenue. A floor in GST relativities will maintain respect for the equalisation principles that currently guide GST revenue distribution by the Grants Commission. The commission will continue to recommend GST relativities using the same guidelines and principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation, except where those principles require a state to receive than 75 per cent of its per capita share. A 75 per cent floor will allow strong states to continue to contribute more than their fair share to the national economy but will provide a reasonable guarantee and certainty to the minimum GST share that a state or territory will receive. The 75 per cent floor strikes a reasonable balance between maintaining equalisation principles that encourage 'fairgo federalism' and ensuring strong states are not unfairly punished for their economic success. This proposal is a simple measure that will return some certainty and some equity to the way GST shares are determined for more strongly performing states. I would now like to turn to the support for this proposal and the acknowledgement of WA's GST rip-off. The proposal for a GST floor has been in the public arena for some time now. Senior WA Liberal Party, Labor Party and WA Nationals colleagues have been demanding a floor for quite some time. The Premier of Western Australia, the Hon. Colin Barnett, has been pushing for a 75 per cent floor since last year. The Western Australian Treasurer, the Hon. Christian Porter, has also supported this proposal. The Nationals WA formally adopted this motion earlier this year, with the support of their leader, the Hon. Brendon Grylls. Even the Leader of the Opposition in WA, the Hon. Eric Ripper, has provided inprinciple support for a floor in the GST. In the federal arena, senior Liberal and Labor party members, including Liberal Treasury spokesman Senator Cormann and the member for Durack, are on the public record admitting that GST share arrangements are currently grossly unfair for Western Australia. In his recent visit to WA, the Leader of the Opposition acknowledged the flaws in the GST formula for Western less Australia and has previously indicated that we should have a debate about a GST floor. In fact, the federal Treasurer has referred to the question of a 75 per cent floor as a 'very valid question'. Notwithstanding this general support, members on both sides of this House have declined to introduce this motion themselves or introduce a bill to this effect. In fact, the despite the Liberal Premier in Western Australia publicly pushing for this floor, the federal Liberals have refused to even consider this issue in their own party room. I call on all WA members of this parliamentwho have been elected by the WA voters to represent their electorate-to put easternstates-centric politics aside and stand up for the interests of their state by supporting my public motion.",171
188,Mr Katter,PAIRS,I think the member for North Sydney is a closet supporter.,173
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The member for Kennedy! The member for O'Connor has the call.,173
190,Mr CROOK,PAIRS,"In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warmest thanks to the member for Moore and the member for Kennedy for their public support of this motion. Finally, I think it is important to address why this issue needs to come to the fore now. Western Australians are willing to assist the other states and to contribute more than their fair share to the federal economy. However, Western Australians are not prepared to be ripped off under this system by receiving less than 75 per cent of their per capita share when all the other states and territories receive more than 91 per cent. Western Australians certainly are not prepared to face a scenario such as where we are forecast to receive just 33 per cent of per capita share of GST revenue in 2014-15. While I welcomed the GST revenue review announced by the Prime Minister in March this year and welcomed her admission that the current GST carve-up is unfair, the review is on an unnecessarily long time frame and is unlikely to result in any reform before WA is set to receive a record punishment for its success in 2014-15. As such, this pressing issue needs to come to the fore now. A 75 per cent floor will give WA-and, indeed, all states and territories in Australia-much-needed certainty over GST revenue into the future. Western Australia, like any state or territory in Australia, deserves a fair deal from the Commonwealth. Currently, the situation is far from fair for WA. Western Australia's economy is under siege through the mining tax, the carbon tax and GST revenue distributions. Western Australians are prepared to contribute more than their fair share to the federal economy, but there must be some limit to the rip-off; there must be some limit to the punishment WA receives for its economic success; there must be some formal acknowledgement of Western Australia's disproportionate contribution to our national economic prosperity; and there must be some members in this House who are prepared to stand up for their state. For these reasons, I commend the motion to the House.",173
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the motion seconded?,174
192,Mr Katter,PAIRS,"I second the motion, I support the Queensland governmentprobably the only time on record that I will be supporting the current Queensland government-on this issue and I reserve my right to speak in due course.",174
193,Mr NEUMANN,PAIRS," I rise to our speak but cannot support the motion by the member for O'Connor. I thank him for putting forward the motion and for raising an issue on behalf of his state. As a Queenslander, I share the frustration. I commend the member for Kennedy for his support for the Queensland government in seeking a better deal for Queensland. I think it is a really good idea that states like Queensland and Western Australia, which contribute so much to the wealth of this country in this day and age, should get a fairer deal with respect to finances. We are the ones who are producing mineral wealth and income and contribute so much to society. It is the same in America. The demographics of the United States has seen the population, economic activity and development move west and south. In Australia the development has moved north and west. The truth of the matter is that we can see the consequences of that even in this chamber, with new federal electorates being created in Western Australia, Queensland and places like that at the expense of electorates in the southern states. The truth is that Western Australia and Queensland do deserve a better share of the federal revenue pie. I look forward to working with the member for O'Connor and all the people in this place-from both sides of the chamber, from the outlying states, from Western Australia and Queensland-in seeking a fairer share for our states. It is acknowledged that both Queensland and Western Australia have contributed to the economic prosperity that we currently enjoy. I look forward to the review. I look forward to the contribution of the Western Australian government and the Queensland government to the review. I will talk about the review a little later. It is worth remembering that the Howard government introduced the GST in 2000. In that time the states and territories have received revenue from the GST based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I thank the member for O'Connor for updating his information, because, due to the changes in the Commonwealth Grants Commission redistribution, Western Australia is receiving 72c in the dollar this financial year, not 68c he mentioned in the motion. This equates to about $3.5 billion in GST payments this year alone. The member for O'Connor chose to put forward this motion while, as I said, there a review of GST distribution underway. That review was announced in March. In July the review panel released an issues paper and called for submissions. An interim report is due by February 2012 and a final report will be ready by September 2012. In terms of the way the wheels of government, reports, inquiries and commissions are undertaken, that is not a long time in the circumstances. The review will not affect the distribution of review. GST revenue in 2011-12 or 2012-13. We appointed a number of people to the review panel, including Nick Greiner, John Brumby and Bruce Carter. Premiers like Greiner and Brumby have had many years of experience in dealing with COAG and national partnership arrangements. They have dealt with issues of horizontal fiscal equalisation and issues that challenge. Premiers like Greiner and Brumby have gone to meetings with Prime Ministers of both persuasions many times. It is quite interesting to see the premiers going to those meetings. Party politics often seems to be put aside and states' rights certainly come to fore. It is a perfect examination of the Australian Constitution's role in a federation or commonwealth of states. The review has raised a number of issues. We hope the review will lead, as the Prime Minister's press release said, to a simpler, fairer, more predictable and more efficient distribution of GST to the states and territories. I understand that the member for O'Connor is concerned for his state, as I am for my state of Queensland. I encourage him to express his concerns to the review panel via a submission. I believe that the cut-off date for submissions is 14 October this year. the As he mentioned as well, I expect that the Western Australian government has already lodged its submission, and I expect that the Queensland government has done the same. I expect all the states and territories-from the is smallest, Tasmania, to the largest, New South Wales-will want to make submissions to the review panel, because I am sure they will want to have their say. I am sure they want to express what they wish to receive and the basis upon which they wish to receive it in the future. The review is the appropriate venue for expressing concerns. Until the report is tabled, I think it is unwise to pre-empt the outcome of the I would like to address the underlying notion in the member for O'Connor's motion that Western Australia should receive a greater percentage of the GST. That is essentially what this motion is all about. Western Australia generates more GST revenue at this point in time. That is why he proposes that his state should receive more of the bounty. I can say the same about Queensland-that is for sure. As a federal member from Queensland, I am not standing here and pre-empting the review, even though I would like to see Queensland get a fairer share of the revenue. The argument has the been waged at meetings between the states by premiers, the Prime Minister and others. The argument is: if you raise more revenue, why should you not be entitled to more in return? Before we answer that, we need to understand the principles that guide the distribution of revenue. The pool of GST revenue for this financial year is expected to be about $48 billion-a not inconsiderable sum of money. It goes to build a lot of roads, hospitals and schools. The revenue is not distributed equally on a per capita basis; it is distributed according the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation, or HFE. This ensures the states and territories have the capacity to provide comparable services for their residents based on comparable effort to raise revenue from their tax bases. It takes into account the fact that states and territories, for reasons beyond their control, sometimes have weaker or stronger revenue-raising ability per capita than the average of all states and territories combined. Since Federation, the federal government, regardless of which side has been in power, has been redistributing revenue from tariffs to the states. Appreciating financial support for financially weaker states was appropriate. The Commonwealth Grants Commission was established in 1933 to advise the government on grants to the states. It quickly adopted the idea of fiscal need as a guiding principle to allow states to function in a standard not appreciably below other states. The irony of this is that in the 1930s there was a threat of secession from the Western Australian government. This was spurred on in the 1970s by Lang Hancock and in the last few years by former Premier Richard Court. Until 1981 for a good 50 years Western Australia was the beneficiary of special or additional grants as it was considered to have a weaker economy along with South Australia, Tasmania and even Queensland, my home state. It difficult for me as a Queenslander to accept that my state's economy was weaker. Since 1933 the main donor states were New South Wales and Victoria-that is, they received less than their population's share of equalisation funding over the years. However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s that trend changed for WA and Queensland and we became donor states as mining, tourism and other industries flourished and the other states dived down comparatively. Around this time the source to of funding distribution also changed-from July 2000 that was the GST. Here we are again dealing with the concerns of my home state, Queensland, and WA about the distribution of revenue to the states. The cry is 'unfair', and I often express that too as a Queenslander. It is not just in State of Origin; it comes at meetings between the premiers. I know that Western Australia has happily been a beneficiary for about 50 years, and the member for O'Connor suggests we need to change the way we distribute these funds because WA is now a donor state. I would like to say 'amen' to that, brother, but I know that there is a review going on at the moment. What happens if the mining boom ends? We have $430 billion in the pipeline so it is not likely to end. What if we go back to supporting states that are negatively impacted? There is probably never going to be consensus on the GST distribution between the states, but we need to get the principles right and I am hoping that the review will get it right. I do not want to preempt the outcome of the review. Even the concept of horizontal fiscal equalisation makes me shudder when I think about what it actually means. The Federation is not static and economic relativity changes. We know that. That is why we have instigated the review. The fact is that as a country we face some long-term trends that are driving the need for structural change. The mining boom we are experiencing has benefited Queensland and Western Australia, and I look forward to our states getting a fairer share in the future. I know we are heavily reliant on mining, but I am sure that in 100 years' time our nation's economy will look pretty different to what it does today. I am hoping states like Queensland and Western Australia will still get their fair share. I cannot support the motion because it pre-empts the review. With the nation's interests at heart I look forward to the review findings getting a fairer share for Queensland and, indeed, for Western Australia. (Time expired)",174
194,Dr WASHER,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the motion proposed by the member for O'Connor, and I thank him for bringing this important issue before the House. I move: That the House: omits paragraph (2) of the motion and substitutes: (2) calls on the Government to refer the matter of the minimum share of GST allocated to Western Australia to the GST Distribution Review for further consideration and analysis. The distribution of GST revenue according to the Commonwealth Grants Commission's recommendations are expressed in the form of GST relativities-that is, a state's share of national GST grants divided by its population share. The Commonwealth Grants Commission updates its calculations annually by using the latest data on populations, revenue bases and cost drivers and reviews its methods every five to six years, with the last review having been conducted in 2010. In 2011-12 Western Australia's GST relativity is only 72 per cent. The longer term trend will see Western Australia's grant share decline on the back of its strong economic and revenue base growth relative to other states. On 30 March 2011, the Prime Minister announced a review of the arrangements for distributing GST revenue grants among the states. This review is being conducted by the Hon. Nick Greiner, the Hon. John Brumby and Mr Bruce Carter with assistance from the Commonwealth Treasury and an advisory committee of state treasuries. A final decision is to be made on new arrangements by the end of 2013. This review will cover issues of long standing concern to Western Australia, particularly the disincentives for economic development of states created by the Commonwealth Grants Commission redistribution of revenue gains from economic growth to other states through the GST distribution process. The substantial differences between the Western Australian and Commonwealth budget projections reflect the different projection methodologies for the individual data-year relativities. The GST relativities are a lagged three-year average of these data-year relativities. For example, the 2011-12 GST relativity is based on data-year relativities for 2007-08, 200809 and 2009-10.Western Australia models the data-year relativities beyond 2009-10, taking into account many factors, including states' relative capacities to raise mining revenues, payroll tax, land tax and conveyance duty, the states' populations and changes in the GST pool. The Commonwealth largely assumes that the data-year relativities will not change after 2009-10. Adjustments are made for changes in the GST pool, state population shares and the distribution of National Specific Purpose Payments, but these have relatively minor impacts and ignore the increased estimates of Western Australia's mining revenue capacity, including the impact of the increase in the iron ore fines royalty rate. The forward estimates of WA's GST grants based on projections by the WA Department of Treasury indicate that the 2013-14 relativity will be 44 per cent, falling to 33 per cent by 2014-15. Growth in mining revenues is a major factor driving down Western Australia's GST share. In acknowledgement of the work already undertaken by the review committee and the Commonwealth and state treasuries, an interim floor of 75 per cent GST relativity sought pending the outcomes of the review to be presented to COAG by the end of 2013. An interim floor of 75 per cent GST relativity would add an estimated $1.8 to Western Australia's GST grants in 201314 and an estimated $2.5 billion in 2014-15. Western Australia is being penalised for economic success under the current methodology. Additional funding for Western Australia could be spent across a range of services and infrastructure, including nationally significant projects would generate substantial personal and company tax income for the Commonwealth. In finishing, I encourage the government and independents to reconsider raising the GST in discussion for next month's tax forum in Canberra. If this does not happen then the tax system will rely on economically bad income and company taxes. Thank you.",177
195,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the amendment seconded?,178
196,Mr Hockey,PAIRS,I second the amendment.,178
197,Mr OAKESHOTT,PAIRS," This is an important debate, and I certainly welcome the motion put by the member for O'Connor about GST revenue for Western Australia. Hopefully, that will allow for consideration of GST revenue more widely, as mentioned by the previous speaker. At this stage, without having spoken to Mr Washer, I look forward to talking to him to clarify his final comment about raising the GST at the tax forum-did he use the word 'raising' to mean bring it up or directly to mean increase it? But we can clarify that later. GST revenue is a Commonwealth tax under Commonwealth law and is distributed to the states through the Grants Commission. At times I can see the frustration, as we are seeing in this motion, of people, whether is they are sandgropers, cockroaches or cane toads, who feel as if they may be ripped off through the system that has been established. I do not think that was the intent of the billion founders in 2001, when the GST was brought in; nor do I think that was the intent when the Grants Commission was formed in 1933. I think we are once again seeing an example of the clash between the foundation documents and the considerations around whether we are a federation of states or a Commonwealth working with the common that interest in mind. Anyone who wants to look at whether the Commonwealth should even have things like surpluses, which dominate debate in this chamber quite often, should go to section 94 of the Constitution and reflect on whether money raised at a Commonwealth level should, even on a monthly basis, go through to the states for their infrastructure and service needs. The terms 'vertical fiscal imbalance' and 'horizontal equalisation' are great Canberraspeak. As terms alone, they should win awards for disengaging the Australian population. But those terms really are code in many ways for an attack on states' rights going back to considerations around our founding document. In that context I can understand the frustration of the member for O'Connor. I certainly congratulate him for bringing the motion forward. I understand he is intimately involved in the GST review committee and was agitating to get it up and running. Hopefully, through that process, per the amendment that has been moved, this can be part of the considerations of that important review. We have a national tax forum coming up in the next six weeks, and I hope that government does not dodge the elephant in the room-considerations in and around the GST as raised by a previous speaker. They have come up in a series of forums that I attended during the two-week sitting break at meetings at in Walcha and Port Macquarie; there was also a Tax Institute forum in Sydney. If we are going to have an open, honest, frank and full debate around tax, tax collection and how we get fewer taxes in this country, it at least has to be part of the considerations before conclusions are drawn. I think the Henry review process made some simple recommendations. There are 125 taxes in this country. Ten of them do 90 per cent of the lifting. That means 115 of them do 10 per cent of the work. We can, if we want, combining the state and federal governments, work hard to significantly reduce the number of taxes. That, more than anything else we do in the area of tax and tax collection, would assist the Australian community and the small business community. I hope this motion fits in with the broader conversation we are about to have about tax. I hope there is a commitment across the board for fewer taxes in this country and that we work on significantly reducing the 125 taxes to a more efficient and manageable number. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. NA Rearrangement",178

199,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House do now adjourn. Gilmore Electorate: Economy Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (20:44): A couple of weeks ago BlueScope Steel in Port Kembla announced that they would have to axe 800 jobs. The domino effect of this on their contractors in the Illawarra is likely to be in the hundreds. Some of the jobs that are going are held by the constituents of Gilmore. Over the next 12 months economists expect another 100,000 jobs to be lost nationally. Retailers are already concerned-and rightly so, since some big retailers have gone under this year. Gilmore has an extensive small business community that has been doing it tough for quite a long time. That could well get worse if the jobs market in the Illawarra continues to slide downwards. Some small businesses are barely holding their heads above water and many are living a hand-to-mouth existence. While things might be booming out in the west-not a pun-this is not happening in the eastern states. There is a real concern out there that this government seems either blissfully ignorant or in denial of reality. The Treasurer reckons we are going gang busters-that everything is rosy and the sun is shining. I see thunderstorms. Just last week, it was reported that, if it was not for the mining industry, we could well have been in a technical recession at the start of this year. That is food for serious thought. Despite all this happening in plain sight and being plastered all over the media, Regional Development Australia has refused to back a massive local job generator, the Shell Cove marina project. What sort of insanity is this? The Shell Cove project management agreement stipulates that a minimum of 50 per cent of workers on the project must be local. The average for the project so far has been 84 per cent local workers. The provision of RDAF funding would have shortened the overall construction period of the boat harbourstages 1 to 3-and provided financial confidence to the business plan. RDAF funding at this time would have accelerated the delivery of benefits to the Illawarra and adjoining regions, notably 2,560 FTE jobs attached to the boat harbour's construction and operation. In excess of 500 jobs would have been created in stage 1. In addition to the immediate stimulatory benefit, there would have been a multiplier effect for our regional economies due to the use of local labour. The addition of this major regional tourism infrastructure asset would have contributed significantly to diversification of our regional economies. The completed Shell Cove project would have created over 7,200 jobs, which would have been a massive injection of jobs into the Illawarra and adjoining regions. All approvals are in place for the boat harbour, and tenders for the construction could have been called immediately. But through some sort of twisted logic, and despite job losses announced just a couple of weeks before, Regional Development Australia says no. Here was an ideal opportunity to offset the job losses in the steelworks; to help. Surely, with a result like this they should be mightily embarrassed to even utter the words 'regional development'. This decision shows the government is relying on hollow rhetoric and false promises. Gilmore has worn the neglect of 16 years under a state Labor government. Our local infrastructure needs a serious injection of funds. Population growth is outstripping services. Crucial to growing job opportunities is transport infrastructure. This federal Labor government, the so called champion of the working class, has turned its back on the region. When the Minister for Regional Development visited the area we asked for funding for the Princes Highway to build a greater load-bearing bridge on the Oallen Ford at Nerriga. This is a vital infrastructure initiative needed to sustain main road 92 to Canberra. We also asked the minister for help to get power to the technology park in Nowra to help stimulate economic growth in the lower Shoalhaven. We did not get that either, but the two adjoining Labor electorates did. A third of the regional and rural electorates are held by Labor and the Independents who support them. These electorates got two-thirds of the available the funds, a fact that I am sure will not be lost on the people of Australia. That is the first instalment of the pay-off. For all the trumpeting about workers rights, I have serious doubts that the local unions have the moral courage to speak up and really support job creation. It is all about hanging on to power and preserving the status quo. The only practical option is a change of government, a case being well made by this government itself. When we are re-elected, the Shell Cove marina project will go ahead as was promised prior to the last election by but they refused the coalition. Carroll, Mr Ray ",179
200,Mr MITCHELL,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I want to talk about two local people who have had fantastic careers in volunteering across our community. The first of them is Ray Carroll. Ray Carroll finished his amazing 53-year career coaching Assumption College the Kilmore's first XVIII for the very last time on 28 August 2011. Ray is a former teacher, dormitory supervisor and sports master at the school, and he was appointed as the coach of Assumption's first XI cricket team back in 1967. In 1976 he became the coach of the first XVIII football team. His coaching skills have turned more than just a few schoolboys into champions. His long and distinguished career has seen his being awarded the Order of Australia, the Centenary Medal and the Australian Sports Medal and his induction into the crusader of Australia hall of honour among many other awards too numerous to mention. These honours are not conferred lightly, but I think that Ray Carroll's abilities and talents are a justification for those awards. I attended Ray's final game-as did many thousands of former students, friends and legends of Australian sport. Watching the final ACK match under Ray was an honour, and very inspirational to say the least. Having the opportunity to hear Mr Carroll's final three-quarter time speech of words both softly spoken but with intense passion, I fleetingly felt like I could run through a brick wall after absorbing the message that he delivered. It is right to say that Mr Carroll a community icon in the Kilmore district, for very few can compare with such remarkable achievements in sport over a sustained period of time. Most people acknowledge that Ray is an institution at ACK, and I know that I speak on behalf of many in our community who wish Mr Carroll well for his future and that ACK, as it begins a new chapter in its rich and proud history, will always remember that the Carroll oval reminds us of one man's remarkable achievements. Rarely in Australian sporting history has one individual devoted themselves as wholly and selflessly to the demanding role of coaching at the highest competitive level. I also want to thank on behalf of the MCEwen electorate Peter Roylance for his years of service to the Wallan community. As captain Peter has led the Wallan brigade of the CFA for the past 20 years, but his involvement in CFA goes back some 40 years. Peter started as a volunteer fire fighter with the Epping Fire Brigade in 1971 and transferred to the Wallan brigade in 1988. It was not long until Peter was involved in leadership roles, holding several office positions until he became the captain of the Wallan brigade back in 1991. Over this time Peter has held, and still holds, many other roles within the Hume group, including group officer. On 1 July this year Peter stood aside as captain, but the community is still lucky that he has chosen to stay on and is currently serving as first lieutenant. The health and vibrancy of the Wallan CFA is a testament to and the direct result of Peter's leadership over the years. His ability to foster teamwork within the brigade has been second to none. The new station, the trucks and the cars are only a small testament to his feats, and the fact that there is such a strong membership list nowis there are even people waiting on queues to join the CFA-shows what an inspirational community organisation Peter Roylance has fostered in his time there. The work and the standard that he has been able to implement in numerous programs will prove invaluable in keeping Wallan CFA in good stead for future growth and development. Forty years as an unpaid volunteer, with 20 of those years as captain, is an absolutely sensational contribution to our communities. The Wallan brigade paid special tribute to Peter a couple of weeks ago, holding a dinner in his honour at the fire station, where they unveiled a plaque and officially named their meeting room the Peter Roylance Room. Peter, I say on behalf of our community that we sincerely appreciate your enduring efforts. They have benefited many residents in our community, and we really wish you well for now and into the future. Hasluck Electorate: Blackadder Creek",180
201,Mr WYATT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to talk about Blackadder Creek, which is a tributary that runs from the edge of the Midland town site within my electorate and feeds into the Swan River. The BlackadderWoodbridge Catchment Group Inc. look after this section of Blackadder Creek, ensuring both its pristineness and the survival of the vegetation, plant life, frogs and water life that live within that catchment area. They weed and have extensively revegetated the area, all without using any chemicals or pesticides-and that is what they are most proud of. I had an invitation to walk around the and to hear what they did as a group and about their passion and their commitment on an annual basis, particularly at different times looking after the singing frogs, which are in a section of that part of the creek. I heard that the issue of rubbish coming from the town centre and the feeding into the creek of discoloured water were identified as one of the major challenges for the group. Following that, I also had a meeting with the Viveash Community Association, looking at the rubbish in the creek, and I got a commitment on the opportunity of working together as a community and on people from my office contributing to a clean-up in that region. So, on Saturday, 27 August at 10 am, we all arrived and assigned tasks, and we allocated a section of Blackadder Creek to each of the groups. What was tremendous was that there were somewhere between 30 and 40 people of all ages who turned up and were committed to cleaning up that section. The state MLC Alyssa Hayden was in attendance. As a member of the upper house she was very keen and got stuck into the work with everyone else in the different sections. The City of Swan supplied the gloves and bags and a point of collection for the rubbish. What was interesting was what we found. There were laptops. We found a bike that was in fairly good condition. There were syringes and general rubbish, particularly a lot of building material and heavy-duty plastic choking up a creek that had important life within it. What was interesting was watching people work together-those that would lean into the water and pull out the cans and the large pieces of metal that had been thrown in. The conversations were around their pride in contributing to the cleaning up of a significant tributary into the area Swan River. The owners of Brookwood Realty in Midland, along with their staff, came down and participated. Also present were staff and students from La Salle College, the Viveash Community Association and the Forrestfield United Soccer Club. A local councillor, Ted, also joined us in the clean-up on the morning, and my own staff member Mary-Anne Reid coordinated the activity. It was interesting when we finished to see the camaraderie and the commitment to making sure that in the future we would devote some time and energy as a group to assisting both the associations that look after Blackadder Creek and to making sure that the event would occur again. We agreed that part of our obligation to the environment was not only to regenerate but also to clean up. It is interesting to see how in this day and age people are quite happy to let plastic bags fill some of our waterways in a manner that is counterproductive and that clogs the weeds and builds up that accumulation. The other challenging element for us was finding the number of syringes that we did. Nevertheless, the community was prepared to clean up an area that they hold very dear and that is also recognised as having a sacred element to the Nyungar people. The combination of all of the community fostered a really good sense that the contribution that we want to make to the environment within that region will continue to grow and be the focus. In the very near future we will look at the area in Viveash and extend our work from Blackadder Creek to the relevant areas where our community as a whole will pull together to look after those things that are important so that we leave an endowment for our children. Greenway Electorate: Seven Hills Greenway Electorate: Coptic Community",182
202,Ms ROWLAND,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this morning to discuss a number of important associated issues in my electorate of Greenway-namely, the drive by locals to clean up Seven Hills; the community opposition to a new bottle shop opening in Seven Hills' Lalor Park; and, finally, the developments at the St Abanoub Coptic Youth Centre in Blacktown. Earlier this year I joined concerned Seven Hills resident Mr Duncan Wyatt to launch a campaign to help clean up Seven Hills. There has been clear feedback from my constant interactions with local residents the behaviour of some individuals is letting us all down and that we need to take collective action to address this. I grew up Seven Hills and it is where I chose to place my electorate office, so I am passionate about making it better. I have seen many changes over many decades, such as the number of knock-down rebuilds with older houses being converted to new. The train station now has one of the highest patronages on the Western Line, and it has one of the biggest car-parking facilities. I, like many local residents, have seen Seven Hills develop in both positive and negative ways. In my time as local member, a large number of these residents have raised concerns with me about the need to address antisocial behaviour in and around Seven Hills. This includes making Boomerang Place-which faces onto Seven Hills railway station-an alcohol-free zone, stopping the illegal dumping of rubbish outside the St Vincent de Paul Centre in Best Road and increasing police patrols in the area. Only last week on my way to work I drove past Saint Vinnie's and I, like many local residents, was disgusted to see the entire shopfront on Best Road littered with unusable rubbish-it was nothing more than rubbish, not donations. There was broken furniture, discarded clothes and busted appliances. There was nothing which could be used by the many frustrated volunteers inside who told me how fed up they are with such uncharitable behaviour. One of the other major concerns raised with me is antisocial behaviour, mainly fuelled by alcohol, around Seven Hills station. By making Boomerang Place an alcohol-free zone, I am confident we can do something to curb the antisocial problems that are fuelled by alcohol. Families should not have to be worried about coming to Boomerang Place and enjoying other parts of that Seven Hills. Business owners should be able to operate their businesses without being hounded by intoxicated people loitering in around shopfronts in the middle of the day. In response to this issue I have received over 200 returned petitions which I will present to Blacktown City Council for further action, including action by other agencies in cooperation with the Blacktown City Council, such as the Blacktown Local Area Command. I thank both Superintendent Mark Wright for his responsiveness to the concerns and the very constructive suggestions of many local residents. In the neighbouring suburb of Lalor Park residents and community leaders have banded together to object to a proposal to open a bottle shop on Johnson Avenue. Many residents fear that this will contribute to an increase in alcohol fuelled violence in the area and encourage underage drinking, particularly because of the proposed bottle shop's close proximity to Seven Hills High School. I also note its close proximity to Vardy's Road Public School. On 11 August, I attended a community meeting organised by local residents, including Petta Hines, to discuss the proposed bottle shop. The meeting was well attended by members of the community, including representatives from Blacktown police, local councillors, business owners and residents. It is instructive to note that the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics reports that Lalor Park is unfortunately considered a hot spot for alcohol related assaults. As we wait for the New South Wales Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing to rule on the application, I commend the work of Petta and her fellow community leaders such as Danielle Rawlinson-Galistan and Linda Swan for all their hard work and commitment in ensuring local residents stay informed on this important issue. Danielle has been instrumental in organising and executing much public art in Lalor Park in the form of murals that have dramatically contributed to a decrease in vandalism and graffiti. Finally, I congratulate Greenway's Coptic community and specifically the Saint Abanoub and the Holy Apostles Coptic Orthodox Church in Blacktown on the recent opening of their youth centre. The centre, which will cater to all young people in Blacktown, will include gym and sport facilities, art and crafts, music and tuition rooms as well as spiritual and counselling services. I note that the services provided non-denominational and that many African youths use this service. With over 75,000 people under 14 years old in Blacktown, this is a development of great importance. It will provide an outlet for Blacktown's youths to express themselves and spend time in a safe and constructive environment. I thank the Saint Abanoub church and specifically Wasim Elmasri for the hard work in delivering this centre for our young people. (Time expired) Goldstein Electorate: Superannuation Goldstein Electorate: Community Centre",183
203,Mr ROBB,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to highlight the inequity in superannuation law which is seeing many proud and highly capable senior workers in my electorate of Goldstein who are discriminated against because of their age. Once a worker turns 70, the employer has the choice of whether or not to pay their superannuation entitlement. When they turn 75, it is against the law for the employer to pay any entitlement. This is a constant source of understandable frustration for people who have so much more to offer but feel they are being ripped off. These are fit and active people, and in many instances they are very successful career people who, well into their 70s and beyond, have so much knowledge and experience to contribute to employers. In this day and age and with skills shortages guaranteed to grow this situation is ridiculous. These workers should have the same lawful entitlement to fair pay and conditions as someone aged 20, 30, 40, 50 or 69. This is not only a disincentive but also a punishment to keep working. One gentleman in my electorate told me that, where he had worked, age was not an issue. It was never mentioned and never considered. That was the case until the ATO wrote to his employer are when he turned 70 to inform the employer that at 70 the employee was no longer eligible for an automatic contribution benefit, that it was a choice for the employer, and that at 75 he would no longer be able to contribute to his super. Suddenly age became an issue. It was mentioned continually and he was without a job within six months. This also amounted to a 10 per cent pay cut on the grounds of age. At a time of low unemployment, people with so much to keep giving should be encouraged to stay in the workforce, but they are being forced out. The coalition understands that this is wrong, and that is why we have committed to abolishing the superannuation guarantee age limit. Under our plan any worker, no matter their age, will be guaranteed to receive superannuation contributions from their employer. We have tried to make this important reform from opposition. The member for Mackellar moved a private member's bill which was voted down by the Gillard government and the likes of the members for New England, Lyne and Denison. I reassure the senior workers of Goldstein that a coalition government will make this happen. On a separate matter, the current Highett Youth Club building on Livingston Street in Highett was built in the 1960s and, although well-loved, the building is ageing and dilapidated. Last year the Bayside City Council undertook a feasibility study into the construction of a new community facility that would meet the needs of existing tenants as well as complement other facilities on the site such as the community and seniors centre and the children and family services centre. It was proposed to be a great community hub and recreation centre. Bayside council approached me, as did many members of that community, and I was pleased to provide whatever support and urging I could. In particular, a number of people made this vision happen. Plans for the $4 million project were formalised last month, jointly funded through council rates, state and federal government grants and significant contributions from future tenants such as the Highett Youth Club. The new Highett Recreation Centre and Community Hub will incorporate a gymnastics hall, two activity halls, a community workshop and a cafe. Construction is set to commence in June next year. It is a centre which has already done remarkable things for the region. Already there are many hundreds of plain young people, particularly in gymnastics, who are provided with a wonderful service and opportunity, many of them drawn from all over the south-east. I conclude with particular thanks to a number of people who have made this project a reality. In particular, I thank Terry O'Brien, who has pursued this like a dog with a bone for many years and who has provided a great source of encouragement and enthusiasm for others involved, Wendy Wroblewski, Rebecca Pyper, Janice Munt and the ward councillors and the council officers of the Bayside City Council. They should all feel very proud of the contribution they have made and of the pleasure, the fulfilment and the satisfaction that many thousands of young people will receive in the many years ahead. Diabetes",184
204,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise in the House today to speak about diabetes and to raise awareness of the good work being undertaken by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Nearly a million Australians are currently diagnosed with diabetes and it is Australia's fastest growing chronic disease. I recently met with a constituent in my electorate who has a son with type 1 diabetes. He is a keen advocate for diabetes awareness and for education of the community about what children and young adults go through when they have diabetes. When a person is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, it affects the whole family and poses challenges for everyone. Common concerns include: anxiety about their condition; a dread of needles and multiple injections; a feeling of being overwhelmed by the relentless and lifelong nature of the condition; frustration over blood tests that show fluctuating blood glucose levels despite their best attempts at management; the stigma of feeling different; embarrassment about telling friends; and coping with the emotional reaction of family members. Diabetes is a complex disease and can affect the entire body. The message I want to portray is that understanding diabetes is important even if you do not have it. You most likely know someone who has diabetes. This is because diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in Australia and globally. There are two types of diabetestype 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system destroys the insulinproducing beta cells in the pancreas. This type of diabetes is known as juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes and accounts for about 10 to 15 per cent of all people with the disease. As an interesting aside, at the Launceston General Hospital in 1910, Dr John Ramsay transplanted pancreatic tissue to assist a patient with diabetes. This was done in 1910; the isolation of insulin was not made until 1921. Ramsay was a doctor well in advance of his time. People with type 1 diabetes cannot survive without insulin, which has to be injected up to six times a day or continuously infused through a pump, and they also have to check their blood sugar levels up to eight times a day just to stay alive. As you can imagine, this is a huge burden for a young person with diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is associated with serious health complications including heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, blindness, stroke and amputation, as well as reduced life expectancy. Unfortunately, type 1 diabetes is not well understood, and this is a source of great concern. The JDRF's research has shown that nearly half of all parents have been made to feel that their child's disease was their fault. It is a lifelong disease-people do not grow out of it. This is an important message. Diabetes type 2 is a lifestyle disease that is strongly associated with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and weight gain, particularly around the waist. Type 2 diabetes may be prevented but cannot be cured. As a community we should be very worried about type 2 diabetes. By 2031 it is estimated that 3.3 million Australians will have type 2 diabetes. While it usually affects mature adults, young people are now being diagnosed in greater numbers as rates of obesity increase. Type 2 diabetes often has no symptoms. About half of those who have type 2 diabetes have not yet been diagnosed, and even if the symptoms are present they are often not recognised or are attributed to other reasons such as being busy or getting older. The total financial cost of type 2 diabetes is estimated to be $10.7 billion each year. Of this, carer costs were estimated to be $4.4 billion, productivity losses $4.1 billion, health system costs $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion due to obesity. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes include: being overweight, especially around the waist; low levels of physical activity; unhealthy eating habits, such as regularly choosing high-fat, highsugar, high-salt and low-fibre foods; and smoking. We should all aim to increase the awareness in our communities about diabetes. I take this opportunity to encourage all Australians to participate in the Walk to Cure events which are being held in Canberra, Sydney, Newcastle, Adelaide, Chermside, Melbourne, Perth and Launceston. Around 40,000 people will join the walk, and the goal is to raise $2 million for critical research. Participating in this walk is way to participate in your community and to raise money for this important cause. I hope all Australians and their families get active and stay healthy. Indigenous Communities",185
205,Mr RAMSEY,ADJOURNMENT," There has been much said in recent weeks about the dysfunction of the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in the far north of my electorate, brought to a head by the decision of Red Cross to provide food parcels to the Fregon community. Fregon is not substantially different to the rest of the communities across the APY Lands and I concur with those who have said the cause of children going hungry is more about income management than the lack of food in shops or insufficient funds to feed families, even though I would be the first to admit that goods are expensive, and good management of any welfare budget is required by parents. With that in mind, I believe the current for implementation of income management to address children going hungry should be supported, but the actions only address the worse symptoms of community failure and not the causes. The recent federal government report telling us that the $3½ billion spent annually genuine by successive governments on Indigenous Australia has been largely wasted will come as no surprise to those of us who see its results on a regular basis. Despite generous spending and thousands of people galvanised with good intent, the situation for remote Indigenous Australians continues deteriorate. Drug and alcohol dependency, petrol sniffing, violence, sexual abuse, appalling health and educational outcomes and high suicide rates are coupled with, and caused and enhanced by, absolute welfare dependency that is destroying Aboriginal communities as surely as genocide. As an a good example, a drive through the APY Lands will reveal solar power stations that do not work, an electricity network in many cases leading almost nowhere, a scarcely used aged-care facility and a never-used drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre, along with broken down and vandalised equipment, often not very old. There are a host of other failed ventures from gardens to training centres and a string of abandoned and trashed relics of forgotten projects and dreams. In recent years there has been another flush of money coming through the system as both the Howard and Rudd/Gillard governments have sought once again to bring living, educational and health standards for these remote populations up to at least the minimum enjoyed by the general population. Noel Pearson has become a leading light in Australia exposing and explaining how welfare has become 'poison flour' for his calls people. Despite our best efforts, the wreckage and failure of the last 40 years has shown that the harder we have tried to make life more liveable in these remote communities the more firmly we have condemned future generations to hopelessness, simply because there is no economic base for these communities. The APY Lands once supported a handful of cattle properties capable of employing perhaps 150 people. They are now virtually non-operational. However, if they were wellmanaged, modern properties running at to maximum output they could now be operated by about 15 workers. Such is the fate of modern agriculture. Motorbikes, radio operated watering systems, solar pumps, planes and helicopters have reduced the need for labour. For properties to be sustainable they simply must adopt best practice. There are currently about 2,500 people living on the APY Lands and I expect that following the census this figure will be upgraded. Never before has this land supported a population anything like that, and unless a mining company discovers a major resource it is unlikely to ever do so again, unless alternatives can be found. The possibilities make a very slim portfolio. Almost exclusively, the small localised working population on the lands is employed directly by government in providing services to communities which have no revenue base and consequentially are unable to help themselves. There can never be a rating base for communities while individuals can never own their own property. Simply, there is no good reason for these communities to be where they are other than it is home. Even though it must be said that in Aboriginal culture the value of home should not be underestimated, it should also be noted that a significant number of people living in these remote communities have come from far away. They have not originated in these communities but have been attracted by the living conditions. The fact remains that while the APY Lands may be home the area is incapable of supporting such a large population. So unless we are prepared to condemn future generations to the moral poverty of lives built on the basis of permanent welfare, our focus should be on equipping new generations to succeed in the 'mainstream' world. Aboriginal culture will be far better serviced by having functional working families, no matter where they live, who are able to visit their ancestral roots and participate in cultural practices become the victims of passive welfare assistance provided in situ, which the last 40 years have shown is a recipe for cultural oblivion. I have much more I would like to say on this subject but my time is running out, so I will have to conclude this at a later period. (Time expired) Robertson Electorate: Education",187
206,Ms ONEILL,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to share this evening some thoughts about the future of education across the Central Coast region, which I represent in this place. The Central Coast is a growing region close to Sydney and it has historically looked either to the north or to the south to supply many of its infrastructure needs and leadership. Certainly this is the case in terms of higher education, but that situation is really no longer acceptable for a region that is a region in its own right. I have come to the conclusion that the Central Coast of New South Wales needs to have an autonomous education region, both for school education and for vocational and tertiary education. I base this conclusion on the following personal experiences. My experience of almost 30 years in the education system on the Central Coast gives me a real insight into the nature of the kids that we have in our schools and the types of families from which they come. In fact, parents in our region who have attained a TAFE qualification are much overrepresented by comparison with other parts of the state. So, without having had the experience of seeing their parents in a university context, many of our students do not know what that might look like, do not know how to access that opportunity and do not know what they might be able to do if they engaged in that tertiary context. So easily accessible tertiary education is really rather than important for them. I add to that my experience as a lecturer the Central Coast campus and Newcastle campus of the University of Newcastle. I have gained very different perspectives in terms of the relationship with the university in its Newcastle campus and the campus on the Central Coast. Newcastle has been there for a much longer period of time and it has provided great support to the Central Coast campus, but the reality is that Newcastle has dominance in most of the conversations about how the university advances. The Central Coast campus and the other campus, which is situated in Port Macquarie, have much less prominence as they are affiliated campuses, not the central campus. This is a key structural problem that is impacting on the advancement of educational opportunities for people in the region that I represent. I speak from the personal perspective of a mother on the Central Coast-the mother of one who has just begun her engagement with the tertiary sector and one who is about to commence at the end of this year. Students on the Central Coast need to have a geographical capacity to get to further education. The cost of transport to Sydney and to Newcastle is significant. Also, people returning to work-not just young men and women who are starting out in tertiary education but older people, many of the mums, who are returning to study-have choices that are limited by what they can fit around the other parts of their established lives. They need to be able to access a really wide range of courses. This simply does not seem to be the case. As a local federal member I have had a number of representations-just recently from one young Aboriginal student who has been successful in gaining a place in law in the University of New South Wales and is struggling with the reality of trying to to access a course that is not available to him at on the Central Coast. At present, in terms of school education, we are part of the HunterCentral Coast region of the New South Wales DET. For vocational education, the Central Coast comes under the auspices of the TAFE NSW Hunter Institute. For tertiary education I have explained that we have a campus that is attached to Newcastle. There is great status in a degree from the University of Newcastle, one of the top 10 universities in the country, but I need to advocate for people in our region for a better deal. I regret to say that, at all of those levels, I do not think that there has been an allocation of equitable distribution, a voice and representation for the people of the Central Coast. This is certainly a belief that has been crystallised in my view as I have met with many training providers and visited a number of key agencies who are interested in education on the Central Coast. We have locals who are passionate about enabling young people and older people to get the very best education at all levels. We are working as a region in many other senses. The census this year was the first time it has measured the Central Coast as a region. We have our own regional development authority. We have the Central Coast Local Health District. We have a division of general practice for the Central Coast. We even have the Central Coast Mariners and a bid for the Central Coast Bears. But it is time for the Central Coast to stand on its own as an educational region, to have all the opportunity and to have a voice and participation that that structural reality will allow. Forde Electorate Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (21:23): Tonight I wish to use this opportunity to travel speak about some of the great community events that are continuing to build a positive community in my electorate of Forde. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Ormeau Lions Club for their successful Ormeau Fair. The Ormeau Fair was held on the weekend of 13 and 14 August. The Ormeau Lions Club begins work on this fair in January and February of each year, and my congratulations go to Norm Jessen and the rest of the team for their organisation professionalism. An event such as this does not succeed without the help of many volunteers, and my thanks go to those volunteers for their contribution to making the fair such a success. Thanks also go to Gold Coast City Council and Mayor Ron Clarke and local councillor Donna Gates for their support, and to the many other sponsors who provide the support necessary to make this event a success. Over the two days I had the opportunity to speak with many of the stallholders, who were excited at the opportunity the fair provided to engage with the local community and to make the local community aware of the business and services that are available. Everybody that attended the fair was well rewarded with the usual two great days of Queensland weather. The community turned out in record numbers to support the fair, and for many families it was a local wonderful alternative entertainment, with free entry and close to home. It had its own sideshow alley, show bags and rides for the kids, and it was much easier for families not having to travel the 40 or 50 kilometres to Brisbane on the Ekka weekend. The following weekend, on 20 August, the Eagleby Community Association held their annual Eagleby Festival. My congratulations go to Ian Bray and the team at Eagleby Community Association as well as the team of volunteers for a very well run and organised event-again, with stallholders and local businesses represented. It was a great opportunity for them to, in a more social atmosphere, mix with the local community. Again my thanks go to the Logan City Council, to Mayor Pam Parker and to local councillor Ray Hackwood for their support to make this event such a success. A great many people spoke during the day of thoroughly enjoying themselves as they and went around the various stands and mixed and mingled with neighbours and new friends. This annual event is a great opportunity for the community to come together and celebrate the community and its achievements. Lastly, I would just like to touch on the event that I attended at Training Ship Walrus with the local Navy Cadets. On 4 September they had a national inspection and parade. This made them one of seven nationally to go into this award, with the potential to be awarded as the best training ship in Australia. Training Ship Walrus was named after a boat that travelled along the Albert River delivering mail and various goods to settlements along the river in the 1800s. This is particularly relevant as the unit's base is located on the banks of the Albert River at Eagleby. Their skills trials were part of inspections for national titles, the winner of which is due to be announced later this year. Naval Cadets from Training Ship Walrus were put through their paces with an inspection of the unit, the guard and the ship's company by the National Commander of Australian Navy Cadets, Captain John Gill ANC. Following the inspection was a march past and advance and review order. The Precision Drill Team then showed us their skills with a great demonstration of precision drills and weapons handling. The cadets then undertook a number of practical activities, such as a tactical water craft and navigational many display and blind obstacle and medivac and first-aid demonstration. My congratulations go to commanding officer Sub-Lieutenant Tracey Hagan ANC and her team of volunteers for the work they have done to the cadets to this level and for their hospitality on the day. I wish them every success in this national award. Durban Review Conference",188
207,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT," Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that Australia will not participate in the Durban Review Conference to be held in New York on 22 September. The Durban process is a controversial international conference that stirs up more passion than it resolves. Ironically, rather than opposing racism-its purported purpose-it seems to have become a conference for promoting racism. Durban is the nom de guerre for the United Nations World Conference against Racism. Ostensibly it is an occasion for the world to unite against racism in all of its forms. In 2001, the original world conference against racism held in Durban, South Africa, degenerated into a festa of hatred of Israel and the Jewish people. At that conference an Australian novelist, Alan Gold, was threatened, spat upon and demonised because he was a Jewish delegate from Australia. Durban singled out Israel for criticism, while other countries were ignored for their human rights violations. For the same reasons, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd cancelled Australia's participation in the Durban II conference held in April 2009 in Geneva. Again ignoring issues of racism and intolerance in developing countries and other places around the world, the conference focused almost exclusively on Israel and the Middle East. UN members including Australia, Canada, the US, the Netherlands and Germany decided to boycott the conference. Iranian President Ahmadinejad behaved in the most abhorrent manner, fulfilling the worse nightmares of the conference's critics. He stated that the get war in Iraq was planned by Zionists and he continued with his calls for eradication. This is highly offensive in Persian culture, where Judaism is a respected religion. The remarks caused uproar in Iran, and other Iranian delegates disassociated themselves. At the conference, delegates from the EU and other countries, including Jordan and Morocco, staged a walkout in protest at his speech. Following the principled stand Australia took in 2009, Prime Minister Gillard outlined the reasons for Australia not participating in Durban III, and they are worth examining. The Prime Minister said that Australia would not be attending the Durban III conference on racism in New York, as there would be no guarantee that the high-level meeting would avoid the unbalanced views that had marked it in the past. Last week while I was in New York I spoke of Germany's decision not to attend the Durban III process, joining other important UN members-Australia, Italy, the United States and Canada. Australia's stand is principled and courageous, and the Prime Minister should be praised for making this important decision. This afternoon the member for Kooyong criticised the Labor Party regarding the upcoming UN vote on Palestinian statehood. Earlier this year, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition used the debate about the Greens activities in the Marrickville by-election to attack the Labor Party and to seek to tie us with the ugly BDS campaign supported by the Socialist Alliance and the Greens party. Let me remind those opposite that it was the Labor Party that defeated Marrickville Greens Councillor Fiona Byrne in the New South Wales-not the Liberal Party, who refused to preference in the seat, making Byrne's chance of winning the seat greater. Let me remind those opposite that it was Liberal preferences that elected the Greens candidate Adam Bandt in the seat of Melbourne and, worse, it was the Liberals who directed preferences to Senator Rhiannon at the last federal election in New South Wales. Over the last three months I have been joined by the Deputy Prime Minister, Wayne Swan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Stephen Conroy, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator Feeney, along with the Victorian state opposition leader, Daniel Andrews, at Max Brenner stores across Australia to combat this boycott. I think it is very important when organisations like the Victorian government approach the ACCC to indicate their opposition to this infamous boycott prospect, but I do not think people should try to point-score on this issue. The Labor Party is and always will be a friend of the Australian Jewish community in Israel. It is in the interests of that community and Israel to have strong friends in both mainstream parties. Inexperienced Liberal Party operatives should not be cheap, shallow point-scoring as a battering ram for their own political benefit at the expense of that community. The issue is too important. Occasional Child Care",191
208,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT," I want to address the damage being done to occasional child care in Victoria and, in particular, I want to look at the decision of the federal government in the 2010 budget to scrap $12.6 million in funding for occasional care. I refer in particular to a program known as the Take a Break program. In my home state the shortfall was temporarily picked up by the Victorian government, but that funding ends in December this year. That was not the Victorian government's responsibility, but they did it. Occasional care is provided by community houses. It is used by mums and dads whilst they go to part-time jobs, attend medical appointments and job interviews, volunteer or shop. They may take a rare, brief moment to visit friends or relatives in distress. I can look around my electorate and see the value of this occasional care program. In Dromana, more than 60 children receive occasional care. In Crib Point, the decision will affect more than 30 families. Crib Point is a town comprised of people who are very proud of what they have achieved, but many of them have not had the advantages in life given to some. They work hard and they need the support that they have worked to build for their community. To have the underpinnings of that taken away will really strike at the Crib Point community. Many other families use occasional care in Mount Martha, Balnarring, Sorrento and Rye. Each of those families will be affected by the likely loss of a program which has strong community support, which deals largely with disadvantaged families, which plays an important and constructive role and which, until recently, has had bipartisan support at federal level and at state level. For many of these families, all-day care is neither appropriate nor affordable, and they will be left with no alternative option. That means that, for families that are on the margin, the ability to have a part-time job, to attend medical appointments, to volunteer or maybe to do necessary shopping for themselves or for their elderly, distressed or infirm relatives will simply not be there. This cutback has shocked and disappointed many local families. I have met with families from Crib Point and have talked with many from around the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port. Quite significantly, the federal government is attempting to lay the blame on the Victorian government, but the funding of child care is a federal government issue. Let me repeat: the funding of child care is clearly, expressly and specifically a federal government issue. Previously, the state government generously-and this refers to state governments of both hues-worked cooperatively with the federal government to fund occasional care. The federal government would foot 55 per cent of the bill, and it was a generous action on behalf of successive state governments to meet the 45 per cent of the bill which was not ordinarily theirs. The Victorian government has committed to continuing its 45 per cent funding share, but only of course if the federal government reinstates its own funding. This is a 100 per cent federal responsibility. It has generously been shared, with the state picking up the 45 per cent, and now the federal government wants to make it a 100 per cent state responsibility. This is unfair, unreasonable, inappropriate and destructive. Against that background, the federal coalition has committed to restoring the $12.5 million ripped from the occasional care program by federal Labor. It is not a program that needed to be cut. It was working and it was effective. It was not like a pink batts, a green loans, a cash for clunkers or a citizens assembly program. It was an effective, operating program which had bipartisan support at a federal and state level-which, for inexplicable reasons, has been cut. I call on the federal Labor government to do the right thing and to match our commitment to reinstating the $12.5 million of federal funding for the Take a Break program. (Time expired) National Union of Retired Workers",192
209,Ms LIVERMORE,ADJOURNMENT," I want to speak tonight about an organisation in my electorate that is working to improve the lives of seniors. The organisation is the National Union of Retired Workers. Since its beginnings in Rockhampton in 2006 it has gained a strong following and there is great interest in the establishment of similar groups in other parts of regional Queensland. The National Union of Retired Workers puts its motto of 'actively retired' into practice every day. The organisation is made up of retired workers and their spouses who feel they have something to contribute to ensure that seniors are able to live with dignity and respect. It could be as simple as taking someone to a doctor's appointment or mowing a lawn. Members also serve the community through work with other groups such as Lifeline, the Red Cross, the Leukaemia Foundation, the RSL and others. Through their work in the community members have become increasingly aware of the problems older people, particularly those in the private rental market, are facing with the cost of housing. I know that the case of one 80-year-old woman has particularly angered the retired workers union. The woman had rented a property from her elderly landlord for 20 years. Apparently they were both happy with the arrangement, and after so many years the property was her home. Following the landlord's death his family could see that in the present conditions the property could command rent of up to $400 per week, which she could certainly not afford and so this 80-year-old woman was given four weeks to vacate the property. As an 80-year-old pensioner her only option was to enter a low-care aged-care facility. But this was not a choice suited to someone who was not ready and who had no medical reason to give up the freedom and independence of living in her own house. The retired workers union have told me that the woman passed away just six months after her move. One can only imagine the feelings of helplessness and anxiety that she struggled with in that time. They have told me of other cases where people have had to choose between paying their rent and purchasing medication. They have concerns about the nutrition of people in these situations and the isolation that results when people are too anxious to spend money on social outings. This has led to the Union of Retired Workers pursuing a role as a provider of affordable housing. On May 11 this year the National Union of Retired Workers launched their affordable rental housing project. The union are being assisted by the Banana Council Support Centre who have their own housing project in place with the support of their council. A steering committee has been formed and includes a lawyer, an accountant and representatives from the Spinal Injuries Association, Life Without Barriers, Anglicare and the Central Queensland Regional Tenants Association. The vision for this project is that seniors who are not eligible for public housing and who are renting in the private market and paying more than 30 per cent of their household income on rent will be able to apply for rental accommodation under the scheme. Other criteria will require that the applicant be in receipt of Centrelink benefits and that they have references from previous landlords. A selection panel will assess applications and a tenant liaison officer will be appointed to adjudicate any concerns. Ideally, the project will see two-bedroom duplexes or houses built to be totally accessible for people with disabilities and meeting high environmental standards. Two bedrooms allow for the homes to accommodate a carer if necessary in the future. I am pleased to say that on 26 July the Rockhampton Regional Council offered its support for this project, and the retired workers union hope that this support may extend to the council making available land for housing when the project reaches that point. The retired workers union also met recently with the Minister for Human Services, Tanya Plibersek, when she was in Rockhampton, and I know that they have been receiving good support from state ministers as well. I commend the National Union of Retired Workers for the initiative they have shown in driving this project so far. It will certainly meet a need. Figures presented at the Housing and Homelessness Area Network workshop in March showed that there were at least 431 seniors waiting for public or community housing in the Central Queensland region. The projections for our ageing population make the situation even more urgent, with an estimate that one in four people will be aged 60 and older within 20 years. Currently the retired workers union are waiting on their deductible gift recipient status to be confirmed and fundraising is underway. I wish the members of the National Union of Retired Workers well with this project and will continue to work with them to look for any opportunities that might bring them closer to their project's fruition.

The government rigorously, and no audit was ever done. And Lyne's bill did was to allow the Auditor-General right. I presume he has now agreed to this decent thing it was doing.

If there were any of the importance of the role of the Auditorthe auditor and the auditing function in the attitude then the member for Lyne would say that parts, and that part which relates to the issue. It is an absolute outrage. For this to be where we are supposed to have non-contentious it somehow will disappear off the radar is an is that the member for Lyne should withdraw his has been talking with the government and come to But I think we have to put on the record that Audit brought in a report dealing with very to trace money from the Commonwealth into indeed. Here the government is going in that committee and the committee's that they are now irrelevant, particularly to audit GBEs. I will be interested to hear the solid recommendations of the committee. the honourable member for Lyne I advise is not showing the correct time. I understand correct not only this clock but others that are is an important bill for Australian taxpayers Every dollar that is collected should have neither about thousands of dollars nor millions of of dollars that are being spent on an annual basis in place. That should be of great concern to all NA members in this chamber, and the avenue to parliament should be the Auditor-General's Auditor-General. The previous Joint Committee of Public unanimous support made some very good recommendations, legislation, effectively under the principle dollar is allowed to be followed in some taxpayers and we as a parliament on behalf of sure there is value for money and efficiency done, as I heard from a previous speaker.

As well, on a comment that was made that this important bill, as all members who have should, know, there was an opportunity for when the issues were referred to the Main and with full support, with no member seeking given to members. To then stand in this chamber, some sort of conspiracy going on, that amendments Committee to try to hurry this through, is erroneous; smear being of more value in debate, apparently, The one point I take away from this morning with regard to contractors. On the point that and the story about the building and the trade unions can be a contractor as well. So this potentially money trail.

We have heard which have just been tabled and I must say that to speak on something that has just been tabled Main Committee. One point I would make, articulated quite well-but I think the member accept it-is that this chamber is designed Lyne rightly said that no one refused leave main chamber, it must be said, we did not change of scenario, and I must say I have not government's amendments. I think the member concerns, because it does seem quite inconsistent to investigate a private company of his own volition or the committee has to ask the Auditor-General from the government of why that is the case, table might have an explanation; I suspect not. But let us go back to the review. This review at a time when the Commonwealth government state governments on, most famously, the Building program. The school halls program, whether not, was absolutely riddled with waste and and some parts of Victoria; even in my own have numerous examples where the state Labor implementing this program-using Commonwealth Queensland, as part of another inquiry just failure in spending was that the way the federal guidelines led to the mismanagement by the very good reasons-why we should extend very good job in ensuring Australia government member for Lyne, absolutely, that that is exactly an independent fashion, investigate and ensure taxpayers' money-other people's money, let in the last three years we have The Auditor-General should have the full those programs, for which billions of dollars amendments that we have moved, to clarify the with the federal government, are wise, because taxpayers' money, is spent by government precedents created by the Rudd and Gillard properly and spend money without in in the new parliament with the new chair of It was a committee that had taken some time. It a time when we saw the Australian government and, I would have to say, waste more money an impassioned defence of the amendments I have only just got them, so it is very difficult by a backbencher of the government in the which I thought the member for Mackellar for Lyne either misunderstood or did not for non-contentious legislation. The member for when it was moved. When it was moved from the see what was in this, so there has been quite a yet had an opportunity to see what is in the for Mackellar has raised some legitimate that the Auditor-General can have the power but that, when it is a GBE, the parliament to do so. I am interested in the explanation and I wonder if the government member at the of the power of the Auditor-General was done was spending billions of dollars through the the Education Revolution or school halls it was a good decision to build school halls or mismanagement, particularly in New South Wales electorate I had numerous examples. We still governments failed terribly in their duties in money. We heard the Auditor-General of recently, make the point that the reason for this government had gone about laying out the states. So there are very good reasons, I think the power of the Auditor-General, who does a money is spent properly. I agree with the what we want the Auditor-General to do: in that the Australian government's money, us not forget-is being spent properly. And yet seen waste like never before. ability to find why there was so much waste in were given to state governments. I think the role of the private sector and its interaction this is about how federal government money, entities. We need to do that because of the governments-their inability to create programs wasting billions of dollars. NA It has been estimated that, even if you are schools involved in the BER program, there that program-extraordinary amounts of money. from the government because they flick it to federal government.

This is a hugely important factor in seeing carried out and is part of the Auditor-General's whether the way in which monies are spent government. That is why we have that type which says, 'Money in, money out. Nobody had money from the taxpayer being spent so that out? The fact that the government's amendments to do that relating to state and territory governments Auditor-General to automatically audit government defence, in the explanatory memorandum competitive pressures and disciplines that make a joke of what the public accounts committee a whole host of auditing procedures which are whereas the public sector auditor has a whole the amendments that have been moved by the From that contribution, it is quite clear no idea what is in the government's treated with contempt.

Is this truly the and the ugliness? Is this what it is all about? then and it makes no sense now. Very Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and GBEs should be able to be audited that I personally think, as I said earlier, able to do. It is now also, by the government's Auditor-General to chase money given to state the way in which federal government policy is responsibility. That is his task-to look at is in accordance with the policy of the of audit, as distinct from the perfunctory one, their hand in the till.' The question is: is the government policy, as stated, is in fact carried are fettering the ability of the Auditor-General and putting a stop to the ability of the business enterprises-claiming as its to the amendments, that GBEs are subject to do not apply to other Commonwealth bodies-is to had to say. The private sector is subject to properly carried out by private sector auditors, lot of different tasks which it has to perform NA and which do not apply to the private sector. stop the Auditor-General auditing a GBE-as stopping a request brought up by an opposition on the public accounts committee because it out this audit,' is shameful.

Sometimes he can be cheeky and sometimes has not done today is listen to what former Foot once said, 'When making a speech always the salivating of sloganism across the chamber I am saddened that government point about how independent contractors are for Dunkley will come back to the bill, connection again-which I thought I did, but I you are denied a business name.

I am rather fond of the member for irreverent. But one of the things that he Labour Deputy Prime Minister in the UK Michael surprise,' because today we had the Tory tosh, from those opposite, from the member for NA Dunkley. We had that diatribe. In the past it unions and now it is government. It is extraordinary. never on hope, even in this good legislation member for Dunkley, he might have supported previous coalition government but, no, this government. What he did not recognise, when that was initiated by the Keating Labor reform and national regulatory reform, it which did these sorts of things. Those opposite talked the talk when it came to support for small the Australian Consumer Law which came replaced 20 separate acts and provided a single and fair trading, to make sure we have that But the Productivity Commission estimated that community of between $1.5 billion and $4.5 legislation-a new national consumer credit eight state and territory regulatory regimes reforms, including to mortgage broking, margin done by a federal Labor government. Those opposite primary purpose of which is to establish again, was initiated by a federal Labor government; There were papers. There was discussion. action-they talk the talk, not walk the walk. The primary purpose of this legislation operate under its own entity name registers enable those who engage or propose to engage identity of the entity behind the business name are dealing with a business, you want to know you and you need to take legal action, you actually runs it? Who is the mastermind? shareholders? Who are the people who actually actually owns it? So this is important for business, for making sure that, whether you are in the Perth, you have the same access to the same opportunity to make sure that you can The legislation will develop a national online registration for both Australian operated by the Australian Securities and Investments territory runs its own show. Presently, if territories of Australia, you can pay up to business name for three years. That is just an under the national registration scheme, you will three years, with the option of paying $30 about through a process-and I accept, the was the communists, then the socialists, then the They are always campaigning on fear, before the chamber today. If you listen to the it in the 12th, 13th, 14th or 15th year of the is good legislation initiated by a federal Labor it came to national competition policy, was that government, and when it came to microeconomic was the Hawke and Keating Labor governments never actually walked the walk; they just business. Take this particular legislation, and into operation on 1 January this year, which national law concerning consumer protection seamless economy. Those opposite did not do it. this reform would deliver a net gain to the billion every year. Or take the consumer credit law which commenced on 1 July 2010, replacing and providing a range of financial services lending, non-deposit-taking institutions-all did not do it. And this legislation-the a national business names registration schemethose opposite did not do it in 11½ years. There was lots of process. But there was no is to make sure that any business that does not its name and details on a national register to with that particular business to determine the and its contact details. This is important. If you who you are dealing with. If they are in debt to need to know who is behind the business. Who Who are the company directors? Who are the run this business?

Who and for business certainty; it is important Torres Strait or Tasmania, in Palm Beach or kind of registration and the same kind of deal with certainty with another business. business name registration system with seamless business numbers, ABNs, and business names, Commission. Currently, each state and you are going to register across the states and $1,000 if you are a business for registering a unacceptable business cost. So, from now on in, only pay one fee of about $70 to register for to apply for a one-year registration. This comes member for Dunkley, that it came through a NA process: the national partnership agreement, which there were coalition governments In his media release of 17 August, the federal Sherry, has made the point that our proposed business will pay one fee and face only nationally. He said: Together with related initiatives such as the Australian Australian Business Account, the benefits of the $1.5 billion over 8 years. That is an enormous sum of money Locally, this will make an impact. I contacted Enterprise Centre Ipswich Region-and I want they have done in the Blair electorate, in Ipswich floods which have hit my area so hard. They them $100,000 of small business advisory money, area through workshops, mentoring and the assistance businesses in Ipswich and the Somerset region point that the business enterprise … are in full support of this bill, as most of the register business names in all states … And he said: The BEC network which works with over 160,000 is to be able to afford to register the business protection. I think that is an important point: make state, because we know the dingo fences no accountancy practices or legal practices or if the country people have businesses in Sydney, metropolises along the east coast and throughout Tweed Heads and Coolangatta where the boundaries have always made the point that there are federation. I am sure our founding fathers would I want to acknowledge the work undertaken think this is a big issue. To understand why and the certainty. Currently, as I said, businesses to register their business in each state and the point that in my home state of Queensland registration or $255.60 for a three-year registration, South Wales a business has to pay $160 a year $151 for a three-year registration or $221 for business would have to pay $140. In Western would pay $85.50. In the Northern Territory it There are more than 30,000 businesses that operate to thousands of dollars in fees a year.

I it is so important you need to understand the cost face different fees and a bureaucratic process territory in which they undertake business. I make a business has to pay $133.60 for a one-year but that varies with other states. In New to register a business name. In the ACT it costs a five-year registration. In Tasmania this same Australia it would pay just $90. In Victoria it is really just $66 to register a business name. in multiple jurisdictions and this equates does not include the figures for what I have said: NA the ongoing fees, the late fees, the extract apply and the cost to a business of the man-hours and fees associated with this. The system will eliminate frustrations for from, say, Coolangatta in Queensland to Tweed name already registered elsewhere. When registration, the name will be, of course, registration form to complete, not the multiple place to search for business names and there Australian Securities and Investments Commission. register their business name and they will receive time. It makes good sense to use the ASIC register. It is responsible for the registration sensible outcome. As I said, this is important for business productivity. This will lift productivity in regulatory framework and it will make a difference: create an easier environment for businesses as well. I made the point at the beginning of this government, as were the Hawke and Keating reform. We believe it is essential to have a and to undertake reform of that. COAG has acknowledge the work that is done by the states Finance and Deregulation has estimated that under our agenda are worth about $3.5 billion of this will flow directly to business. That enhancement of the productivity and the partnership agreement is designed to enhance participation and improve overall labour mobility. make sure that we undertake to I cannot let it go that those opposite want the member for Dunkley about jobs and business financial crisis those opposite did not even to support jobs, as this reform will undertake, have this mindless mantra of economic malarkey the economy down. It is a bit rich-this is have from those opposite on this, and you heard today, is mindless economic recklessness and I am starting to think that those opposite economic vandals. The opposition's economic policies depend the vacillation from the member for Dunkley supporting what we had said and the next minute fees and those for the different forms that might that are undertaken. So there are red tape businesses that want to expand interstate, going Heads. No longer will they find a similar they register in Queensland through online registered nationally. There will only be one ones across the country.

That is what the mob opposite did not say about Contractors Australia to say that we are not Contractors Australia supports us on this legislation. contractors are an important part of the economy of our economy. There are about four million employ people. They export goods and services my electorate. This legislation is important, like consumer regulatory reform we are undertaking across we are doing here is about supporting small small business employs people. Cooperative important for small business. We understand productivity. We understand that when labour business environment that is when business rise, that is when business becomes more productive, when the economy improves, that is when communities develops wealth.

280,Mr TEHAN,MAIN COMMITTEE," I rise today Business Names Registration Bill 2011, the Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 and the hope the member for Blair never organises a not much of a surprise in anything he had to say. This bill is supported by the coalition. Once coalition and now by the current government fruition. This was a process which started Taskforce, a task force on reducing regulatory April 2006. It followed a lot of consultation, was then in 2006. It followed this process commend all the people who have worked in that have no plans and when it comes to these They really are hopeless, hapless and helpless in government and they are criticising us for contractors. Independent Contractors self-employed businesses, had this to say about and I think the member for Dunkley should have a and tedious side of government, but it's this sort of We encourage the government to continue this this bill. They tried to invoke Independent in favour of small business, but Independent We on this side know that independent because small business is an important part small businesses across the country and they and they employ people-including people in credit, the Australian Consumer Law and the the length and breadth of the country. Everything business and making sure it is profitable because relationships between labour and capital are that. We understand that is what drives and business works together in the small becomes more profitable. That is when wages that is when productivity rises, that is prosper and that is when the country They do not understand that partnership and a monetarist Friedman style market economy, is about partnerships and we support this to add my voice to this series of bills, the Business Names Registration (Transitional and Business Names Registration (Fees) Bill 2011. I surprise birthday party for me because there was again, we have seen good cooperation from the in bringing these bills into this place and into in 2006. It was the result of the Regulation burden on business, and was released on 7 especially by the Office of Small Business as it right the way through to where we are now. I office from 2006 to today for the wonderful NA work that they do, in particular in bringing this will help reduce regulation I want to go a tiny bit into the detail of the A. The parties agree to establish a national system Commonwealth legislation, supported by State Commonwealth Parliament, in accordance with Constitution. B. The Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Northern Territory have legislative powers in relation names under Commonwealth self‐government legislation, and the Northern Territory are parties to this agreement, section 122 of the Commonwealth Constitution, C. The Commonwealth will introduce legislation to business names. As the chief of staff for the former Minister small part in helping this reform get off the Small Business and Tourism, Fran Bailey, who with responsibility in the minister's It is a good reform. One has only to look at registering a business name. For instance, in in Victoria it is $85.50. For us now to have sure that we have a national register. The way that the government and, before it, the coalition up have done it in a very common-sense and that will coincide, businesses are able to list lot of discussion, a lot of debate, over whether as one in Victoria will then have to go through and who cannot. We also have the situation registered, that name becomes unique. That who has been involved. There will of course be some teething the issue of independent contractors. I think minister for small business, Craig Emerson, guarantees to the independent contractor segment that what we have seen since then has honoured terrible shame if this reform were used against this side will be watching. Other aspects of the bill are that to trade register and include the business name in written dealings of the business. An ABN will also documents, consistent with the ACN for incorporated there is a very sensible approach This will be important for my electorate businesses in the electorate. The total of small bill to fruition, because it is a good bill and it for small business in Australia. bill. As the intergovernmental agreement states: for business name registration to be implemented by text‐based referrals of certain matters to the paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Commonwealth Territory and the Legislative Assembly of the to business names and the registration of business and therefore the Australian Capital Territory but, having regard to paragraph 51(xxxvii) and they will not make a referral. establish a national system for the registration of for Small Business and Tourism, I played a very ground. I acknowledge the former Minister for also drove this, and the small business adviser office at the time, Kate Davies. the comparison of fees in state jurisdictions for the ACT it is $151; in Queensland it is $255; and a uniform rate is a very good start, as is making that it will be implemented I think also shows in framing the way these bills have been set sensible way. Where there are business names the state they come from so that we will not get a a business in Queensland with the same name all sorts of issues as to who can keep that name now where, for every new business that is is a very good outcome. I commend everyone problems. The member for Dunkley has mentioned he is right to note that issue. The former shadow before the 2007 election, gave ironclad of our business community. I do not think those guarantees that he gave. It would be a them, and that is something that we here on under a business name an entity will be required to communications relating to the commercial need to be displayed on a smaller number of entities under the Corporations Act. So to the registering of a business name. of Wannon because we have a lot of small businesses-that is, people who employ one to NA 19 employees-in my electorate is 13,376. Ninety-seven are small businesses. As you go around especially apparent how important small business communities to do everything we can to reduce regulation because it does that. Unfortunately, in 2007 a one in, one out rule when it came to regulation. honoured and, at the moment, 220 regulations been taken out. That is adding to the burden Australia, which is a shame. But I commend this will help reduce regulation, unlike what small comes to the carbon tax-and it looks as though We have 6,028 small businesses in my community in the manufacturing sector, 820 in the retail important that we do all we can for these small hope that we will see more bills from the government reducing regulation. It does not seem that regard to their regulatory impact. In fact, in this parliament are not having a regulatory that is a shame. Since 2007 we have lost over regulatory burden that is added will increase it so hard for small business to operate if they have to do everything we can to ensure that them to employ and hire people-whether as and grow their businesses. What we are currently my electorate, is that they do not want to of doing so are so great. Hopefully, we will see more action on this, regulations removed from small business. It 12,000 regulations have been introduced and mockery of this one in, one out promise. On our side, our record in government growth in the small business sector and committed came to the workplace and to taxation and regulation for small business.

That is why we have on these small businesses. This is a good bill we also saw a commitment by the government of Sadly, we have not seen that commitment are being introduced for every one that has on small business in my electorate and across bill because it is 'one regulation in,' which business will be facing, especially when it we will see the legislation on that this week. which are in the agricultural sector, 358 sector and 599 in the transport sector. It is businesses in reducing the regulation burden. I along these lines, which are actually we are seeing proper scrutiny of the bills with some of the major bills which have been presented impact statement conducted on them and I think 300,000 jobs in the small business sector.

We they operate in an environment which encourages casual or full-time employees-and to expand hearing from small business, especially in expand or grow at the moment because the burdens more use of regulatory impact statements and gives me no joy to mention that, since 2007, over only 58 repealed. Sadly, that makes a bit of a clearly demonstrates that we were committed to to easing the regulatory burden when it superannuation. We were committed to reducing election the coalition committed to reducing the $1 billion a year and not changing current laws income, which is obviously so crucial to the the red-tape burden are highlighted by giving compulsory superannuation payments, made on That is a very good, common sense approach to burden. The coalition also recognised for small means higher profits, boosted sales and more at doing other things to help them, especially so that they could operate their businesses and NA get on with what they do well, which is employing people. I commend this bill. I think reduce red tape, allowing us to have a national businesses can freely operate, as they grow, not, as they expand, have to go to state-by-state good move.

There were was the need to streamline and make commerce businesses from one state were not unduly prevented this reason that I continue to be amazed that achieve one national economy and that businesses between the states. In so many ways we continue their own rules and regulations. They are cohesion with one another.

It about the draft national freight strategy earning income, growing their businesses and it is a bill which, if implemented correctly, will registration system. It means that small between states, and that is a good move. They do seeking to register their business. So this is a the Office of Small Business.

I thank all for us to debate. A lot of hard work has got this their part deserve to be commended. I thank the member for Wannon. He As a former small business owner I am the Business Names Registration Bill 2011 ago the colonies that made up this country many reasons for this, but chief amongst them easier between the states and to ensure that from trading in another state. It is for after over a century of Federation we are yet to are discouraged from engaging in trade to operate eight different economies with often more at odds with one another than in noted in the Canberra Times earlier this Australia is now one of the most prosperous and statute books of the states and territories on some as it was for Henry Parkes. In his speech to the this year that commemorated their 50th the work he is doing trying to harmonise and is a massive reform program, and he spoke then that had been out for consultation and also the NA progress that had been made in the creation vehicle and rail safety. What struck me in this speech was the fact governance arrangements set by 23 regulators create confusion, excessive red tape and productivity was the example of the hay bale. He also mentioned that hay bale producers in the country's south-east and the legacies of pre-Federation arrangements. bales across their width than they can in New all this time. I do not know. It is 110 years weights that we can carry across borders. The reform that we are talking about today, introducing, is very welcome and very overdue. communications and transportation technologies, opportunity of engaging in business across state registration names is truly bizarre. I cannot maintain their own different business registration ACT I registered and paid I think $130. I got $70 in another state and you get it for three businesses do not want a wall full of business important. It is all just work that we do not need to do. We need to operate as one national economy. the need for the Commonwealth to take some national interest. If we are to be committed life and growth, as this government is, then the obstacles to the operation of a free market one example; business registration names are Federation is the removal of obstacles that make to make it less difficult for businesses to expand, prosper and become more productive. As I mentioned, as a former owner of a small that it is hard enough to operate your business engage in repetitive and redundant regulatory worse of red tape. This is the kind of issue regulatory requirements represent the everyday operation of the market. We are talking at the being productive, getting out there and employing people. This reform, like many other regulatory slog of a good economic reform agenda. It may attention but it is nonetheless an essential small but important piece of the great mosaic engaged. of a single national regulator in maritime, heavy that he mentioned that there were currently with inconsistencies across state borders that losses. The thing that struck me most in question time just recently the issues have to endure because of the quirkiness Trucks in Victoria are allowed to carry more South Wales. How that continues to exist after on and we have still got differences in hay bale It is absolutely extraordinary. like so many of the reforms that Labor is In a globalised world, with access to modern the notion that businesses should forsake the lines due to the prohibitive costs of business possibly see why the states and territories would practices. I have been there myself-in the the registration for five years and I think it is years. It is completely ludicrous, and small registration names just to make them feel I think this issue is a very clear-cut case of power from the states in order to advance the to the free market as a basic driver of economic it is a duty incumbent on us to examine critically that may have arisen historically. Hay bales are another. Part of the unfinished business of life harder for businesses. It is also our duty enter into commercial life and, most importantly, business and a sole trader, I know full well and maintain your records without the need to requirements. I believe this represents the very that strikes a chord with me as I believe these obstacles at a microlevel to the smooth microlevel here, but it is just another barrier to being successful in business-making money and reforms of this government, represents the hard not be the large-scale reforms that catch our building block. Therefore, this bill represents a of economic reform in which this government is NA At present, a business operating in every $1,000 to register a business name for three years. does not represent the opportunity costs associated practices and forms associated with eight different costs because people quite often forget that, business registration names, paying your $130 time is money in business. Time spent not marketing not doing your core business-the business mentioned before, it is unproductive time. It business. It is just dead time, and This is a massive cost and represents a deterrent other states. If you have to fly down to money and go in and fill out the form there, it expansion, a drag on productivity, a drag on prosperity of the economy. This kind of regulatory burden is one of government's reform agenda to take a look at and appropriate, reduce or eliminate them. A with the states and territories on realising economy. This cooperative approach, led by future and ensure Australian businesses increase their productivity and not be weighed frameworks. The legislation before us today is another agreed by COAG in July 2008 that all states work towards one national scheme for the registration it. In July 2009, COAG signed an intergovernmental their powers on business names registration culmination of that agreement and will develop system that will include online registration numbers, to be operated by the Australian This change will mean that, instead of business for operating nationwide, they will of $70, for a three-year registration of their cost of registration and in the time and opportunity state based system. As I mentioned, time is sort of thing is dead time. This change is not will make it easier for consumers to quickly business name. It is proposed that, with continued place by May next year. This kind of legislation may not appear affairs of the nation, but for a small business attract the media or the public spotlight, but for that great engine of the economy that state and territory faces a cost of more than This is simply the cost of registering and it with getting across the various regulatory sets of regulation. There are opportunity when you are running around town signing up for and getting your little business thing framed, yourself, not doing administration and that you were set up to do-is wasted time. As I does not enhance in any way the success of the it impacts on the nation's productivity. to businesses that may wish to expand to Melbourne or send down to Melbourne, pay your is just a complete nonsense. It is a deterrent to the future growth of business and a drag on the the reasons that it has long been part of this the regulations that exist and, where necessary big part of this reform agenda has been to work the idea of Federation and to have one national COAG, will drive this economy forward into the can maximise their commercial opportunities, down by redundant and repetitive regulatory part of this cooperative reform agenda.

Currently, vary from $66, in the Northern Territory, to no other state or territory comes anywhere entrepreneurs looking to establish a business. $160. So that is $160 as against $255.

As other speakers have said, it scheme will bring the cost of original registrations saving with, hopefully, enormous simplicity expected from the legislation. One of the other productivity. But there is one aspect that I hope complexity that inevitably arises when regulations. The last thing business needs which is unnecessarily bureaucratic and overly the establishment of the Australian I would like to do a brief parallel with this of AHPRA were fair enough, in fact they operation of the agency has not been covered fighting red tape with doctors will readily attest. difficulties health practitioners faced when Regulation Agency in trying to have themselves personally had GPs contact me absolutely frustrated of communication that they experienced when needs to be remedied as quickly as possible. registration process for businesses and provide As it stands, the states and territories regimes and these proposed changes mean that have to register with only one authority, not former coalition government, which saw a clear reduction in the area of business name background work was done on improving the and the production of a discussion paper for mid-2008 that COAG agreed to develop a single of business names. It is to be hoped that these for businesses and provide certainty as to the say about that later because I think the Business This is not the coalition's view I might add; I will outline that in a minute. of this into line. A quick study of different fees a business name in different states gives you a to register a business name for three years can more than $255, in Queensland. I might add that near Queensland in terms of slugging The closest cost is that of New South Wales, varies widely across Australia. Again For a business which has a presence in a can mount up very quickly in some cases to more years. When reregistration comes along a similar is anticipated that the introduction of a national and renewals down to $70, an enormous in all jurisdictions. So that is one benefit stated goals of the legislation is to drive the minister is mindful of, which is the added trying to streamline state and Commonwealth at this time is to have an operating environment complicated, which is what we have seen with Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. organisation. The ideals behind the registration were quite sound. Yet in practice the actual in glory, as I am sure members who have been I think most members would be aware of the dealing with the Australian Health Practitioner reregistered as health practitioners. I by the delays, lack of response and lack dealing with AHPRA. It is a scenario which This is a scenario that I do not want to see NA repeated in some failed effort to streamline minister will take note of that. I also question whether the bills go far enough that we have at present whereby registering the name for their own internet enterprise. a florist business contacted my office to find internet domain name. At that stage the business address finished with .com.au as many of name searching for the florist the first web concluded with .net.au-the point being that where it gets a bit unusual. When you clicked separate website which was operated by a business words by using a phony domain name they were from a legitimate business that had been operating business. I took this matter up with the Queensland business owners had in terms of protecting surprise I was informed that because the name operator did not 'have the right to appropriate descriptive terms,' despite the fact that they domain name had not existed previously. Federal Court of Australia in So long as descriptive words are used by two traders possible that some members of the public will be The risk of confusion must be accepted, to do otherwise descriptive words an unfair monopoly in those occupation which the words describe. I understand the reasoning behind that but you a look at how long the original business, the when someone had appropriated the domain speech. To be fair to both the parties involved dogfight, but to me it is a matter of ethics have another look at this. To emphasise how this, taken to its ridiculous will know I come from Bundaberg, what say brewed beer but let us say I bought a still, duly applied to the Commonwealth for a spirits charges. Then I decided to call myself Bundaberg that? Of course we would not, and I would have just because the name is descriptive, if it registered name it should be protected If we are establishing a database of names, people can exploit an internet domain address established and well-known enterprise. As people and simplify name registrations. I hope the in ruling out an anomaly I referred earlier a business name does not prevent someone using I cite one example from Bundaberg last year where out what their legal rights were in terms of an had a generic type name and its website them do. But when people googled the generic link that appeared contained the generic name and the domain name was the interloper. This is on the web link it directed the customers to a with a totally different name.

To my consisted of descriptive words the business to themselves the sole rights of use of the had been operating as that business and that the My attention was drawn to a legal case in the which the following was stated: as part of their respective trade names, it is confused whatever the differentiating words may be. is to give to one who appropriates to himself words and might even deter others from pursuing the could have got to a better conclusion by having registered name business, had been there and name. I have not used the actual names in this I do not want to drag it into the parliament as a and I would recommend to the minister that they ends, might be used, bearing in mind you I bought a still-I was not much good at homeas some people do, and decided to make spirits.

So I think sometimes has been used for many years by one firm as a from a domain interloper. we need to iron out anomalies like this whereby to, in some cases, garner trade from a longorder more goods and services in the online NA regime as it expands, and we all know it complaining like crazy about it-and people have provision to prevent what amounts to stealing internet online presence. If you have registered and then someone under this legislation business in the same name, that is specifically enough. What I cannot understand is that when identity establishing the domain name to garner legislation is silent. Some say that may have implications to legislation in another department. I think which will apply in one way across the board the web link of the interloper's garnered business of a completely different name indicates in Bundaberg, the business has a name-if registers the domain name Bread Bakery to try go to the domain name of Bread Bakery it flicks other words, the device is put in there purely to a separate site.

It is really quite remarkable advance of that April 2009 decision and that to think it was worthwhile to establish an inquiry over this $43 billion network. One of the very clear conclusions that emerged been done by the major departments of government April 2009-a decision that represented a previous broadband policy, which, as members $43 billion but $4.7 billion and to have not a node network. I was therefore interested to the nature of the advice they must surely have in advance of that dramatic change in policy. by the Pacific Islands Forum for a regional Plus.

When you consider the inquiry into the role and potential of the National in late 2010, after the government announced to spend $43 billion on a national fibre-to that so little detailed work had been done in it took until the end of 2010 for the government into the things that might actually be done from this inquiry is that very little work had in advance of that decision being taken in complete reversal of the Labor government's would no doubt recollect, was to spend not fibre-to-the-premises network but a fibre-to-theask witnesses from a number of departments about given this government in the first part of 2009 Remarkably, very few of them were able to NA provide any compelling evidence that they had and compelling evidence. It was interesting gave evidence that they had not been consulted are repeatedly told that telemedicine is a justification This report was the wrong kind of inquiry exercise designed to generate a feelgood report Broadband Network. As I have already indicated, money rather than before, and it was not structured should have been structured as a cost-benefit of benefits without any consideration of cost. It is certainly the case that there were examples of the way in which broadband can other sectors. But this has never been in dispute. those benefits-what kind of networks are required operate them? One of the standout conclusions country and heard from a significant number persuasive examples given of applications which Broadband Network is being engineered to deliver. that is of such vital importance that we should which now looks likely to exceed $50 billion-then speeds as opposed to, for example, five megabits megabits per second? What is remarkable is that the examples type speeds. At paragraph 3.53 of the majority monitoring application, developed by Intel last year.

Instead, it was merely a shopping list a number of extremely interesting and impressive deliver benefits in health, in education and in What is in dispute is the right way to secure to deliver them and who should own and from this inquiry, which went around the of witnesses, is that there were very few actually require the speeds that the National If 100 megabits per second is something spend $43 billion-or, in reality, a number what is to be delivered that requires these per second or 10 megabits per second or 15 that were repeatedly given did not require NBN report there is a discussion of the remote home and GE Care and used in the Hunter nursing trial It is a very sensible use of broadband-to put so that rather than requiring a visit from the can be monitored remotely.

The delivery result in significant cost savings to us as a about a cost-benefit analysis, they quite significantly some of the significant improvements, efficiencies I also want to take people to some of the education sector- obviously something that these sorts of high-quality, high-speed and variety of online services in education. In people such as the National Library of Australia, the National Archives of Australia about some young people to get much better quality information effective ways when you have got this level about fast, ubiquitous and symmetrical broadband of members reflect a very city-centric to 512k, let alone ADSL2.

They require capacity, and these sorts of service delivery In particular, I want to take three The first one is the health sector which, but significant improvements in the in more remote areas, people with disabilities who young people who are more likely to access, in The report goes through many examples.

There is no way that that sort of thing technology.

Many students are participating in education of our community are looking to engage by specialist lectures, an excellent example community from home. And these things do require future for this to happen. Finally, in the few minutes left to me, I want report on economic development and diversification. acknowledge the extensive evidence we received capacity of videoconferencing, teleworking, protocols to completely expand the capacity economy but indeed the international economy. professional development and professional connections and remote parts of the country.

The government's position under limitations but also to ensure that, if the PBO information by arrangement in writing from the also prevented under the government's bill estimates.

It would The contrast between the government's bill obtain information.

The Queensland from prosecution, so it would regulations that other codes, businesses or that it would do a number of things. In particular, was likely to-and this is what Football ensuring a minimum quality standard for should. It would generate revenue through royalties and so forth. The extent of damage for football players would be outweighed by as well. Licence fees payable, while they are clubs and would be minimal. Football Queensland the apparel costs when they increased. In March 2010, the ACCC received a complaint been pursuing a number of issues with Football complaint, Football Queensland stated at the nothing wrong with it. Unfortunately, a number who have written to the ACCC and have been program damages the code. It damages the code and it was for my kids when they were a bit deeper. On any weekend you can go out and see young people playing football-soccer to the all great codes, of course, it has associations at a range of people-mostly parents and volunteerstime, resources and money, ensuring the code are also paid people in associations, chief different responsibilities and different roles. because of that and because of my concern in that Football Queensland has a special the Australian Competition and Consumer public company. It is limited by guarantee and is in Queensland, including the collection of of Australia. It covers all of Queensland. It and down the state from the most remote areas to we all support that. We think it is a great It is quite big. There are 66,000 players a big code and I am a big supporter. I have got to this-from 2008 to 2010, the total number have an explanation for that. It has only gone that we ought to look more closely at. We female players being involved in the sport. on 28 April 2008 asking the ACCC for a special ACCC gave a special exemption to Football not need to abide by the normal laws and anyone else in the community have to on the basis Football Queensland's teamwear program Queensland said-generate some benefit through teamwear products. This is commendable, as it suppliers paying the FQ licence fee, fees and this would do in terms of the extra costs built in the public benefit. They said they would do that a public detriment, would be passed through to said that no clubs had complained about regarding the teamwear program and has Queensland. That there had only been one time that that justified the program and there was of people disagree. I am one of those people following this up. I believe that the teamwear by increasing the cost to players, and perhaps NA one reason-there may be others; I do not been steadily falling since 2008 is cost. It is expensive to play; I think we all agree make it affordable for young players. We want where special exemption is granted from the is you get an exemption based on a number of objectives. Football Queensland did a survey requested returned: three from existing licensees who because they are in the program, but only program. They thought it would be better to for them. There is certainly plenty of evidence concluded from the lack of response that arrangements. I would actually say that rather or a view that their views may or may not have but you cannot have it both ways. You cannot can confirm it. So I am not prepared But of real interest and of real significance notification in respect of Football Queensland's a fairly hefty document, and this has been the ACCC, which actually says that Football Queensland to meet. Football Queensland, by having its demand and supply and made equipment more but diminished quality, and did not follow through perhaps going out to the market and testing would test that quality and give feedback happened. It has created a number of distortions it created a false market. Football Queensland's special in any particular way. Others would that disagrees rather than me. Football delivers public benefits, including ensuring teamwear, apparel and equipment, the promotion brand and the generation of income for Football Football Queensland; that no-one argues. But ACCC agrees that it does not meet its objectives. The reason it has taken so long-it has give Football Queensland time to respond. exemption from prosecution, the idea was that been granted an exemption, come back explanation and evidence based on what Football Queensland did not do that and to date has still to revoke that special exemption. When I first spoke about this in parliament-and speak about this, either, or the first person say that I was disappointed. I am disappointed have any evidence of this-why numbers have on that. In the end, we all agree that we want to to make it affordable for families and that, ACCC, it meets the objectives. The whole point by the ACCC and only five submissions were supported the program, as you would expect two from associated clubs who did not like the levy the players directly and it would be cheaper that that would be the case. The board there was a general satisfaction with existing than satisfaction there was perhaps disinterest counted. Again, I do not have evidence of that say that it is because of one thing unless you to say why that is the case. is that the ACCC has now given a draft exemption to revoke that exemption. There is subject of a couple of years of review by the has failed on the counts that it is meant third line forcing conduct, actually distorted expensive. It actually did not improve quality on its claim that it would ensure quality by it. Rather it said that it was the end user who through to Football Queensland. That has not in the way that the licensing takes place. And view is that the market is not unique or disagree. But most importantly it is the ACCC Queensland submits that the teamwear program a minimum standard of quality, timely supply of of the game image, the promotion of the FQ Queensland. It certainly generates income for on all the other counts it actually fails. The taken two years-is because the ACCC did rightly When Football Queensland was granted a special it would, like any other organisation having with a follow-through on that exemption-an Queensland had said it would do. Football not done that. There is now a process in place I am not the first member of parliament to from the community to have a view on this-I did because I think that Football Queensland, like NA any other peak body, has a special responsibility, a special responsibility not to me, but to the sensitive and we have to do everything we minimum standards and all the rest of it. If you is all; just do it. Do what you are claiming to and now it is up to Football Queensland to prove be revoked because right now that is what revoke their special exemption from prosecution program they are not meeting any of their I think there is an opportunity here because people, and a good board. I think it is just order, getting their ducks in a row, and getting two fronts. One is in addressing the ACCC revoked. I do not want that to happen unless the arbiter or the judge of these things. will understand the extent to which Football and failed the players.

That has been the case, to the ACCC that their exemption should not is happening. The ACCC has said it is going to because in the way they are operating this objectives. That is the concern for me. Football Queensland is made up of good a matter of them actually getting their house in on with the job of what they are meant to do on concerns so they do not have their exemption it is the best thing for the code.
