0,NA,Unknown,"regulation was issued by the Governor General. We know that all regulations are framed by Ministers, but there has been an effort to pass on to the Governor General the responsibility for some of them. ' Mr 'WATT-Nonsense . The statutory position 'is that all regulations are issued by the Governor General in .Council.",22
1,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"But the Government frame those regulations. Mr 'WATT - sEver y regulation is signed by the - responsible Minister, aud is issued by the Governor General in Council. ' Mr JH CATTS - The Prime Minister has gone about the country .referring to regulations as ""being issued by the Governor General with the object of leading the public to believe that .Ministers themselves are not responsible .for their issue, but that some higher authority controls them. In the same - way the Government very astutely",22
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On a point of order, Mr. - Speaker, I desire to ask whether it is permissible for the honourable member, in making a personal explanation, to debate a matter in the way he is now doing.",22
3,Mr SPEAKJEE,Unknown,"The honourable member was merely giving an illustration insupport of the position taken up by ""him. I understood him to be referring only to what he considered to be an analogous case. 'Had he gone beyond - that I should have called him to order. Mr J. ""H. CATTS - The Government have chosen a roundabout means of controlling the records of Parliament; but the fact remains that the Government do, in - this way, control them. An incident has already occurred in regard to some soldiers' grievances ventilated in the ""House. At 'the instance of the Government, certain honourable members agreed to alterations of the Hansard record of the speeches, so that those records, as - they lie on the table today, do not accurately set out what took place in the 'House.",22
4,Mr WATT,Unknown,"On a point of order, Sir, may I , with very great respect to you, express the view that the remarks made by the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) convey a very thinly veiled insult to the occupant of the Chair. Whether he intended it or not, the impression - which his statement left upon the minds of honourable members was that the Government were improperly using. Mr. Speaker as a tool for the censoring of .Hansard. On behalf of the Government, and the office you, sir, hold, I have a .right to indignantly resent that suggestion.",22
5,Mr SEEAKEE,Unknown,"I desire again to point out that .my object in drawing .the attention of the House to the statement made .by the honourable member (. Mr J. ,H. Catts) - was that it should not go before the public without a correction being made, since it .w.as entirely misleading; but misleading, I - believed, because of a misunderstanding on the part of the honourable member who - made it. Later.: Mr - SEEAKEE - I am sorry to have to interpose in order to revert to a matter referred to early this .afternoon. In - the course of an explanation the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) made a further statement implying that the Government, in connivance with some .honourable - members of the House, had-improperly , I understood him to suggest-manipulate d Hansard so that it was not a correct-report of the proceedings. I could not think for a moment to what the honourable - member ""Was referring, but it has since occurred to me that possibly he was speaking of a matter in which the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) was concerned. I remind the House that whatever action was taken on that occasion was authorized by the expressed concurrence of the House, as embodied in the following resolution, and not by Ministers alone in. conjunction with certain - honourable members:That the House accords permission to honourable members .who spoke on the motion for 'the adjournment of the 'House yesterday to censor the Hansard report of ""their .own speeches.",22
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"That resolution was -.carried unanimously. Mr .SPEAKER - That authority was given directly by the .House, but, I understand, .was not acted upon. Later:",22
7,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I desire - to make a personal explanation. I based - my statement upon information supplied to me by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH). I understood him to say that, as Ministers expressed the desire that members should censor their own speeches, he had censored his. I believe that some effort is to be made to endeavour to find the Hansard proof.",22
8,Mr WATT,Unknown,"That has nothing to do with the question. The honourable member said that the Government did it, whereas the House gave honourable members the right to do it individually in a particular instance.",23
9,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If I'remember the words I used-it is difficult to do so with all the exchanges across the Chamber- I said, "" At the instance of Ministers.""",23
10,Mr WATT,Unknown,The honourable member for Ballarat will not confirm that statement,23
11,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,At any rate that was the information. I gathered from the newspapers and from inquiries I made. I was not in the House at the time.,23
12,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I was not in the (hamber when this incident arose today. Honourable members may recollect that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) and I decided that it should be a personal responsibility upon us to censor our own speeches. We conferred together, and the House agreed to a motion permitting us to censor our speeches, but I think that the reports were not censored, because we found that the Age had published what was virtually a full report of what had been said. I 'have asked for a copy of the proof report, so that I may see exactly what was done. SUPPLIES OF COAL.",23
13,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy say whether the 100,000 tons which he agreed to purchase in the northern coal district of New South Wales, in order to relieve distress, have been supplied; and if not, what quantity has been supplied ?  that 150,000 tons of coal should be purchased in New South Wales; 50,000 tons from the southern collieries, and 100,000 tons from the northern collieries. Speak-, ing from memory, about 2,000 tons have been supplied so far from the southern collieries, and about 70,000 tons from the northern collieries. PAPERS.

14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Works and Railways whether it is cor-. rect that at the Flinders Naval Base an avenue of pines, nearly 8 miles long, has been planted, but that the work has been rendered useless by the growth of the. surrounding scrub, which is now higher than the trees? Is it correct also that many tools and other plantwhich were in good condition have been destroyed by fire, and that water is being carted from Mordialloc to Crib Point, a distance of about 25 miles, although there is plenty of roof catchment, and tanks are on the spot, though they have not been put into their places?",23
15,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Probably the honourable member's question is based on statements that have been published, and in. regard to which I have called for a report. It would be better before publishing allegations of this nature, to make inquiry of the Department, so that inaccurate information might not be disseminated. 3 SALE OF TIN"". ELDER SMITH AND COMPANY.",23
16,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Is it a fact that Messrs. Elder Smith, and Company have been appointed by the Government to be the sole purchasers of tin in Australia, and that recently they have declined to purchase tin?",24
17,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Government has had nothing to do with the appointment of Messrs. Elder Smith and Company as purchasers of tin. The Allied Tin Executive, recently formed in Britain and France, appointed the firm as its agent, but I have no information as to what it is doing. RETURNED SOLDIERS. VOCATIONAL TRAINING. .",24
18,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation if he is aware that, at the School of Mines, at Ballarat, there are instructors for training soldiers in fitting, but, although weeks have passed, no tools have been supplied, so that the men are wasting their time. Is he also aware that typewriters were sent some weeks ago, and rooms engaged, so that men might have commercial instruction, but that instructors have not yet been sent, and, consequently, the men are walking about the streets doing nothing?",24
19,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If the honourable member will give me a statement in_writing, I shall send it on to the Minister for patriation this afternoon. Otherwise, I shall direct the attention of the Minister to the matter as soon as I get my Hansard proof tomorrow. REDUCTION OF FREIGHTS.",24
20,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Can the Minister acting for the Minister for the Navy give the House any information respecting the negotiations for the reduction of freights on cargo between England and Australia ?  from Mr Larkin, our general manager, the freight on wheat has been reduced by 30s. per ton, and there has been a general reduction of 25 per cent, on freight from the Old Country. The Overseas Shipping Committee, and the Australian Shipping Committee are further considering the subject of freight charges generally. I shall be able to give further information later. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. HOLIDAYS.",24
21,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The Acting Prime Minister has stated publicly, and has also informed me privately, that until the Public Service Act is amended in regard - to the observance of certain holidays, its existing provisions must be honoured. As considerable perturbation exists in the General Post Office, Brisbane, owing to the fact that tomorrow is a declared public holiday throughout the State, will the Postmaster-General arrange that the employees in the Post Office, Brisbane, shall receive consideration in connection with that holiday?",24
22,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The existing law is being carried out, and under that law a holiday foT tomorrow cannot be granted. Differentiation cannot be allowed between employees in Queensland and those in other States.",24
23,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have received a lettergram from the postal electricians in Brisbane requesting me to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it will not be possible for them to join with the other inhabitants of Queensland tomorrow in Re- the general celebration of the signing of the armistice. I make that appeal to the Acting Prime Minister in the same way as I previously appealed to him in regard to the holiday on Melbourne Show Day. On that occasion, although it-had been decided that the postal officials should return to work, the Acting Prime Minister said that he was willing that the previous arrangement for ""the observance of the holiday should stand. I ask him now whether it will serve any useful purpose to force the Brisbane employees to go back to work tomorrow when all the other inhabitants will be enjoying a holiday?",24
24,Mr WATT,Unknown,"To the answer already given by the Postmaster-General I oan only .add that the :arrangements for holidays 'between :the States .and ""the 'Commonwealth are very unsatisfactory. .Different days are observed :in various parts of the Commonwealth, and - some 'months ago. Cabinet, after consultation with :the Public Service Commissioner, determined to make ihe 'holidays uniform throughout the Commonwealth .by S'tatiite. That decision was communicated to the Public Service Commissioner, who naturally began to operate it ; but when a question - was raised in regard to the holiday for Melbourne Show Day, I saw that an anomaly might be created if Cabinet dispensed with the existing law. I accordingly ruled, 'for the guidance of the Departments that, until the law was changed by Statute, the existing conditions must be observed. That decision gave the men a holiday ih Melbourne on 'Show Day, but the operation of the same law will deprive the employees in' Brisbane of a holiday tomorrow. Mr.''T.unoK - Why ? 'The Queensland Government have 'declared a .public holiday ""tomorrow. I i r . WATT - iTo-morrow.is not a i o l i ""day - usually observed. Melbourne - Show Day was such a 'holiday.",24

27,Mr STORY,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"In view - of the great and increasing .congestion .at .the .Norwood Post-office on .the days on which pensions are paid, will the Postmaster General,give early consideration to a sug.gestian I made on .a previous .occasion, to set aside .a certain day eaoh .fortnight for .the payment of old-rage .and invalid pensions, and .another .day .for the payment of war pensions.?",25
28,Mr WEBSTER,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"Soon after - the honourable member mentioned this matter previously, .shelter .accommodation for the pensioners was provided at Norwood. His other .suggestion in .regard to the setting aside of certain days for the payment - of different classes of pensions has .not yet been adopted, but I shall take - immediate steps to see if leffeGt can the given to it. r WAR PENSIONS.",25
29,Dr MALONEY,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"In view of the'fact that mothers of deceased ^soldiers :can.obtain war pensions - only on two conditions, namely-(1 ) that of dependence on the late son during the twelve months prior.'to enlistment-; and (.2) being .without - adequate means of support, - will the Treasurer request the Cabinet to consider the payment of pensions on the basis of the ""age of a soldier at the time of his death? Mr Watt,- I should not like to give an affirmative answer to that question; the suggestion may involve a considerable change; but I - desire to /intimate to - the House .generally that 'the pensions are :to - be transferred, - as is .generally desired iby the Legislature, to .the .Repatriation Department.",25
30,Mr HIGGS,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"No , no,; Parliament was not unanimous on that point.",25

34,Mr BRUCE,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I ask the .Assistant Minister for Defence whether any - consideration has been given by the Defence Department, or any arrangements made, by which men whose claims to be re- turned .to Australia on account of hardship - were not strong enough to be successful prior to the sighing of the .armistice, shall - receive preferential treatment in connection with the ordinary repatfiaition .of:soldiers-? Mir. WISE - I shall submit the question - to 'the Minister for ""Defence, - and furnish the honourable member with a Treply .tomorrow. CAPITAL REGULATIONS--. Mr Fenton' - Does the embargo still exist, in regard to investments in AUS.T tralia.? Is it still the rule that any person or persons' desirous of investing money in businesses or industries must submit their proposals to the strict scrutiny of an officer of the Treasury ? If so, will the Government remove the embargo now that the war.is practically over?",25
35,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"The Capital' Regulations still exist, and I think will require to exist so long as we are raising heavy loans for war and repatriation purposes. LAND SETTLEMENT OF SOLDIERS-: Mr Rodgers. - Has the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation yet' received a definite answer to a question I have twice asked, as to whether arrangements have teen made with, the Victorian Government to place soldier owners or lessees on private land, in the same position as soldiers taking up land under the Crown ? The whole of private land settlement is at a standstill until we can secure the co-operation of the States in that direction.",26
36,Mr GROOM,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I . have not had: a. reply yet;- but I shall communicate further with the Minister, and endeavour to expedite the matter. SALE OF AUSTRALIAN COPPER:",26
37,Mr BIGGS,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt-) will remember that, on 1st November last, I put to him. a. ques* tion regarding the sale of Australian copper. He then said he had no further cable news-about the matter, but that, in effect, the position was. that the British Government declined to purchase Aus^ tralian copper after 31st December next. Further, he stated that the Government would have arrangements made for the financing of the unsold products of our copper mines for, at least, the first three months of the new year, or, in other words, until the end of March next. I desire to. ask the honourable gentleman, since there is some doubt on the point, what he meant by his statement in regard to financing the unsold products of our copper mines? Will he state what price is to be paid per ton by the Government, and what information, if any, he has. received bycablegram, since 1st. instant, in regard to the copper position?",26
38,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"In . order to afford the honourable member the information he de-: sires,. I . shall have"" to go back a little further than the 1st November, on which date he addressed his question to me; With the expiration of the copper contract on 30th June last, there followed several months of grave uncertainty in the copper world. Although the war was still going on, there was no assurance of any kind that the British authorities would feel disposed to renew Or extend the contract. Eventually the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) wasable, as I said yesterday, to induce, 1 think, the Munitions Department to extend the contract to the 31st December of this year. During those three or four months of uncertainty, we were obliged to calltogether the largercopper producers, and to explain to them how serious would be the position if the small as well as the large copper mines were closed down. The metallurgical' adviser to the Government (Sir John Higgins) was-then able to induce the principal copper-producers to finance thesmaller producers, through that, period of trouble. When it seemed likely that we would not be;able to renew the contract over 1919, and knowing, as we did, that by the end ofi October the ; mines would begin to feel the pressure caused by uncertainty, as to whether we would be able to make a new contract, I asked Sir John Higgins to make a similar - arrangement to that: made during this year. He assuresme that he has been able to do so. I have not entered'into the exact details; because neither the Commonwealth Bank, nor the Commonwealth Treasury 'are parties to the transaction. It is a mutual, cooperative arrangement for temporarily financing the large and small producers alike.",26
39,Mr HIGGS,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,As between the larger companies ?,26
40,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"And the smaller com. panies. The larger companies have meanr of assisting the smaller one3. The arrangement was then, and is no doubt now, on the basis of a payment of 80 per cent, on the copper contract prices. If my honourable friend desires further information as to how the arrangement is operat- ing, I shall be able to obtain it for hi m by the end of this week. MANUFACTURE OF WOOLLENS . able",26
41,Mr LISTER,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"In view of the necessity for the further encouragement of our primary and secondary industries, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether the Government will consider the advisableness of asking the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) at an early date to"" enter into negotiations with a view to purchasing from manufacturers in Great B ritain the machinery necessary to duplicate our existing plants for the manufacture of woollen cloth?",27
42,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,I have had no request of the kind from the manufacturers of woollen cloth. If such a request be made by them it will be considered on its merits. SOLDIERS' INSURANCEAND,27
43,Dr MALONEY,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"Will the Acting 200 Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) despatch cablegram to the Government of the ache United States of America, asking for all particulars in regard to its schemes for doubtful butter. . the insurance of soldiers, pensions for. how, soldiers and' their dependants, and any i formation it can supply in repatriation proposals ?",27
44,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"The honourable member, I think, asked me a somewhat similar question earlier in the year. I then plied that through the agency of the Victorian State Insurance Office we had been able to obtain all the information we thought necessary.",27
45,Dr MALONEY,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,That related to the question of insurance.,27
46,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,I shall ascertain whether make inquiries. any further provision in reference to repatriation has since been made. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. PREFERENCE TO RETURNED SOLDIERS.,27

48,Mr WEBSTER,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I have hot seen the statement referred to, but if the honormember will submit it to me it shall have consideration. QUARANTINE STATION, SYDNEY. TREATMENT OF SOLDIERS.",27
49,Mr FINLAYSON,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I desire to ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) a question that seems to be urgent, in regard to the treatment of returned soldiers at the Quarantine Station in Sydney. A letter came into my hand today, dated the 24th of this month, written by a private soldier, and I should like to read the following extract : - - . Well, fancy us landed back in Australia again, and in such style. Things are serious, though, here on North Head, and a good many chaps are pretty crook. Personally, I spend most of my time working my nut to get something to eat. . . . PENSIONIS . We had an awful time on the Medic. Nearly patients were lying on the dirty troop deck, or in hammocks, while the old boat was rolling a so much that the movement made one's head worse, while all we had for meals was dry stale bitter bread, out thick, with a scraping of - . We have a good army of about thirty sisters and they are doing their best to make our n - lives happy, but they find it hard to make regard to its bread out of stones. I think the Minister will agree that this matter requires looking into, and I ask him to take immediate steps to see that rethis state of affairs is remedied.",27
50,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I shall have immediate inquiries made into the allegations contained in the letter, so far as they affect the quarantine authorities. If the only Defence Department is also concerned, I shall ask the authorities there to also IMPERIAL CONTRACTS. UNSOLD COMMODITIES.",27
51,Mr KELLY,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) a question relating to the position the Commonwealth has patriotically assumed in the past of offering to our Allies certain of our products under the world's price, perhaps in return for their purchasing other products like wheat which the A l lies could not use. In view of the bility of the Allies at present to take certain products, will the Acting Prime Minister reconsider the equity or otherwise of Australia selling under the world's price those commodities which the rest of the world wants?",27
52,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"The honourable member addresses his question in general terms, and I presume he refers to all kinds of products, including foodstuffs. In regard to certain lines, negotiations have been proceeding, and I do not think we are entitled to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to direct them elsewhere. In reference to certain other lines, the negotiations have not yet failed, but we have not got much satisfaction. As I indicated a moment ago in regard to copper, if it be plain that the British authorities do not wish to give us an extended contract, I think it will be our duty to see if we cannot sell to Allied peoples, so as to keep our industries going. In some cases we are about reaching that decision, but other cases, I think, will have to wait for some weeks. META L MARKET.",28
53,Mr BLAKELEY,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"Will the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) cable to the Prime Minister, asking for a confirmation, or otherwise, of the cabled announcement that certain metals, copper amongst them, will be free in the Allied markets? If that information is available, will the honourable gentleman allow the companies to make the necessary arrangements for their products?",28
54,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I could not make a promise of that kind without considering the effects. 1I have noted what has been said in the press, but I have no official confirmation. If I do"" not get that official confirmation I shall wire for it very shortly. SALE OF TIN .",28
55,Mr GREGORY,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"Yesterday the fact was brought under my notice that a number of tin mines have been closed down, and people thrown out of employment, owing to the impossibility of disposing of the product. Will the Acting Prime Minina- ister (Mr Watt) make inquiries as to whether it is a fact that Messrs. Elder, Smith, and Company, who are the sole purchasers of tin in Australia, are not making purchases at the present time?",28
56,Mr WATT,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"I think this matter was dealt with in a previous question, though in a somewhat different form. I have heard rumours to the effect stated by the honourable member, and I have already given instructions to ascertain the facts; beyond this, I cannot speak. PEACE CELEBRATIONS. POSTAL HOLIDAY IN QUEENSLAND.",28
57,Mr FINLAYSON,CONVENIENCES TOR PAYIN G,"'Saturda y is proclaimed a public holiday in Queensland to celebrate the conclusion of the war.

Assent to the following Bills reto establish it . ported :- r Control of Naval Waters Bill. Service and Execution of Process Bill. IRON AND STEEL BOUNTY BILL. SECOND READING.",32
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW," I move That this Bill be now read a second time. When moving in Committee of Ways and. Means for an appropriation for the poses of the Bill , I had not at hand information necessary to put the prowish posals of the Government full y and rately before honourable members, and this afternoon I desire to briefly inform House what those proposals are, and what are our reasons for making them. This is not the first time that a bounty has been given for the encouragement of the galvanized and black sheet industry. In 1908 the Manufacturers' Encouragement Act provided for a bounty of 10 per cent, on the value of galvanized iron, or plate iron, or steel, whether corrugated or not, made from Australian ore. The operato tion of the bounty was extended by the at Manufacturers' Encouragement Act of 1912, and thus made operative for a years, from 1st January, 1909, to the 30th June, 1914. The South bounty, however, had not the desired result. The amount of the bounty paid Zeai n 1908-9 was £ 1 9 2 ; in 1909-10, £2S7; these and in 1910-11, £118. Since then nothing has been paid.",32
86,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Accordin g to Mr Knibbs, the payments for the years mentioned were £ i 9 2 , £287, and £121, and in 1911-12 £74 was paid. Mr Knibbs' statistics (b.) make the total payments £77 more than is shown by the Minister. This difference, however, is immaterial.",32
87,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"'The difference, is i m material; but I think that the informa(b) tion supplied by the Customs officials is the more likely to be right. Obviously, the bounty had not the effect of foster-ing the industry. This need not discourage us from making another attempt Messrs. Hoskins, to whom the bounty was paid, were experimenting with a small and somewhat in ferior plant;'certainly, it was not a plant constructed on modern lines, and did not give them any chance of competing under the then conditions of the world's market. I hope that the bounty now proposed will have the effect of establishing firmly a [3.22]. most important industry.",32

96,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"No , but it does proAltogether, vide for a bounty on black sheets, which we are the basis of the tin-plate industry.

100,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The Bill ' provides: that, the sheet shall be less than one-sixteenth, of an inch.

I in timated the other day that the Governhave ment had been more particularly moved to deal, - with the industry by the reprehonsentations made to them by a large firm other which hitherto has imported nearly all of galvanize'di iron.

A subcommittee of the Board, over - which I had the honour to preside, - was appointed to investigate the matter, and after several interviews with Messrs. Lysaght and Company we came to an/Understanding, upon which the Bill is based. It provides for a total protection of £ 5 -10s. per ton on the English'price. In the first instance, Messrs. Lysaght and Companv asked for considerably more protection than that, but, as a result of the . negotiations, they eventually agreed to the proposal embodied in the Bill . Taking it - a ll round, I believe that . it affords adequate protection, and gives the manufacturer all the encouragement he requires.",33

105,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Bounty , duty, and freight make a total ""protection against the United Kingdom of £ 5 10s. per ton. The bounty is payable conditionally upon certain freights being charged, and, - taking all the factors into consideration, the Board of Trade regarded the total By adding .that protection proposed as being £ 5 10s. per ton against the United .Kingdom.",34
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"- What percentage duty would that mean? o Mr . GREENE - Assumin g that the f.o.b. price after the war is £ 2 0 per ton, it would be roughly 27 per cent, or 28 per cent.",34
107,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"But will it be £ 2 0 per ton after the war? . Mr MASSYGREENE - It is difficult to say what the price will be. the landed cost in Australia was where in the vicinity of from £ 1 8 to £ 2 0 material. per ton. The market varied from time to time. The impression we have formed is that, having regard to the very sharp rise i wages which has taken place in manuspect facturing centres in Europe, - America, an.I elsewhere during the war, it is not that clause fo pay it . at all likely that wages there will drop any great extent in the near future. belief is that the wages and industrial conditions of other European, countries will more closely approximate to our own in the future than has hitherto been the case.",35
108,Mr WEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,We hope so.,35
109,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The industrial condisay tions of our workers, taking them all i all, are perhaps amongst the best in world, and. we can only hope that the same conditions will obtain elsewhere. feel that it is not at all likely-an view is shared by a large number of gentlemen with whom I have been i contact of late-that many of the comtheir modities that we imported at particularly cheap rates prior to the war will f a l their old level for many a long day. i indeed, they ever do. means an additional protection. I said that our view is too optimistic my reply is that it is shared, by the men who propose to engage in this industry. Messrs. Lysaght tell us that they are prebe pared at once to lay down at Newcastle portation of blooms. a plant capable of turning out 20,00u tons a year. Although that will sufficient to supply Australia's requiremonopoly. ments, it will at least be a good beginning. If it proves successful, as it will, it will lead to the establishment of other works of a similar kind in near' future. Let me turn for a moment or two the actual provisions of the Bill able members will have noticed that this Bill we have incorporated the principle found in practically every other measure* providing for the payment of a bounty that the bounty shall be payable in the first place only on galvanized iron and black sheets produced from Australian iron and steel.",35
110,Mr WEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Clause 3 gives power to Before the war pay the bounty on galvanized iron and someblack sheets produced from imported,35
111,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Shoul d circumstances arise which lead the Minister administering the Act to believe that it is desirable n that the bounty should be given in reof material manufactured from i mported blooms, he will have power under The clause was to inserted with a definite object in view. Our The Government recognise that there are not many manufacturers of iron and steel blooms in Australia.",35
112,Mr WEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,There are only two.,35
113,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Quite so, and it is possible that there may be three' manufacturers of galvanized iron. I do not that any of the firms at present enn gaged in the production of iron and steel the here will attempt anything of the kind, but some firms engaged in the industry I might set to work to ' ' squeeze'' the d this manufacturers of galvanized iron.",35
114,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Mr Hoskins and the n Broken Hill Company are producing own blooms. Does this clause mean that the Minister might allow the t h i r d l to manufacturer to import his blooms and t , to get the same amount of bounty in reThat in itself spect of galvanized iron and black sheet f it be produced from those blooms?",35
115,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The Minister administering the Act would have to be satisfied first of all that the industry could not carried on successfully without the i m,35
116,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The Government not be want this power in order to check,35
117,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"That is the only, rea1 hope son for the clause. I think it is a safe provision to make, and one which the M in the ister for Trade and Customs, whoever he may be, can be trusted to administer in to the interests of the Commonwealth. The . Honormanufacturers, whoever they may be, in should be given this protection.",35
118,Dr MALONEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Does the honourable gentleman speak of the manufacturer aa distinct from the ironmaster?,36
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Yes . We have not only tried to protect the manufacturer of galvanized iron and black sheets by providing in this way for the payment of bounty; but, in order to protect the public, we have introduced a principle that is entirely new to-this class of legislation. We have inserted a clause setting for th that no bounty shall be paid to any manufacturer who is making more than 15 per cent, on his enterprise. It the in dustry is paying so well that a manufacturer can make 15 per cent, on his enterprise, no bounty, in our opinion, should be paid.",36
120,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Would not cent, be sufficient ?'",36
121,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I think not. Any o n e establishing a perfectly new industry has to take very considerable risks.,36
122,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"But the firms who propose to manufacture galvanized iron and black slieets have other branches of in dustry, so that they might profess to make a failure in respect of this industry and boom up their profits in respect of their other branches.",36
123,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The Bill provides that the whole of the books and accounts of any firm claiming this bounty shall be open to the inspection of the Government auditors. The honourable gentleman (Mr . Tudor) knows that commercial firms deal separately in their books and accounts with every branchof industry in which they engage. Costing sheets are made out, and they can tell exactly what profit every branch of their business is yielding. The particular firmthat is going to establish these works on a large scale- I refer to Messrs. Lysaght-hav e nothing whatever to do with the Broken Hill Company, from which they will obtain their raw material, the steel blooms. The business will stand by itself, and presumably the books and accounts kept by Messrs. Lysaght will show the whole of their operations. It will be open for the Government at any time to ascertain exactly what their profits are on this class of manufacture. The Government feel that a liberal rate of profit should be permitted so as to afford the necessary encouragement; but if these manufacturers charge for their finished products prices which enable them to earn more than 15 per cent, it will not be fair for them to ask for the bounty.",36
124,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I agree with the principle, although I think the Government have made the rate of profit too high'.",36
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Our object is to protect the public in two ways. In the first place, if the charges to the public are equitable and the business of the manufacturer is so prosperous that he can earn 15 per cent, on his enterprise, be does not want the bounty. On the other hand, if he is not doing too well and raises his charges against the public to 10 per too great an extent, with the result that he makes more than 15 per cent., he will not receive any bounty. I do not know that I need refer at any length to the other provisions of the Bill . It will have been noticed that the employees in the industry are full y protected under clause 10, which embodies a salutary principle that has been included in most of our Bounty Acts. I desire now only to refer to the schedule where we have laid .down the principle that the bounty shall be paid only in the event of freights falling below £ 4 10s. The view of the Board of Trade in making this recommendation, and of the Government in adopting it , was that whilst freights remained high there was no necessity to pay the bounty.",36
126,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,For every shilling below £ 4 10s. by which freights fal l a proportionate amountof bounty will be paid to the manufacturers?,36
127,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Yes , the manufacturers will receive a corresponding amount of bounty until they get down to £ 2 10s. We have provided that the Board ot Trade in London shall be the determining authority in regard to the question of freights and shall intimate to the Government, quarter by quarter, - what the rate of freight from the United Kingdom is. The rate of freight mentioned in the schedule is the United Kingdom freight. That is the basis we have adopted. The Board of Trade in London will advise us what the normal freight is. An odd shipment might come out at a lower freight, but that is a contingency that we cannot avoid. .",36
128,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Is this to include insurance as well ?',37
129,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"No , it relates only to freight. We thought it only fair in the circumstances to give the manufacturers the benefit of insurance and commission charges. Speaking generally,. I think the Bill is safeguarded in every possible way. makes adequate provision for the establishment of the industry, and the Government have the satisfaction of knowing that when the Bill becomes law at least one large firm, which hitherto has carried on ijts operations in another part of 'the world, and has imported its manufactured product into this country, will establish large works in our midst and start at 'once to manufacture the ^finished article from Australian raw .material.

'He - advised me, however, that 'he - and his colleague, the Acting Attorney General (Mr . Groom) were very anxious to proceed at once with the debate. To ..that I have-no 'objection. I do mot mind continuing the debate, but it - m ay be that some'honourable members who have not looked - into this question for' themselves are placed in a difficult position. 1I have, 'perhaps, one advantage in that I was here at the commencement of the Commonwealth Parliament, when the first proposal was made 'to establish this industry. 'On looking round the chamber, I can - see only one OT ""two other honourable members who are - similarly circumstanced. When the late ' Mr Kingston, in 1902, proposed to bring in a Bill for a bounty on pig iron, Mr . Chris. Watson, the then Leader of the Xabour party, moved, and carried, a proposal that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. Committee .the only members remaining in the Parliament are the present .Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), the present Attorney-General (Mr Groom), and the honourable member, for Newcastle (Mr Watkins). That Committee brought .in a report-recommending that ""the States - should do this work, and that the bounty be paid only to a State institution; but nothingfurther was done in the matter until 1908, when, at the instance of the late Sir Will i am Lyne, the Manufactures Encouragement Act ""was passed. That Act provided a total . amount of £150,000 It to provide a bounty of -12s. per ""ton on pig iron made from Australian ore, 12s. per ton on.puddled bar iron made from Australia n pig iron, and 12s. per ton on steel made from Australian p i g iron. It will be seen that under that Act it was possible for a man to receive bounty-'up to 36s. on the same ton of steel in the three forms of pig iron, puddled bar iron, and steel. I regard the Bill before us as a much better measure than that to which T now refer. ""The Bill of 1908 .was - I asked' amended in 1912, when I was the MinisT ter in'charge, and some of the'provisions were altered;'the amount - of Tt2s. Was-re-duced to 5s., and provision was-made for the transfer, if required by the ""State, - of - any land and 'buildings, & c , required 'for the manufacture. First class 'pig iron : and galvanized iron, plain or corrugateo', r made from Australian ore/were placed-on 1 -.a percentage basis of 10-per-cent, on the - value, so' that the higher-rthe manufao-turer kept the value the moire 'bounty he - obtained.

130,Mr MCWILEIAMS,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"What was the bounty on pig iron? "" Mr TUDOR - The whole of the particulars are set out in the Official Yearbook, No. 10, on pages 432 arid 433. The whole of the £150,000, which, by the Act, was devoted to the ""bounty, was paid ..out between 1908 and .1915. The bountypaia on pig i r o n made from .Australian ore for Of that ,the half-year ending 30th June, 1909, - was ^£2,314.; for 1909-10 it was £23,510; for 1910-11 it was.£20,462; for 1911-12' itvwas £15611; for 1912-13 it - was.£16,949; for 5 19.13-14 it was £40,121; and for. 1914-15. £31,S13. Of course, since then there has heen the advantage in the freight.. This bounty has, in my opinion, more than justified the expenditure. H a d the galvanized-iron industry been, in existence on- .a similar basis, we should probably have saved, in the decreased price, four j or five times the amount of the bounty.",37
131,Mr GREEIFE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"We should liave saved £1,000,000. Mr TUDOR, - Probably - more. ' If Honourable members will'look up the statis tics which are provided by the Customs-: Department, and compare the price of pig iron and steel rails four o r five years ago with the price tOHLay; theyw ill see that the increase is nothing, when, we have regard'to the increase in the price of galvanized iron. The freight on one should not be cheaperthanthe freight on the other, though it may; perhaps, be cheaper onpig; iron, because' it is more easily handled. Mr M ' CWILTIAMS - It is cheaper steel rails, which are largely used as ballast.",38
132,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Not much cheaper; I think galvanized iron came out at much about the same rate as steel rails before the war. In 1916 the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) stated that he had. agreed with the British Government to send over 12;000 tons of steel rails. known that the completion of the Eastfigures West railway was hung up because we were sending rails overseas. At least, institution has been brought into existence by the bounty, and it may have helped the Broken Hill Proprietary, though do not'know that that company has drawn any money: I remember, that, the honorto able memberforMelbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) complained that engineers were being thrown out of wonc in Australia owiiig to the fact that these rails were beingsent overseas, and, certainly, least 10,000 tons were so sent; There is no doubt that the freight' has been a better protection,.and given greater assistance than any bounty.

135,Mr MAXWELL,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"What effect had the bounties on the different, industries ?",38
136,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Mr Knibbs, in his little compendium, informs ust h at in a number of cases bounty, was. collected. On flax and hemp £ 7 7 was paid in one year, and £634 was paid in another. The It is well only products that ran into four and five were combed wool tops and pig iron. Other products received bounty in one small sums of £ 2 , £ 3 , and £22,- while dried fruits in one-* year was assisted, to the extent of £7,063. I believe entirely I in the bounty principle; but, im my opinion , it is better to offer a. good bounty 1 an industry that is-likely to be-success: f u l than to spread the amount, over a whole number of-industries, the prospects of which are not so. good. Speaking! the other night on. the message; I said that at we ought to deal with abounty more exactly as we.; deal, with the Tariff-that it; is preferable to select articles for which we have the raw material in Australia. peoFor the iron industry we have the limestone, the coal, and: the iron ore.; and. I Tegard thisB ill as: a step in the As the Minister stated, we imported during 1913-when ; we operated on the calendar yeaiv-3,313,000 cwt. of corrugated galvanized iron, galvanized iron, and plain sheets, or practically 1,000,000 cwt. of each, of the value of £ l 4 2 5 , 0 0 0 . Roughly that would be about 50,000 tons of galvanized and corrugated iron, 50,000 tons of galvanized iron, and 50,000 tons of plain sheet'iron. There was a great fear among builders recently that, while they would be able to secure a certain quantity of galvanized iron, and could use tiles for roofing, there would be a scarcity of plain sheet iron for valleys and spouting. The Minister is only providing £100,000 in the way of bounty, but if we provide for only half the annual requirements of Australia, and the producers draw up to the full £ 2 per ton, the whole of the bounty will be drawn long before the time mentioned in the Bill . We all hope that this will be the case. We trust that we shall do the same as we have been doing in regard to steel rails and pig iron, and in regard to some of the industries to which our Tariff gives special protection. the war broke out 95 per cent, of the flannel and blankets used in .Australia were produced in the Commonwealth. I hope that' the same result will be achieved by the passage of this Bill , and that very soon Australia will be producing all the corrugated and galvanized iron and the plain sheet iron it requires. The Minister has directed special tention to clause 9, which provides it will be impossible to draw any bounty if the firm producing the article makes profit of 15 per cent. When ister has had more experience in the toms Department, he will know is the practice of some big firms to make it appear that the cost of the article imwould ported is lower than it really is. The orable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) will bear me out in this. If a firm of the tyres and body. is established in Great Britain and here, it will allow the Australian house to imI port the article manufactured in the tish house at cost price, so that it can pass through our Customs on a low ad and valorem basis, and so that the firm can make both the British profit and the we Australian profit. If a firm makes pig underpaid duty. iron and turns it into puddle bar iron, Mr Tudor. and subsequently into flat plates for galvanizing, and applies for a bounty on the plate or on the galvanized article- I am s glad to say that they cannot obtain it in both cases-w e have no guarantee, that it may not charge 6d. or 8d. a ton more for ge-tting the coal out of its own mine and turning it into coke, or for getting limestone out of its own quarry. It would take a clever accountant' to say that it was not doing so. A firm may make it appear that they are making 20 per cent, on the one operation, and only 10 per cent, on the other, whereas, as a matter of fact, they may be actually making 15' per cent, on either operation.",38
137,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"W h e r e would be the advantage in giving a bounty on pig iron and puddle to one firm, and a bounty on corrugated iron to another?",39
138,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The pig iron bounty has practically run out. Before 1914 it had dropped to 8s. per ton, and the producers were well satisfied. They drew £40,000 in 1913-14, and £31,813 in Before 1914-15. Of the latter amount, the sum of £19,808 was drawn, at the rate of 8s. per ton. However, I do not think that clause 9 will prove to be workable. I can say from my experience in the Customs Department that if a free article is combined with two dutiable articles, the value of the free article is increased, and that of the dutiable articles is decreased. The value of the chassis of a motor car atis roughly about three-fourths of ..the that total value of the car. On a motor car costing about £400 the value of the a chassis would be £300. I am talking of the Minpre-war times, when we had a little Custrouble with some gentlemen, a few of that it whom got into gaol. The value of the 0 tyres would be £ 4 0 , and that of the body be £ 6 0 . But , instead of valuing hon the chassis at £ 3 0 0 , these gentlemen fixed it at £ 3 5 0 , and halved the value Honourable members will recollect the trouble we had. t started while I was Minister; it conBritinued whilst the honourable member for Kooyong (Si r Robert Best) was Minister, I cleaned it up a little later, when I returned to the Department. I think that collected about £50,000 in the shape of There will be a tendency to follow the same practice under clause 9. At any rate, I do not think that the provision will tend to bring about honesty of manufacture. The producers will be able to show that they are not making money on the galvanized iron upon which they are drawing a bounty, but that they are making an excessive profit on the earlier stage of manufacture, that of producing pig iron and bar iron. Clause 3 allows the Minister to agree to the use of imported sheet bar steel for the manufacture of black steel sheets. This provision is included in the Bill in order to prevent firms in Australia from refusing to sell to other people, but I consider that the firm which lays itself out to manufacture the complete article is just as much entitled to protection as is the firm which is only laying itself out to finish the article. I hold no brief for the Broken Hill Company or for Hoskins Limited- I have said some hard things about them; but if either of these firms is fully employed on general work, and is turning out only 20,000 tonsof pig iron, just sufficient for the requirements of its own mills, is it right for us to say to it, "" must cease manufacturing piates for shipbuilding or steel rails; you must make so many blooms, and turn them into bars in order to supply the requirements of these other people "" ? ""We might just as well go lo a boot manufacturer and ask him to make 1,000 pairs of boots, but not to complete them, but .to allow some one else to finish them off. He would at once object, because it would mean that he would have to keep his own finishers standing idle. We might just as well ask a hat manufacturer to make 1,000 bodies, and allow another firm to block and trim them, and, in fact, finish off the hats.",39
139,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROTECTION FOR NEW,But these firms that could crush out rivals by refusing to supvanized steel. ply them.,40
140,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I admit that that could be done. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) claims that they are doing it today. But I am pointing that there is something to be other side. If a man who has his blast furnace turning out a certain quantity pig iron, and a mill turning out a certain quantity of blooms and bars, desires to continue the process, he will so arrange his plant in consecutive order that he will have the mill turning out pig iron, blooms, and bars, and, close at hand, the machines for rolling and galvanizing. Yet now we propose to tell him that he must have a furnace large enough to turn out more than he needs for his own requirements, and that he must depend upon another man buying from him.",40
141,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"We simply state that if he will not supply the other man, we will not allow him to crush the other out of the business.",40
142,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"If we permit bars to be imported, we shall defeat the object of the Bill, and, in the manufacture of galvanized iron, we shall not be making use of Australian limestone or Australian coal, but will be importing the article in a highly finished state. It is quite possible that clause 3 may defeat the object of the BillSome of the firms which are making pig iron and steel may be prepared to enter into an agreement with other people to supply their requirements. You I hope that such will be the case; but there are dangers in the clause. Many of us have seen houses where the galvanized roofing has practically rusted through, so that one can thrust his fingers through it as if it were tissue paper. This occurs in places close to the sea, or in localities where smelting works are situated. The chemicals employed .in the smelting operations have this effect, particularly at Queenstown. A letter appeared in this morning's newspapers from a practical man dealing with this subject, and I would like the Minister to make inquiries into the correctness of the statement the writer has made galvanized iron lasts longer than gal",40
143,Mr RILEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,That is so.,40
144,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The honourable member, as a builder, should know. If we can discriminate, we should give the bounty for the production of the better article. The out matter is one into which the Minister said on the should make an inquiry.",40
145,Mr RILEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Galvanize d steel' does not of last half so long as galvanized iron.,40
146,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I hope that the honor' able member and other prictical men will give the House the benefit of their knowledge on this subject, so that we may legislate on right lines. I am glad that a Bill to encourage the establishment of another industry which will use Australian raw material has been introduced, because when this industry is established we should be independent of supplies from overseas. Regarding plates for tinning, members who can add anything to our knowledge should do so. A bounty at some future time might make us independent of the supplies that we now get from South Wales; because we have in Australia t in as well as the other raw materials needed. Whether £200,000 is sufficient to do what we need, experience alone can show. I should have liked to see in the Bill a provision similar to that inserted in previous legislation, enabling a State to take over the works if it considered that desirable. Such a provision would have made the limitation of profit unnecessary. I trust that the Bill is a forerunner of others which will place Australian industries on a better footing in the future than they have been.on in the past.",40
147,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Indi ) [ 4 . 4 0 ] glad that the measure has been brought forward, because the industry which it seeks to establish is a big industry, and vitally necessary to Australia. Owing to the fact that we were not making t in plates, we had to pay during the war £1,500,000 extra for our supplies of this commodity, that is, not excluding galvanized iron. I am puzzled . to know why the Government pose a bounty for galvanized iron and for plain black sheets. The quant it y of black sheets used for ceilings and other purposes is not one-tenth of the quantity made into t in plates, and I would prefer a bounty on t in plates to the bounty on black sheets. If the t in ning of black sheets is not done in Australia, we may still be in as bad a position as we are in at present. The production of t in plates is especially needed in a country such as this, which exports great quantities of tinned provisions. Unless we can get a particular quality of t in plate cheaply, we cannot export ^ many of our productions, such as jam, f r u it , butter, and meat, in certain forms. Our trade in these lines has expanded greatly during the war. We have established a standard of quality that is generally appreciated, but unless we can obtain t in plates cheaply we cannot hold our foreign markets against competition. Before. the war a 2-lb. j am or f r u it container cost'to manufacture a little less than I d . , and costs now to manufacture between 2Jd. and 2 | d .",41
148,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I suppose that t in plate must be used for these containers.,41
149,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"F o r f r u it , certainly. A substitute for t in plate has been sought, but the Committee that investigated the matter recommended a substitute which actually costs more than t in plate. I was inclined to think that clause 3, which allows a manufacturer to use imported' steel for making galvanized steel and black sheets should he struck out of the Bill ; but the Minister's remarks have gone far to remove my objection to it , though I feel that the permission to import is one that must be given only with the greatest discretion. It would not do to establish an industry here which would, be wholly or largely dependent on - I am other countries for its supply of steel, because we should not then be in a much better position, should war break out again, than we are in at present. There are now, however, only one or two manufacturers of pig iron and steel in Australia, so that it may be necessary at first to give to"" the makers of steel sheets, black sheets, and galvanized iron the right to import raw material. But the proMinister must give permission for this only with very - great discretion. It must be our object to establish an industry that will be self-supporting in every particular, from the raw material to the finished product. The bounty, including freight, on galvanized iron, plain and corrugated, is equivalent to a protection of about £ 5 10s. per ton, according to the Minister. When asking the Committee to confirm the expediency of granting a sum for the purposes of the Bill , the honourable gentleman said that a certain firm had stated that if the protection amounted to £ 6 per ton, it would commence manufacturing without any bounty at all ; but today he has said that £ 5 10s. will be sufiicient protection. The manufacture of thin black sheets for tinning, or for such things as ceilings, will have a protection of only £ 4 . I do not know"" the reason for the difference. To my mind, the making of tin plates is of more importance to the primary industries of Australia than is the manufacture of galvanized iron, though I recognise the importance of the latter industry. I ask the Minister to make sure that the proposed bounty is sufficient. Should it not be, he should make arrangements for a bounty equal to that which is to be given for the manufacture of galvanized iron. Encouragement by bounties is preferable to protection by import duties, because the latter in the early stages increases prices to the local consumers. If the cost of t in plates were inci-eased by £ 5 10s. per ton, the cost of a 2-lb. jam container would be increased by about Jd!., and the increase of the jam to the consumer would be considerably greater. As to the provision that a bounty is not to be given to a firm that is making a profit of 15 per cent, on its capital, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has expressed' the fear that manufacturers may evade it by false bookkeeping. I have not so much fear of that, but I think that the clause may operate somewhat harshly. If the ister is willing to define capital as it is defined in the War-time Profits Act , namely, as money employed in the business, I have no objection to urge to the clause. Where a firm is not very highly capitalized, but is using a lot of borrowed money, a profit of 15 per cent. m a y not amount to much, although 15 s per cent, may be a big profit to a firm with a large capital. There are other matters on which I shall speak when the Bill gets into Committee. I congratulate the Government on having chosen this method to encourage the establishment in Australia of a big basic industry. If during the last four years we had had in Australia establishments manufacturing black steel sheets, the country would have been saved f u l ly £1,500,000, because we should have been able to export greater quantities of our primary products-notably , butter, jams, and fruits. Being able to sell at a much lower price than that which we were compelled to [315]2 quote, we could have increased our exports by probal-ly 100 per cent. I emphasize the fact that it is absolutely necessary to take steps to prevent us finding ourselves in the same position that we have been'in during the war. We must get supplies of t in plates for containers at as cheap a rate as. possible, because upon the price of those containers depends very largely the rate at which we can sell many of our primary products, and the profits which the producers get for their commodities ",41
150,Dr MALONEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Melbourne) [4.51] I am glad to , add my thanks to the Ministry for having introduced this Bill , and I was glad to listen to the speech of the Minister in introducing it . Iron is the mainstay of science in every country, second only in importance to coal and lime, but I suggest that we ought to include in a Bill of this character two other minerals, known as rare metals, namely, molybdenum and tungsten. In America molybdenum has proved to be more valuable than tungsten, but as the iron and steel masters of that country were more assured of supplies of tungsten, they placed molybdenum at a lower value. Consequently, in 1916., molybM in - denum was sold at as high a price as £1,792 per ton, and tungsten at £4,480 per ton. In Australia prices have been fixed by law, and molybdenite was sold to the Mother Country at £525 per ton. Tungsten, under the name of wolfram , was sold at as low a price as £210 per ton. The Government would be wise to look into the future. They can purchase molybdenum in its natural and unrefined state of molybdenite cheaper than it can be obtained in any other country in the world. This country produces more than half the world's total output of molybdenite. If either of these hardening metals were used as an. alloy in iron sheets or wire netting, the galvanizing process could be absolutely eliminated. At Queenstown, Tasmania, I saw galvanized iron sheets on the houses which, owing to the action of the fumes from the Mount Lyell mines, had a life of only five years; but if those sheets were alloyed with molybdenum or tungsten, or a combination of both, the acid in the fumes from the mines would have no effect upon them. I quote from the United States Bulletin 111, Mineral Technology 15, issued by the Department of the Interior, in which it is stated under the authority of Borcher, perhaps one of the greatest metallurgical chemists in the worldAn alloy of 2 per cent, of molybdenum with 10 per cent, of chromium and little or no carbon is absolutely acid-proof. A combination of molybdenum (2 per cent.),'chromium (60 per cent.), and iron (35 per cant.) will resist boiling aqua regia. Perhaps that passage will be more clearly' understood by honourable members if I ' explain to them that if fine leaves of gold are put into aqua regia, which is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, the gold will dissolve like sugar in coffee; but, as Borcher says, a combination of molybdenum, chromium, and iron absolutely resists boiling aqua regia. These metals could be usefully employed in connection with containers for jams, f r u it , meat, and butter, which could not have any corrosive effect upon steel thus alloyed. On a Bill of this character it may not be permissible for a private member to propose an amendment which will increase the bounty payable, but if I am permitted to do so, I - shall move in Committee a new clause or addendumNotwithstanding anything contained in this or any other Act, the bounty shall be increased by 10 per cent, on steel sheets that are manufactured with an alloy of molybdenum or tungsten. As I have already said, Australia duces more than half the world's of molybdenum. This alloy is used in the so-called rustless cutlery, and Mr. a biomanufacturer in England, Mr Scantlebury, of Sydney, who is interested in these rarer metals, that his"" firm would be prepared to take over the whole of Australia's production molvbdenum for use in the of domestic cutlery. Honourable may have seen the steel rails at a country railway station after a night's rain bearing a coating of rust on their shiny surface. If the steel were alloyed with molybdenum that rust would never'be seen. That alloy can be used with particular advantage in cranks, shafts, axles, rails, rolling stock, motor frames, and large ordnance. As honourable members are aware, the life of one of the Dr Maloney. large guns on a man-of-war is not more than ninety or 100 rounds, after which the gun must be sent to the .factory to be re-wired. It is interesting to note that the British Government found, in connection with German guns captured in the early days of the war, that, although the use of molybdenite as an alloy had increased the cost of manufacture by 10 per cent., the efficiency of the guns was increased by 2,000 per cent; The use of molybdenum enabled the Germans to use a gun with a larger range than even the big naval guns, and we are all aware that "" Big B e r t h a "" bombarded Paris from a distance of 75 ' miles, the shots occurring regularly every quarter of an hour. That gun Was evolved only through the - use of a hardening alloy which prevented the corrosive action of the explosive. Molybdenite could be used also in rifles, and as it is gas resisting, it would considerably increase their l if e ; in cutlery, and in magnets and magnetoes. I made a test with one o.f Bosch's magnets and the best that can be produced from Swedish steel. My nephew proved that a steel file would not touch the Bosch magnet, whereas it easily dented the Swedish magnet. I believe that the superiority of the Bosch magnet is caused by the use of molybdenum alloy in steel. The iron of Sweden has a great reputation in Europe, and is equalled only by that taken frora the island of Elba in the Mediterranean. It pro- could be used for fire-proofing, and it is a supply great germicide. It dyes blue woollens, rubber, leather, - and silk, and is not in Firth, jurious to rubber. It can be used to glaze assured pottery, to support the filaments in incandescent lamps, and in electricity-resistin? furnaces. Every honourable member who has had experience in Queensof land, New South Wales, and Western manufacture Australia knows how the pipes of the members artesian bores become choked owing to the chemical action of the mineral solutions contained in the water. Even the formerly pipes in connection .with the Western Australian goldfields water scheme must be replaced periodicallv on account of the corrosion, and the same thing happens in connection with the pipes in the Yan Yean guns, scheme. That trouble will disappear by the use of steel pipes alloyed with molybdenum. The uses of these two rare metals are a] very interesting developused ment, and I have given some study to tin. bhem during the last year. They will be otf particular use in the hardening tools. With the hardest steel previously known it was possible to cut only from 30 feet to 50 feet per minute through crucible steel. But by the use of an of molybdenum it is possible to cut feet per minute. Tools may become red hot. or even white hot, without their temper. The melting point of molybdenum is 2,500 degreesCentigrade, equal to 4,400 degrees Fahrenheit, and that is 1,400 degrees Centigrade above melting point of copper, 1,000 degrees above iron, and 740 degrees over platiof num. . Those figures explain why tools hardened with molybdenum do not lose tlieir temper when used at a great heat. I have explained that the cost molvbdenum would be far less in Ausused tralia than in Europe. No metal has been known to suffer what is known as a pest which has life in either a vegeferent. table or animal form, but tin has this peculiarity that, in the course of ""time, breaks up into minute globules, just does mercury when thrown on a table, that explains why we have no articles, tin preserved from pre-historic times. Tin is not acid-resisting for so long period as is an alloy of steel plus denum and chromium. The Broken H i l Proprietary Company has taken an option over the Great Mammoth molybdenite mines in New South Wales, and if a bounty were offered by the Government it might be induced to manufacture this class of steel.",42
151,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The molybdenite would make the steel harder.,44
152,Dr MALONEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"And absolutely acid-resisting,",44
153,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,It spoils it by making harder.,44
154,Dr MALONEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I beg to differ. What I have in mind is tin used in the canning of jams, fruits, and meats. There is an old saying amongst miners that a tin of fish that appears to be blown out should be thrown away, since tents are poisonous. There is good reason for that view. The cause of a tin being in such a condition has frequently been traced to the presence of a drop of solder in stopping the little hole in the I have nothing but commendation for of this Bill, and if I could persuade the Government to extend the bounty in the direction I have indicated I should be well satisfied: My desire is that we should be alloy able to manufacture up to the highest 500 economic value, producing the manufactured article from the raw material oblosing tained from our own mines.",44
155,Mr CORSER,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Wide Bay) [5.8] - I congratulate the Government upon the the introduction of this Bill, which I hope is but the forerunner of several others a similar kind. I desire, howeveT, to suggest to the Minister (Mr .Greene) that he should consider the advisableness of .providing for the standardizing of galof vanized .iron. Compared with what we to obtain in the old days, the quality yet of the galvanized iron and galvanized fencing wire now offering is very indif"" Gospel Oak "" galvanized iron, which was obtainable in years gone by, it had a life more than double that of the as iron now manufactured. I have some and "" Gospel Oak"" iron that has been on a of roof for over forty years, and which I should be .sorry, even after that length a of time, to replace by the galvanized iron molybnow imported' into Australia. In the l case of such large States as Queensland and Western Australia, where enormous railage and cartage fees have to be paid in conveying galvanized iron and fencing wire over hundreds of miles to outback settlements, it is all important thatconsumers should be able to secure material of the very best quality. No ordinary saving in price would compensate for the loss incurred in conveying galvanized iron and fencing wire of indifferent quality it over long distances. We should be particularly careful to provide that the bounty shall be paid in respect only of iron of first class quality. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will provide either in the Bill itself or by regulations under it, that all galvanized iron in respect of the conwhich the bounty is paid shall be standardized.' The Bill provides that the bounty shall be paid in respect of iron manufactured in accordance with the requirements of the Act and regulations, and if regulations were framed by which, the quality would be assured, a tremenHouse, dous boon would be conferred upon those residing in the back-blocks of this great continent. In no more effective way could the Government safeguard in this respect the interests of such people.",44
156,Mr WEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"East Sydney) [5.11] I shall offer no opposition to this B i When I interjected while the Minister was introducing it that, under clause 3, power was given to pay the bounty on prevent it . galvanized iron manufactured from i m ported steel blooms, I was under the i m pression that that provision was a violato tion of the object of the Bill . His planation, however, has satisfied me on that point. During the last few weeks I have addressed to the Minister some very per ton. important questions bearing upon this matter. A certain firm carrying business in Sydney, and employing a large many directions. number of men found it impossible f during the war to continue to import rods for the purpose of making wire netting and - fencing wire. Such rods are being manufactured at the Broken Hill Promanufactured prietary Company's works at Newcastle, but the Sydney firm to which I refer covered that an arrangement had been made by which all such rods manufachave tured at the Newcastle works were sent to the Austral Wire Nail Company, price. Melbourne. It endeavoured to obtain a supply for the purpose of drawing wire, and in answer to an inquiry which I recently, the Minister informed me that it had received an offer to supply these rods. My information is that the rods can be obtained only from the AusI tral W i r e Nail Company, Melbourne, and that that firm merely offered to take a draw off these rods, and to supply the Sydney firm with what was left, so that they could make wire netting out of i which the firm refused owing practicability. This only serves to show the kind of information with which Ministers are supplied. Since it seems to me posbounty sible that Messrs. Lysaght might have similar experience, I feel that I can no objection to clause 3. It is very necessary that we' should establish this industry in Australia. fore the war rods for wire netting were sold at £ 7 10s. per ton. I was informed, in answer to a question that I put in this that that low rate was due to German competition. I find, however, - that it could then be purchased from America at £ 7 5s. per ton, whereas the price today is £ 5 0 per ton. In this way the farmers are being robbed, and I am surprised that Ministerial supporters who pose as l l . the friends of the farmers and settlers have allowed this sort of tiling to go on.",45
157,Mr GREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,We have no power to,45
158,Mr WEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"As the result of my - action in drawing attention in this House the exorbitant prices charged, the exhardware people met in Melbourne last week, and decided to reduce the price of wire netting and fencing wire by £ 1 2 10s.",45
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Owing to the reduction on in freights prices are coming down in,45
160,Mr WEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"My honourable friend knows something about this matter; but is he aware that wire drawn in Melbourne from rods made in Newcastle can be here at about £ 2 1 per ton because of the preferential rates which the disBroken Hill Proprietary Company is - allowing the Melbourne f i r m to which I referred ? The wholesale houses will have to pay £ 3 2 per ton, the reduced If the same rates were allowed to the Sydney f i r m , farmers in New South Wales would be able to obtain wire netmade ting for £ 1 3 per ton less than they are paying for it today. This is a somewhat serious statement to make, but it is based on information supplied to me, and am told, further, that unless the Svdney firm can secure a supply of these rods it will have to discontinue the manufacture of wire netting. The supply of wire netting and nails in Australia will thus be t , still further reduced, and that position to its imwould add to the cost. We ought to provide in this Bill that the manufactures in respect of which the is payable shall be of first-class a commercial value. In that way the puboffer lic would be protected, and would be sure of getting full value for their money. The Bill provides for the payment of Bebounty on galvanized iron produced from steel rod. Such galvanized iron does not last as long as ordinary galvanized iron does. The life of steel is of short duration. I have made some experiments with steel on behalf of the Associated Master Plumbers. Steel on the surface is so hard that the muriatic acid and zinc that is used as a solution for the purpose of galvanizing the plate does not penetrate it , alid there is not that adhesion of the galvanizing to the steel plate that is should seek. secured where iron is galvanized. action of the climate creates a coolness"" at times which generates a moisture between the steel and the galvanized surface. This sets up a chemical action owing to there not being a proper adhesion; and that is the reason the product has not the life of "" Gospel Oak "" brand referred to by the honourable member for , Wide Bay (Mr. Corser). I do not suppose there was an architect in Australia who, when it was obtainable, did not specify that brand; and it is certain steel will not take galvanizing in the successful way that iron will. When the Government give a bounty, the article produced should be of first class quality, but I do not suppose I shall be able to induce the Minister to stipulate that iron and not steel be used, because iron today is much more costly. Some steps should be taken to supply the public, because, since the war began, galvanized iron has been at a fearful price, and little of it can be obtained. A great deal of plain sheet galvanized iron is used in connection with sanitation and for other purposes, much more than was used a few years ago; and there is, consequently, a much greater demand. I firmly believe that if those concerned in the mai ufacture would turn their minds to the matter, 'they would find that their customers would much rather purchase galvanized iron than galvanized steel. As an illustration, I may say that roofing of - galvanized iron which I fixed in Sydney in 1875 is still there, but I should not expect the galvanized steel of today to last more than two or three years when made into commercial articles. This is a technical matter,_ and, perhaps, not very interesting, but I feel it my duty as a practical man to place these facts before the House. It ought to be the object of the manufacturers to produce an article better than that imported, and as labour is expensive here, only the best of material should be used. If any one in any part of the world desires even a lathe or any mecha- , nical tool of first class quality, he feels assured that he has got it if it is of English made; and that is the sort of reputation that Australian manufacturers The Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [5.27]. - 1 accept this Bill as a small instalment of what may be a proper system of protection of Australian industries. I think, however, that many of us here would much rather be engaged in overhauling our Tariff so as to be prepared for the inevitable competition in the future. I was not much encouraged by the reply of the - Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) today, and I believe that that reply was given in such a way as to throw us off the track. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), in introducing the measure, said that this bonus, and quite likely others, were being introduced ""before opening up the Tariff."" I hope those words mean that at a very early date we shall be discussing the Tariff, with a view to bringing it into conformity with present-day - requirements. We shall be able to settle only a percentage of our returned soldiers on the land, and, therefore, new avenues of employment must be opened up for them.",45
161,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"This is one of them, and I think it will lead to additional employment for 1,500 men.",46
162,Mr FENTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I hope that we shall keep on multiplying the means of encouragement to industries. As I said before, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) did not give me much encouragement in his reply to my question today; in fact, he used words that might be regarded as not altogether courteous.",46
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The Acting Prime Minister is always courteous.,46
164,Mr FENTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"But there are times when the honourable gentleman, like all of lis, forgets himself, though up to now he has maintained a demeanour satisfactory to this side of the House. As far back as March, 1916, a representative deputation, composed principally of workers, who were anxious for the encouragement of industries, waited on the then Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce), and was promised that more would he done in that direction. I am inclined to think that on the Government side there are many who at one time were pronounced Free Traders. Whether these honourable members are shedding their previous ideas, or whether the Cabinet is under their influence, I do-not know; but I do not think that this Government is one to whom we can look for the encouragement of Australian industries.",46
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I can assure you that we are all desirous that industries shall be established in this country. I believe that those who have not been quite converted to the fiscal faith of the"" honourable member and myself are nearly so.",47
166,Mr FENTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I am hopeful for the future, for the war has changed the opinions of many in this .respect in Great Britain. With shipping once more ploughing the seas in the absence of the submarine menace, there is no doubt that large quantities of goods will be brought to Australia, and our Tariff does not afford sufficient protection to old established industries, to say nothing of new ones. The high freights have afforded some protection, but those freights may tumble down.",47

If it is true that black iron is better than steel for galvanizing purposes, it should also get the bounty. I have seen Government specifications in Queensland which stated that no steel sheets must be used. There must be something .wrong when a Government Department will not allow steel sheets to be used. I see no advantage in giving a bounty for steel sheets if they will not be extensively used. I hope that the Minister will agree to the amendment.

It will be necessary for me to make some inquiries, in order to ascertain exactly what may deupon it before I consent to include are it in the Bill. I shall have those inquiries made, and if I ascertain that the shall amendment will not do more than the to honourable member has in his mind, to include in the bounty corrugated iron which is made from black iron, and not steel, I shall be very glad to arrange for the amendment to be intror duced in another place, and when it comes back to this Chamber the Government will offer no objection to it. I am in the amendment. clined to think that more importance is attached to this matter than the circumstances justify. Certain grades of steel are used in the manufacture of galvanized iron as we know it in commerce. I me understand that everything depends upon the grade of the actual steel used; do not think that soft iron is ever emclause ployed for galvanized iron for roofing purposes. However, I am not certain upon the point, and I shall have ter inquired into. If the honourable member will withdraw his amendment, and the position is found to be as honourable members have represented it, the Government will offer no objection to making the alteration in another place. Mr TUDOR. (Yarra) [5.46] - If iron is the superior article for galvanizing purposes, we should give the bounty for the iron and not for the steel article. What the Minister has said is hardly accurate.",47
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I admit that I do not know anything about the technique of the matter.,48
171,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Most of us are in the same position. I have seen buckets, tubs, and other articles being dipped at Gold's works, and I have gathered that the softer material takes the galvanizing better the harder or more brittle material does. It seems to penetrate more. In eleetroplating it is often necessary to prepare base before dipping some articles, and understand that if a, bit of native copper is dipped in gold it will look just like real article. Quite possibly the thing may occur in theprocess of galvanizing. The Minister will be well advised to ""make the inquiries he has promised. It would be a great pity if we did not give the bounty to the better pany article; that is to say, the article with the any longer life.

175,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Yarra) [5.58] - I am afraid that this clause will be unworkable, though I have every sympathy with its object. In my opinion, firms will be able to. evade the clause by making it appear in their books that their profits on the manufacture of the article for which bounty is claimed was less than 15 per cent. Any man with a knowledge of business could frame his books to show that his profits arose chiefly from his operations in mining for iron or limestone or coal, or in the making of coke or other things. He could increase the apparent profit on other operations to reduce the profit arising from the manufacture of black sheets and galvanized sheets, plain or corrugated. Moreover, I think that, by fixing 15 per cent, as the rate of profit which may be earned, Parliament may be regarded as expressing the view that 15 per cent, is a proper rate of profit for any business. I doubt that many manufacturing firms would earn 15 per .cent., and reference to a share list would show that many of them earn less than 10 per cent. I doubt whether the sum set apart for the payment of bounty will be enough. It allows only for the manufacture of about 20,000 tons, whereas our imports have been as much as 165,000 tons.",48
176,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Hunter) [6.1] Whilst desirous of assisting in the estabthat lishment of the industry for which the provides a bounty, I think that we should not pay bounty on a higher profit than per cent. Persons will be quite prepared to invest capital in a business that will pay 10 per cent. Moreover, if we pay bounty on a profit of 15 per cent., the amount available for distribution may be sufficient to cover the output. think that we are justified in assisting with a bounty a company making a profit of 15 per cent. It is the taxpayers who must find the necessary money, and, whilst they will not object to the giving of this bounty, they will, I am sure, object to the giving of a bounty where it results the earning of an abnormal profit. Probinvesting ably after the first few years the industry will be able to get on without a bounty. Certainly I hope so. I move That in line 3 the word -"" fifteen "" be left out, machinery with a view to insert the word ""ten.""",49
177,Mr SAMPSON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Wimmera) [6.3] - I think that the amendmentmay be detriprice mental to the development of the industry years hence. which we wish to encourage. Although 15 per cent, may be a high rate of profit, the effect of the proposed restriction might be to prevent large companies from entering into,- as a branch of their business, the manufacture of the articles for which we offer a bounty. That would throw the manufacture of these articles upon wholly new business concerns. Now, we have provided that the war-time profits tax shall not fall upon new businesses earning only 15 per cent, on their capital. New businesses do not expect to be able to distribute high profits on the invested capital during the first few years of their existence. A proportion of those profits is carried forward and placed in a reserve fund to insure the financial stability of the business, or is used for its further development. The Acting Prime Minister said that some old businesses had established their pre-war standard at 15 per cent., and new businesses, in order to be placed on an equal footing with them, should be allowed a similar profit. I u the starting of any new business it is always contemplated that a proportion of the profits for the first few years will be devoted to its further development, so if it were thought not wise to limit Bill the profits of established businesses to 10 per cent., it is certainly not wise to 10 do so in the case of. new businesses. I think it would be a serious discouragement of the manufacturers if we unduly limited the amount of profits that a new not business might make, and so interfered I do not with its further development.",49

Apart altogether from the fact that this iron business is new to Australia,.and that in men are taking a good deal of risk in their capital in it, there is a very special reason why this proposal should be treated in the most liberal manner. A large quantity of very heavy is necessary for the establishment of these works, and any firm purchasing plant torday has to pay a higher than may be charged two or three",49

187,Mr RILEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I am speaking of oldestablished businesses, which will participate in the bounty. The machinery required for making galvanized iron is not very expensive, and it is altogether unreasonable to allow manufacturers a profit of 15 per cent.",50
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I think they will be lucky if they clear 7 or 8 per cent.,50
189,Mr RILEY,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I am satisfied that if the they were allowed 10 per cent, the industry would be established all right.",50

I support the amendment.",50
194,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"ICooyong) [6.16]. community as a whole, I urge the Committee to support the clause. Fifteen per cent, is only a fair and reasonable allowance, having regard to the fluctuations incidental to new enterprises. The argument put forward by the Minister is unanswerable. Machinery must be purchased today at, perhaps, 50 per cent, above normal peace-time values, and purchasers are placed at a disadvantage in regard to the future conduct of their business and the competition which they will have to face. Therefore, they must provide heavily for amortization.",50
195,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Does the honourable member think that prices of machinery are likely to remain at the present figure ?,50
196,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Because of the scarcity of shipping, and the high cost of raw material, it will be a long time before the price of machinery becomes normal. We desire people to enter into this iudustry at once, and if they have to buy machinery at the present abnormal prices they must provide a substantia] sinking fund, to wipe out the extra capital cost. We shall discourage enterprise if we provide that the bonus .may be reduced after the business is earning 10 per cent. The clause limits the profits to 15 per cent, on the capital employed. Many businesses are carried on with a comparatively small' capital, and are financed by an overdraft. Therefore, the capital employed does not bear a proper proportion to the real scope of the enterprise.",50

If a man borrows £10,000 a bank in order to carry on his business, that £10,000 is not part of his capital; it is merely a debt owing by him in connection with the business.

If this amendment were carried we should - have so to amend the Bill as to allow the percentage an the whole financial operation of the enterprise, including all moneys borrowed for the purpose of carrying it on.

In addition to the company that has been frequently mentioned during the discussion,- another firm'has also been engaged in the local manufacture of corrugated iron, and during the last three or four years has been receiving for its manufactures about five times as much as was paid before. To such an extent has this firm been able to accumulate profits out of the manufacture of these and other articles, that it has been able to replace its old machinery for the manufacture of corrugated iron with a modern plant,- and to put in up-to-date machinery for use in connection with all its other manufactures. Would the fact that I should be allowed to earn an extra 5 per cent., and still receive this bounty, induce me to enter into competition with - such a well-established business, as that,, even if it had a guarantee of only a 10 per cent, return ?

Messrs. Hoskins' mill, for instance, is utterly useless for the manufacture of galvanized iron under ordinary commercial conditions. The firm entered upon the manufacture of galvanized iron on a previous occasion, and failed. It must fail again unless new plant is obtained, since that already in the mill is perfectly useless for the purpose. If it decided once more to enter upon this class of manufacture it would have practically to put in a new and modern plant. In the first year of the industry, these firms may make a loss. In the second year they may secure a return of 2 per cent, or 3 per cent., and in the third year a return, perhaps, of 4 per cent., so that they will be very lucky if their averagereturn for the whole period in respect of which the bountv is payable amounts to 5 per cent. If honourable members are going to press this amendment, and so to declare that in the last year or two during which the bounty will be payable, these manufacturers shall not make more than 10 per cent., or an average profit of 2 per cent, for the whole period, they will destroy the whole effect of the Bill. They will not have industries established in Australia, and what is more, they will not deserve to have them established.",52

If there is anything that should be obtainable at a fair price- I do not say at a low price, because I want nothing cheap-it is bricks. It is absolutely impossible to secure, the housing accommodation required by the people in any of our capital cities. If that is the position today, what will it be when all our troops return? .We hear of people advertising for a house to rent, and offering as much as £ 5 for the key of a rented house. This is no mere fairy tale. It is a sworn statement made before the Inter-State Commission. The brick combine has been sucking the lifeblood of the people.",52
212,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The honourable member does not put the brick-making industry in the same category as that covered by this Bill?,52
213,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,No ; but both belong to the same crowd that is piling up big dividends at the expense of the people who have to pay rent.,52

The Government will; be coming down presently with an amendment of - the War-time Profits Act, fixing 15 per cent, as the return - which shall be allowed before that tax shall apply. In the Old Country any profit exceeding 5 per cent, is taxable under the War-time Profits Act.

The threat, of the Minister that unless this percentage of profit is allowed, people will not start in the. business, does not frighten me. a former Minister for Trade and Customs, I received many deputations, and was told by men over and over again that under certain conditions proposed they - would be ruined; so often did this happen that I used to say that I had seen men ruined in that room than in any other part of Australia.

There was some curious evidence given before the Commission yesterday by that class of people who complain that they are not making profits enough. It was the case of a co-operative brick company, and the secretary of the company",53
222,Mr GHEENB,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"This is out of order, surely?",53

228,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Hunter) [7.52] There are only two reasons urged why the ameudment should not be accepted. The first is that the companies will have to provide new machinery, which will, to a certain extent, militate against the works the proving a paying concern. Both of the companies which will derive benefit from in this Bill already have certain machinery, but the Minister tells us that it is not up-to-date, and additional plant will be required. If that be so, there will have to be capital for the purpose of purchasing machinery, and their net dividend will depend on the amount of money they' make, on the earning capacity of the plant, before they receive this bounty. With the bounty included, it must not",53
229,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I presume you take into consideration that the comwill have to scrap all their old,53
230,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"They may or may not; but suppose they have to, they put their capital into the purchase of the new",53
231,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION FOR NEW,They lose the capital represented by the old machinery,53
232,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"As a rule, companies 'which possess machinery have reserve funds. Every company, if properly worked, has a sinking fund to meet such contingencies.",54
233,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Then these companies will have to make a reserve fund out of the 15 per cent, to provide for the scrapping of that machinery.",54
234,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I submit that 10 per cent, is a fair profit. While we are all desirous to establish new industries, we must not let our desires get the better of our judgment. We have to hold-the scales fairly between the taxpayers and those who are to receive the bounty.",54
235,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The honourable member knows that deterioration of machinery is considered to represent about 5 per cent, per annum.",54
236,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) also raised the point about machinery. The clause says, "" If the net profits of any person, firm, or company claiming bounty""; and what are the net profits? The net profits are what the company has left after providing for all the things that have been mentioned. A company, first of all, provides for depreciation, and, as the honourable member for Kooyong suggests, they may have to borrow money from the bank on mortgage. We all know that from profits there is, first of all, provided the interest on money borrowed.",54
237,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,That was not the point at all.,54
238,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,That was the point the honourable member made.,54
239,Sir ROBEET BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,It is only a partial statement of the point.,54
240,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,What was the whole point?,54
241,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,We were arguing the question of capital.,54
242,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"The honourable member spoke of the clause providing 15 - per cent. "" on the capital employed,"" but he forgot to read the commencement of the clause, "" If the net profits of any son."" It is the net profits we must keep in view.",54
243,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,What I said was that borrowed money is not capital. ',54
244,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,But certain things have to be provided with borrowed money before there are any net profits.,54
245,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROTECTION FOR NEW,That is not the point.,54
246,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"It is the point in connection with any industry. If I am in a concern and borrow money, I do not regard any profit as net until I have paid ""the interest on that money. The Minister contends that the profit of 15 per cent, should be retained, because a company might have bad luck, making 2 per cent, or 3 per cent, only in the first year or two, and, perhaps, 10 per cent, in the last year of the bounty period. As to that, I am quite prepared to take the average profits over the four years, so that if a company earned 5 per cent, the first year, 6 per cent, the second, 7 per cent, the third, and 10 per cent, the fourth, I would divide the total by 4, and thus hving the company under the Bill. But if a company makes from 12 to 14 per cent, in each of the four years, I do not think it is entitled to receive the taxpayers' money by way of bounty.",54
247,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"If the company made less, would you guarantee it 10 per cent. ?",54
248,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"No ; if there were such a guarantee, you would have everybody going into the industry. If the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment, I shall divide the Committee.",54
249,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Indi) [7.57] - The definition of "" capital"" is not very definite; and it depends on what you mean by '* capital"" whether the 15 per cent, is or is not too much. Eor instance, in the War-time Profits Bill, borrowed money and Teserves are included in the ""capital,'' but in the Bill before us, it seems to refer only toactual share capital employed. There may be a large amount of capital employed, and a company may have very big reserves, and yet have a relatively per- small share capital. On the other hand, this bounty operates for four years only, and those concerned have to look ahead. They have to realise that, at the end of four years, the protection of the bounty will be taken away, and have to ask themselves what their position will then bewhether they will be able to compete with Great Britain, America, and Japan. They have also to consider whether the machinery they have bought will or will not have to be scrapped. Looking at the matter from every point of view, I think it will be found very hard indeed to establish this business if, after taking into account all the risks incidental to the establishing of a new business, the profits are confined to 10 per cent. The object of this Bill is to establish an absolutely necessary basic industry, and I do not think the Committee should haggle about an extra 5 per cent. We must remember that the object of this Bill is to establish the industry, and that the bounty runs for four years only. At the end of that period expensive machinery may have to be scrapped. I fear that very few firms would agree to enter into the business with all the risks, attaching to it if they felt that they could not make up to 15 per cent, on their share capital.

250,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Yarra) [8.9] - This clause provides that the Minister may make application to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a declaration as to what wages and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable for labour employed in the manufacture of black steel sheets or galvanized sheets. I wish to know whether that provision will apply only to the stage of manufacture which is reached after the steel has been produced, or whether it will also cover the earlier stages in the production of pig iron. I understand that the Broken Hill Proprietary will sell their blooms or bars to Lysaghts, who will roll them into sheets ... 32 . and galvanize them, whereas Hoskins Limited are likely to carry through the whole process from beginning to end. If 17 20,000 tons of galvanized iron has to be AVKS. produced every year, there will be a correspondingly large quantity of raw material used in the shape of iron ore, coal, and limestone, and I wish to know whether the rates of wages and conditions of employment will apply also to the men who are getting the iron ore, or the limestone, or are employed in the smelting operations.",55
251,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Richmond - Acting Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.12]. - The intention of the Bill is to deal only with the production of sheets. If the Broken Hill Proprietary, who are supplyNOBS. ing blooms to Lysaghts, are not paying the rates of wages touched upon, in this clause, the fact could not possibly affect Lysaghts' claim to a bounty so long as they themselves are paying the rates of wages laid down by the Arbitration Court. I do not think that the clause does more than protect the employees in the industry this Bill is designed to establish and protect.",55
252,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"In those circumstances, the employees of Hoskins Limited, ""who are engaged in the quarries or in the smelting operations, can be paid any wages the firm chooses to give them, but the men employed in the rolling-room, must be paid fair wages?",56
253,Mr GREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Theoretically , that will be the case, but in actual practice it will not be so. There is hardly one branch of this industry that is not already subject to an award of an Arbitratio n Court, either State or Federal, and the probabilities are that the employees of these firms will become subject to an award immediately after this industry is' commenced. In any case, if the employees do not take steps to approach the Court, this clause will leave it open to the M in ister to do so, and will authorize him to withhold payment of the bounty. if an employer does not pay the rates of wages stipulated by the Arbitratio n Court.

255,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Y a r r a ) [8.22] - The Bill , like the Beer Excise and Tobacco Excise Bills, is largely technical, but there are one or two matters which I should like the Minister to explain. It is proposed to insert in the original Act the following new section: H i . The provisions of the last two preceding sections shall not apply to any still of a capacity not exceeding one gallon. The sections referred to are these10. ISIo person shall without permission(a) Make or commence to make any still. (b) ltemove or set up or erect any still. (c) Sell or purchase any still, either b-y itself or with other property, or as part of any premises. # (d) Import any still. Penalty : One hundred pounds. 11. (1)"" Stills may be used for any purpose other than the distillation of spirits if the owner bas(i) Given written notice to the Collector for the State in which the still is used or is intended to be used, specifying\a) The size or capacity of the still; (b) the purpose for which the still is used or intended to be used; (cj the place where the still is to be used or intended to be used. (ii) Given security to the Collector in such sum as the Collector requires, not . exceeding One hundred pounds, that the still shall not be used for distilling spirits. (2) Persons unlawfully using stills at the commencement of this Act for any purpose other than the distillation of spirits shall be allowed a period of two months after the commencement of this Act to comply with the requirements of this section. (3) Any still used in contravention of this section' shall be an illicit still. It may be the desire of the Customs Department to encourage the use of small stills for experimental purposes. I pay great deference to the opinions of the officers of that Department, because I know how caref u l l y they safeguard the revenue; but I wonder whether they have not gone too far in this matter. Even a still of a capacity of less than 1 quart could, if worked continuously, produce a large quantity of spirit. This spirit would probably be worth anything between 2s. 6d. and 5s. per gallon.",56
256,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"E i g h t shillings per gallon is being charged for grape spirit, without . the Excise duty.",56
257,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Grap e spirit is superior to spirit manufactured from many other cheaper ingredients. Alcohol can be obtained from maize,, potatoes, beet, molasses, and other products. All the r u m made in Australia is got from molasses. I should like to know from the Minister why these small stills are to be allowed to exist, without let or hindrance. should also like some information regarding the alterations of licence-fees and security amounts provided for in clause 18.",56
258,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Richmond - Acting Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.37] The reasons that actuate the partment in permitting the stricted use of small stills are, first, the heavy penalty to which the illicit distiller of spirits is liable, and, secondly, the fact that to distil potable spirit in a still of a capacity of less - than 1 quart would be more costly than to buy the spirit at an hotel.",57
259,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I doubt that.,57
260,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,That is _ what_ my officers tell me. They are quite satisfied that it is impossible to produce spirit in these small stills at a cost which would not be in excess of the price at which it could be bought in the open market. They say that there is no risk to the revenue.,57
261,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Is it not possible to have what is known as a continuous still with a capacity of a gallon, which, if run from 8 o'clock in the morning u n t i l 8 o'clock at night, would distil much more than a gallon?",57
262,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I am informed that that is not the case. The officers of the Department are very zealous in their desire to protect the revenue, but they are satisfied that this provision will not lead to ill i c it distillation. Throughout the Commonwealth, .there is a large number of stills used for experimental purposes, and they have given the Department ah enormous amount of trouble. are used entirely for scientific purposes, the Government do not feel justified in imposing a licence-fee that would be commensurate with the expense entailed by supervision.",57
263,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The ment are creating trouble for themselves.,57
264,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"If trouble does arise from this concession-and it is a concession for scientific purposes-it will be a comparatively simple matter to remedy the defect later. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: I Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to.

The provisions of the last two preceding aections shall not apply to any still of a capacity not exceeding one gallon. De- Sections referred tounre- 10. No person shall without permission(a) make or commence to make any still; (5) remove or set up or erect any still; (c) sell or purchase amy still, either by itself or with other property, or aa part of any premises; (d) import any still.

(1) Stills may be used for any purpose other than the distillation of spirits if the owner has(tt) given security to the collector in such sum as the collector requires not exceeding One hundred pounds that the stili shall not be used for distilling spirits. (3) Any still used in contravention of this section shall be an illicit still.  Government are making a mistake in proposing to exempt stills of a capacity not exceeding 1 gallon. At Tambo, in Western Queensland, twenty-five years ago, I saw a man making whisky on the bank of the Barcoo River, and his still had not a capacity of half-a-gallon. Yet I have seen him produce a small cask of whisky in a very short time, and it was sold over an hotel bar. This clause is a premium on illicit distillation. No doubt the justification offered for it is that not much spirit can be made in a still of a capacity of 1 gallon; but if it be run conAs they tinuously night and day, hundreds of gallons of spirit can be produced in the course of a month.",57
265,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"This concession is only for the benefit of stills used for laboraGoverntory purposes.  vernment would be safeguarding the revenue if they'limited the capacity of the still to half-a-gallon. That will be no inconvenience to persons using a still in a laboratory, because they have plenty of time. In the Wide Bay district a few years ago, hundreds of illicit stills were in operation. All stills, of whatever capacity, ought to be licensed, just as, in most of the States, every gold-buyer is licensed. If the stills are registered, the Government will know where they are, and what is being done with them. All I ask of the Government is to do what is necessary to protect the revenue.  some time past, we have been endeavouri ing, under the W a r Precautions Act and hours. other Statutes, to l i m it the consumption of alcohol, but the Government are now* submitting a provision that will tend to case. increase the consumption of liquor under conditions which they cannot control. I the idea is to exempt stills used for only scientific purposes, then all stills ought to be licensed, and licences for exempt stills should be granted only to persons who are engaged in some way in scientific research. Why should we make a geneupon ral law which will enable anybody to illicitly manufacture spirits in competithis tion'with those who pay licence-fees? I had my way, there would be no manuwould facture of spirits at all except for sciena local hotel. tific purposes. I ask the Minister to take into serious consideration bility of' amending the clause. are in this country thousands of people who view the manufacture of spirits very nearest township. seriously indeed. Why should the Government bring in a Bill that will any person to manufacture a commodity which is recognised as dangerous to a very considerable number of people ? licence is to be granted in this way i sliould be only for scientific purposes.",57
266,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Then every plicant for a licence would be a scientist.  the administration of our laws common senSo will be exercised. If a man scientist. he should come under and rebe ceive the advantages of this clause; t u if he is not, he has no right to enjoy advantages which it will afford. The Bill will not be perfect unless it is so amended that none, but those desiring distil spirits for scientific purposes will be allowed to do so under this clause.",58
267,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Richmond - Acting Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.48]. - I do not think that the passing of this clause is likely to be attended by any of the dire consequences which some honourable members appear to anticipate. Such things have certainly not happened in the past. My officers tell me that no still that would come within the technical departmental definition as being of 1 gallon capacity could possibly produce more than half an egg^cupful of spirits, even f it worked continuously for twenty-four An y still that would produce more than that quantity would not come within the definition laid down in this Our officers, who have to interpret this law, naturally do not wish to go f further than is necessary, and they are' perfectly satisfied that the revenue will not be prejudiced in any way by the passing of this particular provision. As to the point raised by the honourable member  him of the statement.

274,Mr BOYD,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Then I think the honourable gentleman might well .adopt the suggestion that all such stills-should be tered. Spirits are not likely to be distilled for scientific purposes in the bushHaving regard to the experience of other countries, it is reasonable to predict that if we do not provide for the registration of stills they will come into use all over the country. In the country in which I had the honour to be born the manufacture of liquor at one time was wholly prohibited by law, with the result that private stills came into general use.

After his departure, the chemist found that he had supplied him with the wrong liquid. He set in pursuit of the shepherd, but failed to find him. A week later, however, the man turned up again, and asked to be supplied with some more of the same sort of stuff. The chemist put his hands together and thanked God that the man was still alive. "" I am delighted to see you,"" he said. ""Do .you know that the liquid I gave you was aqua fortis?"" "" I do not care whether it was aqua forty, fifty, or a hundred,"" said the man; "" I only know that it has kept my belly warm ever since.""

If the temperance people throughout ""the country were to see tomorrow that the Government, in their efforts to start new industries, was allowing private stills to be established, we should be inundated with petitions; and there is no doubt that it is our duty to protect the . morals of the people as well as the revenue. If the honourable member presses his suggestion to a division, I shall vote with him. The Go-, vernment at the last election were returned as a reform Government with the aid of the Temperance party, and should have some regard to temperance principles. Drink has proved a great curse in this and other countries; and the honourable member for Echuca, by his effort to-night, has raised himself considerably in my estimation.  informed that the amendment - of the Minister effectively covers the whole ground, but I should be still more satisfied if there was a short addition to the effect that none except those who are engaged in scientific investigation shall be permitted to distil spirits. If this was done it would relieve honourable members from condemnation by people outside.",59
278,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I am afraid I am unable to accept the suggestion of the honourable member.,60
279,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Y a r r a ) [ 9 . 4 ] the Committee are making a mistake in allowing this provision to remain in the Bill. The Minister assures us that a still of the kind contemplated will produce only half an egg-cupful of spirits in twenty-four hours. the Government have the advantage of expert knowledge; but I can hardly credit that statement to the Minister. At the Bundaberg distillery I have seen stills not quarter the size of the table in this chamber capable of producing a. quarter of a million gallons in the year. I agree with the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) that once people acquire a taste for spirits they will drink any kind of spirit, and it is known that in the big cities there are people, though I am pleased to think very few, - who drink even methylated spirits. ",60
280,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I oould understand a person drinking scent, but certainly not methylated spirits.  "" farmer's f r i e n d . """,60
281,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I do not know what that is. ,60
282,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Of course, there is a certain amount of spirits in every embrocation, I am glad that the Government are going to-keep a check on every still. In the Grampians there are more distillers of eucalyptus oil than in any other part of Australia, and each distiller has to register his still. The Customs authorities can get a list of every distiller in that district within twenty-four hours. There has lately been an increase in the duty and excise on spirits; and every such increase is an incentive to illicit, distillation - Spirits can be produced from the . potato, or maize, and other gram, a't any cost from 2s. 6d. per gallon. Under the present law, spirit distilled must be kept two years in order that it may mellow with age; and this, of course, makes it more expensive. If a man were to distil, say, at 4s. or 5s. a gallon, keep the product for two years, and then pay the duty of £ 1 when it was released from bond, it would by that time be worth, I should say, 30s. a gallon. Under the proposal in the Bill a still, although it can pro- I think duce only half an egg-cupful in twenty four hours, could be kept running continuously, and a person could have as many stills as he chose. The Government are quite right to insist upon registration, but I think that otherwise Of course, theirproposal is. only an incentive to illicit distillation. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 4 to 13 agreed to. Clause 14Section 55 of the principal Act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead:"" 55. All operations under this Act and fortifying of ;wine shall, for the protection of the revenue, be subject to the right of supervision 'by an officer.""",60
283,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Richmond-Assistant Minister f b r Trade and Customs) [9-10]. - I move That the words "" for the protection of the revenue, be subject to the right of supervision by an officer "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" unless exempted in writing by the Collector, be carried on in the presence of an officer."" Some doubt has been raised as to whether the present terras of clause 14make proper provision for what is required, and, on the advice of the Law authorities the drafting of the clause has been altered to the terms of the further proposed amendment. . The alteration is made in the in electorate terests of the manufacturers, and to avoid unnecessary expenditure by them. Section 55 of the principal Act is mandatory on the Department in requiring that all operations and for t if y in g of wine shall be carried on in the presence of an officer. In the case of all large distilleries this of course, strictly carried o u t; but gard to vignerons' stills, where one Excise officer has to supervise the operations a whole district,,as, for example, the try within, say, 20 miles of Rutherglen, it is not possible for him to be present during the distillation of the for t if spirit. The maximum capacity of each still is, however, known, and effective steps are taken, and safeguards imposed, to insure that no illicit spirit is being distilled. The amendment proposed is for the purpose of bringing the law conformity with the practice, and to vide that, whilst the revenue is safeguarded, a certain amount of elasticity shall be allowable in the matter of ministration.",60
284,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Indi ) [9.13] - The f u l significance of this clause .may not, haps, be recognised by the Committee. Before Federation, spirit for for t if y i ng wine was duty free in Victoria, and growing was encouraged in every possible way. The State expended many thouthe sands of pounds in developing the indusgrower try, and when phylloxera devastated the vineyards it came to the aid of the vigplaced nerons and established a Viticultura l lege and nurseries to raise resistant stocks, which were distributed at a cheap rate. On the advent of Federation excise of Is. per gallon was imposed spirit for for t if y in g wines, not purpose of raising revenue, but merely to pay the expenses of supervision. creased The Tariff Commission, headed by Sir John Quick, investigated the industry, and recommended that the Excise duty on spirits used in for t if y i ng wine be reduced to 6d. per gallon. Parliatralia ment, after giving the matter careful consideration, reduced the duty from to 8d., at which figure it remained until the last Budget was laid before House, when the Government suddenly raised it from 8d. to 6s. per gallon. sudden rise has imposed a most staggerhas ing burden on the wine-growing industry. In some cases it will involve its speedy destruction. The wines that are mostly consumed in Australia are the sweet wines. In fact, they cannot be produced without the aid of for t if y i ng spirit, which is put into them, not for the purpose of making v is, them stronger alcoholically, but for the ' in repurpose of preserving them and preventing, fermentation. Without the use of in spirit most of our wines would turn sour. counPrior to Federation some of the State laws permitted the use of salicylic acid and other preservatives injurious to the y in g people, but the Federal law has prohibited the use of such things, rendering it all the more necessary for the vignerons to use spirits. The wines of Portugal and Spain imported into Australia are for t i fied to the extent of 40 per cent, of proof into spirit, but under our laws, no wine promade in Australia can be fortified to the - extent of more than 35 per cent. The standard is about 34 per cent. Owing adto the State encouragement of the industry, certain classes of grapes for the production of sweet wines have been grown, l and in the Indi electorate it is absolutely perimpossible for the vignerons to produce dry wines, or even wines of any description, without for t if y in g them to an extent. wineThe rise in the Excise duty means an added impost of £133,000 per annum upon industry. The position of the wineis quite different from that of the distiller or brewer. If an Excise duty is on spirit or beer, the merchant or Colbrewer simply adds it to the cost of the article, and he can put it into consumption the very next day at the increased an price, but wine which is fortified has to on mature for three years. Therefore, the for the financial burden on the - wine-grower through having to pay this greatly in duty on the spirits used for fortifying his product not only amounts to £133,000 per annum, but has to be calculated at three times that amount. In should other words, the wine-growers of Aus-will be called on to provide £400,000 extra per annum, as well as an additional Is. interest bill of £26,00 0 per annum.",61
285,Mr LAIHD SMITH,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Canno t they pass this it on to the consumer?,61
286,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"It cannot be passed This on to the consumer at once. The wine to be mature for three years. The inevitable result of this heavy impost will be that wine-growers will endeavour to get r i d of their wines as soon as they"" can, and the country will be flooded - with that stuff known as "" Pinkie."" It is in the interests of this community to see that the wine drunk in Australia is properly matured, but this extra Excise on spirits used in for t if y in g wine will have the very opposite effect. Every year about 625,000 gallons of spirit are distilled from grapes in Australia, and in 1916-17 the quantity used for fortifyin g wines was 452,000 gallons. nerons have been reconstituting their vineyards as a consequence of the inroads made by phylloxera, but some of the newly-planted vines are now coming into bearing, and more wine will be produced, entailing the consumption of a larger quantity of spirit. The wine-growers are quite willing to shoulder a fair share of the extra burden placed on the people of Australia, but it must strike every honourable member that it is an extraordinary jump to raise the Excise duty on the spirits used for for t if y in g - wine from 8d. to 6s. per gallon. The Treasurer says that the increase has been provided for the purpose ""of obtaining revenue, but surely it is not a fair impost on an in dustry that the States have encouraged in every possible way, and upon - which they have spent thousands of pounds with that end in view. I am given to understand that the capital invested in the industry is between £12,000,000 and £15,000,000. and I trust that the - Government in providing that an officer of the Excise Department shall be present when wine is being fortified will also see that the extra Excise demanded from the wine-growers will not be an inducement to them to endeavour to avoid the provisions of the Bill . vigneron with 50 acres of vines will produce 10,000 gallons of wine per annum, and use 1,400 gallons of spirit for for t if y ing purposes. W it h 8s. per gallon as the cost of the spirit and 6s. for Excise a vigneron with 50 acres of vines will thus be called upon to pay in Excise duty and cost of spirit a sum of £ 9 8 0 for one year, or £2,940 for three years, at the end of which time he '""will have the opportunity of disposing of the prodHict of his vineyard.",61
287,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,What about the stocks already matured ? Does not the vigneron as a matter of practice place the extra duty on the stocks he alreadv holds ?,62
288,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION FOR NEW, Order ! This debate is gettin g quite outside the amendment.,62
289,Mr LECKIE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,I was endeavouring to keep within the limits of the amendment.

290,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Hunter) [9.25] - As I understand the amendment, distillation must be carried on in the presence of an officer unless exempted in writing by the Collector. If it is not possible for an offioer to be present, can the vigneron secure permission in writing to go on with his work?",62
291,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The Crown Law officers have said that on further consideration they believe that the words proposed in the Bill would compel an officer always to be present. By the amendment we can allow a man to go on distilling with the officer not present at the actual operation.,62
292,Mr CHARLTON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,That being the case I am quite satisfied.,62
293,Mr FINLAYSON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Brisbane) [9.28J CJnder the proposed amendment a distiller may get exemption from the Department and no officer need be present when distillation is in progress. The original provision in the Bill was that the presence of an officer was required for the sake of protecting theTevenue. I congratulate the Acting Minister on the fact that the Department ^recognised A how essential it is to have a responsible officer present, not for the sake of protecting the revenue, but in order to safeguard the interests of the public in other directions. I am beginning to understand what the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Jensen) said when introducing the Bill , namely, that it would remove certain disabilities which distillers had discovered. The Acting Minister (Mr Greene) now comes forward, and says that the matter of^ protecting the ""revenue is of little consequence, and that - certain distillers who are able to get the ear of the Minister or get on the right side of the Government can have their premises exempted from the necessity of having an officer present when distillation is in progress. I suppose that the Government think that they can protect the revenue without the presence of an officer.",62
294,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,We are quite sure that we can do so.,63
295,Mr FINLAYSON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"I am quite sure that the Minister is wrong. I regret that I was temporarily absent from the chamber when the honourable' member for  grave danger confronting Australia. There are thirty-four distilleries to be watched. It is a matter of notoriety that the liquor trade has to be watched from the beginning to the end of its operations. In an interesting article about Japan, which I have just read, it is stated that in Tokio the watchmen going along with their clappers make such a noise that burglars are able to hide until they have passed, when they can resume their operations in safety. The spirit trade seems to get similar warning. Certainly, despite the watching, it is able to find loopholes in every law that is passed for its control. Even the Excise officer in a distillery may be deceived. No other business is so clever at evading and flouting the law as is the liquor business. Is it to be thought that permission to carry on distilling in the absence of an officer representing the Government will make the distillers honest ? The history of the liquor trade is such that no one can be simple enough to imagine such a thing. There is at present a recognition of the fact that those in this business will try to dodge the revenue officers, but it is proposed that the protection of the revenue shall no longer be considered, and that the consideration shall be the inconvenience to distilleries of having a Customs officer present all the time.",63
296,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The honourable member is not fairly representing what the Minister said.,63
297,Mr FINLAYSON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The Government have changed their mind since the introduction of the Bill.,63
298,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,There has been no change of intention.,63
299,Mr FINLAYSON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Who pays for the presence of Excise officers in distilleries? Mr GREENT. - The Government.,63
300,Mr FINLAYSON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,Then the saving of expense will be an inducement to the Government to allow exemptions.,63
301,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,We merely propose to enact by law what has been the practice of the Department throughout. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) knows that.,63

For years the attempt has been made to get the distillers and the brewers to do the fair thing by manufacturing the pure article, but it has not succeeded, and will never succeed.

304,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION FOR NEW,The honourable member is going outside the amendment.,63
305,Mr FINLAYSON,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Fro m now on the business of distillation should be watched more closely. We shall be interested to see what new distilleries are established, and whether the supervision is effective. No doubt the number of distilleries will increase considerably. We shall want to know how many of them are under supervision, and whether the supervision is as effective, as it was. It is almost certain that exemptions will be freely issued, and under a sympathetic Minister or. Government supervision will practically cease, and may become unknown. It is proposed that it shall be left to the sweet will of the Minister to say whether, supervising officers shall be 'employed or not. From the point of view of the public interest, that is very serious. Does the Minister think that he is going to secure better control of distillation, .more effective supervision, and greater protection of the revenue? I prophesy failure, because no Government Department anywhere has been able to beat the liquor interest.

The reason for the amendment is that a number of patent medicines, which are well known, and some of which are manufactured in Australia, such as liniments and veterinary medicines, are not included in the British Pharmacopoeia, and we think they ought to come under the definition of "" Medicines "" in the principal Act. Although they are not in the B r i tish Pharmacopoeia, they are, at the same time, legitimately on the market, and we think it quite sufiicient that the Department should be left to exercise its discretionary power i h the matter. Needless to say, we would not grant the concession in respect to any medicine which, in our opinion, was a quack remedy that should not be on the market. There are some medicines and particularly veterinary preparations, on the Australian market which are made i h Australia, and which the Department is satisfied are genuine.

Many patent serve a useful purpose in country tricts, but there are others that are only quack remedies. When I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs I did my best to expose the rottenness of the claims made in respect of the properties of many patent medicines. The British Medical Association did a service to humanity when it caused to be published the book entitled Secret in which the analyses of a number of patent medicines were given, and the absurdity of the claims made in respect of many of them was shown. I believe that the present Minister will do exactly what I did to prevent the introduction of quack remedies into Australia, and I certainly hope that nothing will be done to foster their manufacture here. We have no control over the manufacture of such as medicines in Australia; the power to control their manufacture rests solely with the States. In one case I , as Minister - for Trade and Customs, prohibited the importation of a certain medicine, but the proprietor coolly said, "" I can snap my fingers at you; I shall manufacture it in Australia in spite of y o u .

The message is as f o l lows :Re Age article referring relations between Cook and me, of which following summary has been cabled over:1. Political sensation has been caused iby publication article from London correspondent Age, dated 1st October, which states that, for first three months, Hughes and Cook never met. 2. Cook wrote repeatedly to Hughes, but received no reply. 3. Cook's later letters indicated that something unpleasant would happen to Hughes when he returned to Australia; but Hughes still preserved a rigid silence. 4. Hughes did not consult Cook on matter affecting relations between British and Commonwealth Governments. 5.

Hughes desired to be .placed in charge economic construction of Empire. George was prepared offer him a portfolio, but Liberal Coalitionists threatened trouble. We desire to say, in regard to1.

Cook did not, in any letter or personally, indicate that something unpleasant would happen on my return to Australia. Cook's relations with me have been uniformly cordial. 4. This is quite untrue. 5.

I have only received one deputation from British Empire Producers' Association during whole of my stay here, and one from Australian residents re income tax, at latter of which Cook was present. C.

I feel that the cablegram which the Acting Prime M in ister (Mr W at t ) has read leaves something to be desired. I have never heard of a cablegram being signed "" Hughes and Cook."" That is a most unusual way. Were the words "" Hughes and Cook"" attached to the cablegram by an official?

Even Sir on the press. Joseph Cook, who must remain here as long as his chief, has no knowledge of the chief's movements. But that is not surprising, for Mr Hughes is a very reticent gentleman, and it would almost seem that Sir Joseph Cook is not very much in his confidence.

When the row began in Russia, the Prime Minister, then in Australia, said, "" Russia wants and a man,"" meaning, of'course, that if he were there everything would be all right.

The deputation asked for the elimination' and liquidation of all enemy rice milling firms in Burma and made o the r requests. paper correspondent goes on to sayMr Hughes, who has no knowledge of the rice trade of Burma, and no power' of any kind to deal with it in any capacity, or to carry out the wishes of the deputation, gravely assured them the policy which they advocated of developing and maintaining a trade which had been built up largely by British capital, and wholly on Empire territory, had his earnest support, and he would be pleased to do anything he could to help them in eliminating those enemy interests which threatened that great industry.",69

396,Mr WISE,PROTECTION FOR NEW,"Gippsland-Assistant M in ister for Defence) [ 1 0 . 3 3 ] - I have received the following statement from the Minister for Defence-, with reference to the t r a n s p o r t B a r a m b a h : Casualties - Wit h reference to the matters arising out of the last voyage of the transport Barambah with Australian Imperial Force troops on board, I have to confirm wit h regret the report of several casualties,- clearly, it seems, due to the outbreak of influenza, although it is not yet known how the disease was introduced on the ship. It is gathered, from the voyage reports of the Officer Commanding troops, Lt - Colonel H . Pope. C.B., Australian Imperial Force, that the precautionary measure of forbidding shore leave had been taken at Capetown. Telegraphic news of seventeen deaths, and eight cases of illness have been received. The names will , in accordance with The news- practice, be released for press publication tomorrow, the next of k in having been advised. Medical - The medical provision made before the vessel left Australia consisted of two doctors and a staff of thirty-four, there being, as a matter of fact, an excess of fifteen orderlies, due to there being Army Medical Corps reinforcements on board. Accommodation - The question of the shipping accommodation which can be placed at the disposal - of the military authorities is one primarily for the Department of the Navy and the British Admiralty; and, so far as the condition in which the Barambah put to sea at Melbourne, and the necessity for inquiry in that regard, is concerned, the matter has been dealt with in statements by the Acting  however, advised that, whilst the vessel was fitted up for 1,154 troops, the number actually placed on board by the military authorities was 940. Inspection - The vessel was inspected before departure by the responsible military officers, in conjunction with the Naval Transport Staff; the results of the final inspection, as communicated to the Department at the time, being summed up in the words "" Very satisfactory."" Inspecting Officers - The inspecting officers were Captain C. B . Brewis, Naval Transport Officer, representing the Department of the Navy; Colonel M . Sturdee, Principal Medical Officer; and the M i l it a r y Embarkation Staff Officer, Major A. E. Greig. Deck Space - Further , the Director of M i l i tary Transport and Supplies now reports that he interviewed Colonel Pope before leaving Melbourne, with a view to insuring that adey the i r quate deck space was provided for rank and file as well as for the officers. Colonel Pope, it is understood, indicated his intention to allot the bridge-deck to the officers, the welldeck to the Naval ratings and noii-comniissioned officers, and the whole of the forward portion of the vessel to the rank and file. The vessel, I am informed, naturally lent itself to this division, which wasconsidered satisfactory. State of the Ship - I received a letter from Mr George Foley, M.L.A., Chairman of the Western Australian Advisory Committee on M i l it a r y Hospitals, stating that the troopship was not in a satisfactory state at Fremantle, flushing water for lavatories being obtainable only occasionally, .and showers being dry. Mr Foley added:"" The Officer Commanding says that the orderlies are tryin g well, and have done much to make it cleaner; and if it were any dirtier than it was on my visit, it certainly did not reflect much credit on the authorities who let her start."" Pumping Machinery - The explanation given in reply to Mr Foley was that the trouble is due to a break-down in pumping machinery, which was in order when leaving Melbourne; and that no doubt, when the pumping, machinery was repaired, matters would adjust themselves. The matter is referred to in a voyage report, dated 9th September, at Fremantle, subsequently received, in which Colonel Pope stated that "" Trouble has occurred wit h the ship's engines, repairs to which are being effected at this port."" He also remarked:"" Deck space is limited, and troop-deck, when hammocks are hung at night, is somewhat congested. The best use of what is available is being made."" Health, and Rations - Continuing , the Officer Commanding said: ""The troops are in good health and spirits, and the ration issue is quite satisfactory, both in quality and quantity."" Later, from Durban, the Officer Commanding troops reported, on 29th September, that:""The general health and spirits of the troops has remained excellent. Discipline among the troops has been well maintained, and very little crime has occurred. . . . . Rations have continued excellent."" At the same time, the Senior Medical Officer on board reported:'-' The health of the troops has been good on the whole. There have been some cases of mumps. The food has been satisfactory in quality and quantity."" These are the. facts relevant to the question which have come to my notice, and no reports yet to hand from the Officer Commanding troops bring in question the general suitability of the vessel for the purpose of the transport of troops. At this stage, it seems that the difficulties chiefly encountered arose from the regrettable outbreak of influenza making unexpected demands upon the medical personnel and supplies, as well as upon the ship's accommodation. W r it in g from Fremantle. the Senior Medical Officer on board reported, in his usual voyage report, that the hospital accommodation was ample, and that the surgical and medical supplies were found to be in ft good condition. The Durban report does not mention these matters, which, presumably, continued satisfactory.

I have brought the matter up before, when speaking on the censorship. The censor has prevented the publication of extracts from American papers dealing with the case, and appeals made by American Labour and Labour in other countries for a new 'r'..d for Mooney. Circulars containing these appeals were sent to Australia, and were published in the Worker aud in other newspapers, yet the censor in Victoria refused to sanction their publication in the Socialist./ According to to-night's HeraldMr John Densmore, Federal investigator, has found appalling conditions of vice and crookedness in San Francisco. He announces that he has learned of gross corruption in the Mooney case since his investigation began in June. Mr Densmore's report is a national sensation. He says:-""It is difficult to realise how rotten things are in San Francisco. All power and authority are completely in the hands of a gang. The prose--iiting attorney, Fickert, is a tool of the interests higher up, juries are fixed.' innocent men are convicted, and deep-dyed criminals freed. Tho jury in one of the Mooney cases was ' fixed ' absolutely."" Although this is allowed to appear in the Herald, if an attempt publish it in the next Socialist, and the censor acts as he has acted previously, be will forbid the publication. I ask the Acting Prime ister to intimate to the censor that the information regarding the case cated by American Labour civilized country, urging other countries to bring pressure to bear on the American authorities justice for Mooney, is not to be suppressed. Mlooney has been reprieved time to time as a result of the protests of Labour in other countries against the frame-up in San Francisco. gator of the United States has secured proof that the evidence brought about Mooney's conviction ;i frame-up, pu e and simple, birt in Victoria the censorship has been used to prevent the bringing of the facts the working classes.
