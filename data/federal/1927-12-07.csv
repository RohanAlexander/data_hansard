1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Littleton Groom) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. NA NA OFFICIALS.  orable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) asked a question about the granting of Christmas railway passes for civil servants. I wish to ask, Mr. Speaker, whether you will take into consideration the granting of railway passes to parliamentary officials who wish to spend Christmas with their families in Melbourne ?",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"I shall have the matter looked into and, later, will inform the honourable member as to the position. EXHIBITION OF TABLE. Mr E. EILEY - Some time ago I asked you, Mr (Speaker, if the table at which Queen Victoria signed her assent to the Commonwealth Constitution Act could not be moved into the King's Hall, where it could be seen by the public, and you were good enough to say that you would take steps to have that done. . I should like to know why the table has not yet been moved from the library ?",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"It is intended to remove the table from the library, but it is not yet possible to do so, because the glass case in which it must be enclosed, has not been delivered. I am making inquiry as to the cause of the delay, and I shall take steps to expedite the removal of the table to the King's Hall. IRON AND STEEL DUTIES.",13
4,Mr RODGERS,FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs circulate the report and dissections of the departmental officials upon which he has based the duties on iron and steel set out in the tariff schedule, in the manner followed with Tariff Board reports, Avithout the divulgence of confidential information, so that honourable members may inform their minds as to the value of the departmental officials' dissections and report?  honourable members that these dissections contain confidential information that cannot be disclosed.",13
5,Mr RODGERS,FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"Eliminat e it .  of the debate in committee I shall disclose all the details I have, excluding that confidential information.",13
6,Mr RODGERS,FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"If , as it would seem, the duties on iron and steel are the result of departmental dissections and report rather than of the Tariff Board's recommendations, will the Minister say whether, after receiving th* departmental report, he re-submitted the whole question to the Tariff Board, the body appointed by this Parliament for the purpose of investigating and. reporting upon proposals for duties ?  of the Tariff Board is to investigate and report to the Minister, and through him to the Government. The duty of the Government, before it places proposals before Parliament, is to analyse the recommendations of the Tariff Board and to view them from all angles, to come to a conclusion upon them, and to submit its policy to Parliament. That course has been pursued in the present instance and, as the Minister in charge, I am prepared to defend the policy of the Government when the items are being discussed. NA RAILWAY .",13
7,Mr LACEY,PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L,"In the Melbourne Herald of the 26th November last, appears the following statement:Not _ the least interesting possibility in a campaign on the part of the Government to cut expenses, may be the dropping of the Red Hill to Port Augusta Railway Bill, which is now at the second reading stage in the House of Representatives. It also saysThere is considered to be more than a remote possibility that the bill may vanish from the notice-paper as the session closes. I should like to know if that statement is correct and whether it is the intention of the Government to take-the Port Augusta to Red Hill Railway Bill off the notice paper, and not proceed with the construction of the line?",13
8,Mr BRUCE,PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L,"It is not proposed to proceed, before the House adjourns for Christmas, - with the bill for the construction of a railway from Port Augusta to Eed Hill, but the notice regarding it will remain on the business-paper. Whether the measure will be proceeded with early in the new year will be a matter for further consideration by the Governmeut. WELFAEE OF ABORIGINES.",13
9,Mr COLEMAN,PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L,"-Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the fact that a deputation representing an English society interested in the welfare of aborigines waited on the High Commissioner in London recently, urging an investigation into the condition of Australiau aborigines, and, if so, will light honourable gentleman give early consideration to the request which has been made by Australian organizations and scientific societies for the appointment of a select committee or a royal commission to conduct such an investigation ?",14
10,Mr BEUCE,PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L,"As I indicated last night, the Government has given consideration to the representations for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the condition of the aborigines of Australia, and communicated on the subject with the State Governments, but the Premiers of nearly all the States have expressed unwillingness to be associated with us in the matter. As without the cooperation of the States a commission appointed by the Commonwealth would not have power to investigate the matter fully, we do not propose to appoint one. We have, however, asked the Government of Queensland to lend us the services of one of its senior officers so that the position of the aborigines in North Australia and Central Australia, for which the Commonwealth is directly responsible, may be investigated.  communication from the Women's Nonparty Association of South Australia expressing the desire of the association to learn what is being done in connection with the problem that may arise if aboriginal women are allowed access to construction camps on the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway line. I understand that South Australia imposes stringent regulations in connection with railway construction camps, and I ask the Minister for Home and Territories if similar regulations are in operation in connection with the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway construction camps?",14
11,Mr MARR,PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L,If the honourable member will place his question on the notice-paper I shall give him a considered reply.,14
12,Mr YATES,PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L,"I too have received a communication from the Women's Nonparty Association of South Australia in which regret is expressed that a perusal of the Mansard report of a recent debate in this House does not disclose the fact that section 11 of the principal ordinance of the Northern Territory, 191S, has been put into operation. That is the the section which provides for the protection of aboriginal and half-caste women when construction work is in progress. Thfi Minister is well aware of the danger to aboriginal women who come in contact with these camps, and 1 should like .to know what instructions he has issued to put into effect the provisions, of the ordinance?",14
13,Mr MARR,PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L,"The Department of Home and Territories, the Government Resident of Central Australia, and the Works and Railways Department have been collaborating with reference to this important subject so that half-castes may be safeguarded not only against contact with railway construction camps, but also in other ways. If the Queensland Government .will lend the services of a senior officer, we hope that we can get him to begin his work in the Alice Springs district, so that the whole position may be investigated at the earliest possible moment. NA COMMISSION REPORT ON GOLD - MINI NG INDUSTRY.",14
14,Mr A GREEN,DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATION,"Can the Prime Minister say when the second and final report of the Development and Migration Commission, dealing with ""the assistance proposed to be given to the gold-mining industry, will be laid on the table?",14
15,Mr BRUCE,DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATION,"I am not in a position to say exactly when the report will be tabled, but I believe it will be available in the very near future. NA NORTH AUSTRALIA.",14
16,Mr JACKSON,CENTRAL AUSTRALIA AN D,"In connection with the elections in Central Australia and North Australia, which were to commence a considerable time ago, I should like to know whether they have been completed and the poll declared, and, if so, when the elected representatives will commence their duties?",14
17,Mr MAER,CENTRAL AUSTRALIA AN D,"The date set down for the elections had to be postponed because, owing to the weather, the mail service was considerably disorganized. I forget the exact date on which the election is now to take place, but we are hoping to learn the result of it very soon. NA STATES OF AMEEIO A.",15
18,Mr FENTON,COMMISSIONE E TO THEUNITE D,"H as the Government decided to appoint a successor to Sir Hugh Denison, the Commissioner to the United States of America, and is there any truth in the statement that has been made that a member of the present Ministry is likely to be appointed to the position ?",15
19,Mr BEUCE,COMMISSIONE E TO THEUNITE D,Tw o days ago I in formed the House that the Government did not propose to take steps at the present time to appoint a successor to Sir Hugh Denison. FEDERAL CAPITA L COMMISSION. DISMISSAL OF GARAGE EMPLOYEE .,15
20,Mr GREGO RY,COMMISSIONE E TO THEUNITE D,"the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice I. Is it a fact that some months ago Â» man employed by the Federal Capital Commission in the main garage was dismissed? 2. Is it a fact that this man was accused of obtaining secret commissions from a well known firm on the sale of motor cars or lorries ? 3. Was the matter brought before the officers of the Attorney-General's Department, and, if so, did the department recommend a prosecution ? 4. What action has been taken to expose the irregularity or offence, if any?",15
21,Mr MARR,COMMISSIONE E TO THEUNITE D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions follow:1. Yes. 2. Yes. A departmental inquiry was held into the allegations (which did not involve public funds), but no definite case was established. 3. The matter was subsequently brought before the Police Department of New South Wales and the-Attorney-General's Department, and, after full inquiry, the Attorney-General's Department advised against a prosecution. 4. As the officer's services were immediately dispensed with on grounds other th:m the allegations, and in view of the advice mentioned in (3) no further action appeared to be called for as the whole matter was public knowledge in the commission's organization. The commission has handed the confidential file on the subject to the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, and it may be perused by the honourable member if he so desires. RAILS. Mr GREGORY aske,d the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice What were the minimum and maximum prices, f.o.b. at Newcastle or Sydney, paid for rails, 80 lb. per yard, to Australian producers, each year during 1910, 1017, 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1926?",15

23,Mr CHARLTON,COMMISSIONE E TO THEUNITE D,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeTn view of the fact that arrangements have been made for all employees of the Federal Capital Commission to be granted holidays, on full pay and without deduction from annual leave, for the period between Christmas Day and Now Year's Day, will the Government consider the extension of this concession to all officers of tlio Public Service stationed at Canberra ?",15
24,Mr BRUCE,COMMISSIONE E TO THEUNITE D,"I have referred this matter to the. Public Service Board. The board reports that it is unable to agree that circumstances require the closing of all Federal departments at Canberra during the days between Christmas and New Year. To grant leave on these days to Federal public servants at Canberra would not conform to the provisions of the Public Service Act and it would be u n fair to employees in other localities who might, with equal justification, make similar plans. In the circumstances, the Government is unable to accede to the request. TIMBER IMPORTATIONS. are as Mr Forde asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon - notice I.

26,Mr BEUCE,COMMISSIONE E TO THEUNITE D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The agreement that has been entered into between Great Britain and Germany does not propose to abolish the passport system, but merely to dispense with the necessity for the nationals of the respective countries consular visas when about to enter one another's countries. 2 - See answer to No. 1.

27,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,DAIRYINGAND BUTTEE,Enquirie s will be made and the honourable member will be informed as soon as possible. MES. LANE-POOLE.,17
28,Mr MARR,DAIRYINGAND BUTTEE,"On 30th November the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Coleman) asked me the following questions:-1. At whose instance was Mrs Lane-Poole commissioned to furnish the residences of the Governor General and the Prime Minister? 2. Was she given a free hand with regard to the amount expended? 3. What were the terms of her appointment as regards [a) fees and (6) expenses? 4. How long was the period of her engagement? 5. What was the total amount paid to Mrs. Lane-Poole under the headings of paragraph to obtain 3 of this question? I am now in a position to advise bim as follows:- t I . The Federal Capital Commission. No; Mrs Lane-Poole's instructions were to ascertain and study the requirements, and prepare designs and estimates of cost for suitable furnishings. This was done, and the schemes were studied and checked by the Commission's staff, and, before approval, were also submitted to independent check and criticism by the Commonwealth Works Director for Victoria. The engagement included supervision of the execution of the contracts. 3. Payment of a fee at the rate of Â£3 3s. per day during such days as she was engaged upon the Commission's work, plus railway fares and travelling expenses. From this fee she was required not only to employ the necessary artists and draftsmen to prepare the designs, but to conduct correspondence with and interview the manufacturers and employ inspectors at the factories in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide,' to assist her in the necessary inspection work. She then had to supervise the installation at Canberra. - 4. From 29th March, 192G, to the 5th September, 1927. 5. Â£1,247. NA BOUNTY BILL . Message recommending a p p r o p r i at i o n reported. â Order e d - That the message be. t a k e n in to consideration for t h with . In committee. (Consideration of vernor-General's message) That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of for an act to amend the Iron and Steel ducts Bounty Act 1922. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered pare and bring in a bill to carry out the going resolution.  read a first time. SECOND READING.  Trade and Customs) [11.22] - I movewealth That the bill be now read a second time. I desire to recapitulate the various that have been taken in connection with the subject matter of this bill. The is designed' to grant an extra Â£1 per. bounty on galvanized iron as from the 1st January ensuing, and to allow a proportionate bounty to be paid upon tracthose tors made in Australia from 1st January, 1927, provided that they do not contain less than 75 per cent, Australian work or material. A report upon galvanized iron was submitted the Tariif Board as far back as the July, 1925, and it recommended that foreign duty should be raised. As a result Parliament- I think it was in March, 1926-confirme d the enactment of a the foreign duty upon galvanized iron, ing it from 30s. to 60s. a ton. At the same time the existing bounty of Â£2 12s. was continued. The Tariff Board further investigated the industry and, towards the end of last year, submitted a recommendation that the bounty should be increased to Â£4 10s. per ton, and also that a deferred duty of Â£5 a 10s. should be provided in the British,, and Â£7 10s. j n the foreign schedule. That recommendation was considered by the Government, and, for the reasons which I shall set out, the Government submits the present proposal to the House. When the Tariff Board made that recommendamaterials tion it stated that it did so because the extended protection would enable the Ausof tralian manufacturers to capture more Goof the trade in New South Wales, Victoria, Southern Queensland and South Australia. The total output of the Australian mills will supply only a little a bill more than half the requirements of the ProState of New South Wales. It is extremely unlikely that the manufacturers would reduce their profit on a part of their output by forwarding supplies to other States, on which they would have to pay a higher freight. In view of those circumstances, the Government considers forethat the proposal of the board is not entitled to receive favourable consideration, under the present circumstances I shall go further into the question of output, and quote the following figures:For the year 1925-26, the importations for of galzanized iron into the Commonwere 89,466 tons, while in 1926-27 they were 103,696 tons. The percentage of the Australian consumption supplied steps by the New South Wales manufacturer in those two years was 17^ per cent, and bill 20 per cent, respectively. The perton centages that local production bore to New South Wales' consumption only for years are 51 and 53 respectively. The capacity of the works is between 28,000 and 30,000 tons per annum, which of is approximately 25 per cent, of Australian requirements, and a little more by than half of the requirements of New 2nd South Wales. I shall not stress that the aspect of the matter. Honourable members, from the statistics that I have quoted, will be able to see exactly what position is with regard to the capacity raisof the New South Wales workB in relation to the total consumption of the Coma ton monwealth and of the State of New South Wales. The present assistance to the industry is given by tariff and bounty. Tariff item 145 provides a duty of 20s. British preferential, 55s. intermediate, and 60s. general, and the bounty is 52s. ton. This bill proposes to increase the bounty by 20s. a ton. It is considered that further assistance is necessary in order to enable the industry to carry on profitably and to increase its output to the full capacity of its present plant. It is a condition of the bounty that the which are used in the manufacture of galvanized sheets shall be wholly Australian production.. It cannot be gainsaid that this industry is of great importance to the Australian iron industry, which provides the steel bars that are used. I should explain that . when straight out tariff protection is given, the manufacturer is at liberty to use either imported or local materials, whichever he finds are the more profitable; hut in the manufacture of galvanized iron sheets under the bounty he must use Australian steel. I have already stated that the capacity of the local works is from 2S,000 to 30,000 tons per annum, and that about 450 hands are employed. I wish to say also that a large amount of caj)ital is invested in this industry, but that since its inception only a small return has been received""from it. I should like to say now a word or two respecting the amendment that relates to tractors.",17
29,Mr JACKSON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Will the other amendment apply to Australian zinc as well as to Australian steel?  honourable member with all the particulars when the bill is being considered in committee. Prom memory, I should say that Australian zinc is used - Tho schedule to the principal act makes provision for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of tractors, varying from Â£40 to Â£90 according to the horse-power. This bill does not propose to alter the rates. Generally speaking, the basic principle of bounty acts is that a bounty shall be paid only in respect of articles that are produced wholly from Australian material. The Iron and Steel Bounty Act certainly provides that a manufacturer may be permitted tp use imported materials; but it is intended that those shall be used only in an emergency, wben for some unforeseen reason Australian materials are either not obtainable at all, or cannot be obtained in sufficient quantities. The manufacturers of tractors have experienced a difficulty in obtaining a suitable internal combustion engine of Australian manufacture. Since the bounty has been in operation a further difficulty has arisen as a result of the Crown Law authorities having expressed the opinion that the term "" materials "" in the section which authorizes the Minister to permit the use of imported materials in exceptional cases cannot be interpreted to include finished parts such as an internal combustion engine or a magneto. Thus any manufacturer who finds himself in the position I have described is prevented from claiming any bounty, and consequently is obliged to manufacture tractors under conditions that I do not think Parliament intended should operate. The object of the bill is to afford relief in that direction. Under it the full amount of bounty will be payable on the manufacture of tractors that are wholly Australian; ' but it will be reduced in proportion to the quantity of imported material used. Thus, if a tractor is 100 per cent. Australian, the full amount will be payable. If imported materials are used to the extent of 1 per cent of the cost of the completed tractor, the manufacturer will receive 99 per cent, of the full amount; and the reduction will continue proportionately until the stage is reached at which imported materials are used to the .extent of 30 per cent.",19
30,Mr EODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"There will be a proportionate abatement according to the quantity of imported material used?  member for Wannon (Mr Eodgers) rightly observes that ther.e, will be a proportionate abatement according to the quantity of imported material used; but if that should exceed 30 per cent, of the cost of the tractor, no bounty will be payable. Honourable members will be interested to learn bow this bounty, which was agreed to by Parliament some years ago, has operated. On account of its stringent character, it has been practically a dead letter. Th.e, amount of bounty paid in respect of tractors has been as follows:1924-25 . . .. Â£500 3925-26 . . .. Â£270 1926-27 . . .. Â£250 Evidently, therefore, it has not encouraged to any extent the manufacture of tractors here as was hoped by this House.",19

The importations of tractors have been very large, ancl there is a wide field for the development of the industry in Australia. A thorough investigation has. been carried out by the department, in conjunction with the Crown Law authorities, with the object of overcoming the difficulty and enabling fair encouragement to be given to the Australian industry. So far as I know, thgre is no opposition to this proposal of the Government, which, I hope, will stimulate the industry. It will certainly define in a legal way the position that Parliament intended to create. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) adjourned. LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 4th November (vide page 995), on motion by Dr EABLE PAGEThat the bill be now read a second time.",19
32,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Yarra) [11.40] - This bill proposes to amend the Land Tax Assessment Act. I draw attention to the fact that the Government has abandoned the position which it took up when it forced through Parliament a bill to withdraw the per capita payments from the States, because it then proposed to repeal the land tax and to remit other forms of direct taxation. The identical payments that it formerly made to the States jnder the per capita arrangement it now proposes to make in a different form. If anything proves the value of criticism in Parliament, this does; because there is Â» no doubt that on the occasion to which I have referred the Treasurer was determined to withdraw the per capita payments, repeal the land tax, and reduce other forms of direct taxation. Now it is intended that the land tax shall be continued, though at a reduced rate. The bill is one mainly of concessions. addition to the 10 per cent, cut in the rates which will be made under the provisions of another measure, very considerable reductions are proposed under certain clauses of this bill. One concession proposed is triennial valuation of land, and another the abolition of retrospective assessments. The. loss in revenue that will be occasioned by tbese amendments, in conjunction with the 10 per cent, reduction in the rates, is estimated to amount in the ensuing year to Â£445,900. That loss will increase as the years go by. These are very generous concessions to. the large landholders of Australia. No owner, the unimproved value of whose land is below Â£5,000, pays land tax; therefore, a struggling farmer or a small landowner is not affected,, The Government has no warrant for making such a generous gift to these people. It talks at random about the mandate it received at the. last election; but I challenge i i to show any mandate to proceed with this proposal. It carefully refrained from making any mention of it when ir appealed for the suffrages of the people. A Labour Government in 1910 passed the Land Tax Act with a two-fold object: to secure to the people a portion of the unearned increment that accrues to land, and to burst up large estates so as to facilitate closer settlement, and enable those who are born on the land to obtain for themselves blocks from which they may produce wealth and earn a livelihood. ""We have reached the stage at which there is no longer any need to argue that the, aggregation of large estates is inimical to the interests of this country. There was a time 'When that was necessary. In the. early days it frequently happened that, meetings of pastoralists passed resolutions and conservative newspapers published articles in support of the argument that large estates should not be broken up, but should be retained for the purpose of running sheep and supplying the markets of the world with wool. But that day has gone by. ""With few exceptions people - believe today that closer settlement leads to increased pro--duction from the land, and that the bursting up of large estates is desirable in the national welfare. It is strange In that one of the exceptions to the rule is the Prime Minister. At any rate he does not subscribe wholeheartedly to this policy as I shall show later. Speaking in general terms, it is realized that the aggregation of large estates is an obstacle to development and progress. Our first Land Tax Assessment Act was passed in 1910. In 1914 provision was made for the taxation of Crown leaseholds and the rate of taxation was increased. A further increase of 20 per cent, was made in 1918 but it was removed in 1922 under the provisions of a bill introduced by the present Prime Minister.",20
33,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That increase was imposed as a super tax for war purposes.,21
34,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Our war obligations still rest upon us and the increase should still remain. The present Treasurer has also been responsible for decreasing our land taxation. He introduced a bill which had the effect of entirely abolishing the taxation of Grown leaseholds and so exempting 968,000,000 acres, or almost half the area of the continent, from taxation. It is now proposed that a further reduction of 10 per cent, shall be made and that concessions shall be granted which will be in effect another 10 per cent, reduction. So that our land taxation, if this measure is agreed to, will 20 per cent, below what it was in 1914. It is estimated that in 1927-28 our war aud defence expenditure will amount to Â£34,000,000, yet we are told in justification of reduction of land taxation, that the war is over. The fact of the matter is that our war obligations are still increasing. But the Government is so tender-hearted towards large land-owners that it proposes to relieve them ""of this obligation. It is recognized generally that our financial position is serious and that our loan expenditure is increasing. There is a strong demand for land throughout Australia, and one of the objects of this taxation is to discourage the aggregation of land in large estates and to encourage its subdivision into areas which would permit of it being put to better use. Since this taxation was first imposed in 1910 many large estates have been subdivided. In the first three years of the operation of the measure Â£30,000,000 worth of land was subdivided. According to the 10th report of the Commissioner of Taxation, since the inception of this legislation approximately Â£100,000,000 worth of land has passed from taxpayers to non-taxpayers. In other words estates of a value of more than Â£5,000 have been subdivided into estates of a less value than that. I am aware that some of the subdivisions may not have been genuine; but it cannot be denied that this legislation has had the effect of accelerating closer settlement and of encouraging men of limited means to take up reasonably small areas of land for agricultural and pastoral pursuits. There are still many people in the community who would be glad to secure land under reasonable conditions. Whenever either leasehold or freehold land is made available to the people by the various State governments, the number of applications is at least ten times as great as the number of blocks available. The following figures in respect of New South Wales are enlightening: At Albury, in March, 1925, there were 1,900 applicants for 98 blocks; at Lake Cowal, 413 persons applied for a single block; at Grafton, in August, 1925, 2,200 land seekers applied for three blocks; at Moree, in September, 1925, there were 1,205 applicants for one block- I was in the town at the time that the applications be were heard; at Farkes, in September, 1927, 1,072 persons applied for five homestead farms, and 29 for one Crown lease; and at Wilga Downs, in November last, the Nyngan Land Board had 1,380 applications for seven Crown leases on the Wilga Downs.",21
35,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It is almost like a prize in Tattersall's sweep.,21
36,Mr SCTJLLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I do not desire to have my speech punctuated by interjections, but I shall reply to the honourable member for Wannon. The monopolizing of our land by a comparatively few people who own large estates has had the effect of inflating values to such a degree that when the Crown is able to make a few blocks available they are sought after with all the eagerness that the people display to win a prize in Tattersall's. In Victoria, during the last three years, 2,057 applications have been received for the 444 blocks that have been made available in the Mallee; and for the nine blocks now available at Lake Tyrell there are 167 applicants. Most people agree that the aggregation of land in large estates is detrimental to Australia and hinders our prosperity. Only those who wish to see a few people enjoying the heritage of the nation would argue that it is desirable to allow large estates to be held by the few to the detriment of the many. Land that is suitable for subdivision should be subdivided. Some years ago I visited the western part of the Wimmera, which is well known to the honourable member for Wimmera, and discovered that very large areas were bein"" W d there for grazing purposes which were not being put to their best use. I was shown a property of 4,000 acres which was managed by four brothers. I do not desire to mention their name, but it is well known to the honourable member for Wannon. The adjoining estate consisted of 30,000 acres and was held by a big squatter. The four brothers were able to run nearly a sheep to the acre of their 4,000 acres, but the big squatter had only about one sheep to four acres on his estate. The explanation was that the brothers worked their land thoroughly. They systematically destroyed the dead wood, rubbish and vermin upon it and generally looked after it ; but the squatter made no particular effort to increase the production of his estate. At one time, as is well known, the whole of the Wimmera was given over to grazing; but today, in consequence of its closer settlement, it is carrying many more sheep than it did when it was a purely grazing proposition, and in addition, it is producing a large quantity of the best wheat grown in the world. Cultivation does not mean that the sheep pass out, but that the land-owners use the land as it should be used. The Prime Minister is not favourable to the breaking up of large estates. When he was in Queensland last August he delivered a speech which is reported in the Brisbane Courier of the 2nd of August, from which I take the following paragraph:We aretoo apt to yield to the cry that this continent must be cut up into small areas to give settlers with small capital a chance. The development of sheep country can only be successfully carried out by or a eompany with sufficient capital to withstand a periodical drought. That argument has been discredited by experience. Mr G. PKANCIS - Not in Western Queensland.",21
37,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Experienc e throughout Australia has discredited it. Wherever large estates have been subdivided and improved, the country has been able to carry more stock and to resist drought conditions more effectively. I do not say that the comparatively poor country in Western Queensland should be subdivided into small farms. No man with a practical knowledge of this subject would argue in that way; but I do say that even that country could, with advantage, be divided into smaller estates than at present. In consequence of the withholding from cultivation of good country in recognized rainfall areas and adjacent to railways and markets, many of our people have been driven right out into the bush to get land. In the speech of the Prime Minister from which I have already quoted, there appears a statement relating to one of the most interesting pieces of legislation which this Parliament has passed in recent years. The disclosure which the right honourable gentleman made is significant and amazing. He indicated that on one memorable occasion, during the debate on the bill to abolish the taxation of crown leaseholds and remit all arrears in such taxation for the preceding seven years, he disciplined his party and brought it to heel. He statedI f it were in his power, he would wipe out all those arrears. He had threatened to resign and it was only then that Parliament agreed to abolish the tax, but compelled him to collect arrears. Honourable members who were in this Parliament in 1923, will recollect that the Labour party fought that measure tooth and nail and were able to obtain sufficient support from honourable members opposite to oblige the Government to abandon its proposal insofar as it related to the remission of arrears of taxation. There was a race between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, which the former won, to catch the Chairman's ' eye in order to move for the deletion of that clause. a person Now we know how the members, of the party behind him were whipped into line. We thought then that they had acted of their own volition, but now we know the truth. The Prime Minister whipped them into line so far as the abolition of the tax on Crown leaseholds was concerned, but he was unable to get them to agree to the remission of - arrears of land tax being retrospective for seven years. He got them to agree to wipe out this tax on half litis continent only by threatening to resign as head of the Government. I have quoted from the Brisbane Courier. If the statements are not correct, I ask the right honourable gentleman to contradict them. We have here a striking piece of inside information. When honourable members on this side said that by a threat to resign the Prime Minister forced his followers to submit, honourable members behind the Government resented the statement, but here are the Prime Minister's own words to justify it. I recall these two statements of the Prime Minister in order to show that the Government is not sound upon the question of land taxation, and that it is more interested in the welfare of large squatters than in enabling smaller farmers to acquire farms on which to make a living for themselves and their families. Land monopoly and the curse of landlordism have been the struggle of the ages. In some of the older countries of the world they have forced men and women to emigrate to freer lands. The Labour party set its face against land monopoly in 1910. The Labour Government then in office brought in a system of land taxation. Since the present Government has been in office the provisions of that legislation have been whittled away. If the process is continued much longer the land tax will be worthless as an effective check against the aggregation of large estates. I shall say no more at this stage regarding the general principles of this question, but shall refer in general terms to some of the clauses of the bill before us. I propose to deal with them in greater detail in committee. One clause provides for the creation of a valuation board. Notwithstanding that I am of the opinion that far too many boards and commissions have been appoiuted by this Government, I think that the appointment of a valuation board, composed of experts with a knowledge of land values, would be justified if it were the final court of appeal against the valuation of the Commissioner of Taxes and his officers. If one thing more thananother has been demonstrated by our experience, it is the great need for some authority to give consistent interpretations of the law and to determine finally the value of land. Every honourable member knows the disputes that have arisen in connection with land valuation. Should such a dispute arise, the case is eventually brought before the court and decided by a judge. I have the highest respect for our judiciary. I believe that its members are impartial and, in the main, able; but however learned in the law or impartial they may be, I submit with all due respect that judges are not the proper authorities to decide questions of land valuation. In the tenth report of the Commissioner of Taxation honourable members will find some very interesting reading. From it I propose to quote the following extracts:The judgment of the court in the appeal of Jowett v. the Commissioner of Taxation, could not lie treated as being applicable to the facts of any other case The court did not lay down any rules of valuation which the department could usefully follow The department was surprised at the decision. The decision of the judge in that case was not accepted by the department as a guide. Further cases have to be heard on appeals which will probably come before the same judge. I want to ensure that the Valuation Board, which I assume will be an impartial tribunal, representing various interests, will have the last say as to the valuation of land for taxation purposes. The appeal from the commissioner's valuation to the board should be the final appeal. I shall give my reasons for this view. The case of Jowett v. the Commissioner of Taxation furnishes a striking illustration of my contention that judges are not the proper authorities to deal with land valuation matters. The decision of the judge in that case not only was a different interpretation of the law from that of the Full High Court of Australia, but it also produced a mathematical jumble which, - to say the least and to use the mildest term, was weird. I shall not worry honourable members with the details of that judgment-the y can read it for themselvesbut I propose to take one illustration from it. For the leasehold of the Quambatook estate in Queensland, comprising 107,000 acres, Mr Jowett paid a rental of Â£544 per annum. Notwithstanding that Mr Jowctt's witnesses agreed that that rental was reasonable the judge valued the fee simple of that property at Â£376.",22
38,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Who was the judge ?,23
39,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Mr Justice Rich.,23
40,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Was that rental based on the unimproved value of the property ?,23
41,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The rental of Â£544 per aunum was on the unimproved value of the land, yet Mr Justice Rich assessed its capital value at Â£376. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Killen) would be delighted to find an investment that would return him Â£544 per annum on a capital of Â£376. Mr KI.LI.BN - Million s of acres in tralia have no unimproved value at all.",23
42,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I am dealing with a specific property whose owner, witnesses admitted that the rent charged was reasonable, and not with a supposititious case affecting land of no value. In dealing with this question we should do well to confine ourselves to actual cases. I believe that the annual rental for the .estate referred to was low; even the lessee admitted that it was reasonable. In the circumstances, the capital value of that property, as determined by the judge, was ridiculously lo w. Let us .examine the method adopted by the judge in arriving at his valuation. In doing so we should remember .th-.uthe Quambatook estate had been purchased, so that His Honor had before him the purchase price. Por the leasehold, Â£13,604 was paid. Included in that amount was a sum of Â£10,696 for improvements, leaving Â£2,908 as the value of the lease which had 25 years to run. That is a plain admission by the o-.wiers that they regarded the rent as low; otherwise they would not have paid anything for the balance of the lease. The sale was on a walk-in walk-out basis, the total purchase price for land and improvements and stock being Â£35,000. figures I have, given are exclusive of stock; the amount was agreed to by both the buyer and the seller. The judge took the price paid for the unexpired term of the lease, namely, Â£2908. By some process of valuation, he assessed the annual value of the lease at Â£249. He then added the annual rental of Â£544, and arrived at a total annual value of Â£793. That amount he capitalized at 10 per cent, and obtained a capitalized value of Â£7930. Yet, he said that the fee simple of the property was worth only Â£376.",24
43,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The honourable member is wrong in saying that the rental the improvements out of account.,24
44,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The improvements were kept entirely separate.,24
45,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The value created by them is the annual value.,24
46,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Not at all. If it was, the leaseholder would not have paid Â£544 as annual rent and Â£2908 for the unexpired portion of the lease. I have Aus- shown how the judge arrived at the capital value of Â£7930. To that amount he added improvements valued at Â£10,696, making the total capital value of the land and improvements Â£18,626. But the next move of the judge was the most extraordinary of all. Although he included the value of the improvements at. Â£10,696 to procure a total capital value of Â£18,626, in .arriving at the result of Â£376 as the capital value of the property, he deducted Â£18,250 as the value of those improvements.",24
47,Mr THEODOBE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Were those improve- ' ments valued at different times?,24
48,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The judge said that Â£18,626 would be the value of the improvements in fee simple, whereas Â£10,696 was their value with a 25-years lease. His Honor, in endeavouring to ascertain the fee simple value of the whole property, should have taken into account the fee simple value of the improvements. If he had done that his decision would not have been the inaccurate mathematical jumble that it is. Honourable members need not concern themselves about that jumble. All that they need to know is that the judge capitalized the rental of Â£544 per annum at 10 per cent, and arrived at a value of Â£5440. The Even if the rent was a fair one-and I contend that it was low-the property was worth at least Â£5440. Yet the judge valued it at only Â£376. What a valuation for an estate comprizing 107,000' acres!",24
49,Mr ATKINSON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Will the honourable member give me the reference to the case ? ' Mr Scullin - It has not yet been reported; but I can give the honourable member a copy of the judgment. I have it here. I point out, however, that the department does not accept that judgment; nor does the Treasurer or the Attorney-General accept it. I can understand their refusal to accept it.",24
50,Mr BRENNAN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,But they accepted it. leaves for political purposes.,24
51,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is so. Last year the Treasurer pointed with glee to the decision of Mr Justice Rich in the Jowett case in an endeavour to confound me in the stand I had taken in connection with arrears of land tax on Crown leaseholds. made it appear that the victory of Mr Jowett was over me and honourable members on this side of the chamber, whereas it was a victory over the Commissioner of Taxation. A victory, and on such a decision as I have mentioned! I raise this matter now, because I want to ensure that the proposed Valuation Board, if appointed will have the last word in the valuation of land and not leave the question of valuation to the judges. Questions of law, of course, and of law only, must go to the judges when there is an appeal. If that is not made definite and clear in the bill, I not support the appointment of a valuation board.",24
52,Mr EODGEBS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I think that that is sound.,25
53,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I thank the honourable member. I should like to refer to another aspect of this question, and is a matter of equity. The proposal is to . allow an appeal by the taxpayer from the department to the board on valuations only. Of course, there are some other appeals that can go to the court; but from a number of arbitrary decisions by the Commissioner' there is no appeal, either to the board or the court. With due respect to the Commissioner, who, I believe, is conscientious and earnest, I think that he, like every other man, is capable of making mistakes. ' It is a basic principle of law that when a man has arbitrary power to give certain - rulings, there shall be some tribunal to whom appeals against his decisions can be made. I am strengthened in that statement by the fact that right through the Income Tax Act such a right of appeal is recognized, because an appeal board is provided. It is true that in respect of this tax there will be appeals to the court in some cases; but in other cases no appeal is allowed. For instance, ""section 42A was purposely designed to protect the revenue from fraud, and I agree with the provision; but when the Commissioner gives his decision under section 42A, or section 37, or section 76, the taxpayer has no right of appeal against it. I suggest in the present case that, if he cannot appeal to the Valuation Board-and there may be an argument against that-h e should have the right of He appeal either to the court or the Appeal Board under the Income Tax Act. That is provided for in a minor degree under the present bill, where certain action can be taken by members of the Appeal Board under the Income Tax Assessment Act. Under that act the board can hear appeals against arbitrary decisions by the Commissioner. That is only reasonable and fair. Whilst I am strongly in favour of land taxation, and believe that the large land-owners both in town and country should contribute substantially to the revenue-the tax on big estates should be sufficiently high to penalize shall them for holding big areas-the application of such a law as this should be just.",25
54,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It is a class tax.,25
55,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That argument was out of date a quarter of a century ago. It might appropriately be applied to this our income tax or to any tax that is based on the principle that the burden shall be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. Every tax imposed in that way can be called a class tax; but the class that objects to pay it always has the remedy in its own hands-it can break up the large estates, and make them available to the small holders who are land hungry. When the bill reaches the committee stage, I shall discuss this matter further. For the present I hope that the Treasurer will make a note of my remarks. There should be a right of appeal to a board or to the court against any decision, especially when it is far-reaching and involves considerable sums of money; but the right to appeal against valuations should be limited to appeals to the valuation board. If we grant the right of appeal from the decision of the Commissioner, it will bring the bill into line with the Income Tax Assessment Act. I draw attention to the clause proposing the abolition of retrospective assessment. These re-assessments are provided for under both the Land Tax Act and the Income Tax Act. The Commissioner can go back three years under the Income Tax Act and re-assess the value. Under the Land Tax Act, as it stands at the present time, he can go back two years. The reason for that is obvious. It is not always possible to obtain a correct re-assessment. Mistakes can be made both by the taxpayer and the department, and a reasonable time must be allowed for the correction of valuations. The Treasurer said that, although that was necessary while the Land Tax Act was a new measure, it was not so necessary now. Would not that argument apply equally to the Income Tax Act? There is not the slightest doubt that we shall lose considerable revenue under the bill, and certain persons will evade taxation. Under this measure there can be re-assessments that reduce the tax, but not re-assessments that increase it if it is too low.",25
56,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The provision operates harshly where land has been sold, and the interest in it has passed on to others.",26
57,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The same argument applies in respect of income tax, when a man spends his income.",26
58,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,No . It is a responsibility that always remains with him as an income tax payer.,26
59,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"No , only for three years. If he spends his income for a given year he can still be re-assessed for that at a higher rate three years afterwards. If a man sells his land and spends the proceeds, he is in no worse position than is the income tax payer who has spent his money and is subsequently reassessed.",26
60,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Excep t that in this case the tax follows the land, and the previous owner may not be available for taxation.",26
61,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is the responsibility of the purchaser. It is for him to see that there are no rates or taxes due or any encumbrance on the land when ho buys it. When the department was first established, there was good reason for this provision, because it was impossible to make valuations of all taxable lands so as to include them in the original assessments. But every year lands are becoming taxable that were not previously assessed. When they are discovered, it will be impossible under ibis bill to go back even for the two years provided under the existing act. Therefore, I shall oppose the clause that provides for the abolition of retrospecequal tive re-assessments. The question of uncertainty is put forward as an - argument-that it. interferes with adjustments of sales and transfers; but that is a special argument. This system has operated for seventeen years.",26
62,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"When one receives an account one pays it, and that is the end of the matter.",26
63,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"If the honourable member rendered an account, and found out that after it had been paid an amount had been omitted, he would include that amount in the next account and expect payment. The department has a similar right. The Statute of Limitations allows six years; but in the act it is asked that the time limit as it stands, of two years, be abolished. There is a further and worse blemish upon this bill. It removes the power from the Commissioner to - make annual valuations, and it limits the department to triennial valuations. It is true that, in practice, valuations may not be made frequently. Years may elapse before certain areas are re-valued; but the department watches land movements and notices whether the prices move upwards or downwards. It makes its valuations when the changes take place. In certain localities values alter rapidly, and sales disclose that the department has not always discovered the change in values. It should retain the right that it has under the act today to make a new valuation. This will be denied to it under the amendment, and for three years a valuation will stand before it can be altered. Reductions could be made; but the valuations could not be increased. Surely that is not fair. The Treasurer, when questioned as to what he estimated the loss would be, put it down at Â£80,000 a year. This loss, through not assessing lands at their true values as they move upwards, will be all in the interests of the men whose land is increasing in value. It will be of no benefit to those whose lands are depreciating in value; the latter will have the same rights as before.. That is an anomaly that should be removed. The total reductions under the bill, and the 10 per cent, reduction under the Rates Bill, will be Â£-145,000 in.round figures, to approximately 20 per cent, off the existing tax; approximately Â£400,000 will go to the owners of estates over Â£25,000 in value. I have not been able to obtain the figures for the latest years, because, unfortunately, the Commissioner does not include, in his most recent reports, the details that he used to publish in previous reports. His 9th and 10th reports do not contain the same full information that was found in the Sth and previous reports. I join with, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), who made a similar complaint in regard to income taxation. I ask the Treasurer, to see that in future the reports of this department provide honourable members with the complete information formerly supplied. I am making an estimate which I think is nearly accurate, on the basis of the latest available figures, and, in my opinion, Â£400,000 of the total reduction of Â£445.000 will go into the pockets of the owners of estates worth not less than Â£25,000 each.",26
64,Mr GARDNER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Individua l owners?,27
65,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Some would be individuals and others companies. The 10 per cent, reduction alone will mean that, to 75 taxpayers with estates of over Â£100,000 in value there will be reductions of approximately Â£1,000 each, 25 taxpayers with estates of over Â£200,000 value will get reductions of approximately Â£1,900 each, and five taxpayers with estates valued at over Â£500,000 will each receive reductions amounting to about Â£3,500. That cannot be justified. Many of. these landowners are sitting down on large areas of land that could well be cut up, and some of it is suitable for intense cultivation. By not utilizing their lands to the full they are driving the sturdy sons of farmers far back into the bush. I could take honourable members to portions of the State of Victoria with which I am familar, and 1 could show them the broad acres of the Western plains on which sheep are running, although the land could be well used for agriculture. Men born on the land, and anxious to establish homes there, have been forced to take up selections down at Otway and Beech forest. After 20 years or more of heart-breaking toil, most of them have had to abandon that country, with their hearts broken and their little bit of capital gone. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of land alongside railways, where there is a good rainfall-lan d in every way suitable for cultivation, but not available because of the ring fence of the squatter. That is one reason why I feel so strongly upon this question. I want to see increased production, and I am anxious to see the sons of farmers and future arrivals in this country comfortably settled on the land. I want to see more provided for them. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) advocated certain reforms and pointed out, as have other honourable members, that there are producers working long hours in the back blocks who are receiving less than the basic wage. I know many of them.",27
66,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"There is no doubt about that, particularly in the dairying industry.",27
67,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Yes , and if the Commonwealth Government came to their aid with bounties and assistance in other directions, they would still be deprived of the full benefit to which they are entitled. I would go to the full limit to assist these people to get the full reward for their labour and a return commensurate with that paid to others. But what would be the result? Land values would increase and the land monopolists who hold large areas would demand higher rents, or sell their land for sub-divisional purposes at greatly enhanced prices. Years ago beautiful rich land iD the Western District of Victoria ar,d other rich districts was leased at small rentals, and was carrying perhaps one sheep to the acre and sometimes less. Later improvements came along. Butter factories and creameries were established in suitable places, refrigerator space was provided on overseas ships to carry their produce across the seas to the markets of the world, and instead of having gluts during good seasons with butter being sold here at 3d. to 6d. a lb., we had a steady market all the year round, and the butter industry was successfully established. But who is reaping most of the benefit of the improvements that have been effected?",27
68,Mr MCGRATH,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The landholder.,27
69,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The major portion of the profit has gone to the landholder. I could mention the names of numerous squatters who have made fortunes, not because of their own efforts but owing to community effort. Their land values have been increased owing to the improvements produced by the brains of scientific men, and because of the hard toil of the men and women and even children, who have made slaves of themselves on dairy farms. These things have to be stopped, and before bounties are paid on butter and other products, an effort should be made to stabilize land values. I do not wish to support legislation which would assist in ruining anyone, or to drag down land values. But I would prevent landowners reaping the benefit of subsidies, or of other people's toil.",27
70,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That is a generalization.,28
71,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It is not. In respect of every industry we were out to assist, we should be well justified in saying that the value of the land should be pinned where it is was at the time that assistance was proposed.",28
72,Mr GULLETT,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Would the honourable member apply the same principle to secondary industries ?,28
73,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I would apply it wherever advantage was being taken of the assistance given. I would say flb the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) that if the party to which I belong were in power and we had the constitutional authority, there would not be' a duty given to a secondary industry without the right to check their profits and see that they did not take fair toll of it. I would not make any distinction between primary and secondary industries. I would not show enmity or favouritism towards either. I wish to see our mauufacturing, agricultural, and pastoral industries marching successfully along side by side, and their prosperity being shared by those engaged in such industries. They should receive full reward for their labour, whatever they may be, and not be allowed to take advantage of the beneficience of the Government or of the activities of the people. That is why I am advocating the retention of the land tax. Apart from the fact that the tax gives to the community a portion of the value that the community has given to the land, it has also an economic value. It will assist to burst up large estates and give an opportunity to the men of this country to produce wealth from the land on which they were born instead of being driven to the cities to eke out an existence. It is because of those reasons that I move That all the words after "" That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" in view of the grave and expanding obligations of the Commonwealth manifested by an adverse trade balance and increasing loan expenditure, and of the urgent need for the subdivision of large estates to increase production, and to meet the keen demand for land, reduction of land taxation is not justifiable.""",28
74,Mr EODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Wannon) [12 56] I welcome the bill in so far as it affords some relief to land taxpayers; but there are many directions in which I hope it will be improved when the committee, stage is reached. With that reservation I welcome it as an instalment of. longdeferred justice to an important section of the Australian people. Of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) is, to use a colloquialism, ut his top on the question of land taxation, and it was the memory of some of his, may I say, flamboyant speeches made in this House and in the country that impelled me to direct a few remaiks to him during the debate on the Income Tax Assessment Bill, particularly in regard to the incidence of income and land taxation upon the land-holder. Prior to the last election the honourable member marched up and down the country telling the people of the wrongdoings of the land-holders and particularly of Mr Edmund. Jowett. Their actions, which he regarded with suspicion, became a political weapon in the hands of the honourable member, and he must have been somewhat dumbfounded when the court declared that Mr Edmund Jowett was right and the honourable member was wrong. The subject had, however, served his political purpose. In regard to the principle of land settlement and land holding, strange as it may seem, I agree with the Leader of the Oppositionalthough we arrive at the same conclusion from different angles-whe n he says that if we are to have progressive development it is a sound principle that as our populaiton increases the needs of rural Australia in the matter of land settlement must be met. The greatest safeguard of a nation is the settlement of a great band of prosperous yeomanry upon the soil. I have always said that we should be determined to make rural occupation-lan d settlement-the blue riband life of the nation. It is gradually becoming subordinated to the extreme and excessive demands of city dwellers of Australia, and our potential wealth and secondary industries upon the landholding is daily becoming more precarious and less remunerative. I agree with the honourable member when he says that the making available of la'nd suitable for intensive production and agriculture, and even for closer pastoral settlement by the application of scientific methods such as top dressing for pasture and other improvements, will be the means of settling a larger rural population than we have today. Therefore, I am not championing the cause of those who desire to hold exclusively large areas suitable for subdivision, whether for agricultural or other purposes. But there are other considerations which must not be overlooked. There are, however, vast areas of land, mostly in the back country, which, owing to climatic conditions and precarious seasonal vicissitudes, are quite unsuitable for subdivision, and which can be held profitably only in large areas by those who have sufficient resources at their command to withstand the dire happenings of a succession of bad seasons. It is impossible for a person with limited capital to take up large areas of unsuitable land and brave the known conditions which prevail in those areas. I do not share the views of the honourable member on that point. It is an easy matter to tax a man off the land, but it is not easy to put him on. From the time when the principal act was first introduced I have always felt that it was not born in an atmosphere of justice. As the Commonwealth Parliament had not the power to deal with land and land settlement, it was intended from the outset to be a penal tax. At the inception of federation the control of land and land settlement, as well as all activities associated with the land, was deliberately left to the State Parliaments. The Commonwealth had no power to determine land settlement policies or the conditions [102] governing the holding of land. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has apparently never thought of an alternative to penal taxation for forcing land settlement. When the need arises, there is an alternative which rests with the States in the form of legislation providing for compulsory acquisition, which is at present in operation in some of the States. Reference has been made by - the honourable member to a nation hungry for land, and to only one in every 1,000 applicants for certain blocks of Crown land offered by ballot or Land Board, being successful. If the honourable member will refer to pastoralists' associations and land agents in all the States, he will be informed that he can obtain as much alienated good land as he wants at reasonable rates. At present, land Can be obtained at reasonable rates because many land-holders who have ""given their labour and that of their families have not received a return comparable with that received by those engaged in secondary industries. This is not a. land-locked country. There may be certain districts in which large areas are held by wealthy land-holders.",28
75,Unknown,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m.,29
76,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable gentleman stated that Australia was a country in which people were unable to obtain access to the land for settlement, and that there was, in consequence, retardation of national progress, production and development. There is, however, in every State an abundance of land available for purchase, and most of it may be had on easy terms. These holdings consist, for the most part, of-improved lands and ready-made farms, of which young men may take possession without a great expenditure of time or money upon development, and begin straight away to carry on the chosen occupation. Confirmation of this may be obtained by any one who cares to .make investigation in any township or centre in any State in the Commonwealth. Land values have received a check, and land is available at reasonable prices on reasonable terms. I repeat, however, that if the nation is to progress and population increase, land must be made available as required to meet t'ne growing needs of this country. It is, after all, to the great lauded interests to which we have to look for the funds with which to develop the secondary industries of our country. I am one who endeavours to put first things first, and I place it as an unassailable truth that the success of Australian economic life today depends primarily on the success of the rural 'industries. This is much more sa in Australia thau ... in the . older countries which have become the world's workshops and have a great distributing trade in which industrialism plays a large part in providing the world's commodities. But Australia, for generations to come, must depend for its development on primary industries. Anything which tends to weaken the primary industries is reflected very quickly in our secondary industries, as we find in this year of short production, when already unemployment is increasing in all the States, and a condition of financial disorder has been brought about. One would assume from the remarks of the honourable gentleman that Australia had not faced this great question of land settlement in a bold and comprehensive manner, but actually the reverse is the position. If one takes the trouble to go into the historical records of Australia one will see that there were various phases of laud settlement, starting in the old days of what might be called ""squattages,"" which represent a rather romantic, though passing, phase in the rural life of Australia. They represented, for the most part, the handling by adventurous and daring men of small flocks of imported stock, for which, at the time, no preparation had been made, no large estates built iip, and no water or pastures provided. There was practically no'market for any of the products other than wool, and the price for that was very low. The practice was to boil down the carcasses for the bit of tallow which might be obtained. But we march on from those days of squattages when the foundations of the States were laid. ' There was a feeling on the part of. our increasing population that they were not able to get sufficient land for homes, and a great forward movement was taken by the statesmen of the day. They gave to the then rising generation the power to go out and select from the squattages which then were the Crown lands of if r . Rodgers. the country their holdings in their own chosen localities, there to put. in their pegs, and found their future homes. They gave the most liberal terms, requiring no deposits in many cases, or, at any rate, not'more than the payment of the survey fees. Those were difficult times; many of the selectors, after leaving the mark of their labour on their holdings, were' finally forced to abandon them. Those were hard times. Some, however, struggled through by means of the unpaid toil of their families, and their capacity to work and wait, until finally they became the foundation of Australia's yeomanry of today. Now we have reached a further stage, and scattered throughout every 4 State there is a magnificent array of rural homes owned by those who have fought adversity, who have won out, and established the primary industries of the Commonwealth. They have sought out the lands most suitable for their purposes, and it has taken no act of Parliament, no act of compulsory acquisition, to secure the settlement of these areas. The judgment of the men themselves, and the pressure of economic conditions,- forced the settlement. The honourable gentleman will know that, in the districts with which he is most familiar, the Tower Hill district of Victoria, no act of Parliament was necessary to procure settlement. That land is now worth over Â£100 an acre, but the force of economic circumstances was suflicient to clear it of forest, and to make it rich and fruitful. In no age can there be a perfect system. Australia is not the home of landlordism; it is the home of people who came mostly from other countries to avoid the curse of landlordism. In the main, we are a great body of freeholders who believe in the right of a man to have some spot on earth that is his very own; a spot upon which he may set up his citadel, and upon which no one can set foot to desecrate his home. That is the fundamental belief of our people. Now I come to the question that perplexes the honourable gentleman, the question of land values. He says that he would mark as with a javelin the ruling prices of land today, and would not allow them to advance beyond their present point. That is a human impossibility.",29
77,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"May I re-state position? I said that if we are to subsidize any industry, we ought first to stabilize the price of land in that industry.",31
78,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Tes , by fixing a mark beyond which it would not be allowed to go. The ideal valuer has not yet arrived upon earth. The man wbo thinks he can fix a stable price for land is a dreamer of dreams. Take this very act which seeks to tax the unimproved value of land, and contrast it with similar acts in the States. In Victoria, for example, the Parliament did not agree on the same formula as our federal act for the taxation of unimproved land values. If there is such a thing as a definite basis for determining the unimproved value of land, we ought to be able to fix upon a formula defining it.",31
79,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It is laid down in the act/,31
80,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,But it is laid down differently in Victoria. If the Crown cannot lay down a formula which will be the same in any two States or the Commonwealth Land Tax Act that is only an additional proof of what I have stated: that it is impossible to fix definitely the value of land.,31
81,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It merely proves that one of these systems is obsolete.,31
82,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I have had a good deal of experience of land selling and land financing, and I know that it is the most difficult thing in the world to fix the value of land. Some say let us fix upon its productive value, but what is the productive value of land? One man will grow wool, and another will grow corn or some other commodity. Therefore, there is no such thing as fixing a value that is not subject to change. Then, again, we may have a serious depression in the value of products. Probably never before in Australia were there such wonderful seasons and high prices for primary, products as during the period of the war and immediately following. At. beginning of the war there was a drought, but for ten or twelve years after that there was a period of unprecedented rural prosperity, with prices for rural products at a level never previously dreamt of. The effect of this was that there was a my wave of prosperity throughout Australia. Values of land rose in sympathy with that wonderful fund created by the prosperous conditions prevailing. Many people bought land, sold it again, and bought more, and, in many cases, the price they paid was not the true value of the land, but the mark of their capacity to purchase. Their capacity to purchase often dominated them when they desired to acquire land on which to settle their families. In considering the value of land, we must remember that there is something in human nature which makes men dearly love to build some reserve, and there is ho class of investment so favoured for this purpose as investment in 'land. The only - form of investment which approaches it for popularity in this connection is investment in the country's consols. We cannot, therefore, lay down any hard and fast rule that will determine values, because they fluctuate; according to the season, the output, prices of produce, and the demand for land. I have never been attracted by the federal land tax. Judging it by any test that may be applied to it, it, it cannot be regarded as just taxation. It is not based on any spirit of fairness. First of all, it is the only form in which wealth is taxed in Australia, and even the Labour party has abandoned all its ideas of imposing a wealth tax. Then, why should a portion of the land of Australia be subjected to land taxation and not the rest of it? If it be an equitable system of raising revenue to impose a land tax, it should be levied without exemption, but when the Commonwealth Labour party introduced its land tax it, so to speak, gilded the pill by exempting from the payment of the tax any person owning land whose unimproved value was less than Â£5,000. By that exemption owners of suburban cottages and all small land-holders, in the aggregate representing a great voting and political fighting power, were exthe empted, leaving the rest of the landholders of Australia, numbering fewer than 20,000 persons, to provide the whole of the revenue which the Commonwealth was to derive from its land tax.",31
83,Mr WATKINS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member is not fair in his reference, because he is well aware of the reason for the imposition of the Commonwealth land tax.",32
84,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I shall state' my case in my own way. One reason for the exemption was that a great band of potential voters would not be antagonized. One reason for this tax we have beard mentioned from time to time is that the revenue it would produce was required to build up an Australian Navy.,32
85,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The main reason for the imposition of the tax was to break up large estates.,32
86,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It was also said that the tax was imposed for the purpose of breaking up large estates; but other reasons were given.,32
87,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I gave two reasons.,32
88,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Let us take the first reason advanced by the honourable member. What constitutional right has this Parliament to attempt to break up large estates?,32
89,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The High Court has decided that it has the right to do so.,32
90,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The High Court has decided that the Commonwealth Parliament has the right to impose taxation for the services of the Commonwealth, but in framing the Constitution all quesfrom tions relating to land-lan d settlement, land tenure, and so forth-were left to the States, and to the States alone.",32
91,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,But some of the States will not take steps to break up large estates.,32
92,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I like that statement! What has been done in New South Wales, where for years Labour Governments were in control of affairs.",32
93,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,But there is an Upper House in New South Wales.,32
94,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That cock will not fight. There is also an Upper House in Victoria.,32
95,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,But the Victorian land tax is not worth talking about.,32
96,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"At any rate, there is a land tax in Victoria, and, furthermore, the land legislation of that State provides for the compulsory acquisition of land for closer settlement purposes. dreds of thousands of acres have been acquired under an act that contains a provision for compulsory purchase for soldier land settlement. It was not the intention of the Commonwealth Constitution that the land.tax should be imposed, for the purpose of breaking up large estates. The tax itself is not only a tax on the wealth of the man who owns the land; it is also a tax on the borrowed money invested in the land, without being, a tax on the mortgagee who lends it. Speaking broadly, it may be said that the amount of money advanced on land in Australia is 50 per cent, of its value. We have, therefore, a wealth tax in the form of an emasculated land tax, specially designed to fit the case of 20,000' people, and leave free the mortagees,. who may have lent up to 50 per cent, of the value of the holdings of these people. It is not only a tax on the capital value of the people who own the land, but it is also a tax on the borrowed money invested in lands, with the exception of the exemption of Â£5,000. Mr Scullin.,-Will the honourable member advocate the extension of the tax to the mortgagee?",32
97,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"What I am claiming is that the Commonwealth land tax is really a tax on wealth that exempts the rich mine-owner who draws wealth the bowels of the earth; the shipowner whose ships sail^on the coast of * Australia and are given protection against overseas competition; the manufacturer, with the exception of his factory; the bond-holder, and to some extent,, the rich money lender. If it is a right principle to impose a tax on wealth, it is inequitable to pick out 20,000 people to pay it, unless it has been conceived in the spirit of a penal tax to carry out the purpose referred to by the honourable member for Yarra. In my opinion, judging it by any test we may apply to it, that legislation is unworthy of an Australian Parliament. I regret that the Government's instalment of relief is so small. It is not my desire that large landholders should be exempt from taxation. They ought to pay taxation for the privileges' they enjoy. But so should every one else: those who lend Hun- money on mortgage, the bond-holders who hold their bonds in banks, the manufacturers whose goods are on the shelves awaiting distribution, the rich importing firms and the .ship-owners. If the principle of taxation of wealth is sound, why have we this one form of taxation which taxes, not only the equity which a man has in his land, but also the very money he has borrowed to enable him to hold it? The principle of the Commonwealth land tax tested in every way is unsound, and its perpetuation is a reflection on the intelligence of the people of Australia; likewise on their courage, as they are apparently not willing to get rid of it. We should ascertain who are benefiting by the expenditure of the people's money, and then levy taxation on them for the prosperity they enjoy by income tax according to their incomes. The honourable member for Yarra referred with a sneer of contempt to the legislation recently enacted which exempted from land taxation our western lessees. After all, those lessees were not holders of valuable Crown lands; they were merely lessees of doubtful areas. Had they not put their improvements on that country it would have been infested with rabbits, noxious weeds, and wild dogs, and the Crown lands would have been not only useless, but also a menace and curse to the country. These lessees have done - a great service to the nation in tackling those far back lands, which for the main part are the least dependable in Australia. They are mostly in drought areas, and the living conditions on them are most unfavorable. As the honourable member for Eiverina (Mr Killen) has interjected, they have ruined many pioneers.",32
98,Mr MCGRATH,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,In those circumcants in such stances the lessees would not have tax.,33
99,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is not the spirit in which we ought to impose taxation. We do not propose to ruin a first and then let him go free from the payable ment of taxation. We want to give men every encouragement to go on the and not pick the in out specially for taxaBut tion while exempting from such taxation their richer brothers who live in the cities in greater comfort and enjoy the privihustings. leges conferred by the public money upon the development of Australia. have beard a great deal about the high social standard of Australia, but in the. main it is not enjoyed by the great majority of those who take on land settlement. The great majority of those who have settled in the western area of New South Wales, in Central Australia, and in the northern portions of this continent, are far removed from pleasant social conditions'. The only things they enjoy are .the happiness of their family life and any feeling of satisfaction they may have in knowing that they are playing an important part in the development of our great public asset. I have looked at this legislation from every aspect. It is not the Commonwealth's task to break up large estates. The States have ample power to undertake that task. In every sense the people of the States are those who ought to control land settlement. They know their own requirements better than we do, and most of them are endeavouring to grapple with the problem. The honourable member for Yarra has drawn attention to a few landboard ballots for isolated lots which have been made available. From time to time the Crown combs over its lands, seeking areas suitable for settlement, and when a lot is found it is offered at a reward price to any man. who is willing to settle on it. As unoccupied land, it has been bringing in very little return, and consequently the upset price placed upon it is generally sufiicicntly small to draw a lot of applicants. The man who gets the block is just like the man who wins a lottery. He is lucky because immediately he becomes possessed of a good equity. It is a wonder there are not more applicases. In some to pay of the States there is no longer a great deal of Crown land available, and consequently we have to fall back on the our alienated lands. With the honourable man member for Yarra, I say that when suit 1 land, alienated or otherwise, is not available, it must land be made available to the people. it is for the States to make it available. State members are elected for the purpose. They present their case on the They tell the people how they spent propose to deal with land settlement We problems, and the people entrust them with the task of doing it. I am afraid that in our energy we have overreached ourselves. We are trying to do the work of the States. Land settlement is certainly a responsibility that should be left to the States. The founders of our Constitution intended that, because they entrusted the matter to the States. I am pleased to' see that under this bill a board has been appointed to deal with land values. When the value placed upon land by the commissioner is regarded as excessive, a board is to be appointed to deal with it, and I hope that that board's decision will be final. I do not believe that a judge who has been (trained in law, and whose position has Ibeen one of isolation and non-contact with the land or with rural industries, should determine land values. I hope that the iboard will consist of sound practical .men, who know something of land holding and the use of land. If there should ""be a period in which land values have suddenly gone up, I hope that they will not go round the country taking the - sales as a basis of valuation. If a man determines to get a block for his son in a locality adjoining his own holding, and is willing to pay through the nose for it, I hope that the board will not be a party to a - system whereby the taxation commissioner will follow such - sale and fix the value of the land according to the price paid for it. Tliat should not be done. There should be a good margin between the taxable value and the market value of unimproved ""land. There is no force in existence that - can keep values up at a time when the money market is depressed.",33
100,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Excep t a good war.,",34
101,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"On e of the most f r u it f u l sources of depression in land values is the existence of periods of - financial depression. When credit is withdrawn the weak holder is unable to hang on. He has to sell, and sacrifice, and it takes very few enforced sales in a locality to affect land values. Land valuers should not take cognizance cf either those periods .or boom periods.",34
102,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,What does the honourable member think of the suggestion that there should be a right of appeal against the decision of the board?,34
103,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It is advisable to leave that matter until we get to the committee stage. This country, when it settled its returned soldiers, gave forced or artificial settlement a trial. The Victorian Soldier Land Settlement Board did splendid work in purchasing land mostly at reasonable values, in sub-dividing it, and in nursing the soldiers in the early years when they were placed on the land. In the main, it bought well, and had an overwhelming regard for the welfare of the soldiers as against the vendors. The results of that artificial settlement have proved that it was impracticable and it has been, in the main, unsuccessful. When a man is settled on land of which he owes 100 per cent, of the value, and when similar conditions apply to his stock and implements, it is practically impossible for him to make a success. Those conditions were not faced by the earlier settlers or upon those who were in the . business with their families prior to launching out on their own. Such men begin by gaining knowledge from association with practical farmers; then proceed steadily with the assistance of their families, and, with the credit granted by pastoral companies, auctioneering firms, machinery business merchants and the like, usually make good. They are in auction quite a different category from the unfortunate returned soldier settlers. Frequently the returned soldier did not know his work, he was just married, and had probably cashed his gratuity bond which, with his other money, had been absorbed by the purchase'of furniture and establishment costs. The task of settling on the land in Australia is not a rosy one. The seasons impose a considerable burden which, coupled with economic conditions, make the undertaking exceedingly precarious. It is certainly not as attractive as many other undertakingswhich escape the wealth tax which this measure imposes. Undoubtedly, land settlement is a difficult problem. It involves the balancing of bad years with good, and it needs a ,very high courage. I hope that the spirit which prompted the land tax will not be persisted in, and that something of a more equitable nature than this bill will be introduced. I shall reserve the remainder of my remarks until the committee stage.",34
104,Mr CHAELTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Hunter) [2.52] - I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) on his very able speech on this measure. It indicated how painstaking he is. Not only on this, bnt on numerous other occasions, the honourable member bus rendered yeoman service to Australia. The honourable, member for Wannon, in the course of a good speech from his point of view, found it. necessary to make an attack on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition",35
105,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Not an attack.,35
106,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,T deemed it tc be so.,35
107,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I assure the honourable member that it was not intended to be an attack.,35
108,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It was calculated to cause people to think that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had no justification for the attitude which he adopted some years ago in reference to Crown leaseholds. It will be remembered that at that time a very large sum of money was owing to Australia by leaseholders, and an endeavour was afoot tb relieve them of their obligations. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been able, for the first time in this Parliament, to indicate that the Prime Minister was favourably inclined at that time towards making the then contemplated legislation retrospective. The right honourable gentleman had made a statement to that e,ffect in Queensland, and he probably thought that it would not appear in the southern press. Hitherto the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) has always been credited with the desire to make that legislation retrospective. We now find that the Prime Minister .threatened to tender his resignation if his views were not adopted, plainly indicating that he was endeavouring to assist a body of individuals who had consistently omitted to pay taxes which were due to the Crown. Mr KTLI.EN - That is not fair. Only a few had evaded the tax.",35
109,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member has a perfect right to place his own construction on the matter. honourable member for Wannon slaimed that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went round the country making capital out of the incident. At that time il was stated that Mr Jowett owed the Commonwealth Treasury Â£77,000, and that a large sum was owing by a number of other Australian taxpayers. Those figures are authentic, having been taken from the official report of the Commissioner of Taxation. Surely, in the circumstances, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was justified in using them. That is what we are here for, and no charge, can be justifiably laid against the honourable member of having been unfair to those people. Mr Jowett appealed in June of 1926, That was after the incident of which the honourable member for Wannon complains occurred. Judge Rich decided that Mr Jowett was not entitled to pay the amount of tax charged against him. He valued the property at Â£376, although the rent, was Â£544 per annum. The Taxation Department will not accept that as a guide for all other taxation.",35
110,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It is scarcely right to traverse the judgment of the High Court.,35
111,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It is not the judgment of the. High Court, but of Judge Rich only. The honourable member for Wannon admitted that settlement is necessary, and that we should make land available as freely as possible. But the honourable member stated that climatic conditions in certain sections of Australia necessitated the granting of very large holdings. Surely the honourable member will not deny that, adjacent to many of our railway lines, land is not being put to its fullest use, notwithstanding favourable climatic conditions. Those who oppose the breaking up of such estates do so without justification. Mr M . CAMERON - That is the job of the States.",35
112,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It is not. This Parliament has contitutional powers enabling it to impose an adequate land tax, by which means large estates could be broken up. The honourable member for Wannon doubted Avhether we possessed that constitutional 1 power.",35
113,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The matter was decided! by the High Court.,35
114,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"^-I shall read an The extract from the report of the Royal Commission on Taxation,' published in 1923, at page 181C13. In 1911 the validity of the law was challenged before the High Court in what is known as the Osborne case. Two of the various grounds of objection taken to the Land Tax Assessment Act 1910 and the Land Tax Act 1910 were(2) That the Acts are not in substance an exercise of the taxing powers the Commonwealth, but an attempt to regulate the holding of land in the Commonwealth, which, it is contended, is extra vires the liament; and (3) That the acts, either together or separately, are in contravention section 55 of the Constitution. The court unanimously held that the act as a whole was valid. Sir Samuel Griffith then gave his views. That is evidence that the Commonwealth has the necessary power.",35

He went on to urge that land situation. should be made available at reasonable prices. Very few will claim that, land I can now be purchased at a reasonable price. Ever since the war the price land has increased, until today flated to an extraordinary degree. The result is that, when a man takes up such land, he is so burdened with the capital cost that he is almost sure to fail. Every week people are failing in their land settlement undertakings. The Commonwe wealth and State Governments have spent millions of pounds in settling soldiers on the land, but this Governavailable ment has had to write off huge amounts in consequence of the failure of many the schemes. Will it be suggested that the projects have failed because the were incompetent? Many of them were thoroughly experienced. The whole trouble is that the land was too exa pensive.",36
117,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,In many cases that .was not so.,36
118,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It may not have been so in a few cases; but, generally the speaking, it was so. When the price land is too high, it is impossiblefor people to make a decent living on it. We shall have to face this position shortly, for something more will have to be done to assist our soldiers who settled on the land in various parts the Commonwealth. Until the price land is reduced to normal, new settleholders ments in our rural areas must fail. The honourable member also had a good deal to say about Crown lands. Every time the Crown invites applications for land of there are too many applicants for it, by thousands.

The great majority of the people who apply for of this land are genuine land-seekers. Some of them have been trying to obtain blocks for many years, but have been unsuccessful.

What need is a sufficiently large population here to create a good local market, but that can only be secured by making land in reasonable quantities and at reasonable prices. Australia has a larger of. area of undeveloped land than any other country in the world, with one' or two men exceptions, but it appears to me that we should be better off with a smaller territory more densely settled than with large territory sparsely settled, for the cost of government would then be considerably less. The honourable member for Wannon had a good deal to say about the relative merits of freehold and leasehold sysof tems. It has been proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that leasehold is, to all intents and purposes, as good as freehold. In fact, many persons prefer it, for it has proved to be a better speculaare tion for companies, banks, and indiof viduals. The honourable member knows of very well that in many districts the of large freehold estates lease their land out to tenants at exorbitant Land Tax [7 DECEMBER, 1927.] rates.

140,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Yes , and they did their work well; but seven or eight years have elapsed since the war, and our financial responsibilities are now even greater than they were when the war ended.

Mr. CHABLTON - That is true, but many of them are still suffering. urge that the time has arrived when we are not justified in further reducing the direct taxation that falls) on the privileged few. If I owned land of the unimproved value of Â£25,000, I should consider myself to be in a more comfortable position that the ordinary citizen, and I sliould recognize that I was entitled to contribute, in proportion to my wealth, to the cost of Government. The amendment by the honourable member for Yarra has the whole-hearted support of the Opposition.  oppose the amendment, and I may incidentally mention that I am not particularly enamoured of the bill. I am inclined to agree almost entirely with the remarks of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Eodgers). If the Federal Government .should meddle in land taxation, the object being, according to the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to break up large estates, the tax should be imposed on unimproved land. That would tend to bring about a subdivision of large unimproved holdings. That would be a machinery bill, and not really a taxing measure. The greatest crime, commercially and financially, is to further load the people on the laud who are raising the wealth necessary to maintain the credit of this country. To-day the land-owner is taxed in three main ways, directly/ and he is taxed indirectly in many other ways. He escapes none of the taxes. He, above all, bears perhaps 97 per cent, of the taxation levied through the customs, particularly if he is an exporter, because he is die only person who cannot pass any of it on. He has to pay high railway freights, because the railway employees under our arbitration' system, must be paid high wages. He 'is required to pay income tax like everybody else; but he pays a little more than the others because his income is irregular. In some years, such as the present season, he may have no they income at all; but under our graduated system of taxation, he may have to pay more direct income tax than the ordinary individual. Then he has to pay a land tax that is not imposed on any other section of the community. His land is capital, and therefore this is a capital tax I in this way. He is taxed upon the machinery by which he earns his income, although his income is taxed in the same way 'as the income of other people. I am referring to particularly valuable land - that - has perhaps been held by wealthy persons for generations. We should look by and large at the jnar* on the land, and compare his percentage of increase of taxation with that of those engaged in other industries and professions. The agriculturist today is manifestly oppressed, otherwise the wheat . industry would be advancing instead of. declining.' Is 'that a case for furr ' ther taxation? ' Qf course the Treasurer is ' ostensibly reducing the; land "", tax by lO jje'r' cent., but this House must""'' not imagine','that, the man on ithe' land'. is to get that reduction. The department has men all over Australia reassessing, the unimproved value of landL As has already been pointed out, the' present high value of land hasbee& brought about by the increased prices of wool and wheat since the war. At a time when the farmer is getting little encouragement, the Taxation Department assesses his property at a value that is not inherent in it. I have with me a report supplied by the Taxation Department and signed by the Deputy Commissioner of Federal Taxation in Western Australia, and in it is a schedule showing the old and new values in various districts. The acreage in Bruce Rock is 816,350. The old unimproved value was Â£279,020, and the new unimproved value is Â£S18,433. In the face of those figures the Treasurer says thaj^he is giving the farmers a 10 per cent, reduction! is a little bit of the Hebrew in that. The - acreage in Broomehill is 279,122. The old unimproved value was Â£180,658, and the new unimproved value is Â£247,428. In Quairading the acreage is 462,456. The old unimproved value was Â£301,265, and the new unimproved value is Â£471,486. That increased value is entirely due to the inflated prices of wool and wheat, and not to any legislation passed by this Parliament or the State Parliaments. The present high prices are not likely to last. Those holding land may consider themselves to be in possession of a greater asset than before, but the land is not producing any more, and its enhanced value is nothing more nor. less than the means of placing on additional tax upon them. The farmers are taxed in every way. They have to bear, in addition to the direct taxes levied - upon most people, the shire tax which helps to make the roads, and that is a very heavy impost upon them, the wheel tax and the vermin tax. Rural life is becoming uninteresting to the country people and they are nocking to the cities. The Treasurer declines to help them to develop their land in order that - they may profit from their labour. Extraordinary statements are made in this House by those honourable members .who do not own land, and do not know what it really means to go out to settle in the outback country. About sixteen or seventeen years ago my brother and I had the experience of taking up land which was considered to be unsafe because of the light rainfall. When I went there to inspect the land before selection, had I not been trained as a ""bushmari, I  should have been lost, and I suppose that the majority of honourable members, under similar circumstances, would have been lost iii the scrub and afraid to go near the place again. Western Australia at that time was, and is today, offering people every inducement to settle on the land. All the capital that could be raked up was put into the land to clear, fence, aud fertilize it in order to produce wealth, to improve the credit of this country, and to provide work for the railways and other means of transport. We want people to settle on the land, but this is not possible when our legislation provides for continual reThere valuations of land that are taking the last ounce of strength from our farmers. Not only is the farmer loaded with the protectionist policy of ' Australia, but the Taxation Department is trying to grab all his profits from his operations on the land. The Government of Western Australia seems to have been more reasonable. to the farmer in order to help him to develop his holding. If his income tax amounts to more than his land tax, he pays the income tax only and vice versa. The Federal Government is collecting both taxes and making no differentiation. The Taxation Department is not sympathetic even in its interpretation of the act. It has been said that it would pay the Government to give the land to the people in order that it may be developed; but we have paid for the land and developed it. I had this experience two years ago. I wanted a piece of Crown land adjoining my property to square up my fencing. That land was so useless in its natural state that its. freehold was sold to me at 5s. an acre. Last year the Taxation Department assessed the unimproved value of that land at 17s. 6d., for the simple reason that the valuer did not see the accumulation of stones and rubbish that had been taken off it at great expense, nor did he take account of other unseen improvement made also at great expense. The man on the land is not credited in his land tax assessment with his contributions to the upkeep of roads. He, and not the man in the city, has to pay for them. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) does not pay for the roads, at any rate, in my district. Because these roads are made and the land improved by the farmer, the Taxation Department takes the last penny from the man on the land, and that is calculated to discourage land settlement in this country. Treasurer has said that we-are to have a valuation every three years.",39
142,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The poor land-owners!  ""the consideration that is given hy honourable members opposite to the man outback. The Leader the Opposition (Mr Chariton) has said that primary and secondary in dustries should go hand in hand, and I agree with him ; but that is not the position today. The man on the land is groaning under the burden of secondary industries. If industries were going hand in hand, there would not be the adverse trade balance that exists today. If the Treasurer pursues his present policy and - extracts the last penny from the farmer, - our adverse balance will soon be three - or four times what it is today, and we shall then begin to realise that we have indeed killed the goose that laid the .golden eggs in this country. The Leader - of the Opposition also said that land was different from other assets, because its - existence was not due to the owner. - One buys property of any kiud as an in vestment, a means of earning a livelihood, and the most difficult livelihood to âget is that which comes from Mother Earth. If the Treasurer will consult the Commissioner of Taxation I am sure that be will be told that the bulk of the - direct taxation is paid, not by the wheat farmer, but by the manufacturers and - city merchants, which shows that the farmer is working for little if any profit. Although 90 per cent, of - the wealth that maintains the community is produced by the man on the land, he is just permitted a bread and water - existence so that he may continue his in. dustry and keep the country solvent. .ask the Treasurer to consider seriously the insertion of an amendment to provide that land used for the production of - wealth shall be exempt from land taxa- tion. That should accord with, the views - of honourable members opposite. Under -.the present law we definitely impose upon the man on the land two taxes that are not borne by anybody else in the community. I propose to show how unreasonable are some of the assessments of unThe improved values. What is known as "" the Captain Cook value"" of land is practically nil . Who really is responsible for the enhanced value that is given to certain land? The land I selected in Western Australia had no real value until I expended my money upon it . Until that time it would not carry three kan-. of garoos or two sheep over the whole area. The railway was already built, so it cannot he said that the value of the land was enhanced by Government expenditure. The Crown owned the land, and I bought it . We put the whole of our capital into it , and when we proved that it could be put to profitable use others desiring to follow our example set up an inquiry for land in the neighbourhood. In consequenece the land became more valuable than it was when I acquired it . B y so enhancing the value of that land I helped other citizens and the State, not myself. What benefit do I gain from the increment of values? If I continue to utilize it for wheat-growing that increased value will not help me at all, so why put a burden of taxation upon me in respect of a value created in accordance with public policy and the desire of the Government and the. people? The definition clause of the Land Tax Assessment Act defines "" unimproved value "" in relation to land as the capital sum which the fee simple of the land might be expected to realise if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements (if any) thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in .title had not been made. Several interpretations of that definition have been given. The High Court has heldI That the unimproved value of land may b< ascertained by comparison' with the prices ob tained for similar land in the neighbourhood in a state of nature. The mere sale price of land in a districi is no index to its value unless one takei - into consideration the reasons that go verned the payment of that price. Tht price might have been excessively high not because of the merits of the land, but because a father wanted to buy an adjacent block for his son, or a land holder desired to acquire an adjoining property. Special consideration should be given to those facts when valuing property for land tax purposes. The High Court also heldTliat the word "" improvements "" in the nition of the term ""unimproved value"" includes sueh operations of man upon the land since it has ceased to be Crown land, the benefit of sueh continues at the date of valuation, and operations of nature which are only effectual by reason of what man has done, as have contributed to bring about the present enhancement of the value of the land. That phase is not sufficiently taken into account when valuations are being made. The valuer visits a property that is fully improved, and asks the owner the cost of the fencing, clearing, dam sinking, &c. Upon this information he tries to estimate the value of the actual improvements done on the property. Then he arrives at the unimproved value by taking the improvements from local sales. The department does not allow, however, for the fees that have been paid to roads boards or the cost of root picking for a number of years after the first clearing of the land, or the cost of destroying noxious weeds and poison plants, and the interest paid on the capital expenditure. These outgoings should be taken into consideration wheu endeavouring to arrive at the unimproved value of a property. There is another injustice that affects the people of Western Australia particularly. When the goldfields commenced to decline, not because the gold was exhausted, but because high costs made the winning of it no longer profitable, many people previously interested in mining turned their to the land. Some who occupied city positions selected land, as they were entitled to do, and entered into a form of partnership with brothers or other relatives - One man worked the property, and the other provided from his earnings the capital with which to carry out improvements. That was a most economical arrangement. The two brothers thus associated raised more taxable income, developed the land more .rapidly, were able to buy more efficient  machinery, and produced more per unit. But for purposes of taxation the department treats the two brothers as one unit, and allows only one deduction. The Treasurer and the Crown Law Department should be able to frame an amendment which - would give relief in such bona fide cases. I recognize that certain defi- partnerships are formed for the purpose of evading taxation, but there should be provision for honest, genuine partnerships of the kind I have mentioned. When each partner has individual rights and a family to maintain, both should be taxed as individuals. Instead the department combines their holdings and brings them within the scope of the Commonwealth land tax. I ask the Treasurer to give the fullest consideration to the amendment I have suggested, which I am confident would encourage and help the development of the land.",41
143,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Dalley) [3.57] The honourable ""member for Porrest (Mr. Prowse) has been arguing on false premises. He has painted a most doleful picture of the conditions of wheat-growers and agriculturists generally, because of the imposts of all kinds placed upon them, and particularly because of the oppressive manner in which this form of taxation is applied to them. He has spoken frequently of the man on the land. Surely the honourable member overlooked the fact that the Commonwealth Jand tax does not in the main apply to such people.  said were that a couple of small men working in partnership are heavily taxed by the department.",42
144,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That happens in particular cases to which attention should be paid by the Treasurer. But the main attention burden of the honourable member's argument was that the man on the land was singled out for double, treble, and quadruple taxation, and he said that this land tax is particularly unjust because of its effect upon agriculture. If the honourable member believes this taxation to have that effect, he should be more specific. I do not believe that one in a hundred wheat-growers who work their own farms is subject to Commonwealth land tax. Including all wheat-growers, whether working their own farms or> employing others to do it, not 1 per cent, would be subject to the tax. The tax applies generally to large land-holders. It is true that it applies to the pastoralist; but even in respect of him the honourable member's argument ignores the underlying principle of legislation of this character.  must be speaking of the period before the re-valuations.",42
145,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I am speaking particularly of wheat-growers; but, extending my argument to agriculturists generally, I doubt if there is one farm in a hundred of a sufficiently high unimproved value to be liable to the Commonwealth land tax.",43
146,Mr BELL,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,What does the honourable member mean by farmers working their own farms?,43
147,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I distinguish between the men who work their own farms and those who merely own farms which' others work for them. I do not call myself an agriculturist or a farmer, because I own a farm and employ somebody else to work it. There are plenty of cheque-book farmers; presumably the honourable member for Forrest was not pleading for farmers who live in the cities and employ others to work their properties. When he spoke of the struggling man on the land he must be assumed to have been referring to the man who really is struggling on the land, the man who is working his farm, and is a producer in the real sense of the term. In those cases there is not 1 per cent., or a fraction of 1 per cent, subject to the Commonwealth land tax. The class of which the honourable member for Wannon spoke-the large land-owners-ough t not to receive special concessions from o the Commonwealth Government. I know there are pastoralists who have done useful pioneering work for the community. For that they are"" entitled to the of the community and of this Parliament; but when he speaks of the pastoralists to whom this legislation applies in its general effect, I say that among them are many who are not, and never were, pioneers. There are pioneers still in the pastoral industry, and all honour to them, but 99 of every 100 in the pastoral industry in Australia at the present time are not pioneers in the sense in which the honourable member spoke. A great deal of our pastoral land at the present time is held by pastoral and land companies, many of them with absentee shareholders. Ninety-nine out of every 100 of the large pastoralist lessees-at any rate, in New South Wales and Queensland-ar e men who not only have never done any pioneering work, but have done no work of any kind themselves on the land; they have been investors and capitalists. I do not say that they are not entitled to a just return from their investments; that is another matter altogether. But the argument offered against the Land Tax Act by the honourable member for Wannon was that land taxation ought not to be imposed on these men because of their pioneering efforts. He drew a most moving picture of the struggles of the pioneers in pastoral districts, and put forward the argument that many of these areas would be waste land today but for the work"" of the pioneers. That may be true in some cases; but does he claim that the woolgrowing districts of western New South Wales and Queenslandwould be deserts but for the work of the present pastoral lessees ?  tion.",43
148,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"If today we had men who had risen to prosperity after a life of toil on the land, men who had endured the risks and disabilities of the pioneer, and it was proposed to impose this tax upon them in the evening of their lives it might indeed be called an oppressive measure.",43
149,Mr FOSTEB,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I believe there are more absentee pioneers in Queensland than in all the other States put together ?,43
150,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I believe we have respect- in Queensland a great many absentee owners of land. I do not believe that one in 100 of the people who originally took up the land are in possession of it now. Companies have been formed to take over the pastoral areas which were formerly owned by individuals. Whether leaseholder or freeholder, you will find that the present taxpayer is not the man who did the pioneering work. I am not saying that the present occupiers are not doing useful work. They may have invested their capital, and it may be necessary to retain that capital to continue the industry. But the argument that this legislation should not apply, because of the pioneering efforts of the men on the land, carries no weight.",43
151,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Does the honourable member think that a man should be doubly taxed? Is not, income taxation sufficient ?",44
152,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I do not think that anybody should be doubly taxed, but then I do not think that the Land Tax Act places double taxation on auy one. The land tax is justified on the grounds so succinctly stated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin). It was intended in the first place to prevent the growth of land monopoly in Australia. It was intended to make it unprofitable to hold large areas of land idle, or to hold it out of its most effective iise, and it was intended to secure to the community a portion of the community-created value of the land, the increment which increases year by year. Further, it was intended to be a revenue measure. It was intended first to prevent monopolies, then to force large areas into closer settlement, and to get for the community a portion of the community-created values. That is the justification for the tax. The longer it is in operation, provided it is not meddled with, the less hardship it will impose on the holders of land. As land continues to be held, the burden of the tax will apply to those who ought to bear it. It does not operate harshly against anyone against whom it ought not to apply. If it has the effect of steadying land values-and it has had that effect - if it keeps down the value of agricultural land, it is justified. It has done more than anything else to keep land values down. It enables those who acquire land to get it for less than they would otherwise have to pay. There is no sound reason why those persons who acquire land for farming or grazing purposes, and who have been enabled to do so at cheaper prices because of the operation of this tax, should complain subsequently that the tax applies to their land. They will have derived benefit from it. The land tax, if it is wisely applied. benefits the farmer much more than it injures him. It makes land available at cheaper prices than would otherwise be possible. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) said that there was no necessity for legislation of this kind, because if the prime reason of the tax was to force land ou to the market to bring about closer settlement, that object could be accomplished by means of compulsory acquisition by the Government. Every State has attempted the wholesale acquisition of land, and the payment of compensation by means of resumption acts. But their experience has been, without exception, that they have had to acquire the land at a price many times greater than what it was really worth for agricultural or any other purpose.",44
153,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,There are many prosperous settlers today on estates which were cut up under State acts. . Mr THEODORE - Compulsor y land acquisition always creates a boom. The fact of a government coming into the market has the effect of enhancing prices immediately. It.is the unfortunate agriculturist who settles on these estates who has to bear the burden.,44
154,Mr STEWART,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That was strikingly illustrated by the settlement of soldiers under the Repatriation scheme.,44
155,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Almos t without exception, the soldier settlement areas throughout Australia were acquired at too high a price, and in almost every case they have had to be revalued to relieve the present holders of the land, showing that too much was paid in the first place. That is the inevitable outcome of government acquisition. When a government commences to purchase land, it always has to pay too much. There are influences at work which force up the prices of land, so that the charge-on the incoming settler is beyond his capacity to pay.",44
156,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Not necessarily.,44
157,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Not necessarily, perhaps, but that is the rule. I u Queensland and in New South Wales, where land has been compulsorily acquired, the prices paid were too high. If the putting, into operation of taxation legislation of this kind has the effect of preventing the accumulation of areas of land and the growth of land monopoly,-it is a good thing. If it has the further effect of forcing the subdivision of land, it is a good filing; and if it steadies the price of land which the sons of farmers have to acquire, it is doing still more good, and is completely justified. The honourable member cannot ignore what has been happening under this legislation. Estates have been subdivided. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) mentioned the area of land that has been forced out of the taxable class almost solely because of the operation of the land tax. From 1910, the first year in which this tax became operative, to 1925, the last year covered by the commissioner's report, land of an unimproved value of Â£117,000,000 has been removed from the taxable field by subdivision.",44
158,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"And a good thing, too.",45
159,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Of course, it is a ' good thing. That is the justification for the law. A good many of the estates which come within the aggregate value mentioned might, in the ordinary course of events, have been subdivided, but a large proportion would not have been subdivided if it had not been subjected to the land-tax law. The tax has been the prime reason for subdivision, and that is why this land has been made available for closer settlement and is now more productive than it ever was before. In the older countries of Europe, and in America, too, agrarian problems, due largely to land monopoly, and absenteeism, have agitated the public mind. Right through the centuries this has been a f r u it f u l cause of trouble, insurrection, agitation, and the disruption of nations. Because land monopoly has been allowed, landlordism has grown to dimensions beyond anything known in Australia, and the lesson to be learned from the history of those countries ought not to be ignored by us. We should ' take steps to prevent land monopoly in this country. A great deal of the trouble in Victoria in connection with arrested development is due to it.",45
160,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Victori a is the most highly developed State in the Commonwealth.,45
161,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The fact that. Victoria has more people to the square mile than the other States does not vitiate my argument. In proportion to the population, land monopoly exists to a greater extent in Victoria than in the other States. It also exists in Queensland and New South Wales. It exists anywhere that large areas of land are held by companies or individuals when it could support more people if broken up into smaller holdings.",45
162,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The non-land-owners seem always to constitute themselves the judges of these matters.,45
163,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"In this instance it is not a non-land-owner who is speaking. I am speaking, however, in a representative character.",45
164,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I refer to the attitude of the honourable member's party.,45
165,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The argument cannot be refuted that there are many Australian towns that are land-locked because the land in those localities is held in large estates. That prevents development, as the land is not put to its fullest use. If this land tax will have the effect of hastening the subdivision of those estates, it will do an excellent work.",45
166,Mr EJLLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Confiscation . N,45
167,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"No . It is the operation of a perfectly rational and natural law, in order to prevent the perpetuation of an evil which, if it continues in this country, will introduce concomitant evils similar to those that have caused so much trouble in the older countries of the world. """,45
168,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,You could legislate for the limitation of holdings.,45
169,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Does the honourable member advocate such a course instead of imposing this tax?,45
170,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I do not.,45
171,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member was not here when I referred to his argument, which was, in my opinion, based upon wrong principles. The honourable member stated that this tax applies to the pastoralist pioneers of Australia. By inference, the honourable member led the House to believe that the great pastoralists of this country, freeholders as well as lessees, are the men who pioneered western New South Wales and Queensland. It is true that some of them did, and that some obtained due reward while others did not; but the honourable member cannot class the big pastoral companies which will pay this tax among the pioneers of our country.",45
172,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Our pioneers died generations ago.,46
173,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member referred to our pioneers, and was therefore more deliberately misleading than I imagined.",46
174,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"If the honourable member says that I was deliberately misleading, I shall make him withdraw his remark. I do not attempt to mislead the House.",46
175,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"If the honourable member is hyper-sensitive I shall substitute some more euphemistic lerm. The honourable member spoke of our pioneers, and now he states that they have been dead for generations.",46
176,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I gave a sketch of our pastoral settlement from the early pioneer days to the present time.,46
177,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member spoke of the taxation which is borne by our present pioneers. I point out that the freeholders, as well as the lessees are in the main wealthy individual pastoralists and pastoral companies and absentees who have come into the industry since the pioneering days. It is the rare exception to find the big pastoralists living on the land. They live in Sydney, Melbourne, or on the other side of the, world. It useless for the honourable member to endeavour to work sentimentality into this matter by pleading the case of some allegedly struggling, hard-bitten pioneer, who has patriotically expended his energy and substance, and whose only reward is to have onerous taxation in-flicted on him. The honourable member must realise that that picture does not apply in this case.",46
178,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I do not think that it was drawn, except by the honourable member.",46
179,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"This tax is intended to prevent the growth of land monopoly, and to secure to the community a portion of the unearned increment in the value of land. The honor apparently disagrees with those who hold the same opinion as myself about community created values. He spoke of his own experience, of how he went out-back and took up land which appeared to be valueless. The honourable member explained how he expended his energies and money in the endeavour to develop that land, which is now of a certain value and, presumably, subject to this tax. The honourable member claimed that, surely, he had created that value by his energy and' by the expenditure of his capital.",46
180,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,And did he not?,46
181,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I assert that the honourable member did not. No doubt he was one of the contributory causes of that value, like every other member of the community. What value would that, or any other land have, if it depended entirely upon the efforts of its owner, and upon no one else in the community? Supposing there were no railways, no ports, no markets-woul d the land be of any value? Land values - are .created by the combined activities of - the community.",46
182,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is his portion of that community-created value, just as every one else in the community has his portion of such value.",46
183,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member argues from too narrow a vision. Supposing there are 20,000 landowners in Australia- I know that there are more-the argument of the honourable is - member assumes that those 20,000 landowners should take credit for the entire value of the ""land that they own, and that the whole of the remaining members of the community have done nothing towards - creating that value.",46
184,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,No .,46
185,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,What other inference am I to draw from the interjection of the honourable member?,46
186,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I say that the owner is the chief contributor towards its value.,46
187,Mr SPEAKER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Order !,46
188,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I do not mind the interjections of the honourable member. I think that the dialogue. is enlightening him. There are many factors which'make for the enhancement of land value, and they should be thoroughly understood, if the justification for a land tax is to be appreciated. The development of the State leads to an increased increment in land values; the same result follows from the expansion of industry, and the expansion of home markets. Land, values are enhanced not merely by the efforts of the landowners, but by the efforts of the whole community. The building of towns, roads, railways, harbours, the establishment of factories, and the creation of markets, all contribute towards the gradual enhancement of the value of land, and it must be attributable to collective community action It is to secure the return of a portion of that value from the commuuity that land tax is justified. Assume that a given area of land had an unimproved value of Â£10,000,000 at the beginning of a decade and that at the end of the decade, because of the expansion of the aifnirs of the nation, its value was enhanced by 25 per cent., that enhancement would not be due to the efforts of the land-owners, except in the ratio of their efforts to those of the community. The community merely asks a small return for what has been given by its united achievements.",46
189,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Will the honourable member admit that, when land depreciates, the position would be reversed?",47
190,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"When values decrease, it is because of special niishappeniugs such as bad. seasons, flood, drought, or fire. Such cases should be met, because land tax is not intended to apply in case of hardship.",47
191,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Accordin g to the argument of the honourable member the owner of such land should be reimbursed by the Government.,47
192,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member misrepresents my argument. Statistics show that land values are improving in the aggregate by millions every year in our cities, towns, and in our rural districts. In ten years city property in Sydney has appreciated by Â£80,000,000 sterling, on the municipal and local authority valuation. The enormous enhancement in value was not due to the efforts of persons who owned the freehold, but to the efforts of the entire population, and the return to the community of a portion of the increase of value is no more than common justice.",47
193,Mr MANNING,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The honourable member adv6cates a tax on unearned increment.,47
194,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Yes . I have mentioned three or four factors which justify the imposition of a land tax, one being to secure to the community a proportion of the unearned increment. It also prevents the growth of land monopoly, and is a means of supplementing the public revenue. This last matter was very effectively dealt with by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin). Our war burdens are still with us, and our war obligations still have to be met every year. This tax brings in only a small contribution of a couple of millions a year from people who own land of an assessable unimproved v!ilue of Â£256,000.000 sterling. They actually pay only Â£2,600,000 towards the revenue of the Commonwealth! The whole burden of the speech of the honourable member for Forrest was that the man on the land suffers; aud that this taxation is one of the grievous burdens which he has to carry. If the honourable member believes that the man on the land is the person who suffers, he should be in favour of the abolition of land tax. His argument and the argument of the honourable member for Wannon were not really arguments against this amendment, but against land taxation entirely. Their speeches were directed against this party specifically. I remind those honourable members, and others who are following this debate, that whether there is justification or a lack of justification for a land tax, the present land tax has been in operation continuously for fifteen years, during the last ten years the Labour party has beeu in opposition, and not in office. If there is anything in the contention of those honourable members opposite, that this is a fatal sort of imposition operating adversely against a class of the community-and the honourable member for Riverina calls it class taxation--the y must blame their own party. There certainly is no justification for the reduction proposed by the Treasurer. The honourable member for Forrest is entirely mistaken if he thinks that it is a reduction that will benefit, even in the slightest degree, the class for which he pleaded this afternoon. Did not the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in an unanswerable argument, clearly show that the people who will be relieved under this taxation will not be the farmers at all. The entire value of the concession which will be given by this bill amounts to Â£445,000 per annum, and Â£400,000 of that relief will be enjoyed by people who own estates to the value of Â£25,000 and upwards.",47
195,Mr ATKINSON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Well , they deserve it.",48
196,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"But they are not farmers. I mentioned that I am of opinion that not one working farmer in a hundred will benefit by this 10 per cent, reduction. Honourable members opposite must agree that the man who owns an estate to the value of Â£25,000 may be a land-owner, but he is not a working farmer. The number of farm holdings in Australia is about 200,000, and' less than one in a thousand of those is likely to benefit by these reductions and concessions.",48
197,Mr DUNCAN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,HUGHES - Does the honourable member know how many farmers in Australia pay federal land tax?,48
198,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The number about 21,000.",48
199,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I maintain that not 1 per cent, of the agriculturists in the Commonwealth are paying the tax at present.",48
200,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I was informed that every member of a deputation of farmers from Yorke Peninsula, which was introduced to me in Adelaide recently by the honourable member for Wakefield, was paying this tax.",48
201,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"They must be very wealthy farmers. Their properties would need to be of an unimproved value of at least Â£5,000 to make them liable, so that the improved value of their farms would be probably Â£10,000 at least. Yorke Peninsula must be a very wealthy part of the honourable member's constituency.",48
202,Mr FOSTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It is.,48
203,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Nevertheless , I do not think there is any need for me to modify iny statement, that not one in a hundred wheat-farmers in Australia pay land tax. Mr M . CAMEBON - The honourable member does not know South Australia.",48
204,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"This is a matter that, can be determined by reference to ithe statistics im the Tear-Booh. My argument is this: There are 200,000 farm holdings in Australia. The reduction and concessions in tax under this measure, which amount to Â£445,000 annually, will to the extent of more than Â£400,000 benefit persons whose estates are valued at more than Â£25,000. Consequently, only Â£45,000 of the total will be distributed over persons holding estates of a less value than Â£25,000. The major portion of the relief will be enjoyed by wealthy land-owners.",48
205,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member is confusing the 10 per cent, reduction with the other concessions.",48
206,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"My argument is based upon the figures of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), which I believe to be correct.",48
207,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"They are applicable only to the 10 per cent, reduction.",48
208,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,They would work out at the same percentage for both the reduction and the concessions.,48
209,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Eve n if a little is modification of the argument were necessary, I submit that the basis of it is perfectly sound and fair. An overwhelming proportion of the relief that will be afforded to land-owners by this concession will be enjoyed by wealthy men who are in a position to continue to pay their taxation without hardship. In view of our economic and financial position and our war obligation, there is no justification for the granting of this relief.",48
210,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Does not the honourable member think that this money will fructify more rapidly in the pockets of the people than in the Treasury?,48
211,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"If the Treasurer desires to leave money in the pockets of the people he should leave it in the pockets of those who are called upon to pay heavy indirect taxation through the customs, and are least able to do so.",48
212,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Under the present .tariff schedule, 28 items are being added to the free list.",48
213,Mr THEODORE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition respecting outstanding land taxation. The report of the Commissioner for Taxation states that more than Â£1,000,000 of arrears in land taxation is outstanding, and has been so for more than five years. Of this amount, Â£836,000 has not been called. Possibly it is affected by litigaA tion, but apparently there is no intention to make a demand for it.",48
214,Dr EARLE PAOE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,It is a question of valuation in some cases.,49
215,Mr THEODOEE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"An amount of that Â£162,000 of the total outstanding has been called for, and I suppose assessment interject. notices have been issued in respect of it. Some of it has been owing since 1914-15. The amount outstanding on freehold land is Â£210,000. There is no justifiation allowing these amounts to remain uncolgestion lected, especially in respect to the earlier years. It is unjust that while many pasother toral lessees paid their taxes promptly on receiving their assessments, others who refused to pay are, apparently, being allowed to escaj>e it. Such discriminamotest tion should not be permitted.",49
216,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That is not so.,49
217,Mr THEODOEE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It is so, for it is well known that many of the lessees their taxation promptly. They did question the authority of the Commonters wealth to assess them, nor the valuation placed upon their property.",49
218,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,There was a sussooner pension of this taxation by the Treasurer in 1918.,49
219,Mr THEODOEE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I trust that the Treasurer will take immediate steps to collect this money. I realise that this not the time to discuss the exemption from taxation of pastoral leases, but must say that, in my opinion, there was every justification for the continuation that taxation. The case of Mr Jowett has been mentioned. I can see no reason why he should be permitted to evade this taxation. He holds enormous tracts country under leasehold. Some years he had 54 separate holdings in Queenswinch land, which aggregated 9,000,000 acres, on which he paid a rental that did not present its economic value, but only the value reserved to the Crown. The difference between them was the basis of assessment by the Commissioner.",49
220,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"""Was not a special rate granted to him to induce him to take Land up this land? Mr *THEOI>OEE - No . He tained the holdings uuder such conditions owing to purely fortuitous circumstances. considerably higher figure is being paid by land-holders adjacent to some of these properties.",49
221,Mr SPEAKER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS," The honourable member may not discuss that subject, although I know he has been led into it by interjections. I ask lionorable members not to",49
222,Mr THEODOEE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker; but this is a most for important subject. I support the sugof the honourable member for Yarra that a board of review or some authority should be constituted to which appeals may be made against the arbitrary decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. I do not reflect in the redegree upon the Commissioner. I think that he always gives due consideration to the matters placed before him, and acts in strict conformity with what he believes to be the justice of the case; but paid any man who is called upon to make not numerous decisions, involving matof vast importance to the persons concerned, must, in the vast number of cases he is called on' to determine, or later commit errors of judgment. The State does not suffer from these, but the individual does. Even if a man were as wise as Solon there should be an appeal from his decisions. Such decisions should not be absois lutely final. The Treasurer would be wise to agree to an extension of the funcI tions of the proposed valuation board to allow it to hear appeals on this matter. of If that proposal is not practicable, perhaps it would be possible to allow the Board of Eeview in income tax matters to be a special board of review in certain of approved cases under this law. There ago should be a tribunal of some kind to aggrieved taxpayers may appeal from the decisions of the commissioner in recertain cases. I support the amendment.",49
223,Mr HUNTEB,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Maranoa) [4.43] - I the disapprove of the imposition of taxation on lands that are being used for productive purposes, no matter whether imposed by State of Federal authority. held for speculative . purposes should be taxed. In some cases obland which is held for speculative purposes is worked sufficiently to recoup its owner for his current expenses, although it is really being held for sale later at a big profit. ' I call that speculation, just as I would call it speculation to hold land without working it. Land which is used for production in either primary or secondary industries should not be taxed. This tax was introduced by the Labour party with two objects. As the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) pointed out, it was designed to burst up large estates. It has not achieved that object. The second reason for introducing it was to augment the revenue. It has become a revenue tax pure and .simple, and it will remain so as long as it is on the statute book. I submit that it is not a federal function to tax land. The Commonwealth is debarred constitutionally from discriminating between the States; but honourable members know very well that, . owing to the wide variety of land in the Comnioiiwealth, this tax operates more unfavorable on some States than on others. The honourable member for ""Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has described the quality of some lands in Victoria, and honourable members who represent South Australian constituencies have referred to certain areas in their State about which I am entirely ignorant. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) has dealt with Queensland conditions, with which, of course, I am well .acquainted. It is impossible, however, for the federal authorities to discriminate. A large area of land in Queensland would be regarded as an enormous tract of country in a State like Victoria. ""When I was - recently in that State I heard persons ing about squatters and their land, and the areas that they had in mind would be regarded in Queensland as no more than night horse-paddocks. In travelling through New South Wales one sees large unoccupied areas along the railway lines; but, because, of that, it is worse than useless ' to levy a tax upon the value of that land in order to burst up tbose estates, if it will injure somebody in Queensland who happens to be doing .a national work. There may be urgent necessity for cutting up some estates. The State Governments know these; let them act when necessary. On my first trip toMelbourne, six years ago, I saw sheep being grazed within about 12 or 14 miles of the Mr Hunter. city. Possibly that was the best purpose to which that particular land could be put at the time; but I dare say the owners of it were merely grazing sheep on it for the purpose of paying the rates and taxes on land which afterwards they would cut up for suburban settlement. Conditions vary greatly in each State, and in different parts of each State. Queensland is a huge tract of country. Conditions in the south are entirely different from those in the north, and those along the coastal belt vary tremendously from those in the western areas; 20 miles east of Toowoomba, the value of the land and the purposes for which it is used, are different from those 20 miles westward. The States are the proper authorities to exercise discrimination legally and for revenue, political and every other State purpose. The States have so discriminated in the past. Queensland and New South Wales, for instance, have done so. I have before me a copy of an act passed by the Now South Wales Parliament on the motion of the Labour Government led by Mr Lang. It is an amending taxation act dealing with large estates. Even that Government saw the necessity for discrimination. It exempts land within the western division of New South Wales, which, like the land in western and north-western Queensland, has been badly hit in clays gone by by the tax on leaseholds. The Labour Government under Mr Lang, which will not be accused of having been a Tory administratalk- tion, exempted from taxation leasehold ancl freehold lands in the western division of New South Wales. The measure also exempts irrigation areas, or lands owned by a person to whom the advisory, board has issued a certificate that they are being used mainly for the purpose of breeding stud stock. Although even that Labour Government saw the necessity for discriminating between certain classes of land, the federal authorities cannot discriminate. We have been told that the object of the tax is to burst up large estates and take a portion of the increment in value. We are informed, also, that it is a rich man's tax- a big man's tax. It may be a big man's tax; but a big man is not necessarily a rich man. If he is rich, and is using his land, he is to be blamed no more, in fact, considerably less, than persons who own a considerable amount of property of other kinds that cannot be taxed. only way in which the latter can be reached is tlirough the income tax. If they happen to be speculators in stocks and shares and sundry other things,, men who never circulate their money throughout the country, who never produce anything-som e of them are to be found in the ranks of the Opposition-the y are permitted to escape from taxation; but the men who own land and cannot get away from it, who produce something, add to the wealth of this country, are selected to be hounded down and penalized. Even supposing this were a justifiable tax and a rich man's tax, which I deny, what would it matter if the Government retired from this field of taxation? These men could not escape. There are four State Labour governments, including one in Queensland, which has no upper house to block land taxation. The State Labour governments would seize such a favourable opportunity to enter the field of tion vacated by the Commonwealth. It would be a chance to obtain increased revenue. Goodness knows, the States, with their wild expenditure, need it. The rich man in Queensland would be unable to escape in any case. All the talk about the rich man and the poor man is indulged in merely to renew an old cry, and set class against class, so that, when honourable members opposite go before the electors, they can say to them, "" Look what we have done to place taxes upon the wealthy clasSj thereby relieving the poorer section."" That argument will not be accepted in Queensland, because the rich man can be taxed there. He was taxed in days gone by. But when the honourable member for Dalley, as Premier of Queensland, went , abroad to interview the money-lenders, they whispered something in his ear, and he climbed down. He had to account for his notions to his own party, and it is said that that was one of the matters that led to his loss of the premiership.",49
224,Mr SPEAKER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The honourable membeen ber is getting away from the subject - Jer' of the bill.,51
225,Mr HUNTEB,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I am tired of the talk that I hear, that honourable members on this side are the friends of the rich The while honourable members opposite are the friends of the poor. Probably, if an investigation were made, it would be found that I and the greater number on this side of the House are considerably poorer than the majority of the honourable members who sit opposite. One thing that must be impressedupon the people is the fact that there are two taxing authorities in Australia; but, listening to the speeches delivered by honourable members in Canand berra in the last few months, one would imagine that the people should be encouraged to believe that the only taxing authority is the Commonwealth. The people know to their cost that there are two taxing authorities-the States and the Commonwealth. Queenslanders know it only too well, and so do the taxpayers in every other State ruled by Labour governments. When one of those authorities vacates a particular field of taxation, it is left open to the other taxaauthority, which may immediately enter it. Therefore, there is little opportunity for any class of taxpayer to escape when two authorities operate. We have heard about the Federal Government receding from direct taxation. Everybody knows that it did uot enter that field until 1910. We are informed that it was done for the purpose of bursting up large estates. Now that we have entered that field, however, we depend upon it for our ordinary revenue. It is true that direct taxation was imposed for war purposes; but the repayment of debts incurred to meet war expenditure is spread over a period of years and cannot be made at once without hardship and ruination to industry. No business man will hold that the taxpayers sbould have to pay in one year the whole' of the cost of the works authorized in any particular year. The people of today are paying something for posterity, but posterity should bear its'share of the cost. The only way to apportion the burden of debt fairly is by sinking funds and other such means. We have assured many times that those funds matare too large. Beports have appeared in the press of attacks upon the Federal Treasurer for establishing too large a sinking fund. We are told now that there should be no sinking fund at all. It is said by the Opposition that every penny of tax placed upon industry should be kept there, and used to pay off the national debt. Direct taxes are the only taxes that the Federal Parliament can reduce. Our indirect taxes are really not taxes at all. They are spread evenly over the whole community. Eor the most part they are collected upon luxuries that the average man, woman and child does not enjoy. Only from about Â£1 18s. to Â£2 per head of indirect taxation can be said to.be properly distributed throughout, the community. No road user objects to the moneys raised for roads; other sums have been raised for other purposes. The total moneys received from both direct and so-called indirect taxation have increased in the last four years from Â£9 Os. 3d. to Â£9 13s. Id. per head, an increase of 12s. 9d.; but the direct taxation has decreased from Â£4 Os. Id. to Â£2 10s. 7d. Let us examine the taxation figures in; Queensland or any other State that has been ruled by Labour. This party calls itself the Australian Labour party, and claims to be Semper idem, the same in every State and in the country. If we look at its achievements elsewhere, we naturally conclude that it will show a similar record in the federal sphere. The increase in State taxation has amounted to pounds per head of the population in every State that has been ruled, or misruled, by Labour; but the increase in total federal taxation from all sources, even cluding so-called indirect taxation has been infinitesimal. This year the increase will be only 7s. 7d. more than in 1922, and 5s. 2d. less than this year. What have we done? Everybody knows that 6s. per head of that has gone for the roads, and 12s. or 13s. per head for invalid and old-age pensions. If we add the two together, we have about 18s. By eliminating that expenditure, we could bring about a fairly considerably reduction in taxation. But is'any honourable member prepared to cut out that expenditure? We find in the States a constant, increase not only in direct tion, but also in indirect taxation, ing increased railway freights, which hit Mr Hunter. the people in the country and particularly the people of Queensland. In the States direct taxation has constantly increased without our having a single benefit to show for it. Certainly wild-cat shows bankrupt State enterprises, and depleted railway returns, coupled with worse services, are nothing to brag about. It may be asked, what have we to show in the federal sphere? I ask honourable members opposite to go to the country, where they will find an efficient telephonic system in operation. The sum of Â£20,000,000 has been voted for the improvement and extension of telephones and other facilities of communication by the department of the Postmaster-General. Ask the country people if they object to that expenditure and if they want these services curtailed. Ask them also what they think of the roads grant.",51
226,Mr SPEAKER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Order ! I ask the honourable member not to pursue that line of discussion.,52
227,Mr HUNTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I . wish to compare the taxation policy of this Government with that of the State governments. Honourable members opposite would lead us to believe that the Federal Government is the only taxing master, whereas the Federal Government has reduced taxation and the State Governments have not. It is the duty of the Federal Government, or of any government, when it has too much revenue, to return some of it to the people. This Federal Government is reducing taxation, but I have never heard in- of a Labour government doing that. This Government, through its economical administration, has been able to reduce taxation, and thereby give a fillip to industry. A man is a fool who says that money is better in the hands of the Government than it is in the hands of private enterprise. The Opposition says that we have immense war responsibilities to meet, and therefore this is not the time to reduce taxation. It says also that we have bad times ahead; but, if that is so, who will suffer? It will be the people on the land, and this Government is' giving them some taxa- relief, so that they may be better includable to withstand drought periods. The policy of the Opposition, when bad times are ahead, is to tax the people as much as possible, and especially those who are engaged in industry. It would be wrong for the Federal Government to remain forever in the field of land tion ; because that should be the sphere of the States. It is a penal tax, pure and simple, and can be imposed by the States if they wish. Reference has been made to the reduction in taxation on Grown leaseholds. This Government has done that deliberately, and does not apologize for its action. Queensland ^has more leasehold country than any other State. We know what the taxation of leaseholds means. There are few large areas of freehold country in Queensland, so probably the ordinary land tax has not affected Queensland so much as it has the other States. Queensland has huge undeveloped areas, and its population is small compared with those of New South Wales and Victoria. Most of the settlers in the far west have large holdings. Much has been said about the conditions in Queensland, and in that respect I shall quote from a report of the Land Settlement Advisory Board which was ' appointed by the Premier of Queensland, Mr MCCormack. It is frequently said that the industries of that State are progressing, and that many of the settlers are rolling in wealth. Let me quote the Queensland figures relating to sheep, spread over a period of 34 years. In 1891 the total number of sheep in that State was 20,289,000; in 1910, 20,331,000; and in 192S, 20,663,000. That represents an increase in sheep carried of 1.84 per cent.",52
228,Mr ATKINSON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Was the total number higher in the intervening years?,53
229,Mr HUNTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Onl y in 1914. At present there are probably from 14,000,000 to 15,000,000 sheep in Queensland. Take the cattle industry. In 1891 the total number of cattle in Queensland was 6,192,000; in 1910, 5,131,000; and in 1925, 6,436,000. The sheep and cattle are pastured mostly in wide spaces in the outback country. Since 1891 the mileage of railways has increased almost threefold, and the total number of grazing selections has increased from 5,600 to 9,692. But there was a great increase in something typical of Labour Government revenue. The total land revenue ir. 1891 was Â£489,000; in 1910, Â£757,000; and in 1925, nearly Â£1,500,000. Although there has been an enormous taxa- increase in revenue and railways, the grazing industry has made little advance. The conditions of Queensland are different from those of other States, and this is shown in the report of the Advisory Committee. Expressing the carrying capacity of New South Wales and Queensland in terms of sheep, over a period of five years-192 1 to 1925 - Ne w South Wales carried 222 sheep and Queensland only 137 sheep to the square mile. In New South Wales the average weight of fleece increased by 1.33 lb., and in Queensland by only 0.38 lb., so that New South Wales is 1 lb. to the good in the increase of wool per sheep. I am quoting these figures to show that, in view of the different conditions in Queensland, we cannot apply the federal land tax with equity throughout the length and breadth of Australia. We have heard much about the producers making money. . The Advisory Board found that the approximate annual income of all graziers from the sheep industry is Â£4,000,000, the value of property and stock being Â£50,000,000. This represents a net return of only 8 per cent., without taking into consideration the various troubles of the settlers, such as dogs and droughts. The committee found, also, that the production costs had considerably increased since 1911. Taking a flock of from 13,000 to 16,000 sheep, we find that the costs increased from Â£2,765 to Â£7,400. The cost per pound of wool increased from 5.39d. to 12.43d., and the average price per pound from 8.71d. to 15.26d., leaving a net return per pound to the graziers in these far-back places, whose leaseholds the Labour party taxed, and whom they propose to tax again, of 3.32d. in 1911,- and 2.83d. in 1925.",53
230,Mr KILLEN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Are those figures for Queensland only?,53
231,Mr HUNTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Yes . They apply to a carefully managed station in the Hughenden district.,53
232,Mr FENTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,We are not taxing leaseholds.,53
233,Mr HUNTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I have heard today that the Opposition, when it obtains office, intends to levy a tax on leaseholds, and that I shall, at the next election, drive thoroughly into the minds of the people of Queensland. Then I come to the taxation per head of sheep. In .1911, an income of Â£4,000, representing approximately 16,000 sheep, returning 5s. per head, paid in State income tax Â£133, or approximately 2d. per sheep. In 1927 the State and Federal tax amounted to Â£960, or Is. 2-}d. per sheep. Yet we are told that no taxation should he taken off these people. These conditions apply to leaseholders, but would press considerably harder on freeholders, because they invest considerable capital in their pror perties and the interest on that would charge against them - Most of the graziers in Queensland are leaseholders. Honourable members opposite want to know where the money goes. Take, for instance, a station with a run sufficient for from 10,000 to 40,000 sheep. During the last six years the net income of the owner was Â£4,479 per annum. In this instance, for every 90s. of gross profit, the owner received 20s., the Government ISs., the workers and other associated with the industry 52s. Yet honourable members opposite would like to tax that settler, so as to reduce his return of 20s. In the case of this grazier, for every Â£1 that he received he spent Â£2 12s. in providing work, particularly reproductive and national work. He sold his products overseas, and the proceeds were sent to Australia, yet the Opposition says that tbese men are privileged because they own land.",53
234,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,And they are helping our trade balance.,54
235,Mr HUNTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is so. We are. told that this tax should be kept on, because it would assist our trade balance. But by allowing these graziers a remission of taxation, more money will be put into the industry, and more wealth will be produced, with a consequent less adverse trade balance. The board examined the conditions of the industry, and made certain recommendations. It has vised a review of the rents that have recently been fixed by the department. It also advises inquiries into the promotion of production and land settlement, so that the value of our exports may exceed our imports and that the Government should take action so that investment in the wool industry might be attractive. That board was appointed by a Labour Government. We have been told that men should be taxed on their leaseholds; but surely that is a matter for the State to decide, because it fixes rentals, not only for revenue purposes, but also for purposes of development. The quality and fitness of land for grazing purposes is not the same throughout Australia, nor even in Queensland. In the report is a long table setting out the conditions that assessors must take into account when fixing rentals. The board recommends be a low rentals^ and now an additional tax is advocated by the Opposition. Rental values are created and main tained by land development and by the development of other lands in the neighbourhood. The enterprise of Crown tenants in investing their capital has proved the resources of their country, and make it possible for the State to derive extensive revenue from rents and taxatioi: which otherwise would uot have been available, and spend by far the greater proportion of their gross revenue in wages. This country is not developed by the man in the city, by the man in the office, or by the man who sits in Parliament. It is developed by the man who settles in the outback t country, and by those who follow him. Private enterprise alone, by investing its capital in the land, can develop the resources of this country. It is the selectors who develop this country, and that was what was in the mind of the Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, when he made the speech that has been referred to by the Opposition. I was with him in Queensland, and I know what he said. He referred to our large areas of land, and the enormous amount of capital necessary to develop them. He said that these areas would be developed only by big men with capital, and subsequently that after they had been ad- developed they should be subdivided into selections for the next settlers. The big man pioneers the country, and after he has developed it and made it productive and railways have been constructed, the smaller man can come in and' get the benefit by selection at the resumption periods. That is what the Prime Miuister meant. Nobody in this chamber believes that he said that he was against the bursting up of huge estates that are not being used. Honourable members opposite say that because reduced rents are being charged by the States for certain lands, the Commonwealth should step in and impose increased taxation. They would ignore the national work that the settlers have done for the development of this country and in providing for export, and they say that no taxation should be reduced for them. There are in Queensland and other States vast areas which are wholly undeveloped, and the Land Settlement Advisory Board has recommended that there should be discrimination not only between lands adjacent to and distant from railways, but between lands partially developed and those that are undeveloped. It has suggested that the rents in respect of the latter should be so low that the people settled there will be encouraged to remain and develop the land for the benefit of themselves and the nation, and thus help towards adjusting the present adverse trade balance. The report of the board shows that it appreciated the necessity for conserving any interests that create national wealth, particularly the interests in the outback country. It matters not whether the land is occupied by sheep or cattle. The Queensland Labour Government appreciates that fact, and that is why I said that, if some honourable members opposite pitched in Queensland the tale that they have been pitching in this chamber, even members of their own party would laugh at them. The State Arbitration Court discriminated between cattle country and sheep country. Although a sheep property may be divided from a cattle run by only a wire fence, the man who works ou the cattle run is paid Â£2 10s. a week and the employee on the sheep station Â£3 10s. The Queensland Labour Government also introduced a law, which will expire this year, to allow of special rents being charged to cattlemen.. The board has recommended the extension of that act for another six years, in order to enable the cattlemen to get on their feet. It is admitted that those men should not be required to pay in rent the full economic value of the land. But because they have received a concession ou account of bad seasons, and the vicissi ; tudes of the meat industry, members of the Labour party in this chamber say that the Federal Government should collect the amount that the State Go^ ernment has been generous enough to forego. I intend to let the people throughout the length and breadth of Queensland know that the Labour party is in favour of re-imposing the land tax on leasehold, which this Goverument repealed a couple of years ago, and is against any reduction in direct taxation which would benefit the man outback who is doing a great national work in providing development, exports and work for workmen. I commend the Federal Government for reducing taxation in the past, and for the further reduction they now propose. I know the whole of the people of my State will appreciate it.",54
236,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"East Sydney) [5.20] I cannot understand some of the speeches delivered upon the bill and the amendments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Ministerialists have endeavoured to cloud the issue by introducing many matters that are irrelevant to the bill. I am aware that in debating a bill of this character, much latitude is allowed, and that may account to some extent for some of the extraordinary statements that have been made. The speech of the honourable member for Forrest  would be of benefit to the country if it could be deleted from Hansard and totally excluded from the columns of the press. Some friends of mine who recently returned from a visit to Europe told me that if honourable members could see the Australian news that is published in the English newspapers, they would be more careful of the public statements they make. If the speech of the honourable member for Forrest is cabled to the other side of the world it will do infinite harm to this country. I have been surprised to hear the enthusiastic championship of land agents and land monopolists; they are the curled darlings of the community, because they extract more wealth from the country than any other section. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra is a protest against the removal of land taxation from this wealthy section, which is well able to it. As one who has endeavoured to study the problems of public finance, I consider the Treasurer's proposal most unjust. While he is losing revenue by the remission of taxation, he is trying to balance the ledger by using loan funds for expenditure that should be met from revenue. Instead of producing a budget that would be a credit to Australia, he has produced one which does uot meet with the approval of any business man. The proposed remission of land tax will mean an extension of the rotten principle of paying from loan account money that should be paid from revenue. private company that did not live within its income would soon find itself in the bankruptcy court. The principle of balancing expenditure against income js equally sound in the management of the nation's finances. It is strange that honourable members cannot speak on any question without blackguarding the people who live in the cities. They say, that the city dwellers are supported by the man on the land. That is nonsense. If there were no consumers, the goods produced by the man on the land would be worthless, and even land would have little value if the population were small. The land-holders get more benefits from the public treasury than the rest of the community. Railways are built for their assistance, and although the land-owner gets the benefit of the resultant increment of values, city residents have to to pay the interest on the capital cost of the lines.",55
237,Mr FENTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Many railways are not paying, but we do not mind that.",56
238,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The people of New South Wales pay annually Â£2,250,000 in interest in respect of railways that do not pay. There is a good deal of misconception about taxation. The honourable member for Forrest included in the burden of taxation municipal and road board rates. Those rates are not taxation; they are a charge for services rendered. The roads are paid for out of the petrol tax, which is mainly contributed by the people in the cities. I was a member of this Parliament when the Commonwealth land tax was originally imposed. At that time large areas of land were not being put to productive use, and many bear of the people who were deriving large incomes from land only partially used were paying little or no taxation. They were actually free from taxation other than that collected through thecustoms and excise duties. I am in the happy position of knowing that the forecast made at that time, that the tax would break up the large holdings, has been verified. Another injustice in regard to the land is that , the governments of the various States have disposed of it at prices far below what it should have brought. In New South Wales there are large areas on the RichA mond and Clarence Rivers, and up to the Queensland border, which were sold by the Government for Â£1 an acre. In the old days, when the Treasurer of the New South Wales Government was short of some income, he could always balance his expenditure with his revenue by selling so many acres of land at Â£1 an acre, and anybody could buy it. The whole of the land in the north-eastern portion of the State was sold in this way. .This land along the Clarence and other rivers and on the north coast is selling now at from .Â£100 to Â£110 an acre, although originally it was sold by the Government for Â£1 an acre. I did not follow all the things that were said on this subject; there are some honourable members who say so many silly things. A man of intellect gets tired of listening to them. Honourable help members of the dorner party are out to preserve the interests of the men who own the land, and they think that the rest of the community have no rights whatever-hardl y even the right to exist. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition dealt with this matter in a statesmanlike way in the course of his address in support of the amendment. That amendment states, "" In view of the grave and expanding obligations of 'the Commonwealth manifested by the adverse trade balance and the increasing loan expenditure,"" and there is no dispute about those things. We are today floating a redemption loan. Our practice is to pay Â£5,000,000 or Â£6,000,000 off our debt, and then to borrow another Â£12,000,000. The amount credited each year to the loan account is much greater than that set aside for debt redemption. I believe that there is a day coming when we shall no longer he ahle to finance country on these lines. The Government would be very wise, even at this to alter its decision in connection with the/proposed reduction of the country cannot be governed without taxation, and we can get the taxes only those in a position to pay. Honourable members will notice, if they study press, that those persons whose estates pay the largest amount in probate are those who held property in land. professional or commercial man in the city never leaves a very large estate, unless he, too, has done some dabbling in land. Most of the big business men in Sydney are also large land-owners. Personally, I shall not pay much probate matters. when I go my way, because I do not own any land at all except a little block 6 feet by 3 feet, for which enough; and the place on which my home is situated.Â« When I first went to live there the land was valued at Â£10 a foot, but now, for some reason, the valuation has been increased to Â£50 a foot. T do not know why this should be: I did not ask them to put up the value. When I made inquiries at the Town Hall about it they told me that so much was for the town clock, so much for the. bridge, so much for the gulley at the back, and so much for other different items. I do not know why the' people do not take more interest in what is going on. Since this Government has been in power it has granted numerous concessions to the people on the land. There is what amounts. to a bounty of 3d. a lb. on with the land. butter, for instance. When a drought comes, the people on the land apply for all sorts of assistance from the Governbenefactors ment, and ask, among other things, were that their cattle shall be carried free on the railways. I never wealth heard of better socialists some of these people. They have the land, and if Providence favours them with bounteous rains so that they have ment in power. good crops, they take all the profit, while the community gets nothing; but if they meet with adversity they want whole community to help them to bear They obtain all the benefits of high prices, and yet are nothing better than tax dodgers. They are the most misera able section of the community as far as the contributing to the development of Australia is concerned, and they are the late hour, greediest section also.",56
239,Mr MCGRATH,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That is the squatter; tax. The do not say the farmer.,57
240,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I have great sympathy from with the struggling farmer. When the Government resumes land, it the pays such a high price for it that the settlers or farmers are unable duty 'to make anything out of it . In The Victoria alone, the Commonwealth is losing Â£10,000,000 by reason of the falling off in the value of land upon which it has advanced money. In New South Wales all our political scandals of any magnitude have had to do with land",57
241,Mr GREGORY,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Does the honourable member propose to tax the land-holders I paid quite to make up for that ?,57
242,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The land-holders do not want to be taxed even to make the roads. If it were not for the workers in the city who purchase their commodities, the landholders would find themselves in Queerstreet. I am sorry that the question of country versus city was ever brought into the committee; there was no justification for it. The land-holders wish to be relieved of taxation, and to obtain all the benefits of high prices and a prosperous industry, while allowing the country TO be financed by those who pay indirect taxation. If there was ever a section of the community that ought to be taxed for the purpose of helping us bear the burdens of the war, it is those connected The late Sir Samuel MCCaughey made a fortune, but he left, it to the university. The Russells-othe r of the Sydney Universityengineers, but they made nothing out of their engineering; they made their out of the land they held. After than they had held it for some time it was worth ten times its original value. It is a pity that we have the present GovernI t represents vested interests, and the interests of those connected with the land. It is sterving its the friends loyally. I only wish the indusit. trial section of the community would learn a lesson from the experience of the last few years. We should then have different result at the next election. I hope that the committee will pay some attention to this amendment. I recognize, however, that the Government has its majority, and that it is only talking to the wind to oppose its proposal. It has the numbers, and it is able to flict this punishment on a section of the community. It has no soul, or it would think twice before it laid such burden on the mass of the people.",57
243,Mr COOK,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Indi) [5.44] - I , for one,, am opposed to land taxation by the Commonwealth. I believe that the State can administer that business very much better than the Federal Government can. So far as this tax is concerned, the city provides about 55 per cent, of it. In the city the major portion is paid by the consumer. I am connected with business concerns, and I know how warehouses and other businesses pass the load on to the consumer. The rural industry is in quite a different position. It has to compete with cheap overseas markets, and has not the opportunities to pass on expenses which are enjoyed by the secondary industries. cannot be emphasized too clearly. Fifty-five per cent, of this tax is paid in the cities by the consumer. At present a harbour bridge is being constructed in Sydney, aud the major portion of its cost will be passed on to the consumers. When the Arbitration Court compels the employer to pay additional wages he passes the increase, with a little addition, on to the community, which must bear the burden. It would be difficult to get two men value land at the same, price. I have been associated with land valuing for many years, and while I feel that I am competent to value the land with which I am familiar-and in connection with which I know the rainfall, accessibility, carrying capacity, &c - I would not dream of going 100miles away from my own centre, and posing there, as a competent valuer. Values depend chiefly on the man who values, and it is impossible for him to have a comprehensive knowledge of many different'localities. One primary producer may make good on land which is valued at Â£20, while another man may fail on similar land valued at Â£10. Our experience, with soldier land settlement provides an excellent example of that. There is land in Victoria, arid in other parts of the Commonwealth, which varies in valuation from Â£1 to Â£3 an acre from adjoining land, from which it is divided by a fence or a road. That is in- manifestly unfair. We should have some co-ordination in our valuing. A valuer may be instructed to value a certain estate, which may not have been valued for some time - Changed circumstances may warrant the valuation that he places upon it, but the adjoining lands are not revalued, and remain at the old value. We have State and Federal values of the land which differ, and even our Federal values of similar land differ considerably. I have argued constantly that land should be zoned when it is valued for Federal taxation purposes, and that the valuation should apply for three or six years, the land in each zone to be r.e-valued simultaneously. That would set right many existing anomalies. I am very pleased that the old system of assessing land values is to be abolished, as it was unfair. I do not agree with the Leader of That the-Opposition (Mr Charlton), and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), in their remarks on the value placed on estates, and as to the difficulty experienced in obtaining farms. I have been through large portions of Western Australia, South Australia, and other States of Australia, and I believe, that the opportunities to go on the land are as good today as they ever were during my lifetime. It is useless to give a man 1,000 acres of land when he has no money with which to to develop it. He must possess capital to pay for fencing, implements, stock, and for the erecton of his house. It must be realized that there is a multiplicity of financial obligations following the actual acquisition of the land. Referring to the alleged .exorbitant values placed on large estates, I saw five estates sold in a western district at from Â£95 to Â£110 per acre, for 20-acre blocks. Large estates, when cut up for sub-divisional purposes, may be purchased at a much lower figure. In Victoria there are estates which have been on. the market for some time, and which may be purchased reasonably. Associated with the subdivision of estates is the cost of subdividing, road construction, cleaning, and so on, and the profits made by the owners are not nearly as great as some honourable members would have us believe. Those who have the most to say on such matters appear to know the least about them. A lifelong experience of land matters teaches me that the person wbo goes on the land is confronted with many adversities of which the average person has not the slightest conception. At the same time. I believe that there has been too much pessimistic preaching. I realise that the amount offirst-classland available in Australia is limited. It is our last and practically only asset. It is the source of all wealth. Our secondary industries would be nothing without primary producton, and we should encourage to the fullest extent the linking of - the two industries. I am confident that the Governa large' number of people. ment have played the game in regard to soldier settlement. I have had a practical knowledge; of the scheme its inception in Victoria. The Federal Government has come to the assistance of our returned soldier settlers with straight-out gift of Â£10,000,000, and the time finalization is arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth, this Government will be compelled to foot bill even to a greater extent. That indimany miles from the railhead. cates that, when you place a man on the land, the matter does not end there. It may be argued that soldier settlements have failed because the land was bought at exorbitant prices, but in most districts it would have brought on the open market a price at least equal to that which the Government paid for it. Our soldier settlers have had heavy burdens to meet in the way of rents, rates, instalments stock and implements, and payments for sub-divisional fences, and as many of them had practically no capital, it was only to be expected that they would fail. I do not desire to have anything to with land settlement which is carried in this fashion. If we attempt to settle migrants here under similar conditions we shall invite disaster. I expect that the future Commonwealth land in North and Central Australia will become valuthe able, as also will the unoccupied parts States. of Northern Queensland, and the Kimsure. It is not have berly district in .Western Australia, before that day comes heavy expenditure will have to be incurred in constructing roads and railways. These are essential to settlement, and until they are provided the areas I have mentioned must remain of little value. I agree with the proposal of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) that a board should be appointed to hear appeals from the decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. I favour submitting these matters to laymen of wide experience in land valuation and dealing, rather than to judges in a court, for I think that justice is more likely to be done if practical men determine the issue than if such matters are left to lawyers. I disagree with the view of several honourable members opposite that the relief granted by this measure, up which is approximately Â£445,000, will be enjoyed principally by moneyed men. In my opinion the concessions will benefit They will even be advantageous to the worker, for they will make available for productive from purposes money which would otherwise be spent in taxatiou. While it is true that many people are forsaking the pasa toral industry, quite a number of our by young men are taking it up. Only last week two young fellows of my acquaintance left for Western Australia to settle the on a big undeveloped grazing property They will bp pioneers in every sense of the word. It is interesting to note thatÂ»while this Government is proposing to grant a reduction of 10 per cent, in land taxation the Labour Premier of Victoria (Mr Hogan) is increasing the tax by a similar percentage. This shows that the people will appreciate all the relief that we can grant them. I appreciate fully on the decision of the Government to abolish the unfair system of dating increased values back over two or three years. The Labour party's reason for opposing the 10 per cent, reduction is on the ground that do State governments cannot imposeland on taxation because the upper houses in the State Parliaments will not agree to it ; but I am of the opinion that whenever in a good case can be made out the State upper houses may be relied upon to do fair thing in the interests of their I approve of the concessions which been granted by this meaa fair thing that persons but who object to the decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation should be compelled to fight the matter out in'court. Many taxpayers have made complaints to me, but when I have advised them to take the matter into court they have said that they would not do so, for it might cost them two or three times the amount involved, to obtain a decision. The provisions of this bill will bring more equity into our taxation methods.",58
244,Mr BAYLEY,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Oxley) [6.10] - I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this bill, but I regret that it is not altogether evacuating this field of taxation. The sooner it does so the better, in my opinion. The policy of taxing land is unsound. An axiom of taxation is that a person shall contribute to the expenses of government according to his ability to do so. Land tax is levied on the value of the land, regardless of the return that is obtained from it, which is unfair. Income taxation is a much fairer method of obtaining revenue from the country. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), the Deputy Leader (Mr Scullin), and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore), all gave reasons why the Government should continue to impose land taxation. The honourable member for Dalley mentioned four specific objects which the Labour party had in view when it introduced the first Land Tax Assessment Bill into this Parliament. They were: first, to prevent land monopoly; secondly, to break up large estates; thirdly, to secure to the Government a, certain part of the unearned increment in the value of the land in consequence of the expenditure of public money in constructing roads and railways and other developmental works; and, fourthly, to obtain revenue. I do not desire to discuss the constitutional aspect of the subject at length, but I submit that it was never intended that the Commonwealth Government should enter this field of taxation. In a time of emergency, such as of war, it is justifiable for a government to obtain revenue by auy means which are fair to all concerned. The State Governments could impose a land tax which could be just as effective in preventing land monopoly as any such tax which the Commonwealth might impose. serious complaint that I - have against land taxation is that it gives no consideration whatever to the man who is putting his land to the best. use. He is charged on the capital value of the land, and not upon its earning power. What has this Parliament done to improve the land values of Australia? We legislate for the welfare of the people :'.3 a whole. Certain powers were delegated to us by the States, but land development was not one of them.",60
245,Mr DUNCAN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,HUGHES - The Commonwealth Government intends to take the unearned increment with respect to the land in the Federal Capital Territory.,60
246,Mr BAYLEY,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is so, and also with respect to the Northern Territory. We should be well advised to leave the power to control land settlement and development in the hands of the States. I hope that this measure is only the forerunner of the good things to come from this Government, and that the 10 per cent, reduction now forecast will soon be followed by an entire vacation of the field of land taxation. Debate adjourned. WATERFRONT DISPUTE. END OF WATERSIDE WORKERS'"" STRIKE ",60
247,Mr BRUCE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [6.17] -(B y leave)- I desire tp make a short statement in regard to tin. industrial troubles along the waterfront. I have received advice during the day from both Melbourne and Sydney from which it would appear that it is practically certain that the industrial troubl* which has existed on the waterfront between the waterside workers and the shipowners has reached a satisfactory solution. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",60
248,Mr BRUCE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Bot h parties came before his Honour Judge Beeby, this morning, and I understand the court was in possession of a written undertaking by the committee of management of the Waterside Workers' Federation that it would wire to all its branches in these termsThe committee advises you that the overtime embargo is declared off and instructs you One to resume on conditions of existing awards The court, I am informed, was also in possession of a resolution by the committee of management that it would advise its branches to carry out the existing awards and agreements, and that it also would undertake to exercise all its powers to enforce strict compliance on the part of the members of the organization with any future awards made by the court or any agreement arrived at from time to time. Upon the basis of that undertaking the judge then,,made an interim award for three months which provides That the time and places of picking.up shall be those prevailing in the different ports on the 10th January, 1927, which was the date on which the court commenced the hearing of the men's plaint. This award has been made without prejudice to the rights of either party. No date has been fixed for the hearing of the plaint, but I understand that it will be heard within a few days. I received other information from both Melbourne and Sydney, which appears to indicate quite definitely that the trouble will be over today, and that work will - be resumed tomorrow morning. I am sure that to all honourable members this information will be of the most gratifying character. Last week, we had a discussion in this House upon the trouble which had arisen, and while in the heat of debate some members may have expressed strong views, I think that the desire of all of us was to see that we did not in any way prejudice the situation. We were merely trying to carry out what we thought was an obligation of this Parliament. The present indications are that it will be unnecessary for any action to be taken to safeguard the interests of the people, that wise counsels have prevailed, and that happily the whole trouble will disappear ancl that Australia will be able to resume the normal course of its industrial activities.",60
249,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS," The information which the Prime Minister has conveyed to the House is very satisfactory. Nobody could be more pleased than I am to hear of the possible early termination of the dispute that has been in progress during the last two or three weeks. The settlement shows that, after all, instead of rushing into industrial trouble, it is better to call the parties together, so a conference can be held or some conciliatory action taken whereby their dif[103] ferences can be adjusted. I think that the debate in the House has not done harm, but rather some good, since it focussed public attention upon the matter and upon the desirability of reaching a settlement. It was also of indirect assistance to the parties who have since met and as a result of negotiations extending over two or three days, have settled their differences. Although we are not in possession of full particulars regarding what occurred at the conference, or the names of those who took part in it, I think that credit is due, not only to the court, but also to the disputes committee in Victoria, which took u^ this matter. This committee, although it was not a party to the dispute, and is one which is often much abused, got into communication with the contending parties and also with the court, and did its best to bring about a satisfactory result. It is most pleasing to know that its efforts were successful.",61
250,Unknown,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Sitting suspended from 6.2S to 7.30 p.m. LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed.,61
251,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Cowper-Trea surer) [7.30] - It seems extraordinary that a motion which deplores ouradverse balance of trade should have been moved to prevent the Government from giving effect to a reduction of direct taxation, because the most satisfactory method of improving the balance of trade is to increase the total production of Australia, ancl the best means of doing that is to lighten the burden of taxation upon it. The great exports of Australiawool and wheat-whic h tend to make our balance of trade satisfactory, are essentially products of the land, and wool particularly, and wheat to a minor degree, bear practically the whole burden of this tax-so far as it affects the country. In view of that, one wonders at the Opposition bringing forward a motion, which, if given effect, would prevent these industries from receiving a certain measure of relief. I feel sure that when the vote is taken, honourable that members will, in no uncertain fashion, favour remedying the balance of trade as far as possible by giving relief to country industries and industry generally by a reduction of direct taxation. This afternoon the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) quoted from a report which has recently been made to the Queensland Government by the Land Settlement Advisory Board. board is admitted to have made probably one of the most comprehensive and satisfactory examinations which have beeu made of the pastoral position in Queensland, and its conclusions, incidentally, are applicable to the rest of Australia. In its report, special stress is laid on the fact that if these industries which provide so much of 'the export wealth of Australia, are unduly handicapped by vexatious taxation or exorbitant rents, the immediate effect will be to paralyze and strangle them. The report shows conclusively that in the outback country instead of small areas being economical from the point of view of development and output, they are the reverse, and that to induce men with insufficient capital to settle on the land reduces the total output per sheep, lessens the rentals, and decreases the total production of the industry. The board made a strong plea for reductions of taxation in the outback portions of the country. That applies - especially to that taxation which this Parliament some four years ago removed from Crown leaseholds. Certain honourable members today have referred to that action, and the Leader of the Opposition has taken some exception to certain remarks of the Prime Minister regarding Crown leaseholds. At that time the attitude of the Government was consistent. It said that sired to repeal the taxation of Crown leaseholds for two reasons; first, that that tax interfered with State policy-and this report bears that out beyond disputeand secondly, that the industry could not carry this crushing load and that it was practically impossible to administer the tax. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) asked what portions of the tax had been collected. At that time there was in hand something like Â£690,000 of receipts on account of Crown leaseholds, and the proposal of the Government was to repeal that tax, retrospectively to 1917. It was then recognized that even if we did not Dr Earle Page. repeal the tax we would collect very little more than we had already received. Parliament decided that the tax should be continued until 1923, and the Government made every effort to collect it. That Mr Scullin - The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) was prevented this afternoon from speaking on this subject.",61
252,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I am replying to a statement regarding the actual collection of arrears of land tax.,62
253,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I rise to a point of order. I do not wish to, prevent this discussion provided that we can take part in it ; but I would point out that when the honourable member for DalJey (Mr. Theodore) referred to the taxation of leaseholders this afternoon, you, Mr. Speaker, informed him that he could not discuss that subject.",62
254,Mr SPEAKER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS, I do not think so. I intervened while he was replying to an interjection.,62
255,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I wish to reply to a statement made by the honourable member for Yarra in connection with the judgment of the court, and with that object. I am making these preliminary observations. Up to June, 1924, we had been able to collect some Â£909,000. We have continued to collect that tax, but now find that we are in possession of Â£901,000, which is less, by Â£8,000, than the amount we had three years ago. That is due to the fact that a royal commission, of which Mr Duffy,'the secretary of the it de- Labour Council of Victoria, and Mr. Warren Kerr were members, laid down certain lines of action. There have been up to the present, out. of a total of 2,578 Crown leases, some 1,875 cases re-valued, itself and a consequent reduction in tax of Â£887,000.",62
256,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"How much has been collected since the 30th June, 1924?",62
257,Mr SPEAKER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Order ! When the honourable member for Dalley was speaking this afternoon he charged the Treasurer with neglecting to collect arrears of taxation. He continued at some length, and 1 asked him not to discuss the details of that subject. I consider it only fair that the Treasurer should be allowed to reply to the honourable member for Dalley, but I ask him not to discuss details, because the collection of arrears of taxation on leaseholders has no relation to the principle of the bill.",62
258,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I have no objection to this discussion so long as honourable members are given an opportunity to reply. My complaint is that the Treasurer is not giving the whole story.,63
259,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I am trying to place the facts on record.,63
260,Mr SPEAKER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The Treasurer will be given the latitude that was extended to the honourable member for Dalley, but he will not be permitted to discuss details.",63
261,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member for Yarra has asked me what amount of taxation on leaseholds has been collected since June, 1924. As a result of revaluations, we have Â£8,000 less in the Treasury today than we had in 1924.",63
262,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Is it not a fact that in answer to a question the Treasurer stated that he had collected over Â£200,000 of taxes that were outstanding on the 30th June, 1924?",63
263,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That is so; but the refunds have been greater than the collections.,63
264,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That Â£200,000 would have been remitted had the Government had its way in 1923.",63
265,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"After we have been put to considerable trouble and inconvenience, and fought many actions in the court, the moneys in hand are less than they were in 1924. That is a position which I , as Treasurer, very much deplore, because with more money in the Treasury, we would have been able to make'greater reductions in taxation. First of all, the tax on departmental valuations amounted to over Â£2,000,000. There has been a revision of those valuations on the basis of the Royal Commission's report, with a consequent reduction in taxation of some Â£887,000. We have had those valuations tested before the court, and it g'ave a verdict against us on the facts. The honourable member for Yarra this afternoon suggested that the arithmetic of the judge-was at fault, but we obtained legal opinion to the effect that the judge had decided on the facts, and there was not the slightest chance of a successful appeal. We have found it necessary to establish the general principle of taxation and to proceed with other actions to ensure some basis that will bring to an end the complicated question of taxation of Crown leaseholds. I make that statement for the information of the honourable member for Yarra, and for honourable members generally.",63
266,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I brought no charge against the department for not appealing against the decision of the court. I merely discussed and criticized the judgment itself. I . agree that legally there could be no appeal.,63
267,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"We were forced to fight many cases to make certain that we were able to collect this tax. Since the 30th June, 1927, as the result of the application of the new system of valuation, the deductions from the original assessments have amounted to Â£152,000. I wish now to deal at some length with the land tax itself, because the Opposition has suggested that the Government should 'not under any circumstances reduce that tax. The honourable member for Yarra said that there were two specific reasons for the tax, first, to break down large estates; and, secondly, to ensure that the unearned increment would return, in some degree, to the people of this country. The Government does not hold that view in regard to Federal Land Tax. We look upon it more as a means of obtaining revenue, and. although, incidentally, it may have brought about .a certain amount of subdivision, the Government considers that, as a means of subdivision, it is probably the crudest instrument ever devised in the history of mankind. The tax has to be paid out of income, so that it becomes a tax on income measured by relation to land value. From that point of view I wish to examine it, because I do not think it can be successfully contended that the land tax was originally imposed for the purpose of raising revenue. In .1911-12, the year in which it was first brought into operation there was a surplus in the Commonwealth Treasury of Â£1,890,000. The land tax returned Â£1,390,000, so that the actual surplus over and above the land tax was Â£500,000, compared with which our recent surpluses-considered in relation to total expenditure-shrink into insignificance. As a.revenue raising medium the Labour party has never regarded the land tax seriously. It has been regarded as an instrument of subdivision, and as such this Government considers it most clumsy, inefficient, inequitable, and almost useless. An analysis of the land tax returns shows that the bulk of the money is derived from the cities and towns. For instance, in 1911-12, Â£525,455 was obtained from the towns and Â£919,805, or 64 per cent., from the country. In 1912-13, Â£575,871, or 39 per cent., was collected in the towns, and Â£S84,092, or 61 per cent., in the country ; in 1913-14, Â£605,933, or 40 per cent., in the towns and Â£899,S70, or 60 per cent., in the country. In the next few years the figures were disturbed because of the interposition of tax on Grown leaseholds, which brought the receipts from the country back to the earlier proportions, but by 1920-21, notwithstanding that the leasehold tax was still included in the total returns, the towns, were returning 42 per cent, and the country 58 per cent, of the total tax. In 1921-22, the towns returned 45 per cent, and the country 55 per cent., in 1922-23 the towns 46 per cent, and the country 54 per cent. In 1923-24, when the tax upon leaseholds was remitted, the towns yielded 51 per cent., or Â£1,042,000, as against 49 per cent., or Â£999,272, from the country. In 1924-25, the latest year for which I have been able to have the returns analyzed, not less than 55 per cent, of the total tax came from the towns and only 45 per cent, from the country. So that more than half of the revenue yielded by this tax, which was imposed largely for the purposes of sub-division, is derived from town and city lands. Whatever else may be said of the tax it is obvious that it will not bring about any further sub-division. Everybody will admit that it operates to the detriment of industry. If a factory occupies a piece of land worth Â£10,000 and because of the need for doubling the size of the works the company finds it necessary to buy another piece of land along/>Â»-. Marie Page. side at a cost of Â£10,000, because of"" the graduation and cumulative effect, of the tax, the company will pay in respect of the first block of land double theprevious tax. The tax on the second, piece of land also will be doubled, so that the enterprise will have to pay four timesas much tax as it did before the necessity for extending its operations arose. That, instance "" indicates very clearly that this tax really penalizes city in dustries. That is something we do not desire. .We are all anxious to see these industries expand, because asour total production from primary and - secondary industries is increased our chance of correcting the adversetrade balance will be greatly improved. I turn now to the manner in wh.ch the tax operates. Section 99 of the Constitution providesThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. It is constitutionally impossible for a Commonwealth tax to discriminate bet./een city and country lands. In any one State certain areas, by reason of quality of soil, situation, proximity to railways and ports, rainfall, &c, are much better suited for closer settlement than are others. But the federal land tax is an instrument which operates against the just and the unjust alike. It is impossible to discriminate between lands for any of those reasons; but the tax tends to break up the huge areas outback which are held in the only way in which they can return satisfactory rents to the Crown and produce income taxation. At the same time, it penalizes the highly developed areas close to the coast. The various State parliaments have recognized the necessity for discriminating between different areas In ; New South Wales, Mr Loughlin, a member of Mr Lang's Cabinet, introduced to Parliament a measure, the declared object of which was "" to impose a tax for the purpose of promoting agricultural settlement and the subdivision of large estates."" He said definitely that, in his opinion, the land tax was essentially the prerogative of the States, because they could use it not only for taxation purposes, but also for policy purposes in a way not possible to the Federal Parliament. The New South Wales bill prescribed a minimum taxable value of Â£10,000. estates above that amount were to be taxed, but exemption was granted to lands within the western division, lands within the irrigation area-honorabl e members know how rapidly they acquire value and how few acres are necessary to bring a property under the operation of the federal land tax-Crow n lands held for mining purposes, city lands, and land held for agricultural and dairying purposes to a reasonable extent, and lands suitable for grazing only. In addition, deductions of tax were allowed. If in any year a taxpayer put under cultivation a certain specified area he would obtain a deduction of the whole of his tax for the following year. If he put a smaller area under cultivation, the deduction would be proportionately reduced. If in any year a taxpayer sold or leased on share-farming conditions a certain specified percentage of. the land held by him he would obtain a deduction of the whole tax levied in the' following year. The deduction was also extended to a taxpayer who satisfied an advisory board that ho had made a bona fide attempt to sell or lease the specified area. Although it would be competent for a State to make such a law, it is quite beyond the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, and, therefore, a federal land tax can be regarded as a very clumsy sub-divisional implement. I do not deny that it has accelerated to some extent"" the rate of subdivision, but we must not forget th at other factors were, and are, operating in the same direction-increasin g local taxation, the greater economic use to which lands can be put if subdivided and used for other purposes, and the death of the original holders. A thousand different causes operated to bring about subdivision before the federal land tax was imposed, and will continue to operate for thousands of years after this law has been relegated to oblivion. The Government, therefore, can only regard the land tax as one of the sources of direct revenue, and believes that great harm must result if it is not reduced - pari passu with other forms of direct taxation. At the same time we must try to remove anomalies, as this bill proposes to do, and to make its incidence as equitable as possible. In doing so we All should have regard to the danger of compelling an undue subdivision of country lands. The Queensland Land_ Settlement Advisory Board brought out - that fact very clearlyBut, in seeking to obtain a widespread distribution of pastoral wealth amongst the people of the State, it is necessary to take care lest this dominating' influence strangle the industry and defeat the purpose it is striving to attain. That must be the result unless the requirements above enumerated are carefully considered. Economics cannot be ignored. The grazing industry, like other industries, must be conducted on a business basis. The undue subdivision of land would inevitably lead to1. A struggling class of Crown tenants always looking for relief whenever a dry season eventuates. This would cause chaos in land legislation ancl administration. 2. ^Difficulties as to finance, holdings being over-capitalized ancl representing doubtful security to financial institutions. 3. The depreciation of the standard of wool, inasmuch as the selectors could not maintain a sufficient number of breeding ewes to permit of culling, or have the neeessary capital to obtain good flock rams from time to time. 4. A decline in wool output, due to the depreciation of fleeces, and shrinkage in revenue all round. The same report included another paragraph, which I wish to place on recordA policy of high rents, inevitably, would hinder the development of the Crown lands of the State, and without eontiuued development the Government cannot expect increased revenue from the grazing industry. The primary function of the Lands 'Department is to secure land settlement, and then to administer its lands in such a way ns will lead to the greatest development and the greatest production of which the lands are capable. The collection of rents should be regarded as a secondary object. The Government cannot have high rents, high taxation, and development as well.

Paragraph 2 of clause 5 says:NOES. Where in this act the exercise of any power or function by the commissioner or the operaScullin, J. H . tion of any provision of this act, is dependent upon the opinion, belief, or state of Watkins, D. mind of the commissioner in relation to any matter, that power or function may be exer\ . 'es, G.

PAIRS. That is not very clear to me, and I am anxious to avoid the position which might arise if two officials with practically co-equal powers give conflicting rulings.",66
270,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Cowper-Trea sure!) [8.12] - The wording of this section is practically identical with that in the Incom? Tax Act, which deals with a similar maimer. The powers of the assistant commissioner, although considerably widened by this section, would not enable him to give decisions conflicting with those of the commissioner. The commissioner will have power to review any action, decision, or determination of the second commissioner, just as he may review any action, decision, or determination made by himself. By that means position is safeguarded. I think the honourable member will see that the system will work quite well in practice. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7. (Taxable values.)",66
271,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Yarra) [8.13] - I do not propose to raise any objection to this o u n d clause as printed. I think it is a vast the improvement on what we had before; but what I am concerned about is the provision at the end of the clause dealing with taxable values. What is value, and how is it arrived at ? We now have a decision by Judge Rich which is in complete conflict with the previous decision of the F u l l High Court. Judge Rich, interpreting the law in the Jowett appeal case, saidFrom a process of ascertaining what the unimproved land as it would be improved under yproper conditions, is worth, and deducting the cost of improving it , you cannot find what the unimproved value would fetch. That is entirely in conflict with the rulings of the F u l l High Court. Could we not, at the end of this clause, insert paragraphs reading something like thisThe commissioner may ascertain the unimproved value of the land by deducting the value of improvements from the improved value of the land. Where, in the opinion of the commissioner, the land was suitable for sub-division, able value may be obtained by ascertaining what the land would realise in allotments, less the expenses of the sale. There is no reason why we should not define the position specifically. Adverse decisions have been given against the Commissioner of Taxation with regard to the value of land that is suitable for subdivision. The commissioner assessed the value of land for taxation purposes on its value if subdivided, less the cost of subdividing the land, it being in his opinion suitable for subdivision. Such lands were in city areas. Honourable, members know that there is a vast difference between the value of a large estate in the city when it is bought in one piece and when it is purchased after subdivision. I am of the opinion that the commissioner was, quite right in declaring that the value of the unimproved value of the land is the value that it would bring if subdivided, less the cost of subdivision, but the court held the reverse opinion. In another case, where it was a matter of purchasing land upon which to build soldiers' homes under the War Service Homes Abt, and in which the Commonwealth desired to resume at the value of the whole block, the court ruled that the land must be paid for on the value which it would bring if subdivided, less the cost of subdivision. There are two conflicting decisions, both against the Government. If the Treasurer would insert the paragraphs which I have suggested at the end of the clause with which we are dealing it would clarify the position.",66
272,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Cowper-Trea surer) [ f . 2 0 ] - I urge the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) not to press his amendment on this clause. I consider that the right place in which to define unimproved land would be undersection 3 of the principal act, which setsout the definitions. Unimproved value is there defined as meaning. . . . the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realise if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements (if any), thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made. A similar definition exists in practically all the State acts. If we adopted its taxa fresh definition we should immediately put ourselves out of line with the States. Our policy is to try to have our definitions uniform with State and municipal definitions, to reduce the cost of valuation. Our practice with regard to the City of Sydney has been to accept the municipal valuation as theofficial federal valuation. Section 7 of the has principal act is being amended by the clause which we are considering, and it seeks to bring the act into line with the accepted practice of the department. It was only when the commission on Crown leaseholds was examining the act that it was discovered that the actual wording of the act was not in consonance with the practice of the department. We are now endeavouring to rectify the anomaly. I urge the honourable member for Y a r r a to make his suggestion when we reach the end of the bill .",67
273,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I shall postpone m y suggestion until that stage?,67
274,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) during my second-reading speech, addressed a question to mc with regard to the position of a person who had lefÂ».Â°ed or rented a shop. The piece of land on which the shop is erected would be treated as a separate parcel, in terms of paragraph a.",67
275,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Wannon) [8.24] Though this is perhaps not the most appropriate place for me to make my suggestion, it seems to be the only place in which I can bring under the notice of .hp Treasurer a matter affecting both improved and unimproved value, and one which has not, so far, had the cognizance pf the commissioner or his department. Recently, Australian pastoralists have sought the aid of scientific investigation for the betterment of their land. So far that betterment has been in the directiou of improving the pastures, by top dressing with superphosphates, and by the development of new pasture plants. In some cases that treatment has doubled the carrying capacity of the land. Under the present machinery of the act the pastoralist or grazier who undertakes sucb work, is unable to deduct the betterment from the improved price of the land brought about by his enterprise, apart from the annual deduction of the cost of the labour employed to effect the improvements. Thus the progressive man creates a higher valuation of his land for taxation purposes, merely for the benefit of the taxing master. I know of some holdings, particularly along the border of South Australia where "" l i g h t "" country capable of carrying half a sheep to the acre has, by concentrated, up-to-dato methods, been so improved that it will now carry two sheep to the acre. I know that it is not possible for the Treasurer to give an undertaking immediately tu rectify the anomaly, but I trust that he and the Government will carefully consider the position, and allow the progressive pastoralist, grazier, or dairy farmer a fair and reasonable allowance on the betterment effected by his enterprise.",67
276,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Does the honourable member suggest that it should be a deduction from the ascertained unimproved value of the land ?,68
277,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Th. e definition does not permit the Commissioner or his department to allow such a reduction unless, of course, he is able to give a ruling to that effect.",68
278,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"In determining the unimproved value of land, it is assumed that no improvements have been made.",68
279,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is so. As the act stands, the only allowance that can be made is in respect of the value of the improvements which, of course, include those out of sight, which are often very difficult to value. The lifting of timber out of the, soil of Australia has been a herculean task for which our landholders rarely receive sufficient allowance. Graziers, pastoralists and farmers should be given every consideration' in respect of the expenditure of money to improve their properties. The New Zealand dairy farmers and the small fatteners have been considered in this connection,: but w.e are be-* hind the sister dominion in these matters. I know that in some cases in New Zealand land is fertilized twice annually to improve it. I trust that the Minister will assure the committee that he will introduce an amendment to give effect to niy suggstion, or that he will at least inquire whether the existing provisions are sufficiently elastic to allow of this deduction being made. Clause agreed to. Clause 8 agreed to. Clause 9 (Land exempted from tax).  should like to see a new paragraph added to section 13 of the. principal act, which this clause amends, to provide for the exemption from taxation of all lands used for agricultural purposes. The speeches delivered on this measure today lead me to believe that such an amendment would meet with general approval. The ""Treasurer informed us .that the object of this legislation was to break up large estates, and not to obtain revenue. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) stated that, in his opinion, land tax was being paid on less than 1 per cent of our farm holdings. Consequently, the loss of revenue, through the insertion of an amendment such as I have, suggested would not be great. In order that the Treasurer may have an opportunity to consider this proposal, I move- '-That the clause be postponed.",68
280,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Cowper-Trea surer) [8.36] - It would be difficult, if"" not impossible, in the time at our disposal to give proper consideration to the effect of the suggested amendment of the honourable member. Is he proposing that land used for only four months of a year, or land turned over onee, or land used continuously for agricultural purposes should be exempt ? If the honourable member will allow the clause to pass I will undertake to give full consideration to his proposal, with the object, if the posal meets with the approval of the Gobeing vernment, of introducing an amendment to the clause in another place.  undertaking, and ask leave to withdraw my motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.",68
281,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Yarra) [8.36] - The object of this clause is to exempt from taxationAll land owned by, or in trust for, any or body of persons, and used primarily principally for the purposes of athletic sports or exercises (other than horse-racing) and used for the pecuniary profit of the members of that club or body. Oan the Treasurer inform honourable members of the amount of revenue that will be lost if we agree to this I take it that it will exempt golf links. I do not wish to draw distinctions between different kinds of sport; but the Riverssheep dale Golf Links, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, were sold in 1926 for racing purposes. Â£101,000. Two years ago the property was the subject of an appeal against municipal assessment, and its capital value was.then put down at Â£47,600.",69
282,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,How was the property acquired in the first place?,69
283,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I have no idea.; but nothing like Â£101,000 was paid for it. Melbourne has expanded beyond these links in the last few years, and they become very valuable. A number of similar properties in Melbourne and other cities of the Commonwealth will exempt from taxation if this clause agreed to. It is well, therefore, that should consider how far we are prepared to go in this direction. Persons who can afford to occupy a property valued Â£101,000 for the purpose of playing golf upon it could surely well afford to taxation upon it. The municipal authoof rities would suffer a heavy loss of revenue if they were to cease rating properties such as these. Probably, as the Treaany surer pointed out, these areas serve as lungs for our cities, but at the same time they keep much valuable land but of use for residential purposes. I "" have an quiry to make, also respecting the interhas pretation of the latter part of the proit posed new paragraph. I take it that the words, ""not used for the pecuniary profits of the members of the club or probody,"" would prevent any land which'.'is used for the conduct of sport' f ^ r profit coming within exemption. '",69
284,Mr FENTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,What about tin-har/a .,69
285,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Probably the commissioner would not regard tin-hare racing as a sport. In many small country towns fairly large areas of land are used perhaps twice a year for .the conduct of picnic race meetings, the pror club fits of which are usually devoted to and charity. I take it that such areas would not come within the exemption, for nobody would be making auy profit out of thesport.",69
286,Mr HUNTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Shee p are usually, n in on such land to keep the grass down,, and: proposal? a profit is made from them.",69
287,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"If they were running on the land for most of the time, it would not be primarily held for horse We tax all land ,on which sport is conducted for profit.. If the it can be shown that land is used only once or twice a year for horse racing, it is merely a private block of land and is taxable. I shall be glad to hear the Treasurer's explanation on this matter, and to be informed of the revenue that would be lost by including golf links.",69
288,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"East Sydney) [8.46] have When the honourable member for Forrest  clusion of all land used for agricultural be purposes, it was suggested by the Treais surer that the clause should be allowed we to pass, because it could be amended in the other branch of the legislature.",69
289,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I said that I was at prepared to consider the position.,69
290,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Let me remind the pay Minister that this chamber has control all taxation. The other branch of the legislature is a class chamber as at present constituted, and it would take action that it could to remove taxation from the section of the people.that - it represents. It was never intended that legislation should be initiated in that inchamber. The very fact that each State equal representation in it shows that was intended under the Constitution to be a house of review. I should like the Treasurer to reply to this criticism, because I am speaking in the interests of the taxpayers of Australia. We should abide by the terms of the Constitution. We are constantly told that we enjoy constitutional government; but a.jiion such as that suggested by the Treasurer indicates a desire to depart from it. I have always fought for the. ret cniicn of all the privileges of honourable members of the popular chamber. If we allowed such an amendment to pass without raising an objection to it, we should fail in our responsibilities as direct representatives of the people in the House that has control of all taxation.",69
291,Mr EOSTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Wakefield) [8.52] Will the Treasurer say what the practice is today in regard to the taxation of recreation grounds and reserves both in town and country? In my opinion the clause makes the evasion of taxation possible.,70
292,Mr FENTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Maribyrnong) [8.53], - I amplify the remarks by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). He mentioned a golf club that has land for sale. I know another near Melbourne. In several cases large areas are held by these clubs, which have purchased twice as much land in more outlying parts of the metropolitan area. They have bought the additional land at a cheap rate, ancl one club is now about to sell the land that it holds in the Sandringhani district. This is practically at the seaside, and it is very valuable land."" I doubt whether it could be purchased for Â£104,000. I also wish to know whether the royal agricultural societies in the capital cities are affected by land tax proposals of the Government. They all have properties worth considerable sums of money, and, in some cases, they have purchased the land on which the Royal Shows are held. For instance, the Royal Society in Melbourne recently increased its show area, having bought laud at considerable expenss from private owners, even to the extent of buying out an hotel. Without wishing to single out a particular sport : - I recognize that golf is a capital cise-^-I remind the committee that wealthy syndicates and clubs hold large area's of land, and if they are not now required to pay land tax under this bill they ought to be, because the land is owned by wealthy people.",70
293,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Cowper-Treas urer) [8.55J - In order to clear up the points raised I shall read section 13 of the principal act. It states:The following lands shall be exempt from taxation under this act, namely:(a) all land owned by a State, or by a municipal, local, or other public authority of a. State; (6) all land owned by a Savings Bank regulated by any State net; (o) all land owned by any society registered under a State act relating to friendly societies or trade unions; {d) all land owned by any building society registered as a building society under any aet or State aet, not being land of which the society has become owner by foreclosure of a mortgage; (e) all land owned by or in trust for ,i charitable or educational institution, if the institution, however formed orconstituted, is carried on solely for charitable or educational purposes and not for pecuniary profit; (/) all land owned by or in trust for a religious society, the proceeds whereof are devoted solely to the support of the aged or infirm clergy or ministers of the society or their wives or widows or children, or to religious charitable or educational purposes; (g) all land owned by or in trust for any person' or society and used or occupied by that person or society solely as a site for(1) a place of worship for a reli- gious society, or a place of residence for any clergy or minister or order' of a religious society; (2) a charitable or educational institution not carried on for pecuniary profit: (3) a building owned and occupied by a society, club or association not carried on for pecunary p r of it ; ; (4) a public library, institute, or museum; (5) a show ground; (0) a public cemetery or public burial ground; (7) a public garden, public recreation ground, or public reserve: (8) a public road; or (9) a fire brigade station; Those are the existing exemptions and it is desired to extend them, for the reason exerthat I gave in my second-readirtg speech, to tennis, cricket, bowling and golf dubs and certain other sports clubs. The words "" other than horse racing"" are inserted to qualify "" athletic sports or exercises."" The amount involved is only a few hundred pounds. A tax of Â£100 is a fairly severe one for a club whose grounds nre used purely for recreation purposes. It is felt that in the suburban areas around our big cities it would be a pity to enforce the premature subdivision of these large grounds. It is recognized that u l t i mately they will be purchased and either presented to the public byphilanthropic citizens or nought up and used for building purposes, but nobody can help regretting that the same care was not exercised in the lay-out of some of our suburban areas as was the case in Melbourne and Adelaide. Therefore, there is little risk of a big loss of revenue. Although it is possible that certain areas are very valuable, I suggest that the committee might accept the clause. Clause agreed to. Clause 30 (Taxpayer to furnish returns) ",70
294,Mr DUNCAN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"HUGHES (Boothby[8.59] - Sectio n 15 of the principal act, as proposed to be amended by clause 10 of the bili will read(1) For tlic purposes of tlic assessment ancl levy of liiiid tax, every taxpayer shall in each financial year, in the prescribed manner, and within llie prescribed time, furnish returns setting forth a full and complete statement of all laud owned by him at midnight on the thirtieth day of June then lust past In lln; original section the word "" n o o n "" appears.

"" (4) Whenever there has been a change of ownership of the whole or part of an area of land or of an interest in an area of land, the commissioner may, for the purpose of the assessments of the remaining years comprising the triennial period during which the change of ownership took place, cause the value of the area or interest or of the respective parts into which it has been divided to be altered or increased.

297,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Y a r r a ) [9.5] - This clause repeals sections 20 and 21 of the principal act. It provides for triennial assessments, and takes from the commissioner the power to value annually, and to make re-assessments retrospective g h t ?"" I spoke on this subject on the second reading, and do not desire to traverse the whole of the ground again. As I hatv already pointed out, if we take from the commissioner the power to make an annual valuation of land, we shall, on the admission of the Treasurer, lose Â£S0,000 a year in revenue, but I estimate that the loss will be considerably more than that. The estimate of loss for the first year is Â£80,000, for the second Â£160,000; and for the third year, n i L But in the next three years the relativeincrease in values will be greater. Whyshould we losa that revenue? There areareas of land in Australia that will remain at .one valuation, perhaps for a number of years, but other areas-, such large areas as golf links adjacent to cities, although of low value today, will,, as the cities spread, rapidly increase in value.",71
298,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"In some cases, the valus has doubled in one year.",71
299,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is so. Many of those areas are held undoubtedly for speculative purposes, because they arc being put to no use today. The owners are waiting for the extension of railways and tramways so that the land can be subdivided into suburban blocks. In the meantime they should pay taxes on thereal value of the land as ascertained from time to time by the department. Under this clause we shall deliberately take from the commissioner the power to value that land except once in three years.",72
300,Mr EODGEBS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"If land is subdivided, it can be valued.",72
301,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"When areas are sub-divided for home building purposes, the allotments are usually valued at less than Â£5,0(50, and are, therefore, free from land t&x. It is before they are subdivided ithat they should be assessed for taxation [purposes.",72
302,Mr EODGEBS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The unsold portion of the estate may be re-assessed. . Mr Scullin - Usuall y large estates are completely subdivided. Two arguments in favour of the clause have been advanced, first, that. assessments at present are not made every year, and may not be made for five or six years, and secondly, that there are not sufficient valuers in the department to travel every year through Australia making reassessments. I admit that there are difficulties.",72
303,Mr FOSTER,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,An annual valuation is too costly.,72
304,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"There is no need for an annual valuation, but why take that power from the Commissioner? I suggest that this is being done for no good and sound reason. The Treasurer argued that these re-valuations were costly and difficult,, and brought forth numerous protests. I suggest that there would be less protest if values were increased annually rather than every three years, when the accumulated increases in value would be taken into account. The Labour party favoured the retention of the present land tax rate, but this House has decided against that. ' It has affirmed the principle that there should be a general reduction in land tax. Let us accept that decision for the. time being. Surely we sbould not be prepared to lose Â£80,000 a year by placing a low valuation on some land, and the correct valuation on other land. One principle of taxation is that it should be equitable in its incidence. I submit that this loss of Â£80,000 a year cannot be justified. What has been wrong with the practice in the past ? Not one word has been said by the Treasurer to indicate that the powers possessed by the Commissioner have been abused or have caused difficulty. For seventeen years this power has remained in the hands of the Commissioner, and now it is proposed to take it from him. Land assessments are to be made every three years, despite the fact that large areas of land in and around the cities are likely to increase enormously in value within a short period because of the extension of railways and tramways. The clause also provides for the abolition of the power of the Commissioner to make ru-assessments retrospective for two years.",72
305,Mr EODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,That will be beneficial.,72
306,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The honourable member is entitled to his opinion, and I am also entitled to mine. The Commissioner is charged by the law to collect the taxes justly, and there is nothing good in the proposal to deprive him of the power to make re-assessments, although obvious mistakes may have been made by the taxpayers or the taxation assessors. Every business man would claim the right to send to a customer an amended account if a mistake had been made in the original. Two years is not a long period within which to re-assess land tax. The Income Tax Assessment Bil l allowed the Commissioner three years in which to reassess, and not one word of protest came from the honourable member for Wannon when the amending bill was before the committee.",72
307,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I think I did speak on that.,72
308,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I gave very close attention to the bill during the three days it was in committee, and I heard no such protest from the honourable member; certainly none came from the honourable member for Angas. Land may have been omitted from a return because the owner did not think that his holding was taxable. I am leaving out of consideration attempted evasion.. The Commissioner has power to deal with sueh attempts by making a retrospective valuation.  Titles Ofiice will tell the department all - that it wants to know. Mr Scullin"" - In theory, what the honourable member says was correct; one can find out a lot if he applies to the right place at the right time; but those who have"" studied the administration of the Land Tax Department know that, despite the records of the Titles Office and other documentary evidence, the department again and again has found reassessments absolutely necessary. It is quite a common practice to make reassessments retrospective for two years; as a matter of fact, even that limitation has been responsible for the loss of a lot of revenue. The royal commission that inquired into the taxation of Crown leaseholds heard evidence from responsible men about the difficulties created by the limitation of two years. Now the Treasurer proposes to abolish this retrospective power, although experience has demonstrated the need for it. The prof )Osal is unwarranted, and will mean a oss of revenue. If the relief were equally distributed over all taxpayers, might be included with the general reductions which are part of the Government's policy, but I am certain the Government will not say that it favours a reduction of taxation in respect of one section and not in respect of another. For the reasons I have mentioned, I shall vote against the clause.",72
309,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"East Sydney) [9.19] - I strongly object to the proposed curtailment of the Commissioner's powers, which hitherto have been exercised most satisfactorily. I have in mind two land transactions that indicate the need for the power of re-assessment. The erection of the North Shore bridge in Sydney has led to a considerable increase in the values of adjacent land, and one family sold out its holding at a price four times as great as it would have received two or three years ago. The Commissioner should have power to collect taxation in respect of that unearned increment. Another family sold some houses and land at Darlinghurst, and one of the partners in the auctioneering firm of Hardy and Gorman said to me, "" If you had told me three months ago that this land would be sold for Â£103 a foot I would have laughed at you."" It was a Saturday afternoon sale.",73
310,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,But that sale would come within the scope of the tax.,73
311,Mr WEST,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The family owned land other than that which was sold. The proceeds of the sale amounted to Â£14,000, but I believe that if the value of the unsold land were added, the tax payable by the family would have been 6d. in the Â£1. It would be unwise to deprive the Commissioner of power to collect extra taxation in respect of land, the value of which has risen suddenly and considerably. The Treasurer would do well to heed the objection raised by ihe honourable member for Yarra.",73
312,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.24] - The triennial valuation is not a new principle in Australia. It is operated by municipal and shire councils in Now South Wales and Queensland. The valuation is made at the beginning of each triennial period. In regard to re-assessments, land tax is in a different category from incometax, and it the department has sufficient experience of land values* to be able to make ar assessment in the current year, except in the uncommon instances in which land values rise suddenly.",73
313,Mr SCULLIN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Annua l valuations arc in force in Yictoria.,73
314,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The department is of opinion that it has sufficient information to assess the approximate value of land, and it will be generally admitted that retrospective assessments coming to hand a couple of years after taxation has been paid interfere seriously with land transactions and make it impossible for land-owners to know where they stand.",73
315,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,Hunter) [9.25] This clause contains two important provisions. The Treasurer has brushed aside very lightly the objections to the proposed triennial valuation. Tn most of the States municipal valuations are made annually. Mr M. CAMERON - In South. Australia .they are made for three years ahead.,73
316,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"In Sydney the valuation is annual, and I am under the impression that all municipalities in New South Wales may call upon the Valuerday, General at any time to make a special valuation",73
317,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,-The valuation in City of Sydney is triennial.,74
318,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"It may have been altered, but I think that the power call in the Valuer-General remains. The commissioner will have no such power.",74
319,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"He will not need it, because he will assess the value.",74
320,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"For three years ahead. It is strange that, at this in the country's history, when we can i afford to lose revenue, the Government should be proposing an amendment that will mean the surrender of Â£80,000 a year. Hitherto the annual valuation proved quite satisfactory, but for reason undisclosed that power has been taken from the commissioner. In both income and land tax returns mistakes occur which are not discovered for some considerable time. Having regard to the fact that values of land increase rapidly the commissioner should have the power of annual valuation. During the last three or four years the value of lands in Newcastle has doubled. If the triennial valuation is adopted, the owners may sell next year for twice the amount upon which they have been paying taxato tion. Why should not the Treasury get some benefit from the unearned increment on that land? They did not increase the value. It was increased because of the creation of ' public utilities, because of the new works established in the neighbourhood, aud because of the growth of population. Now we propose to allow the speculators to the benefit of those increases. There are speculators operating in all areas. wealthiest people in Australia, have their money by speculating in land, they can afford to pay the tax. I cannot understand what justification there relieving the in of taxation to the extent of Â£S0,000 a year. But this Government throws thousands and millions about, as had if they were nothing. It is necessary, of land however, that we should face the ecoposed. nomic position as it exists today. Things are looking bad, and there great stringency in the money market. It is very difficult to obtain money to carry out any developmental work toand while the country is face to face with so serious a position, and we may look forward to a big reduction the of revenue for the next year or two, the Government proposes to throw away Â£80,000 a year by making these revaluato tions only every three years. What objection could a man have to paying just taxation on his land? If the land increases in value why should he not pay taxation on that value? If he subdivides and sells, he recives the whole of the increased value of the land. I am surtime prised at this amendment, and I do not l l like to say what is in my mind concerning it. It would appear that the Government is looking about to see how it can amend legislation so as to give some has benefit to the already wealthy people. some We do not do the same thing for the poorer people of the community. It is impossible .to point .to any legislation passed in this Parliament during the last three years that has benefited the poor people. Parliament is constantly giving so back something to the rich, relieving them of direct taxation, and at the same time placing additional burdeus on the some poorer people. The present system is fair, but the system of triennial valuation is not. If land doubles in value in three years, and a man sells it just prior the time for revaluation, he obtains the benefit of the whole of the increased value. It is surely a fair thing that the commissioner should have power to deal retrospectively with land valuations. I venture to say that, if we were in the position to get full information, we should find that there are hundreds of cases in which some mistake bas been reap made in valuation. I do not say that they have been wilful mistakes, but misThe takes can be made by men sending in made their returns, and in this way wrong and valuations have been made. Why should not the commissioner have power to deal is for retrospectively with these cases?",74
321,Dr EARLE PAGE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Where a mistake been made regarding the inclusion in a return, no time limit is imThe act states that where any interest in land has not been included in is the assessment the commissioner may deal retrospectively with the case.",74
322,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"But suppose it has been included, and there has been some mistake in regard to the value, perhaps a big mistake. It may not be discovered at the time, but comes to light later. Why should the commissioner not have the power, as he has under the Income Tax Act, to go back over a period of three years and rectify the error ? Departments like this cannot be run properly unless extensive powers are given to the commissioner. No system of valuation can be completely satisfactory. Mistakes will inevitably occur even under the most capable officers. If it were posgree sible to get the exact figures, we should probably learn that as much as Â£1,000,000 has been recovered by the department through the Commissioner being able to go back and make re-valuations. We should base measures of this kind upon what is a fair thing between the taxpayer and the State. We should not make any concession to any one. It is possible there may be deliberate wrong-doing on the part of individuals, and we. should not allow them to escape their obligations. A person may wilfully mislead the Commissioner, and thus have his property undervalued. Under this proposal there would be no way of dealing with the position.",74
323,Mr DUNCAN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"HUGHES - That is provided for in the bill. It comes under the heading of evasions. . Mr CHAELTON - I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment as placed before the committee by the honourable member for Yarra, and allow the commissioner to investigate these matters from time to time. In connection with taxatiou matters, it is absolutely necessary that the Commissioner should have power at any time to rectify mistakes that might have been made. Tliat provision has been in operation for a long time, and why should we now make an amendment which will cost the Treasury Â£80,000? There is no justification, so far as I can see, for the Government's proposal.  support the clause. I think that it is high time that some limit was placed upon the period during which the Commissioner of Taxation can review returns. The department has limited the period in which the taxpayer may lodge an appeal, and the time of the Commissiener should be limited also. A sense of justice should always be shown by the Government towards its citizens. The time given here is ample for the department to examine the returns properly. It is a serious thing for. citizens to feel in an unsettled condition due to the power of the Commissioner to review their valuation at any time whatsoever. I hope the Government will safeguard the rights of the citizens in that matter to the same dethat it has cared for the rights of the department. I know of a cas.e in point, under the State taxation system in Western Australia, in which a judge of the court gave an interpretation of the Taxation Act"". One of the members of the State Parliament deducted expenditure in connection with wire netting, which he had bought for that vermin-proofing paddocks. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction. It was taken to the Chief Justice of Western Australia for an interpretation of the act, and he upheld the contention of the taxpayer. Now the Commissioner refuses to allow taxpayers any review of their returns, and he absolutely refuses the man who appealed to the^ court any reassessment of his returns beyond the year in which the decision was given. But the act was not altered; the judge merely interpreted it. That is the ""kind of thing that creates a feeling of insecurity and injustice in the minds of citizens. Citizens are apt to say that if the department is going to play these tricks upon them they will see. what tricks they can play on the department. In the case to which I have referred the taxpayer has again carried the matter to the court, aud he has been granted the right to cue the department to 'secure justice. I think that this amendment is along the right lines. The citizen wants to know where he stands. The department will not go back for more than three, years in connection with the taxpayer's appeal, no matter how just the claim may be. Some sort of reciprocity should exist between the taxpayer and the department.",75
324,Mr FENTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Maribyrnong) [9.43] I support the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader in what they have said regarding the ro-valuation of land on the three-yearly basis. This proposal seems to me to be an underhand method of tax remission. Jt is a well-known fact-and 1 can give illustrations of it-that where a new way line is constructed, or a public utility is created, land values immediately rise. Everybody knows that land values increase where a new line is built, sometimes us soon as the line is authorized. Under this proposal, however, the department will not be allowed to re-value the land for taxation purposes even after a great increase in value has taken place, due to the expenditure of public money. What huge values, for instance, are going to be put ou to property adjacent to the great Murray Waters Scheme. In that area there has been great expenditure by three States and the Commonwealth combined. Millions of pounds have been, spent, and the value of the land has been increased by nearly Â£500,000. The electricity scheme, another public utility which has very extensive ramifications, has also added to the value of land. We are providing that the commissioner is to authorize only triennial valuations. Except in very exceptional circumstances he is debarred from making any other revaluation.  ten years for a re-valuation in Canberra.",75
325,Mr FENTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"The position is not analogous, as Canberra is a self-contained area. The one thing that reconciles me to Canberra is the perpetual leasehold _ system which obtains here.

The whole party opposite would be "" in the soup "" if he did, as they have not another leader in sight. This Government should husband every penny of its resources with a view to reducing our huge debt. Instead of that it is throwing away thousands of pounds in all directions. But, unfortunately, were I to spend my last ounce of strength and my last word in opposing this concession, I should create no more impression on the Government than I would on a desk. Honourable members opposite never dare to vote against the Government. They are dumb, driven cattle and always answer to the whip when it is cracked over their heads.

If we had the time we could make up a very considerable list of gifts that have been made to the wealthy people of Australia at a time when Australia is distressfully situated.

The object of the amendment is to exempt from the appeal to the court all questions which relate to the value of the land. I am agreeable to the appointment of a is rereal valuation board; but I shall vote against the proposal if the taxpayer is to be given the right to go over its head to the court to obtain a review of his valuation. The Treasurer pointed out in his second-reading speech on the bill that the Government, proposed to give special representation to the taxpayers on the lodge with board. Por example, if the question at issue related to the value of pastoral lands, a person thoroughly experienced in the pastoral industry would represent them; but if it involved the valuation of suburban lands, a person competent to express an opinion on that subject would be appointed. A board so constituted would be valuable; but it would be r i d i culous for us to set it up and permit a with taxpayer to go over its head to a court to have his valuation reviewed. Judges are trained in law and probably they are impartial in their outlook; but they haye given some wretched decisions in matters of valuation. What amazes me is that the Treasurer is disinclined to accept amendment. If he will not accept shall vote against the whole do not see why we should go to the expense of establishing the board unless we make it do the work for which it was appointed. If it could be shown that the judges of the High Court or the. Supreme Courts have knowledge of land valuation superior to that of the members of the board, I could understand the objection taken to the amendment. Appeals are made from a lower court to a higher court, because the judges in the court of appeal are supposed to be more highly trained than those presiding over the lower tribunal: but nobody would argue that a judge could give a better decision than a board of experts on a matter of valuation. . should be throwing money away if , havties, ing appointed a Valuation Board, we did not allow it to act as a final board appeal.",77

When he has once made election, he is committed to the board as the final arbiter on all matters, except on points of law; but it would be wrong to set up a new board to which he might go, and, at the same time, to take him his right to go to the court.

Speaking as a land owner, I should prefer the decision of such a board. I suggest that we should wipe out - the Valuation Board altogether unless its decisions are to be final and definite so far as land valuation is concerned. I cannot conceive of any High Court or the Supreme Court having more knowledge of land valuation than this board will have. If a question of law were involved, I should agree with the Treasurer; but on questions affecting the valuation of land I prefer that appeals should be made only to the Valuation Board, and that it should decide the issue once and for all. Mr M. CAMERON (Barker) [10.21]. - The composition of the Valuation Board is at present unknown, but we hope that capable men with a knowledge of land valuation will be appointed to it, that little or no objection can be taken it by the taxpayers.

Surely a board of this character will be best able to hold the scales of justice evenly between the two parties. I cannot understand why these openings are provided to enable disgruntled people, who are either wealthy enough to experiment with the law Or who have a passion for litigation, to go to the High Court. We should give to the taxpayer every opportunity to get justice, and that opportunity will be afforded by the appointment of a competent board. The Treasurer has said that if this provision is not agreed to this Parliament - will have to answer many complaint"". Prom Avhom will they come? Is there .any section of the community so anxious about this matter that if the provision proposed by the Treasurer is not agreed to complaints will be made?",80
356,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,I cannot conceive of - that.,80
357,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"I regard the statement of the Treasurer as mere bluff. I clo not suppose that half a dozen men .outside this House know that this provision is in the bill. This Parliament should definitely decide that a board con .stituted as the bill proposes, shall be the final arbiter on all matters, except those ^involving points-of law.  The appointment of this board is long overdue, but the Leader of the Opposition has not grasped the reasons that have actuated the Treasurer in proposing it. For many years the taxpayers have laboured under a great disadvantage in that they have no right of appeal from the decisions of the commissioner except to the High Court. A large number of taxpayers interviewed the Treasurer and asked that some tribunal should be provided to adjust any differences that might arise between taxpayers and the commissioner. In asking for the appointment of a board of valuation they did not contemplate that they would be deprived of the right to go to the High Court if they preferred. This matter affects farmers primarily, and unlike some other sections of the community, they are men of reason and sense. An eminent lawyer once said to me, ""Don't go to law, if you can avoid it . "" That is the farmer's view. Litigation, they know, is expensive, and they will not go to law if they can get justice otherwise. I am entirely opposed to the federal land tax. I do not think it should be within the power of this Parliament to legislate on this matter ordinarily. I am aware that a section in the Constitution enables us to impose direct taxation in times of national emergency. The. great war was such an emergency. Hut I hope that before long the Commonwealth Parliament will see fit to evacuate this field of taxation. This board will have duties to perform which, I maintain, will be much better performed by a board containing at least one practical member than is usually the case in High Court proceedings. It will have to thresh out matters which have not been thoroughly threshed out in the past. Complaints are made by farmers that when their assessments are reviewed by the commissioner, and when their cases go to the High Court, none of those who consider the matter have a proper conception of what unimproved value means. .That is not surprising. I have heard some most extraordinary statements made by honourable members on the other side when dealing with the question of unimproved values of land in the outback. One sees that after returned soldiers and others have gone on to virgin Mallee land with an upset value of 5s. an acre, and have - turned it into fruitfu l farming land by rolling the scrub aud burning it off, stump picking, putting up fences, cultivating the ground and putting feltilizers into it, the valuer is apt to assess the value of the land, not - what it was, but according to what it is. It is because I believe that this board will save, the deserving taxpayer from unjust taxation, and because I believe that it will, in the long run, save the Commissioner of Taxation himself many headaches, that I support the Government's proposal, which provides for the establishment of a board of experts, and, at the same time, preserves the inherent rights of the taxpayer to appeal to the highest court in the land .  order to simplify the work of the board, I think it would be a good thing if this Parliament were to define more clearly what the unimproved value of land really is. The definition set down in the act is""'Unimproved value,"" in ' relation moaiiK the capital sum which the feesimple of the land might be expected to realise if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would rc-quiro, assuming that the improvements (if any) thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title hud not been made. If you are selling an hotel or a shop, you : get a certain goodwill value for it. contend that the man who goes back and - develops virgin land, and brings it into a state of productivity, is entitled to some .goodwill respecting it. He has helped to create the increased value, and the public is not entitled to take it all. A ; going concern is worth more than one that is closed up. It would be a fair thing if a large percentage were deducted from a valuation for a man's own right, as having developed the land and increased its value. It is he who, in part at any rate, has created the increased value of the land. The people in the - city have done nothing towards it. It is knowledge of this fact that creates a great - deal of heartburning, and that leads to many appeals to the court. I would not be satisfied to leave the determination of great issues such as these in the hands of si couple of officials.",80
358,Mr HURRY,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Bendigo) [10.47] - In reference to the point of view put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), and backed up by the Leader of the Opposition himself (Mr Charlton), it seems to me that proposed new section 44 K is really for the protection of the taxpayer. 1 do not think we need worry very much about the protection of the Government in this matter, because the Government is very well able to look after itself. Speaking as a practising solicitor, I can say that a taxpayer hesitates a long while before fighting the Governmeut, and it is only on an important principle that he will think of going to the High Court. If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the assessment he has two choices: he can ask for it to be referred either to the Valuation Board or to the High Court. He need not go to the High Court unless he pleases; he can have his appeal heard by the Valuation Board, and the decision of that board is final, subject only to an appeal to the High Court on a question of law. If he desires to go before the to land, board, the procedure is provided for in section -44 L. Section 44 L (7) provides that the commissioner or the taxpayer may appeal from the board's decision to the High Court if the matter involves a question of law, and then only.",81

I think that is all we need really look to in the present instance. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.49]. - I am surprised that the Government does not accept this amendment. I understood that the bill was introduced to simplify the making of appeals, and that taxpayers, instead of having to go to the law courts might have matters settled by experts on a board created for that special purpose. Now, however, we find that instead of setting up a board with final powers, the lawyers want to give the right of going to the High Court, and, I suppose, of going from there to the Privy Council. There must be some finality-. But it is in keeping with the policy of the Government to create an-, other board. It has not created one so far this week, and I suppose it is time that something was done in that direction. Ministers appear to consider that it is time that another board was created. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put forward a common sense proposition, which has my support. We contend that the board appointed for this work should be the final court of appeal.  appeal to the High Court except on a question of law. Mr E. RILEY - I protest against the formation of any more boards, which are a menace to the country.",81
363,Mr DUNCAN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"HUGHES (Boothby) [10.52] - I was rather surprised tc hear the objection of the Leader of the Opposition to the clause as it stands. It seems to be sufficiently probable that a judge would follow the decision of the Valuation Board unless there were very good reason for doing otherwise. The evidence would have been before the Valuation Board, and the judge would naturally start off with a prejudice in favour of what the board had decided. I disagree with the honourable member's statement that no judge has any knowledge of land values. I know personally that there are some judges who have a very shrewd knowdedge of land values. Had the matter merely been one in which it was possible to clearly separate questions of fact from questions of law, it would have been simple, but there are questions of mixed fact and law. Some years ago, in the High Court, following on a decision by the Supreme Court, it was held that the sale value of a property was not necessarily the value of the land, but that the sale value could be very greatly increased by the terms that were granted in the conditions of sale. In other words, if land is sold for Â£10 an acre it may be worth only Â£8, but the conditions of sale which are granted may add to its capital value. I ask honourable members was that decision of the High Court on a question of law, or on a question of fact? Personally, I incline to the view that it was common sense applied to fact. It is obviously desirable that a court like that should decide the point, whether the sale value is the real value, or whether by altering the conditions of sale it may be made an unreal value. I suggest that the matter is not simple. I have no doubt that there are other cases in which law and fact are almost inextricably involved, and it seems to me to be sound that this matter should rest with an ultimate appeal to the High Court. After all, the taxpayer can form a reasonable an opinion as to whether it would be wise for him to go on fighting the case.",82
364,Mr CHARLTON,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"That is not what is provided. The appeal may be either to the Valuation Board or the High Court, not to botli.",82
365,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,The appeals are only on questions of law. There is no appeal from the valuation.,82
366,Mr DUNCAN,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"HUGHES - A man under the suggested amendment of the honourable member for Yarra cannot have his objection treated as an appeal ou the question of valuation. I can see no flaw in my argument. If I am wrong, I hope that I shall be corrected by some honourable member. I suggest that these things are not easy to separate, and it is well that there should be a reference to the High Court just as there is to the other board.",82
367,Mr THEODOBE,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Dalley) [10.57] The point covered by the amendment seems to me to be perfectly clear. I feel quite sure that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) is mistaken as to the intention of the amendment. It will not prevent an appeal to the High Court on questions other than valuations, but reserves questions involving valuations for the board that is set up,"" which seems rational. The argument of the honourable member for Yarra is that any court of legal jurisdiction is not necessarily the best authority to settle questions of valuation, and may often be the least desirable to go into such matters. Valuation must be left to experts. Wo doubt the Valuation Board would be selected because of the special knowledge of its members. Possibly the personnel would be a movable one. If the board were considering the valuation of country lands or city lands its personnel could be adjusted accordingly. As provision is made in. the new clause for the making of valuations on those terms, the honourable member for Yarra proposes that in paragraph b of this sub-clause, where the taxpayer is satisfied, he may request the Commissioner to treat his appeal as an appeal to the High Court, but only on matters other than those relating to valuation. That appears to be reason. able, and will inflict no hardship on the taxpayer.",82
368,Mr RODGERS,IRO N AND STEEL PRODUCTS,"Wannon) [10.59] - It appears to me that the Government has altogether overlooked the fact that it remodelled the whole provisions of the previous bill, and substituted section 44, which contains the procedure for appeal. It has clothed and furnished the valuation board with ample authority, provided deliberately for its constitution, and has gone to no end of trouble to perfect the new system-and then it deliberately .gives the taxpayer the right to avoid that board altogether. The giving of this choice will mean that we shall get nowhere. I submit that ample machinery is provided to protect the legal rights of both the Commissioner and the land-holder, for either party would be able to appeal to the High Court or the Supreme Court on any question excepting that of valuation. I should be the last to take from a citizen the right of appeal on a question of law to the highest tribunal in the land; but it would be folly for us to set up this .expert valuation board and then permit a taxpayer or the Commissioner to go over its head to a court. The honourable member for Boothby said that the court would probably accept the valuation of the board ; but I point out that the ease would go to the court without heing submitted to the - board. Seeing that the board will have as its chairman a gentleman who would give his whole time to the work, and as its othor members would be thoroughly competent valuers, we should not permit either party to disregard it. It should be the final authority on all questions of valuation. Question-That the words proposed to be inserted be so inserted (Mr SotrLinr's amendment) - put.
