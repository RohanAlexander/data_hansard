1,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"I rise to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question relative to the payment of the sugar bounty. In order to make the question clear, I may mention that a few months ago the sugar-growers in North Queensland complained that they were put to considerable inconvenience owing to the delay in the payment of the bounty. This was rectified for a time, but the sugar-growers are again experiencing, similar delay in getting the - money paid, andmuch inconvenience is also caused to the workers. I hold in my hand a telegram, which was addressed to Senator Chataway from Mackay, and which reads as followsCustoms without money again,' dozens farmers anxiously waiting, shake Minister up. Will the Minister be good enough to state the reason for the non-payment of the bounty, and to sec that in future it is paid promptly and regularly?",14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I promise the honourable member to look into the matter, and to ascertain if there is any delay. DUTIES ON DRESSED TIMBER .",15
3,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he has yet given consideration to the representations of the deputation of timber merchants which waited upon him in Sydney in reference to the anomalies in the new duties on dressed timber, and, if so, will he, instruct his officers to give effect to his expressed 'mention to make no alteration in the old duties thereon?.",15
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I certainly shall not give any instructions, because the matter does not come within my Department. I shall speak to the Minister.",15
5,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The honourable member promised a deputation that he would.,15
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable compelled member is quite wrong. I promised a deI putation that I would inquire into the matter, and I also said that the only place in which the matter could be dealt with was in Committee of Ways and Means when the item was reached.

14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the honourable member about to ask a question ?,15
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No , sir; I wish to refer very shortly to a leading article in the Age of the 14th September, with reference to myself. In supporting its views, in opposition to party government in Australia on the British model, the Age made me say in my remarks of the 12th inst., when replying to the honourable member for Coolgardie's statement as to my constituencyI did not believe in high duties then any more than I do now. But the well-understood principle of loyalty to the Government' policy me to vote for what I disbelieved in. am not now a member of any Government, and I shall vote according to my conscience. This statement is printed between inverted commas, and is, therefore, likely to convey the impression that it'' is a report of what I actually said, which is not the case. It implies that I said that I had voted against my conscience in the cases referred to, which is also not a fact. The fixing, of a duty is question of practical'judgment and not of I have not referred to Hanbut in the Age of the 13th inst., I am reported as follows- "" On the question for> the adjournment Sir John Forrest said it was a well-known rule sink that members who joined Governments had to their individual opinions in many matters to unless they were matters of conscience or so that one could not long retain his position in the Government. That is what I did say. ELECTOR AL DEPARTMENTS . *",15

17,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Every effort is being made by the Department of Home Affairs to bring about unity of action as nearly as possible. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.,16
18,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"I desire Fostmaster-General whether, .in view . of break-downs to machinery on steamers, it his intention to take into consideration the low :question of the early establishment of a system of wireless telegraphy on the coast contained of Australia?",16

20,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I desire to Acting Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister of Defence, whether his atnexion tention has been called to the result of test applied by the National Rifle Associafairs, tion to the cadet ammunition as supplied in New South Wales, and, if so, whether steps be will be taken to have that defective ammuColonial nition recalled and proper ammunition plied in its place?",16

The Minister of Defence is in Sydney at the present time, making tofromprotect inquiry into that amongst otheir honourable member may depend upon it that the Government will not lose sight such a serious state of affairs as is repreto statesented. STEAM TRAWLER.",16
22,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"asked the Minister reprecan senting the Minister off Home Affairs, upon - notice I. Has the lowest tender for constructing the steam trawler been finally accepted ? 2. If not, what is the reason for the delay? 3. Is it likely that some other tender will be accepted ?",16
23,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions. are as follow :1. No. 2. Consideration of ' the tenders received volved inspections and reports by Commonwealth officers in respect of the works of the tenderers. It also involved negotiations with a view to securing satisfactory guarantees for completion of the contract, and securing the exCommonwealth against any possible loss. 3. No. It is probable that fresh tenders will be called.",16

25,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The answers to the is honourable member's questions are as fol1 and 2. The replies to these questions are in the reply given to the honourable member for Yarra in reply to question No. 1 on the notice-paper of today. 3.

26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"the Acting ask the Minister of External Affairs1. Did the authorities of the Presbyterian Church submit a list of grievances in conwith their mission work in the New the Hebrides to the Minister for External A f and afterwards to the Acting Minister? 2. Was a request made that these grievances. forwarded for the consideration of the Office, and was the request declined? 3. Has any inquiry been made into these supgrievances by the Government? 4. What is the reason for declining to conthe grievances of citizens of the Commonwealth made in a proper and respectful 5. Is it not the special and primary function of the Department of External Affairs the citizens of the Commonwealth injustice in any part of the world, inthinlgs. The cluding the New Hebrides?",16
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In reply to of the honourable gentleman's questions, I beg 1. Communications have been received from the authorities of the Presbyterian Church, concerning the New Hebrides, but none of them be described as a list of grievances. 2. It has been the invariable practice to transmit all representations made to the proper authorities, whether or not a request has been made to forward the communications. They have been sent, sometimes to the Colonial Office, sometimes'to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, or His Excellency the Admiral, and. sometimes to all of these authorities. No representations made to the Government relating to the New Hebrides have been delayed or ignored. In every instance they have been promptly dealt with. 3. No independent inquiry into the asserintions made has been conducted by this Government, for none was possible. The New Hebrides are not within the Commonwealth, and this Government has no jurisdiction over any of the officials, British or foreign, who are intrusted with the government of the group. 4. No request to consider grievances of Australians has ever been declined. If the honourable member will submit his authority for the suggestion that anything of the kind has taken place, the Prime Minister will cause the facts of the matter to be immediately ascertained. 5. The Government, without attempting to distinguish as to which of the duties of the Department of External Affairs may be described as "" special and primary functions,"" have always been ready to urge the fullest inquiry into any apparently bond fide allegations of wrong or ill-tTeatment sustained by Australian citizens in any part of the world. Matters regarding the New Hebrides brought before the Government by the Presbyterian Church authorities have always received full and sympathetic consideration, and everything in the power of the Government to assist them in their humane and self-sacrificing work has been done. The mission bodies have repeatedly thanked the Prime Minister for his efforts on their behalf. EXCISE TARIFF (AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY) ACT 1906. PROTECTION OF WORKERS AND CONSUMERS.",16
28,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"the Acting Prime tralia, Minister, upon notice I. Whether the declared intention Ministry to abandon the method of protecting labour provided by the "" Excise Tariff 1906,"" and to substitute another there for, was the result of a doubt as to the constitutionality as well as the efficacy of the provisions for the purpose in the Act referred to? 2.. Whether, in view of the statements of some honourable members of this House that their support of the Tariff proposals is conditional on the extent and efficacy of the protection to be afforded to labour, the Acting Prime Minister will, on the close of the general debate on the Budget and Tariff, submit his new method of protecting labour to the House for consideration, to enable honourable members to consider what it is worth, before dealing with the lines giving protection to employers?",17
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable member's questions, I beg to stateThe intentions of the Ministry will, I hope, be made public today.",17
30,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I shall repeat the questions tomorrow if I do not receive an answer today. NATIONAL PHYSIQUE : MEDICAL NA CHILDREN .,17
31,Mr TUDC,INSPECTION OF SCHOOL,"R asked the Acting Prime Minister1. Whether his attention has been drawn to an article appearing in the Age on the 7th inst. on national physique, wherein it isstated""The British educational authorities intend to give more systematic attention infuture to the physical development and general health of the children attending the elementary schools. Medical inspections will be made compulsory, more playgrounds are to be found, and' .other measures taken to raise the physical standard of the nation. "" Simultaneously with the announcement of - this new policy there has been a discussion on the subject at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association. Dr Henry Davy, president of the association, said that physical culture was one of the most pressingquestions of the day, for it offered the only means of providing a remedy for the state of muscular . degeneration which was so prevalent"" ? 2. Will he instruct the Commonwealth Statistician to have a compulsory medical inspectionof school children in cities, towns, and in the country districts, in order to obtain comparative statistics showing the physique and health of the children, with a view to measures beingadopted to improve the conditions that obtain?",17
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INSPECTION OF SCHOOL,"The Commonwealth Statistician, who has devoted considerable attention to the question of anthropometry and school hygiene in Ausand who specially investigated the matter in nearly every country of Europeof the as America, reports as followsI am full y seized of the importance of comparative statistical records of school physique and school hygiene; and consider that the value of such records would be greatly enhanced if they were made on a uniform planfor the whole of Australia. The subject hasalready received some attention in the Commonwealth-i.e. , in New South Wales and Tasmania-bu t the records, while possessing a certain local value, do not cover a sufficient number of children or refer to a sufficient number of different years to possess comprehensive significance. It was suggested by the Premier of Tasmania, towards the close of 1906, that the various States should be invited to undertake the work of collecting complete data, and' the Honourable the Minister for Home Affairsexpressed his concurrence in the proposal that the Commonwealth Statistician should analyze and tabulate the results. Communications wereaddressed to the Premiers of the States, but owing to the fact that unfavorable replies were received in some instances, I understand the matter has not been further proceeded with. SUPPLY. NA - EXPENDITURE. ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, AND BUILDINGSDEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS. In Committee: Division 1 (Home Affairs, Neio South Wales), ^ 6 , 0 0 0 .",17
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.16] - I propose to ask honourable members to proceed with the consideration of the Estimates relating to additions, new remained stationary. works, buildings, & c , for the year 1907-8. The expenditure, for which provision been made in this connection, totals £ 8 1 9 , 8 7 4 , and is rendered necessary additions, new works, buildings, & c , - connection with the Department of Home Affairs, the Department of the Postmasterin General, the Department of the Treasurer, ancl the Department of Defence.'",18
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Is the Acting Prime Minister now moving that the whole of the works Estimates be agreed to?,18
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I desire to say a few words upon the whole of these Estiin mates, before the details are submitted the Committee. In dealing with this ter, it is only right that I should refer to the total expenditure involved, and to tain questions in connection with the Budget which, in my judgment, come within ' purview of the Government proposals. has been said that although the revenue derived by the Commonwealth during first year of the operation of the uniform. Tariff-1902-3 - wa s £ 1 , 6 4 0 less than the amount which it is anticipated will be collected during the current year, the sum of ,£1,145,234 in excess 'their three-fourths share of the Customs ancl Excise revenue was returned to States, whereas during the present year, it is expected that they will receive £ 1 0 3 , 9 9 2 more than the three-fourths the Customs and Excise revenue they are constitutionally entitled. To put the matter even more clearly, I would that out of a total revenue of £12,105,937 in 1902-3, the Commonwealth Treasurer was able to return to the States whereas during the current financial year, with, an anticipated revenue of £13,745,200 - a revenue exceeding that which was lected in 1902-3 by £1,639,263-the Treasurer estimates that he will be able to return to them only £ 7 , 7 7 9 , 2 9 0, That is 'to say, the States will receive £ 4 2 5 , 2 7 3 less than the amount returned in 1902-3. The inference to be from these criticisms is, I presume, that Commonwealth should return to the States in 1906-7 ,£8,204,563, the amount returned in 1902-3, plus the £ 1 , 6 3 9 , 2 6 3, crease in irevejilie estimated during 1907-8-in all £9,843,826. The amount - estimated to be returned to the States year is £2,066,61 8 less than that amount. mencement. The contention of some honourable members would have been quite correct, on one supposition, namely, that the expenditure had This, however, has not occurred. I will enumerate the items has of expenditure occurring in the Estimates for 1907-8 which did not occur in 1902-3. by I ask honourable members to take special in notice of the' amounts which I am about to submit. We now pay £ 5 , 0 0 0 per annum connection with Papua. This amount is in the nature of a loan to be used for the construction of roads. The repatriation of Pacific islanders involves an expenditure of £ 6 , 5 0 0 , being the balance required for returning the Kanakas to their islands. The expenditure on advertising pur resources Great Britain amounts to £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , and to is mainly expended in Great Britain. The matCommonwealth London office accounts for £ 4 , 4 0 0 . This office has justified its existcerence. Last year interest was earned in London amounting to £ 2 , 8 5 2 , the rates varythe ing from 2J per cent, to 5^ per cent. It Before the creation of this London office the Commonwealth earned no in the terest in London whatever, all our remittances being made to the Agents, 0 00 General of the various States, and forming part of their balances. So that honourable financial members will see that there has been a of great saving in connection with our London office. Our Crown Solicitor's office, which the did not exist in 1902-3, involves an expenditure of £ 3 , 3 6 0 . The High Court only was not in existence at the time to which of I have referred, and the expenditure upon to which it amounts to ,£22,145.",18
36,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Some of the honourable say gentleman's comparisons begin in 1904.,18
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I am enumerating the fresh items of expenditure since £ 8 , 2 0 4 , 5 6 3, 1902-3.",18
38,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The honourable gentleman is not answering the strongest case. Some colof the expenditure to which he has referred did not commence t ill 1904, and, consequently, does not affect his argument.",18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,I am taking the additional expenditure as .from 1902-3.,18
40,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The honourable gentleman drawn has. taken the weakest case put by honour the able members, and not the sfrongest one.",18
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I take the whole period of the Commonwealth's exthe inistence. I am not picking out any particular case, but desire to show truly what has taken place, and why we are spending this more money now than we did at the comI n so doing, my object is partly to show that the States have been relieved of a considerable amount of penditure, although, nevertheless, some them have not reduced, but have increased their own expenditure.",18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Hav e they been opinion, relieved of expenditure in connection with the High Court, for instance?",19
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The Commonfrom wealth Statistical Department has involved an expenditure of .£10,808. This should relieve the States of a considerable expenThere diture.",19
44,Sir TOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,It will not.,19
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Why should it been the case. not?,19
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,They will want their own Statistical Departments also.,19
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,I think they ought to be able to work with the ComQueensland monwealth in regard to the collection statistics.,19
48,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Our Department cerbeen tainly should relieve them of. expenditure.,19
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The Commonmonwealth Meteorological Department inby volves an expenditure of £15,996. is an amount of expenditure directly transwas ferred from the States. I hold that they should be relieved of an expenditure of at my officers. least £10,000 odd. Our Patent Office involves an expenditure of £13,357. That also is a relief of the States.",19
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,It is a revenue ducing Department.,19
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I quite underto stand that it is, but, notwithstanding that, the States incurred expenditure on account of patents of which they are now relieved.",19
52,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,We relieve them of the revenue also.,19
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Our net expento diture on account of trade marks is £3,838. In 1906-7 the expenditure amounted to ,£6,390, and the receipts to £3,951The abolition of the cable charges between mainland and Tasmania has cost the monwealth £8,781. In consequence the abolition of the charge of Jd. per on cable messages we have to pav the Eastern Extension Company £5,600 per annum. The balance represents arrears.",19
54,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The reduction was only just. Sir, WILLIAM LYNE - But the Comthat monwealth gets very little credit from mania for the justice that it has done.",19
55,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,The Tasmanians are as loyal as the people of any other State.,19
56,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The Commonwealth gets excredit from the people of Tasmania, alof though not from the Premier of the State.",19
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I think the honourable member is quite right. In* my wherever trouble is caused in the various States regarding increased Commonwealth expenditure it does not come the people, but from a few only who are constantly trying to belittle the' Commonwealth whenever they get a chance. is a loss on the Pacific Cable of £25,000.",19
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,That has always,19
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"There was no expenditure under this head in 1902-3. The cable was not finished until December, 1902. New South Wales, Victoria, and together bore one-third of the of loss of working the line.",19
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,There must have an expenditure in connection with the construction of the line.,19
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I am informed * my officers that .this is an item of exThis penditure that did not occur in 1902-3. I not Treasurer at the time, and must accept the statements furnished to me by",19
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Who paid it then?,19
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The three States concerned paid it at that time, I prosuppose. The expenditure on new bo'un- . ties amounts to ,£25,000. There is also be spent this year a sum of £15,000 on the survey for the transcontinental railway ; and here let me sa.y that if a promise was ever made regarding the construction of that line, or a promise to do justice to Western Australia, at the time when she entered the Federation, that promise ought be carried out regardless of any factious opposition. Provision is made for the repayment to the Government of New South Wales of an advance of £25,000. This advance the was made prior to Federation by the New ComSouth Wales Government for Savings of Bank business, and it was also used for word money order purposes. The New South Wales Government now wish this sum to be repaid to the Savings Banks Commissioners; and, therefore, a new advance from the Commonwealth funds is necessary. The money represents the amount was in the tills at the time the ComTasmonwealth took over the Department. With the addition of the other items I have quoted, it will be seen that, in all, there is a sum of .£203,185, which did not appear in any way in the expenditure of 1902-3, but'which is now necessary; and in many respects this means a relief to the States. In respect of the Governor General, there is this year an increase of ^5,758. In the present Estimates, £1,000 is included for services rendered by the Railway Departments of the various States-a n amount that was not charged in 1902-3. In addition, we are providing this year for repairs, furniture, and so forth, for the Government Houses in Sydney and Melbourne, to the amount of £5,985 more than in 1902-3, and the total expenditure under this head is £[20,389. In regard to the item of £1,000 especially, I wish to say that in 1902-3 the Railway Departments of the States did not charge for the conveyance of the Governor General, though I do not remember whether a charge was made on account of members of Parliament.",19
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"A charge was made for the conveyance of members of Parliament, but not for the conveyance of the Governor General. I think we have paid all the arrears in respect of members of Parliament.",20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"At any rate, we have fo meet a charge now which we did not have to meet then on account of the travelling .of the Governor General. The reason I refer to this item, is that I desire to show first, the largely increased sum of money which has to be provided, and', secondly, that the increase, though large, is not extravagant as compared with 1902-3.",20
66,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,There is evidently no extravagance in the administration.,20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Quite so, and in justice to the Commonwealth, in view of statements that are made, I desire the fact to be placed on record. I am not accusing any Treasurer or Government of extravagance-fa r from it ; but I desire the tion to be made clear by means of figures from the Secretary to the Treasury. Under the heading of Parliament there is an increase of £34,588. The main item of the increase is that of £27,863 in connection with the electoral administration. There is an item of £6,000 for a new mail service to the Pacific islands, one to the New Hebrides, and the other islands, involving £4,500, and another to New Guinea involving .£1,500. The Public Works staff is represented by an increase of -.£7,066. In 1902-3, the sum of ,£44,178 was paid for the construction of buildings and so forth, and for 1907-8 provision is made for £221,824. I desire to point out that in 1902-3, practically no works were being proceeded with. We were not in the position at that time to know where works should be carried out; but each year since the expenditure has been growing. We have to. keep all the buildings in repair, and, especially in the Post and Telegraph Department, offices have to be extended, in addition to the ordinary repairs over the whole continent of Australia. I may say that the buildings were discovered to be in very bad repair, indeed, in 1902-3 and subsequently; and, therefore, more work, and, of course., more expenditure is now necessary.",20
68,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The older the buildings get, the more repairs they need.",20
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Quite so; whatever happens we must keep the buildings in repair. Under the head of Naval Agreement, there is an increase of £95>°35In 1902-3 we paid ,£126,000 per annum, which was shared with New Zealand on a population basis. We now P )' £200,000 per annum, and the a ;£°5>°35 is necessary, partly to meet the increase and the share formerly paid by New Zealand. Naval expenditure ""other"" is represented by an increase of £15,788. In 1902-3 the Naval' Forces were severely retrenched, but since then this armi of the service has been strengthened. "" The increase in the military expenditure is £98,299. This increase is a large one, and I desire honourable members to observe the cause. On account of rifle clubs, there is a sum .of ,£24,057, and, I presume, no honourable member will raise any objection on this score, because I believe the expenditure on these clubs has the approval of all. Then cadet corps are represented by £46,902 ; and I think I am safe in saying that the Parliament of the posiCommonwealth will cordially approve of both this and the item I have just mentioned. The balance of the increase is caused by bringing the personnel of the various arms of the Defence Forces nearer to the maximum strength; and there has been a corresponding increase in the cost of equipment. The defence works, under the head of '' maintenance, ' are responsible ! for an increase of £15,586, and it is proposed this year to renew the boilers of the naval vessels. In 1902-3, all alterations and improvements were charged to the new works vote, but that is not 'done now. The increase in the Postmaster-General's, Department, Central Office, is £ 5 , 4 there being now 35 officers as compared 15 in 3902-3-a n increase found necessary on account of the expansion of the Departproper ment. In connection with the expenditure on account of the conveyance of mails across Bass Strait, I think the action of the Government will show the representatives Tasmania how groundless is the charge that the Commonwealth Government neglectful of that Sta.te. An item of £ 7 , 0 0 0 represents the increase in the necessary to secure the more rapid service provided by the fine steam-ship Loongana. I am quite sure that Tasmanians, ancl, indeed, all Australians who travel, that this is an expenditure to be commended, and that it must have been to the Tasmanian Government, who could have ill afforded to pay the extra cost.",20
70,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,And a relief to travellers,21
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Of course. 1907-8 In connection with ocean mails, there £ 7 8 5 , 2 7 0 . is an increased payment Orient Steam Navigation Company £52,880. In 1902-3 we paid £ 7 2 , per annum, whereas we now pay £ 1 2 0 , 0 per annum, with £ 4 , 8 8 0 tion in consideration of the company's vessels calling at Brisbane. Rent, repairs, & c , in the Department of the Postmasterfor General are represented crease of £[9,273. Works are expensive to carry out than they were i.n 1902-3; and it is believed that the present buildings are being kept in much better pair than they were at that time. general increases in the Department of Postmaster-General amount to £ 3 1 1 , 3 the bulk of which is represented by salaries. The amount provided under this heaid for this Department in 1902-3 was £ 2 , 2 9 6 while for 1907-8 there is provided allows £2',6o7,877, showing an increase of postage.",21
72,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Does that include the salaries of the 600 permanent hands pointed this year?,21
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Yes . Department 1,159 new positions have been created in six years, additional officers ing been found necessary to cope with the greatly increased work.

In I am taking the statement as it was made, it and showing the position in which the I hold that it will be found necessary in the future to expend considerable sums under the head of new works and buildings, and, in addition, as we expand we shall have to expend larger That'would make the case still 0 , as worse, so >far as the States are concerned. The expenditure upder the special defence votes for this year amounts to £ 2 9 6 , 0 5 0 , and when the expenditure for coastal defence is fairly started, it will annually be a very large sum. The honourable member for Flinders pointed out the difficulty with which we may be faced, and suggested orable member's pardon. two ways of meeting it. . One was by was worked out by statisticians. cutting down the expenditure on the Civil Service, and stopping the increments to civil servants, and the other by resorting to loans.  figures point in the direction that tive duties are bad for the States ",27
156,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I do not think that they do. I shall mention presently how the new duties are operating, and the information will astonish honourable memwas bers. Mr BAMFORD.'-In any case there are no prohibitive duties.",28
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Exactly . Comparatively speaking ours is a low Tariff, and not a high one.",28
158,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Nonsens e !,28
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"If the honorread it . able member makes a comparison he will find that our Tariff is as nothing compared with that of the United States, or Canada.",28
160,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,Does the honourable memmember ber want a Tariff like Russia's?,28
161,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Russia' s Tariff averages T31 per cent, on all imports from Great Britain, whereas our Tariff averages 6 per cent.",28
162,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,That is rubbish.,28
163,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"It is not, as the honourable member will see if he looks the Tariff.",28
164,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Canada' s Tariff averages was concluded. 30 per cent, on British imports.",28
165,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Our Tariff averages 6 per cent, on all imports from Great Britain.",28
166,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,That is not the test.,28
167,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I am sorry that I did not bring with me a statement which all the Tariffs of the world are pared with Great Britain's. Russia stands at the top with an average of 131 per cent, on British imports, and Australia is near the bottom with an average of 6 per cent. In the case of New Zealand, the average 9 per cent., while in the case of Canada is 17 per cent.",28
168,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,The Tariffs are not pared on the same basis.,28
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"They are. I the honourable member will do me the of looking at ai speech I addressed to Imperial Conference, he will find that it contains all the information required.",28

171,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"I beg the hon The comparison It was quoted by me to the Imperial Conference, and it has not been questioned since, although it has been published in a large number of newspapers in Great Britain. Minister's Mr Glynn - Withi n the last two months prohibiit has been questioned publicly.",28
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"It may be questioned, but it cannot be disproved. It was admitted by Mr Lloyd George, who joined in the discussion, that 6 per cent, the average of the Australian Tariff.",28
173,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,No .,28
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,I may refer to the document before I resume my seat.,28
175,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The honourable member suppressed the report during the debate upon the Address-in-Reply, but I",28
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,I did hot suppress it.,28
177,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,The honourable suppressed the report until the debate was finished.,28
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"That , sir, is not a proper remark for the honourable member to make. I gave no instruction in the matter. I had a confidential copy which I gave to the leader of the Opposition.",28
179,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"Marke d "" 36."" I up saw it. We got the report immediately after the debate on the Address-in-Reply",28
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"The honourable - member for Flinders pointed out the difficulty confronting us. But, as I said, he did not point out any possible decrease in ordinary expenditure, except in one case where he urged that the civil servants in should not be paid their increases, and comthat in other cases salaries might be reduced. The Coinmittee will agree, I think, that any considerable reduction in expenditure is not possible. The only Departments in which it could be urged that a reduction is could be made, but in which I think it is it hardly possible,' are the Defence and Post and Telegraph Departments. We cannot comcut down the expenditure on the Defence Department if we earnestly intend to f strengthen our defence. We cannot cut favour down the expenditure on the Post and the Telegraph Department without impairing its efficiency, and reducing the conveniences which it supplies to the public. I venture to think that the Committee is not prepared to do one or other of those things. As regards the possibility of effecting any saving by reducing the amounts of increments paid to junior officers in the service, I find that the total amount of the increments to be paid this year to fifth class officers is only £5,810. These youths enter the service between the ages of 16 and 21 years, so that even if they should get their statutory increment each year they will be between the ages of 22 and 27 before they can attain a salary of £160 a year.",28
181,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,It would hardly save anything appreciable for the States if we withheld the increments.,29
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH REVENUE AND,"No . Allowing three years to intervene before the lads receive promotion to fourth class, they are from 25 to 30 years of age before they receive a salary of £ 1 8 5 . Perhaps after that their promotion should be guided largely, if not wholly, by merit, but not before.

In the following week of last year, the returns amounted to £76,109, and of this year to £81,713. In the week ending 31st August last year, the returns amounted to £107,929, and this year to £132,396. . Mr Bruce SMITH - Is the comparing weeks in each year?",29
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Yes .,30
187,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Why is the comparison made in respect to weekly returns ?,30
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Because the. figures available for comparison deal with weekly returns. In New South Wales, the returns for the month ending 31st August, last year totalled £351,812, and this year .£366,530, an increase of about £>5,ooo.",30
189,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"A large quantity of goods had left England and America, and were on their way to Australia, on the date of the introduction of the new Tariff, and duty must be paid on them when imported. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The increases were due mostly to the payment of higher duties upon taking goods outof bond. The returns ih New South Wales for the first week of September last year were £75,283, and this year £88,228; while, for the second week, they were £67,952 last year, and £96,768 this year. In Victoria the returns for the period between the 8th and 14th August last year amounted to £124,572, dropping to ,£47,207 for the same period of this year. In the following week of last year they were £64,720, and of this year £46,536; and in the third week last year £94,451, increasing to £107,888 this year. For the first week of September last year they were £35,997, and this year ,£60,707, and for the second week last year £63,564, and £71,738 this year, showing an increase in the Victorian revenue, as well as in that of ""ftew South Wales. In Queensland the returns during the week following the 8th August last year were £23,975, d they dropped to £ i 3 , 5 9 a n 2 during the corresponding period of this year. In the succeeding week last year they were £21,746, and this year dropped to £14,169, and in the last week of August last year they were ,£31,761, and dropped to £23,685 this year. In the first week of September last year they were £22,279, and rose to £24,510 this year, and in the second week of September last year they were £15,559, and increased to £18,382 this year. Therefore, Queensland, too, is benefiting by the new Tariff. The position of Western Australia is different. For the week beginning 8th August last year, the returns in that State Minister were £16,074, and in the corresponding period of this year they fell to ^13,375. In the following week of last year they were £20,222, and this year fell to £13,477; and in the last week of August last year they were £33,474, and this year £29,669. In the first week of September last year they were .£11,637, and this year £ 6 , 0 1 2 ; and in the second week last year ,£16,156, and this year ,£12,459. The figures for South Australia for the five weeks' period to which I have been referring are, in the first week, last year, £13,075, and this year £15,099; in the second week last year £^19,061, and this year ,£17,921; in the third week last year £26,071, and this year .£35,096; in the fourth week last year £12,214, and this year ,£23,094; and in the fifth week last year £11,862, and this'year ,£18,773. So that in some weeks the revenue under the new Tariff was nearly twice as much as that received under the old Tariff.  number of merchants are keeping as much as they can in bond. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE' - The figures for Tasmania for the period to which I am referring were, for the first week last year .£4,813, and this year .£4,564; for the second week last year £2,888, and this year £ 5 , 2 6 0 ; for the third week last year £5,407, and this year .£5,411; for the fourth week last year £6,249, and this year £ 7 , 2 7 3 ; and for the fifth week last year ^5,151, and this year £^5,34°",30
190,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Does the Ministei seriously believe that the returns for the month immediately succeeding the introduction of the new Tariff are a criterion as to what will be received six months hence ?,30
191,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Honourable members have said that the returns would not be so large this year as they were last.,30
192,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,No. .,30
193,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I am showing that the returns this year are in most cases higher than they were last year, and that the revenue of the States is benefiting by the new Tariff.",30
194,Mr ATKINSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Has not every honourable member admitted that the returns for this year would show an increase because of the increase in the rates of duties?,31
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"A number of honourable members said that that would not happen. I am giving figures which honourable members opposite do not like to hear. * They have tried to do all they can to injure the proposals of the Government, and have decried the possibilities of revenue under a protective Tariff. I am"" showing exactly what has happened.",31
196,Mr BOWDEN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Does the honourable member expect to receive an equally large amount of revenue two vears hence?,31
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It is possible, though I do not say positively that we shall. The statement attributed to me more than once in regard to the extension of the Braddon section of the Constitution is not correct. My remarks on the subject are reported on page 1644 of the Hansard record of this session. After quoting the resolutions submitted to the Brisbane Conference by the right honourable member for Swan, and agreed to by the Premiers, I said in my Budget speechThe Conference also agreed that the further consideration of the taking over of the States debts by the Commonwealth should be postponed until the question of distribution surplus revenue amongst the States was deterextension mined.",31
198,Mr WH IRVINE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable gentleCommonwealth man is not surprised at the States being willing to accept that provision ?,31
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Not at all. course, those provisions would not be binding did not give his consent. on Parliament; they were adopted subject ratification by Parliament. With regard other question-the continuation of the Braddon section-it appears very evident from the figures I have quoted this evening that such an arrangement, however desirable to the States, will be quite impossible in view of public expenditure which must be carried by the Commonwealth. I have been called so suddenly to take the position I now occupy, and have hacl so little opportunity of considering this question, that I feel that some time must gether. elapse before my views are thoroughly matured. The right honourable member for Swan has stated more than once that in repudiating the arrangement which was made at the Brisbane Conference I was repudiating views of the Prime Minister. Let us see what the oflicial report of the proceedings Conference discloses. In the first place, I affirmed that the Prime Minister never authorized what was attempted to be'done there. I will quote his very words in support of my statement. If honourable members will refer to pages 200, 238, 239, 241, 244, and 245 of the official report, they will see the position for themselves. The resolution which was carried at the Brisbane Conference readsThat the further consideration of taking over the State debts be postponed until the question of the distribution of the surplus revenues amongst the States has been determined. It will be seen, therefore, that what the States desired was to secure an extension of the Braddon section of the Constitution before the question of the proposed transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth had been dealt with. What did the Prime Minister himself say upon that aspect of the subject upon a previous occasion-upo n the last occasion that he spoke of it, so far as I am aware. The question was put to him by one of the representatives of the StatesWe clearly understand then that the scheme of Sir John Forrest is that in taking over the State debts we cannot deal with one part without the other? To that question, the Prime Minister repliedExactly, not one without the other. That is the Prime Minister's opinion today. In other words, if the Braddon section be extended, the States debts must be taken of the over by the CommonAvealth. The proposed of the Braddon section represented only a portion of the proposals made by the Go\'ernment to the Statesa portion to which, by itself, the Prime Of Minister does not adhere, and to which he According to to the official report of the Conference held to the at Brisbane, the right honourable member of the operation for Swan said I am here, as you know, acting for the Prime Minister, and I point out that that answer wasgiven deliberately. I said yesterday that theout two matters were distinct under the Constitution, and that one could be arranged for without the other, yet it was the view of the Com. monwealth Government that both should go to",31
200,The PRESIDENT,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Without disparaging the statement of Mr Deakin, you recognise that there is no necessary connection ?",31
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Acting Prime the Minister stated that the arrangement to which the Prime Minister did giA'e his asof that sent was impossible.,31
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"- I did not. I said that it was impossible to give effect to. the resolution which was agreed to at the Brisbane Conference, which readsThat the further consideration of the taking over of the States debts be postponed until the question of the distribution of the surplus revenues amongst the States has been determined.",31
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I said that tco.,32
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"In answer to it. the following question put to the Prime Minister at a previous ConferenceWe clearly understand then that the scheme impossible. of Sir John Forrest is that in taking over ""the States debts we cannot deal with one part without the other? he repliedExactly, not one without the other.",32
205,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I said that at the Brisbane Conference of Premiers. quoted the utterance of the Prime Minister at that Conference.,32
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Then why did the right honourable member accuse me having said that what the Prime Minister proposed was not practicable ? I said that it was not practicable to extend don section of the 'Constitution unless we took over the States debts.,32
207,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The taking over of the States debts will not provide us with any revenue.,32
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The interest the balance. payable upon the States debts would absorb the amount returnable to the States under the Braddon section.,32
209,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The two things are quite separate. Sir WILLIAM LY'NE - They are not separate. They are absolutely inseparable. I repeat that it is practically impossible to extend the Braddon section of the stitution unless we take over the States debts.,32
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It may not be expedient to extend the Braddon section unless we take over the States debts, but to extend that section it is not absolutely necessary that we should take over the States debts.",32
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I tell the right honourable member again that it is not possible to extend the Braddon section without taking over the States debts. That is what I said before.,32
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Acting Prime Minister does not grasp the situation.,32
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The right honourable member stated that I had repudiated an arrangement which was agreed to by the Prime Minister.,32
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,So the honourable gentleman did.,32
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I did not, and I have since received the word of the Prime Minister that I did not.",32
216,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,He did not hear what the Acting Prime Minister said.,32
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,He heard of,32
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable gentleman stated that the arrangement was,32
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I said that the proposal by itself to extend the Braddon section beyond the ten years fixed by the Constitution was impracticable and impossible, and I say so today.",32
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It is useless to I argue with the honourable gentleman, because he does not understand the question.",32
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,If we take over the States debts the whole of the of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which the States are now entitled will be absorbed in paying the in the Bradterest upon those debts.,32
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,And more than absorbed.,32
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Exactly . We have power, however, to obtain from the States a sum of money with which to pay",32
224,Mr GLYNN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"We should require to obtain from them about £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually at the present time.",32
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I wish to let the public know what are the facts of the matter, because a wrong construction has been placed upon my remarks, and in all the States it has been alleged that I am Conopposed to granting them any consideration after the expiration of the ten-years' period.",32
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Acting Prime Minister said so.,32
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I never said anything of the kind.,32
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is on record in Hansard.,32
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I am putting the position before the Committee and before the country.,32
230,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Does the Acting Prime Minister say,32
231,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Order ! I have re- ' neatedly called the right honourable member for Swan to order.,32
232,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,But the Acting Prime Minister is misrepresenting the position.,32
233,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I hope that the right honourable member will recollect that we are in Committee, and that he will have an opportunity to reply to the statements of the Acting Prime Minister.",33
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Does not the Prime Minister approve of everything that I did at the Brisbane .Conference?,33
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I do not wish to say anything that the right honourable member may regard as offensive, but I do say that if he agreed to an extension of the Braddon section without simultaneously providing for the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth I do not agree with his action.",33
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I do not want to know what the honourable gentleman may think- I want to know what the Prime Minister thinks.,33
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Prime Minister would not agree to a proposal to extend the Braddon section unless provision were made for the taking over of the States debts.,33
238,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I never agreed that. The honourable gentleman has grasped the situation.,33
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I understand words. the situation just as well as does the right honourable member.,33
240,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Acting Minister repudiated an arrangement of which the Prime Minister approved.,33
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Primestatement Minister did not approve of it. He said, that we must not agree to an extension of here. the Braddon section unless provision were made at the same time for taking over States debts.",33
242,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Who made such arrangement?,33
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"As far as I factured can gather, I think that the right honorKingdom."" able member did, because he agreed to suggestion of the Premiers at the Brisbane Conference..",33
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,That had refercent. „ ence to the adjustment of' the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth.,33
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The right honable orable member cannot escape from ficulty in that way. He must have done one of two things. Either he the proposal to extend the Braddon section without taking over the States debtSj he did not.,33
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"There is no extenabout the subject further, sion involved.",33
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The proposal of the Conference was that the Commonwealth should continue to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise, revenue.",33
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,That is not the Braddon section of the Constitution.,33
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Is it not?,33
250,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,No . We do not necessarily keep one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue.,33
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I cannot understand what the right honourable member is driving at.,33
252,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Acting Prime Minister should study this question before he comes to this House.,33
253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I understand the question very well. If the right honourable member says that by subscribing to an arrangement under which the Commonwealth would continue to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and would retain only one-fourth of that, revenue for Comto monwealth purposes, we should not be exnot tending the Braddon section of the Constitution, I say that there is no meaning in",33
254,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"There are other conditions involved, such as the right to Prime levy special duties.",33
255,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable member for Parkes has questioned my in reference to the percentages.,33
256,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I have the figures,33
257,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I hold in my. the hand the British Trade Year-Book for 1906. It gives the "" average rate per cent. an ad valorem import duties levied in certain foreign countries, and in certain British Colonies and Possessions, on all manuarticles exported from the United I . will mention only a fewthe Russia, 131 per cent.;. United States, 73 per cent.; New Zealand, 9 per cent.; Canada, 17 per cent.; Australia, 6 per",33
258,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is ridiculous 1,33
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,If the honormember is prepared to teach the author the difof the British Trade Year-Book,33
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The error was agreed with pointed out at the time.,33
261,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"If the honoror able member will not take any notice of this book, it is of no use for me to talk I hope I shall be in order in this debate in dealing generally with certain matters connected with the Tariff. I particularly desire, if I can do so, to submit the proposals of the Government in regard to the "" new protection "" ; but, not desiring to come into collision with the Chair, I wish to ask you, sir, whether I shall be in order in so doing. I have now completed what I had to say in regard to the Budget, and wish to know whether I shall be in order in dealing, although not at great"" length, with various generalities connected with the Tariff, and in submitting the proposals of the Government regarding what is known as the "" new protection "" ?",33
262,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Acting Prime Minister has asked me a questionWhether he would be in order in dealing with matters connected with the Tariff in Committee of Supply? I must rule that he would not be in order, for the following reason:-It would certainly be a new procedure, and one that ought not to be permitted, to have two debates in the two Committees of Supply and Ways and Means running on parallel lines. If I permitted the Minister to do what he desires, we should have a similar debate in Committee of Ways and Means to that which the Minister proposes to initiate in Committee of Supply - I realise the difficulty in which we are situated owing to the fact that there is no standing - order to guide us, whilst the references made to the point in May's Parliamentary Practice are so vague that they afford no light upon the situation. The House goes into Committee of Ways and Means for the purpose of devising methods of raising revenue. But we are now in Committee of Supply. While in Committee of Supply, we deal with the manner in which revenue shall be expended. It is, of course, only reasonable and right that honourable members should be allowed in a general way in Committee of Supply to make reference to the manner in which money to be expended shall be obtained. The Minister himself has made certain general statements concerning the probable revenue of the Commonwealth. He was quite in order in taking that course. But to refer in detail to matters connected with the Tariff would not be in order. The proper place in which to make those observations would be, not \n Committee of Supply, but in Committee of Ways and Means.",34
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Then I understand you to rule, sir, that I am not at liberty at the present time to deal generally-no t in detail-wit h certain features of the Tariff, or to submit for the information of honourable members, and of the country, the proposals of the Government regarding the ""new protection?"" These proposals include measures to be taken for the protection of the workers, of the manufacturers, and of the public. If you rule that I cannot proceed further, I have finished what I intended to say.",34
264,Mr GLYNN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Would it not be possible for the Minister to make a further explanation of some statements which he has made as to the effect of the Tariff upon the revenue? For instance, a sacrifice of Excise duty may be involved in carrying out the policy of the Government. Would it not be in .order for the Minister to deal with the subject as having a certain effect upon the revenue?",34
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It has occurred to me, Mr Chairman, that you yourself laid down the proper course of procedure on F r i day last. I beg leave to remind you of what y.ou then said. In reply to an observation which I made, you said I understand that the honourable member for Parramatta is going to discuss the first item. I may point out that, although we may be discussing the first item, the whole Tariff is under discussion. What I wish to convey is that if an honourable member desires to introduce the question of free-trade versus protection, it is ' quite open to him to do so on each separate item. I take it , therefore, that in Committee of Ways and Means it is possible to discuss the Tariff in all its bearings, but not in Committee of Supply.",34
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I quite understand that.,34
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I submit that the Minister would be in order in discussing the effects of the Tariff upon the revenue at this stage. It seems to me that the proper course for the Government to pursue is to revert to Committee of Ways and Means, and then, upon a particular item of the Tariff, it will be possible for the Minister to discuss the "" new protection.""",34
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I put a question to the Chairman just now because he ruled the other day, when in Committee of Ways and Means, that the general debate was finished and that when we arrived at a particular item the discussion must be confined to that item.",34
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I have just read a - ruling to the contrarv.,34
270,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Chairman ruled otherwise on Friday.,34
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"If that when we get 'back into Committee of Ways and Means I shall be at liberty to make a statement with regard to the policy of the Government as to the "" new protection,"" I shall be content. I shall be able to accomplish what I desire in that way, just as I have accomplished what I desired in reference to the Budget in Committee of Supply. "" If I am given to understand that in Committee of Ways and Means I can discuss the Tariff 'generally, I shall be quite prepared to allow that part of my speech to stand over until we get back into that Committee; but shall I be able to do so?",35
272,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I am not called upon to say exactly what I shall rule when we get into Committee of Ways and Means. I prefer that the Minister should leave that point until we get out of Committee of Supply.,35
273,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I suggest that' it is most important that an answer should be given tp the question put by the Acting Prime Minister.,35
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is not usual for the Chairman to give rulings upon hypothetical questions.,35
275,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"But this is not a hypothetical question. It is a question of procedure to which we ought to have an answer. The "" new protection,"" or the rate of any item of the Tariff, or of any duty, or proposal regarding Excise, must, affect the financial proposals of the Government, and consequently must have some relation to Supply. The honourable member for Angas has asked whether any honourable member - because , of course, the same privilege, as was extended to the Acting Prime Minister would be extended to other honourable members-woul d be at liberty to refer in a. general way in this Committee to the "" new protection,"" or to any proposed duty of Customs or of Excise having regard to its bearing upon the finances. That I take it, is the question put by the honourable member for Angas, and I think we are entitled to have it answered. question of the convenience of the Acting Prime Minister just now, but a Question of laying down an important precedent. In deed, it is a matter which affects the freedom of speech in this House, and the right of honourable members. to discuss, in the fullest manner possible, questions which come before them affecting the finances. We all know the golden rule that we may discuss grievances before Supply is granted, I understand and I should like to hear an answer to the question put by the honourable member for Angas.",35
276,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"As to freedom of speech, and the discussion of grievances before Supply, I remind honourable members that our action in that connection is limited by our standing order, to the effect that we shall discuss grievances before the granting of Supply only once every three weeks. That rule is laid down definitely in our Standing Orders, beyond which we cannot go. I have already pointed out that questions of Ways and Means and questions of Supply are so involved that it is almost impossible to discuss one without considering the other. While questions of Ways and Means ought to be discussed in Committee of Ways and Means, and questions of Supply discussed in Committee of Supply, it is only reasonable to suppose that the discussions may sometimes overlap. But seeing that we are in Committee of Supply, I must rule against any detailed discussion of the Tariff, because that is a discussion which must take place in Committee of Ways and Means. It is obvious that Supplywill be affected by the Tariff to a greater or less extent, because the Tariff is one of the - means by which 'we make good Supply, and, therefore, a general reference to the Tariff cannot well ba avoided, just as in Committee of Ways and Means, when we are dealing with the Tariff, a general reference to Supply cannot be avoided. I point out that we are in the peculiar position of having this question introduced both in Coinmittee of Supply and in. Committee of Ways and Means, and I do not see how some reference to the Tariff could possibly be avoided in this Committee - However, I rule that it would not be in order to deal with the details of the Tariff while we are in Committee of Supply.",35
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I gathered from what took place on Friday that that would probably be your ruling, from which It is not a I do not propose to dissent on the present occasion. I must sav, however, that I was of opinion we had a larger range of discussion. I moved the House into Committee of Supply in order to deal with the matters with which I have dealt this afternoon ; and when we get back into Committee of Ways and Means I shall be prepared to proceed with the remarks I had intended to make on Friday last. . I think I have shown today that the Commonwealth has not been. extravagant in its expenditure, and that there can be but little reduction made.",35
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Would the Acting Prime Minister mind saying what his intention is at the present time?,36
279,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,As to what?,36
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Does the honourable gentleman propose to go into Committee of Ways and Means?,36
281,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Not now. I propose to proceed with the discussion of the Works and Buildings Estimates', in the hope that we shall conclude it to-night.",36
282,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It is a free country for hoping! Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - And hope deferred has been the honourable member's trouble. As I was saying, there can be but little saving effected in the Estimates now before honourable members. We must look forward, at no distant date,' to considerable expenditure if we take over the Northern Territory; and, further, I hope that it will not be long before we shall have to make provision for the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway. Both these undertakings will mean a considerable addition to the expenditure.  consented to the survey ?",36
283,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"No reply has yet been received from the South Australian Government, but I presume they wil l carry but a promise which undoubtedly was made. However, that is a question with which I do not desire to deal at the present moment. When I delivered my Budget speech, and also this afternoon, I showed that the Commonwealth will require all the money we are likely to receive as a result of* the present Tariff, in order to keep our engagements with the States during the next three years or so. I have pointed out the danger to the revenue which would result from reducing the Tariff. At present the revenue is rising, and is sufficient to enable us to carry out intended works, and, perhaps, a considerable number of other works not proposed on the present occasion. I strongly impress upon honourable members that we must deal with the Tariff in such a way as not only to make it protective to our industries, but to cause it to continue to return the revenue we receive at present. In deference to your ruling, sir, I shall not deal in detail with the Tariff, though I should be very much tempted to do so were it not that I have no wish to come into conflict with the Chair. As I said before, when we get into Committee of Ways and Means I shall, on the first item, deal with the Tariff to the extent I had intended on Friday last. At present we shall proceed with the consideration of the Works Estimates, and as there is little or nothing to object to in these Estimates, I earnestly ask honourable members to deal with them as quickly as possible. If the Estimates are not dealt * with. promptly, it is possible that some works may have to be stopped; indeed, that is the reason the Estimates are placed before honourable members at the present time.",36
284,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I shall, as usual, allow a general discussion on the first item.",36
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Parramatta) [4.57] - I sympathize to the full with the desire of the Acting Prime Minister to have the consideration of these Estimates concluded as speedily as possible; I mean, of course, as speedily as is consistent with . a fair and just reviewof the items, in order to insure that the money is not voted without proper consideration, and that we are getting the worth of the money we vote. These are always considerations with honourable members, no matter what haste may be desired in regard to the Estimates or any other question. I should now like to make one or two observations regarding some of the statements which the Acting Prime Minister, has thought fit to make in regard to the state of ""the finances. Although there has been no criticism of anything I took the opportunity to say during my speech on the Budget, there are, none the less, matters of general importance in reference to which I should like, in the first place, to correct some of the statements of the Acting Prime Minister, and, in the second place, to show' how inadequate, in my judgment, was the address of the honourable gentleman this afternoon. The Acting Prime Minister has fallen short of the request made in all the criticism on the Budget, for a sketch of the financial outlook from the Government point of view, and of the needs of the Commonwealth during the next few years, particularly in the light of the Tariff. During his observations this afternoon, the Acting Prime Minister treated us to a comparison of the revenue of today and of the revenue as it stood years ago in New South Wales. For instance, the honourable gentleman went back to 1899 in order to afford a comparison of the revenue required lh l^t h O V e r n m - with the revenue required today o»nfi J^° .gentleman did so, unless, to put it vulgarly, he desired to have a dig at Mr Carruthers, who seems just now to be his vete noire.",36
286,Sir WILUAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"- I did not onr mention Mr Carruthers' name that What the honourable gentleman did was to show that the Government of New South Wales is expending £2,000,000 per X "" "" X e L ;, ^ 9 W d l d tell the Committee that his Government succeeded to power in New South Wales in 1899, and that the moment at which his Government has succeeded to power in New South Wales, or anywhere else, has synchrony 'th public expenditure? The honourable gentleman is noted for his spending proclivities, it was the Government that he put into ister"" power that increased the expenditure in New South Wales by no less a sum th™ _j6-,jOo,ooo. Honourable members who have any political experience ' know how difficult it is once expenditure has been increased to reduce it to what it was before the increase. Somehow or other, public expenditure always creates vested interests. Dep ents are increased to pretentious proportions, and it is with artni ficulty i„ the world that they can be duced to their original proportions without very great injustice and hardship to viclua s. The Acting Prime Minister, therevenue 101 e, has today unconsciously informed Commmee of one of the "" enormities winch his Government in New South Wales are aiming. was guilty in sending expenditure up to a figure which it has not since been possible revenue! ^ to substantially reduce. This should make us only the more careful as to our financial dispositions so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. When we know that it is so difficult m the government of State to bring about a return to normal financial conditions, there is all the more reason why we should, during the period of financial boom through which we are psssing, ?take husband our resources, and not play the part of the spendthrift with them. I can with the Tariff. I for their proceeding conceive of no more salutary illustration t 0 w h k ister has referred us in connection with Government expenditure i„ New South ""ales.

A great deal of expenditure has been incurred to which no one can take any exception. Every one listened quite sympathetically to the narration by The honourable gentleman of the items of expenP diture incurred in the proper and normal discharge of our Federal functions. But I venture to say that the Acting Prime Minister's statement was still quite inade - quate. We all knew these things before Jo one quarrelled with them. The honor! r°,1 a y t h a n ^ expended in able members for Flinders, Parkes, and he not, at the same time, Swan have repeatedly said that they do not challenge hese particular items. That has not been the criticism from this side at all The criticism has been that all this piling up of expenditure, legitimate though if may be, very d i l y * / swift upward leap of 1S s p e e c r e at i for s a serious Federal financial outlook. That is w a the challenge which has been addressed t 0 t h C Act in g P r i m e M h l ",37
287,Mr WATKINS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Then are we to stop or Mr ° in ^ ^ ^ r k ° f the Federation?,37
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"We are to take the usual honest course of cutting our coat according to our cloth. We are to take the honest course of raising moneys before we undertake the spending of them. What we say is, that these items of expenditure the greatest difconstantly p i l X l n g up s h o w the n e o e s s it refor proceeding cautiously with such proposals as those which are contained in the indiianrf, which must necessarily destroy rei f they are to have a protective in the cidence, and to attain the object at which of the protectionist authors of the Tariff",37
289,Mr KNOX,WEEKLY STATEMENT,If we are to have protec* r e d u c e - Customs,37
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Quite so. We were reminded of this last night at that particularly cordial meeting which Ministers addressed at Brunswick.

I have no wish to discuss that meeting, but the Postf master-General reminded his audience that three years ago .he called attention to the tact that industries were being strangled. in Victoria. It has taken over three years to prepare this remedy, and now that they have it prepared I charge the Government with loitering over its application. I say that they are loitering over the Tariff, and show no disposition to get to close grips with it, and put the strangled industries upon a permanent basis. After three years of struggling, industries which have continued to pay handsome dividends",37
291,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Order . ask the honourable member not to go into that question.,38
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I am dealing with the financial aspect only. During that time the volume of business in all these industries has increased, but notwithstanding the statement that they have been struggling for three years, there is still no disposition on the part of the Government to put them on a permanent footing. Passing from that, I should like to say that in my judgment the Acting Prime Minister has not replied to the criticism from this side. Our criticism has been that the Tariff will in all probability be ultimately in a form which will give us a revenue of £9,000,000.",38
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I did not say that. I think it will give a great deal more.,38
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I know that the honourable gentleman did not say that. He would not tell us what is his estimate of its operation. That is what we complain of.,38
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I did tell the honourable member. I said that I expected that it would give a revenue of £10,500,000.",38
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable gentleman told us that that would be this year's revenue, but in his Budget statement he also admitted that it was unquestionable that this revenue would be very largely reduced when the protective duties became operative. Does the honourable gentleman repeat that statement now?",38
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I did ""largely."" I said that the tendency would be towards a reduction if the Tariff had its proper effect.",38
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Quite so. The Tariff, in proportion as it becomes protective, must have the effect of destroying revenue from imports. The Acting Prime Minister will not deny that, having just said the same thing in other words. We are forced to supply a basis of our own, since the honourable gentleman will not favour us with the probable results from the point of view of the Treasury. I thought that this afternoon we should have heard a definite statement as to the financial outlook, and the bearing of the Tariff upon it, after the infinite pains at which the honourable gentleman has been to state the financial position. Whether we have been economical or extravagant is not the point at issue. We desire to know our financial bearings before we set out to I must reduce or increase the revenue-pro-"" during capacity of the Tariff. On this subject we get no guidance from what the honourable gentleman has said this afternoon. We should have been informed of the financial outlqok, and the honourable gentleman should give the Committee some forecast for the next two or three years before he asks us to deal with the Tariff. We have no reliable data to guide us, and the Government have at least no right to sneer at the Opposition, as some of them did at a public meeting held last night at Brunswick, and to ask whether or not certain honourable members on this side of the House are protectionists.",38
299,Mr TILLEY BROWN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It was a piece of gross impertinence.,38
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It was; and it was particularly impertinent to make personal references such as those in which the Postmaster-General indulged when he went so far as to speak of an honourable member of this House as "" The honourable member for the wine vats.""",38
301,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,That was an interjection which I answered.,38
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It was a piece of impertinence on the part of the honourable gentleman to compare one honourable member with another, whorm he called an ""iceberg."". We want less of these frothy, trashy utterances r",38
303,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member indulges in such utterances in this House. He is constantly insulting me, as well as not say other honourable members.",38
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"May I sav that the great need of the moment in this House is a passionless, and, if honourable members like, an iceberg view of our financial outlook. It is far better to apply cold reason to these matters of finance than it is to make general statements on a public platform where there is no one to answer them and to indulge in tirades and diatribes against honourable members who in this House are striving to do their duty, and taking, as (Par as they may, a responsible view of our immediate financial outlook. I wish to recur for a moment to the member ought to be fair. position.",38
305,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Member s of the GovernI ment, at the meeting in question, had bad time, so that the honourable member need not attack them.",39
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It would seem that they had.,39
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Did the honourable member say I had increased the expenditure, ture of New South Wales by £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0",39
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Yes . The Acting Prime Minister has endeavoured to saddle upon Mr Carruthers the responsibility an increased expenditure of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , the part of New South Wales. He tells me that he meant to indicate that Mr Carruthers was responsible for the increase question.",39
309,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I said so. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I think the honourable member is mistaken.,39
310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Mr Carruthers has increased the expenditure, .and the Commonwealth has supplied him with the money. Mr JOSE PH COOK - If I remember rightly, the last utterance on this subject .made by Mr Carruthers was to the effect that the expenditure of New South Wales at the present time was much the same at it was when he took office three years ago.",39
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That is not correct. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Ministry which the Acting Prime Minister set iip to govern that poor distracted countryNew South Wales-rushe d up its expenditure by no less than £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year.",39
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Government of which I was the leader? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The very first Estimates which the honourable member, as Treasurer of New South Wales, brought down-befor e he had been in office many months-showe d a large increase.",39
313,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Nonsens e !,39
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"After the honourable member had been in office in New South Wales for twelve months, the expenditure of that State was increased by no less than £5005000. type. The moment he obtains control of the finances of the Commonwealth up goes the annual expenditure. That is what happens after he has acted as Treasurer for only a few weeks.",39
315,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable I had nothing to do with the increase of the expenditure. think I have given a very good reply a today to the charge which has been made as to the increased expenditure of the Commonwealth.,39
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Quite so, but the honourable member has not replied to the question as to how our increased expendinecessarily extended as Common0 0 ? wealth development proceeds, is to be permanently safeguarded. That is the issue, and the honourable member is challenged for to deal with it. Before we set out upon 0 0 0 on our detailed discussion of the Tariff we need some information on the point.",39
317,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I want to know a in little more of the returns from the Tariff before I can possibly supply it.,39
318,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Eve n then the honourable member would be very foolish to indulge in forecasts.,39
319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,That is so. The honourable member is fairer than the deputy leader of the Opposition.,39
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The exchange of compliments between the Acting Prime Minister and the honourable member for Dallev is becoming very frequent.,39
321,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member had better look out. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I had indeed. When I find that the honourable member is amiable to the Opposition, I should do so as much for the safety of honourable members on this side of the House as for anything else. The Acting Prime Minister is putting the car.t before the horse. He says to us. in effect, "" F i x this Tariff as you please, and then I shall be able to forecast the financial future."" The matter at issue between us is very simple. We say to the Government, "" Let us know what is the financial outlook, so that we may know how far to proceed with the destruction of revenue in the consideration of the T a r if f . "" I venture to say that while the honourable member may be unable to forecast with accuracy what will be the financial position some years ahead, he should be able to look ahead, as Sir George Tur-ner, the right honourable member for Adelaide, and every Treasurer has tried He is true to to do, for at least several years. The Government would have been well advised had they refrained from touching the Tariff for another year or two. I believe that for purely financial reasons it should not have been touched for some time. We may revise it now if honourable members desire to do so, but there can be no doubt that there will have to be further Tariff revisions after t'he financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States have been settled in 1910.",39
322,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is admitted that the Tariff is full of anomalies.,40
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It is full of anomalies, and will require considerable re-adjustment, but I am not now dealing with that point. There are purely financial considerations which might very well render Tariff re-adjustments necessary after our financial, relations with the States have been permanently fixed. With such frequent reconstructions of the Government, however, one begins to despair of any definite arrangement being made with the States. We do-not know where we are; the office of Treasurer passes from one member of the Ministry to another; and every arrangement is changed during the course of a few months. It seems absolutely impossible to forecast the future, and to indicate - what may happen even six or twelve months ahead. In such circumstances, it is the bounden duty of every honourable member to try to apply passionless logic to the financial question, and even to attempt to make a forecast, since the Government themselves, with all the resources at their command, refuse to do so. That is all the honourable member for Flinders did the other night. He attempted to make a forecast, saying distinctly that it was a rough and ready one, and no man could do more when he had not the resources of the Treasury behind him. Instead of dealing with that forecast, as he ought to have doneinstead of attempting to correct the honourable member's outlook-the Acting Prime Minister today set out to show that if we proceeded upon the basis indicated by the honourable member for Flinders we should have a huge deficit. That was exactly what the honourable member for Flinders pointed out. The whole point of his argument was that if we proceeded on, the basis of an annual revenue of ,£9,000,000 from Customs and Excise, we should find ourselves at the end of 191.0 face to face with liabilities amounting to no less than £1,000,000, which we should be unable to meet. That is the criticism which the Acting Prime Minister was asked to meet ; instead of meeting it, he has burked it. He can give us no statement of his own as to the outlook; he has none to give, and perhaps has not even considered' the question. All that he has done has been to quote the flowing revenues of today. Any one who knows anything about business matters is aware that the revenue must necessarily increase whilst traders are unloading their stocks and before the Tariff has had time to operate in the direction of preventing imports and setting up the local supplies to meet the demands whicharise from day to day. Every one knows that, none better than the Acting Prime Minister. The relation of those figures, showing that today there is an overflowing revenue from the Customs, mattered little. Everybody knows that for this year there will be an overflowing revenue. An extra revenue of £1,000,000 is provided for in the Estimates.",40
324,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is not provided for to the extent that the revenue is coming in at the present time.,40
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"But the honourable gentleman does not seriously think that the revenue is going to continue all the year like this? If so, he ought to revise his Estimates of revenue. If he has made a mistake he should recast his' balance sheet.",40
326,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I have made no mistake.,40
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Clearly , therefore, the honourable gentleman contemplates a falling off of the present rapid rate of revenue before the year is closed. For the whole year he estimates that he is iroing to get, roughly, £1,000,000 more out of the Customs than he received last year.",40
328,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"£800,000 .",40
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon; the extra sum is estimated to be received from the Post and Telegraph Department. The question, then, is whether this rate of revenue is going to be maintained in the years that are to follow. If it is, then what becomes of the protective incidence of the new duties ? I : take it that'. their main function is to destroy revenue by setting up local works to supply the demands which are now supplied from oversea. It was incumbent upon the Treasurer, with all these serious obligations immediately in front pf him, to attempt to scan the financial horizon, to show us what revenue he expected from the new duties when they had settled down, and what the probable financial obligations of the near future . were to be. In my judgment we are making somewhat of a mistake in proceeding with this Tariff at the present time. When we set out on our Federal career it was 'anticipated that the first ten yeais would be years of adjustment, and of the taking over of new functions, with the finances, therefore, somewhat . unsettled. That was the reason, I take it, why the financial safeguards were included in the Constitution. It was said in the Convention that whatever re-adjustments were to be made, whether they were to be economical or extravagant, the States at least should be safeguarded dining the period' of adjustment. As I have already said, when that period closes, with the close of the year 1910, it is inevitable that our financial outlook will have to be re-adjusted to the new conditions. That this was in the minds of Ministers themselves at the outset of our Federal career is quite plain from the records. Sir Edmund Barton declared that we could not have during the bookkeeping period, and the period of the Braddon section, any definite settlement of 'the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. said that we should have a compromise Tariff which could be supported by free traders and protectionists. His colleague, the present Acting Prime Minister, said the same. He repeatedly asked for the support of free-traders in his first electioneering campaign, and hoped confidently that he would get it , because he said, ' ' We cannot have a protective Tariff until the year 1910. It must be a Tariff averaging from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent.""",40
330,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I did not say anythe thing of the kind. I said the average would be 15 per cent, or 16 per cent.",41
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The statement was quoted the other night from the Sydney Morning Herald, a very accurate paper, so far as its reports are concerned.",41
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Terribl y accurate when it suits them.,41
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It showed that the honourable gentleman said at Cootamundra that all that we could expect was a Tariff of from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent.",41
334,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I have denied that a dozen times, and denied it then.",41
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Not then.,41
336,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I denied it immediately afterwards-withi n a fortnight.,41
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That statement was reported in the same paper as having been made at two other meetings within a period of three or four weeks from the time it was first made. There were three or four distinct statements repeated by that paper, showing the honourable member to have said what I have just indicated. What shall we say of another member of that Ministry- a man who (would never, upon any other basis than that of a fiscal truce, have seen these Houses of Parliament as one of the representatives of New South Wales? He accused people who proposed to raise the fiscal issue in New South Wales of being traitors to the Commonwealth. On the basis that there could be no scientific protection for some years at least, all our initial arrangements were made. So far as I am able to judge, those forecasts have proved to be singularly accurate. It is not the forecasts that are wrong. It is our politics that, in the meantime, have not adjusted themselves to the forecasts that were then made, or-shal l I say?-to the inevitable conditions arising from the very act of Federation. No sooner was that Tariff brought into operation than we heard the cry of "" strangled industries,"" and so, Accordingly he because ,of those strangled industries in one State, we have this new Tariff brought down three years after the cry was Taised. Now we are face to face with a financial outlook which, I venture to say, is of the - most menacing and serious kind. The seriousness of the outlook arises from the very fact that this Tariff is to further destroy revenue, and, therefore, before we adopt it, we have a right to know what the financial prospects require of us, so that we can, on the basis of the figures supplied by Treasurer, and on the basis of past experience, so adjust the Tariff as to insure the receipt of sufficient revenue to meet our needs in the years that are to come. It is idle, therefore, to quote the Tariffs, in the way they have been quoted this afternoon, of Canada, the United States, and other countries. There is no analogy between the cases. Ours is a very different Federation from that of Canada. We are not able to deal as airilv and lightly with our financial position as they may be able to do in Canada, where the Federation has control of the greater portion of the functions of Government, and leaves little for the States to do. Ours is a different problem from theirs. Say what you will, do what you will, turn this Tariff about as you will, the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States will always to a certain degree colour your financial outlook, and make for you your Tariff problems as well. I care not how you act, you cannot - escape from that responsibility, unless you take an easy and short cut to those other sources of taxation to which reference has already been made in this debate. But, assuming for the present that we are going - to finance Federation",41
338,Mr WATSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Is there not a lot to be said for some direct taxation ?,42
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The whole point of my argument is that our present resources are altogether inadequate to meet out requirements. The Acting Prime Minister said nothing about direct taxation.,42
340,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,That is the trouble.,42
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It does not trouble me, or other honourable members on this side. Our trouble is that the honourable gentleman cannot meet his obligations in the future without a resort to something of that kind unless a verygreat change takes place.",42
342,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The member wants me to forecast for three vears ahead- a nice little job indeed.,42
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable ' gentleman is, I take it , fixing a Tariff for many years ahead. He is forecasting with respect to the Tariff at least. I call the attention of honourable members ancl airy way of disposing of the financial outlook of the Commonwealth. He-the lia Treasurer-decline s to have anything to with the financial outlook for even two three years ahead. What is the immediate financial outlook? .We nave to look or three years ahead, and more, before can full y realise what it is. The question of taking over the Northern Territory not likely to be disposed of in less than or three years.",42
344,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Is it not just well to wait until we take over the Northyears ern Territory ?,42
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The trouble is that that proposal is included the Government programme for this sesdevelopment sion. Is the honourable gentleman now pudiating the programme with which the Government met Parliament only a few weeks ago? If he says now that they do not not intend to go on with all the large financial development. items of expenditure which were then casted, it will make the position veiy simpler and the outlook very much easier. But I am assuming that their programme was honest and straightforward. I assume that the Government intend to deal with the transfer of the Northern Territory ing this session.",42
346,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"If we get an opportunity we will, but we may not have that opportunity. South Australia may not agree to our scheme.",42
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I see the position.,42
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,What a stupid thing it would be to forecast things which were not likely to happen.,42
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"If I recollect rightly, the honourable gentleman declared that that matter would be submitted for the consideration of this House during this session.",42
350,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,If it comes off.,42
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Nothin g was said then about whether or not South Australia was likely to agree.,42
352,Mr WATSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"If South Australia does not agree, there will not be much good in going on with the proposal.",42
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is not of much honourable use to waste our time if South Australia is not' going to agree. Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - I propose to make one or two assumptions. I think it is safe to assume that South Australia w i ll agree to the terms of the compact.,42
354,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,South Australia to his light has not yet agreed.,42
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"South Austrahas not refused to agree, and I ' s h all do be very much surprised to hear that it has or refused to accept the bargain which has been offered to them by the Prime Mintwo ister. I should say that it is not quite we so safe to assume that the terms of the compact will be agreed to by this Parliais ment, as it is to assume that they will be two agreed to by the South Australian Parliament. When a person begins to consider as the outlook he is obliged to look a few ahead at the very least. The transfer of the Northern Territory, the cononly - struction of the transcontinental railway, in the transfer of lighthouses and buoys, the of the fisheries and the disrecharge of other new functions have to receive our consideration. It should be remembered 'that these new functions )do necessarily mean a corresponding So far, our exforeperience has shown that we may not hope much to receive any revenue from ""any of our ordinary functional departments. What I mean is that the Post and Telegraph Department today is spending all ' it earns, and a little more if a strict account of its durexpenditure were kept. Take that functional Department which on its spending side has developed most of all. I refer to the Department of Defence, and I to guard myself by alluding only to its spending side. I am afraid that has been no development on the side of its efficiency.",42
356,Mr WATSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,-There has been a large point to make. advance. Mr. JOSEPH iCOOK - I wish I could believe that. I have no hesitation in ing that its efficiency has not corresponded with the huge increase in its expenditure.,43
357,Mr WATSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"As a matter of fact, efficiency is greater, but the expenditure not greater than it was when the Departfore ment was taken over by the Commonhonorable wealth.",43
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I will to contest that point, as I am only making an incidental illusion. The only making was that the Department which seems to be developed more than any other, and in which, during the last four years, the expenditure has practically doubled self, is the one to which we can look for no return. I mean to say that it is dead expenditure so far as the balancenear future. sheet is concerned.",43

361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I do not know , where the money is to come from, but we have a right to ask the Government to tempt to forecast the probable sources which the expenditure is to be met.",43

No man has shown more unbounded ignorance of the functions which he has been set to its administer than the honourable gentleman is has done during this debate.

It is time that this Government began to assume an attitude of responsibility.

372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,That is nonsense. Let the States stop some of their extravagance.,44
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,What has that to do with the point?,44
374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It has a great deal to do with the point about which orable member is talking.,44
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That raises quite another question. I am pointing out the present position of affairs. What the States may or may not do is a matter for the year 1910, and is not a matter of immediate concern. Until that year is reached the States will have a right to demand from the Treasurer thrpe-fourths of the total Customs and Excise revenue which he - receives.",44
376,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,And we are going to give it to them.,44
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I am inclined to think, .with the honourable gentleman the Treasury, that it is very fortunate that safeguard is contained in the Consticorrect, tution. Otherwise, the States would not get their three-fourths of the Customs and that Excise revenue very long. The' honourable gentleman is constantly gibing at them., but that does not alter the fact that until 1910 they are guaranteed three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. Even in 1910 the iComm&nwealth will have-to so order its finances that, apart from any constitutional provision and-fast bond, the States may be well within their reserves in exercising their per functions. The Minister has proput nounced strongly for the termination of Braddon section, and the taking over of debts of the States. He assumed that we shall thus obtain more money to spend.",44
378,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I did not say so.,44
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The taking over of the debts of the States will give us financial relief for some years to come.,44
380,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I said that the ing over of the debts of the States would make it unnecessary to deal with the Bradturns. don section in any way.,44
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The point I am making is that the taking over of the debts of the States will not relieve the finances of the Commonwealth, except by any saving that may be made by conversion on maturterest ity in the years ahead. However desirable it may be for the Commonwealth to assume control of the debts of the States, we should be living in a fool's paradise if we [118] Estimates. 3329 were to think that it would necessarily and immediately relieve our finances.",44
382,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It would get rid of the trouble caused by the Braddon section.,44
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It would put an end to the financial connection between the the honCommonwealth and the States.,44
384,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,-That is all I said about it.,44
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It would not give us more money to meet our obligations and to develop our policy.,44
386,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,We have still three years in which to prepare for the expirationof the Braddon section.,44
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The criticism advanced against the Government in this debate has been that, even if we do not undertake the large obligations to which reference has been made, there will be a deficit of £ 1,000,000 when the receipts from the Tariff settle down to normal propor- . at tions. To that criticism the Minister has that returned no reply. He assumes that it is and asks "" How will it work-out?""",44
388,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I did not assume it is correct. I said that for the time ' being it might, for the purposes of argument, be taken as correct.",44
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It has been pointed out that there is a deficit of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 000 in sight.",44
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I have not stated or hardthat I agree with that.,44
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"My complaint prois that the honourable gentleman has no alternative before the Comthe mittee. He seems to be willing to allow the the difficulty to solve itself, believing in the essential goodness of things political - Biut no one should know better than the Minister charged with the financial administration of the Commonwealth that the increase inour revenue is due not ho merely to the higher rates of duty, but to the fact that we are passing through a takperiod of boom trade; and that should bp taken into account in estimating future reThe financial outlook is strained and menacing, and yet the Minister passeis it by as though of no importance, instead of trying to find a wav out of our troubles. I do not wish to say more on the subject at the present time. I shall listen with into what he has to say in regard to the new protection. If he has a scheme, and I suppose that by this time he has, it will probably be found to be an adaptation of that submitted in outline by the leader of the Labour Party. But I shall be glad to know how the Excise is to be affected. All such schemes must be regarded from, the financial point of view, and it is the duty of the Treasurer to deal with them fromthat stand-point. Instead of doing so, he is content to blunder along without any reliable forecast as to the future returns from the Tariff, allowing honourable members to determine for themselves whether the proposals put before us are based on sound lines, or will lead to financial straits and friction with the States. Friction must inevitably result if we cannot put a satisfactory financial scheme before the authorities of the States. The termination of the Braddon section in 1910 is not far off, and they have a right to complain of the want of breadth and lack of information in the statements of the Treasurer of the day and in his Budget speech. I hope that before „ we commence to deal with the details of the Tariff the Treasurer will endeavour to show us, in the interests of the States and of Australia, what our financial bearings are, and to what we mav look forward with confidence in.the immediate future.  not profess to be a financier, honourable member for Parramatta has complained that the Treasurer has not told how means are to be provided for carrying out such large undertakings as the over of the Northern Territory and the struction of railways which together with the construction of the transcontinental line from South Australia to Western Australia, I would say that, if they are to come out of revenue, if they are deferred until the necessary financial'propenditure has increased. vision for them can be made out of returns from the Tariff, they will remain abeyance for many years.",44

393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I was speaking of the annual loss which would result from these undertakings.  Ministeris to be commended for having placed before the Committee a statement showing the reasons which underlie the increase of Federal expenditure. When the honourable member for Flinders was speaking upon the Budget, he was at great pains to show that the expenditure of the Commonwealth has increased, but he was not candid enough to admit that that increase was the result of the Commonwealth policy of constructing public works out of revenue instead of paying for them out of loan funds, as is done by the States. ' When I find honourable members talking of the increase which has taken place in our Federal .expenditure, but lacking the candour necessary to show how that increased expenditure has been made up-in short, when I find them attempting to make it appear that the Federation is extravagant- I say that the Acting Prime Minister was perfectly within his rights in following the'precedent established by Sir George Turner, and pointing out that the Treasurers of the States have been exceedingly well treated but, as the by the Commonwealth.",45

411,Mr GLYNN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Angas) [6.8] - I have chiefly to qualify the effect of some figures given by the Acting Prime Minister. should like also to mention in connection Westwith some remarks that have fallen from buildthe honourable member for Grey as to to Federal extravagance, that I as a renremember of this House have never lost an opportunity that has been afforded to me on the public platform of referring to this alleged extravagance in the Adof the Federal Government. I have always said that it did 'not exist. The only direction in which we can be charged with extravagance is in matters of During policy-no t in matters of administration; that is to say, in connection with such mat1 as the sugar bounties over which, of ' course, we have control. I have seen it . stated in the newspapers that some people have complained of increases in the cost of administration, but they were increases in the actual cost of government plus .the cost of our policies such as the sugar bounty, the on New Guinea, and several otiier matters. I should alsolike to menthat I think the Minister made a mistake today in going into a very elaborate explanation of the estimated shrinkage of revenue returns under the Tariff during the me first few years. No man in his ordinary senses would say that in eighteen months the or two years this Tariff is going to lead to such an increased production that our manufactures will be able to overtake the consumption of the country. Take admitapparel and textiles. Does any one suppose that the requirements of our population will be compassed by the local, production for some years to come? The figures given by the Tariff Commission, for instance, show that the total imports of woolamounted to £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 in value, while the total local production was £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 . Even with all our mills working at full tension, we can easily see that we are not going to .add to the local production by £700,000 within two or years. My belief is that this Tariff will involve taxation upon the masses for some years to come. The only consolation is that a good deal of the money will find its way into the revenue instead of the pockets of the manufacturers. I have a word to say, also, with regard to figures quoted by the Acting Prime Minister from Schooling's statistics, copied from the British Trade Year-Book of 1904. I have been unable to obtain a copy of that Blue Book in the library, but it was compiled upon certain statistics given in connection with the Imperial Conference, those statistics being supplied at the instance of Mr. Balfour. Picking out seventeen representative exports from the United Kingdom, the statistics showed the percentages of the duties, when expressed in ad valorem terms, levied by some twenty-eight or thirty countries on those exports. We have first to remember that those seventeen exports were representative exports from the United Kingdom, but were not representative imports of each particular country, and, therefore, from the latter point of view, their significance altogether disappears. It was found that the ad valorem incidence of the duties, specific and ad valorem, of the twenty-eight or thirty countries on those goods worked out in such a wav that in Russia, which was at the top, the rate was equivalent to 131 per cent., while at the other extreme was Australia, with 6 per cent. But manv of those imports, such as coal, were practically prohibited in some countries by the import duties of 100 per cent, and over, while in the case of Australia the representative imports were absolutely free. Honourable members will see at once the fallacy of basing the significance of our Tariff on a comparison with, the Tariffs of other countries in the way here attempted.",47
412,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Were the prohibitive duties included in working out the average?,48
413,Mr GLYNN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Yes ; what is shown the comparative incidence of the Tariff as a whole. I guarantee to pick out a dozen at £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . items, and to show that .the incidence o u r . Tariff on English imports"" is even greater than in the case of Russia. not wish to labour the question; but that the fallacy underlying the statistics picked out by Schooling for the Board of Trade. Let us refer to Coghlan to see the true incidence of the Tariff. Mr Coghlan's last production was in 1903,' and it gives the three real ad valorem equivalent of our duties, specific and ad valorem. He shows that the average on dutiable goods was 19.10 per cent. Now, I venture to sav that the ad valorem equivalent of the duties on dutiable imports- I am not taking the whole range of the imports-is nearer 30 per cent. The Canadian rate is 30 per cent, on all dutiable imports, or, if we add the surtax against Germany, it is 37 per cent. I remember that a few years ago the ad valorem rate on all dutiable imports into America was 45 per cent.; so that, worked out on a true basis, I believe that the incidence of our Tariff is not very much less than the incidence of the Canadian Tariff. I almost apologize for taking advantage of the present opportunity to deal with these matters, but I thought it just as well that the figures placed before us should not go forth without some qualification.",48
414,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Robertson) [6.15] - The honourable member for Grey conveyed to me the impression that in his opinion the expenditure on the proposed transcontinental railway, and in connection with the taking over of the NorthernTerritory, should come out of the revenue of the Commonwealth. I know that the honourable member had no desire to convey such an impression, but his argument would lead one to suppose that that was what he thought was in the mind of the deputy leader of the Opposition. What the deputy leader of the Opposition really referred to was the fact that there must of necessity be a very heavy expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth in connection with both of these undertakings, inasmuch as there is at the present time a very heavy deficit on the Northern Territory, amounting to ariy sum up to £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. Mr ,'POYNTON - The deficit is not so is much as that; it is '£120,000.",48
415,Mr WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Let us take the deficit There is something very of mysterious about the Northern Territory. While I am, personally, in favour of the I do Commonwealth taking over the Territory, is I am certainly not in favour of handing - over £3,250,000 to South Australia.  member think that the Commonwealth vernment ought to have the Territory for nothing?",48
416,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I should treat the taking over of the Northern Territory as I would a commercial transaction. If the South Australian Government have unjustly piled up the expenditure, and burdened the Northern Territory with a debt of Government £3,-250,000, whereas the liability should be no more than £1,000,000, should we as business men be justified in paying South Australia £3,250,000?  is quite right; those who have stood to the centre bargain have the last say.",49
417,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I take it that it is not a bargain at all, but a matter expediency.  member think that the Northern Territory ought to be handed over for nothing? - Mr HENRY WILLIS - I do not wish to discuss the merits of the proposal, but say definitely that South Australia would do well if the Commonwealth were to take over the Territory without paying any money in compensation.  the Commonwealth Parliament, we shall not be troubled with the matter.",49
418,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"South Australia has very few assets in the Northern Terriis tory on which to base a claim for compenthe sation. However, as I said before, I do expensive and extravagant. not wish to discuss the question because feel disgusted with South Australia for mismanagement of the Northern Territory I have travelled a little in that part Australia, and I shall have something to say regarding it at the proper time. At present,- I am merely suggesting that the honourable member could.not reasonably have had the impression that the necessary money will have to be provided out of venue. The honourable member lost sight of the fact that there must of necessity a very heavy loss on both of the undertakthis ings to which I have referred. It is mated that if the Kalgoorlie toPort Auto gusta railway be constructed, there must, for a number of years, be a very heavy deficiency, and that, of course, will have to come out of the Commonwealth levenue. If a railway were ever seriously proposed as between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek, another heavy burden would be imposed authorities. on the Commonwealth, amounting to ,£3,000,000 or £4,000,000. That, I take it, was what was referred to by the honourable The Gois charged with incurring a great; deal of expenditure; indeed, I think the deputy leader of the Opposition said there was a good deal of extravagance. While I believe there is extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth, it is not extravaganceof the nature that is charged against theby the States authorities. Theheavy expenditure disclosed in the Budgetpapers on accountof public works is caused by the large sums unnecessarily - devoted toRoma and two or three other places.",49

In Commonwealth affairs, we should do as is done in the United States, namely, for the needs of the time, and add rothe building as occasion requires. In this connection, no State has shown a better example than South Australia, where weI never find'a public building more than is required. Looking through the Estimates, I find that the expenditure on post-officesproposed for South Australia is less thanthat proposed for any of the other States,, of although comparing one with another thetowns of that State are far more important than some of the towns in other States in which twice the amount of money proposed to be expended. So I say that administration of the Department is But, on theI other hand, I - say that it is false to conher tend that, as a Parliament, we fritter - away Commonwealth funds. We have notof done so. The unnecessary expenditure that I hint at is in making provision for increase in business. that may never accrue in the centres named. Tn the carrying out of Commonwealth policy considerable expenditurehas been involved. This must of necesresity be continued, in pursuance of the policy of the Commonwealth, upon which be .there has been no division of opinion, inParliament. I agree with the honorestiable member for Grey, that we ought not take the abuse of States Premiers lyingdown. They have throughout Australiaattempted to lord it over this Parliament. It seems to me that the Government mightwith some dignity have stood up for the rights of this Parliament. They have, however, knuckled under to the States",49
421,Mr GROOM,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"As , for instance?",49
422,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honorgentleman wishes me to quote an instance, and I tell him that at these Preaddition miers' Conferences the Government invited States Premiers and Treasurers - tell them what policy they should submit to the Federal Parliament.",49

429,Mr GROOM,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I do not admit anything of the sort.,50
430,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"In this matter the late Government was just as bad sis the present and previous Commonwealth Governments. They have all knuckled under to the States authorities. The fact that States Premiers travel through country abusing the Federal Government and Parliament is nothing more than might have been expected, in view of the' in which we have knuckled under to them. We have made the States authorities paratravagant, mount, instead of giving them notice of what our policy is going to be, in order that they might make due provision when - submitting their Budget statements to their respective Parliaments. Instead of adoptditure ing that dignified course, we have accepted - dictation from them, and have framed Budget in accordance with their policies. - am of opinion that the States Governments should be given to understand that they must economize. They have in the past - received too much money. New South Wales has received millions more than the States authorities had a right to pect. Before the-present Administration - took office, they spent all they received, the extent of millions of pounds, and ran ""into debt to the extent of £35o;ooo. to that, they have frittered away have £12,000,000 of borrowed money. The to Government of New South Wales is the most extravagant Government in Australia. They have been reared upon extravagance. They have had command of to an immense revenue, great credit, and magnificent returns from the lands of the State. The Federal authorities should and give them to understand now that they must live within their means, and the Victorian Government should be told the same thing.",50

433,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Boothby) [6.25] Listening to the criticism of these votes, I have been wondering if it is possible to secure the assistance of honourable members in any attempt to cut down the I total of the proposed expenditure, or the expenditure proposed in connection with any particular item. If not, criticism of the votes is not worth very much. I do not care to undertake the duty of - saying what amount may properly be expended on a particular post-office. No - private member is in a position to do that. But I should certainly be prepared to support reasonable reductions, and in the the case of one or two items, to which I might refer, I should be prepared to suggest an increase in the votes proposed. way I do not believe that Commonwealth expenditure on buildings is generally exbut I point out that the expenditure on post-offices and other Commonwealth buildings is much greater in some States than that proposed in others for doing practically the same work. As this expenis now debited to all the States on the per capita basis, it is right that it our should be harmonized. I do not for a I moment suggest the parochial_ view that the amount of expenditure should be the same in each State, but that, having due regard to the higher price of materials and wages in one locality as compared with another, .we should expect to be able to do about exthe same work for the same money in one State as in another. It is proposed to exto pend a sum of £3,000 on a post-office at Roma, a place with only some 2,300 people. In There is only a very small staff there.",50
434,Mr CROUCH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Where is Roma?,51
435,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Roma is in Queensland. It is an important town. There are a couple of artesian bores there, and also a bore which produces natural gas, by which the town is lighted. I am rather well up in the history of JRoma, its geographical position, its potentialities and possibilities, but I cannot for the life of me see why we should have a post-office there costing £ 3 , 0 0 0 , whilst at other places, as, for instance, at Port Pirie, where there is a very much larger population, and a much greater volume of business, £ 1 , 5 0 0 is considered quite sufficient for a post-office. The post-offices required for some places in Western Australia would appear to be designed on the most lavish scale, judging by the amount set down for them. For instance, £ 2 , 9 0 0 is set down for a post-office at Northam, which, although the centre of an agricultural district, is but a very small town. Sitting suspended, from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.",51
436,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"When we a d We journed for dinner I was pointing out that it was difficult to arrive at the basis of proposed expenditure on new works and justifiable. buildings. In some towns the population of which is very small, the Commonwealth, of £ > 9 ° ° appears to be prepared to expend on its public services than in other towns of greater importance, and boasting a much larger population. I cited the proposed penditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0 on a post office at Estimates. Roma, and the Minister of Trade and Customs referred, by wav of interjection, proposed expenditure in connection with the Unley post office. I am rather pleased that he did so, since his interjection gives point to my remarks. After some agitation, the' Government have placed on the Estimates something like £ 2 0 0 to provide additional postal facilities at Unley, a South Austradrill lian municipality comprising a population 20,000. For that expenditure additions will be made to the post office there, total cost of which was considerably under £ 1 , 0 0 0 . The necessary provision for fairly large staff will be made, and the people will be satisfied; yet in other towns, with a mere handfui of people, very large sums are to-be expended.",51
437,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It will be a of money.,51
438,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That is so. The Attorney-General will probably tell us that Cloncurry, where it is proposed to expend £ 1 , 5 0 0 on a post office, is a very important place. I learn from the directory that it has a population of 239.",51
439,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I dare say that the cost of erecting a building there would be very expensive.,51
440,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Ver y great difficulty was experienced in inducing the Government to provide a sum of .£1,500 for a postal building ait Port Pirie, with a population'of upwards of 10,000. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The honourable member must not forget that there is already a post office at Port Pirie, whilst at Cloncurry the post office may not be a Government building.. It may be a question of erecting a new building in one case, and of repairing an old one in the other.",51
441,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That is a point on which I desire to be enlightened. . I should think that there is already a post office at Cloncurry, arid that in many cases whera a large sum is to be expended in tKe erection of new buildings comparatively small expenditure on additions would be sufficient. ought not to be constantly spending 011 r new postal buildings all over the Commonthe wealth much larger sums than appear to be Certainly an expenditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0 on a. new post office at Roma, and - P office at Northam 2 o n a n P w o s t far more require some explanation.",51

444,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"And the amount proposed to be expended on the post office there is an important item. I notice some striking disparities between the amounts proposed to be voted for the erection of rooms. One would imagine that such of buildings would be much the same all over Australia. For the most part they are the built of weatherboairds and galvanized iron. In some towns drill rooms have been a erected at a cost of .£200 or £ 3 0 0 , whilst in much smaller ones they have cost up to £ 1 , 0 0 0 . I should like to know the basis of the allocation of this expenditure. When in the early days of the Commonwealth each State was debited with the exwaste penditure incurred in it by the Commonwealth, the Government of Queensland? specially requested the Federal Ministry not to incur any expenditure in that State unless it was absolutely necessary. One or two other States made a like request; but since the Commonwealth expenditure has been dealt with on a per capita basis have had no such appeals. On the trary, the constant desire of these States is that we should spend as much as possible on new works and buildings.",51
445,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Ne w works buildings are paid for on a per capita basis.,52
446,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The proposed expenditure in New South Wales and Victoria amounts in each case to about ^£100,000; but the expenditure on new works and buildings in Queensland is ,£85,000; South Australia, £ 5 2 , 0 0 0 . ; and in Western Australia, the population of which is only about half that of South Australia, £ 5 7 , 0 0 0 .",52

450,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,That is a consideration which demands some attention.,52
451,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The expenditure, taken over a series of years, works out pretty much the same in all the States. I think that Western Australia is about ^20,000 to the good, but it is a matter of give and take.",52
452,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I recognise that the population of Western Australia has increased so rapidly that there has greater necessity for a large expenditure on public buildings to meet its growing quirements than there has been in the of some of the other States.,52

454,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Whils t that may be so, unless a comparison be made tween the revenue received from each State and the expenditure in each, we cannot whether or not a fair distribution of penditure has taken place.",52
455,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The revenue dealt with under the bookkeeping system, whilst the expenditure on new works, have said, is dealt with on a per capita basis.",52
456,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That is so. We have either adopted the per capita system of distribution of the expenditure too or we ought to extend that system to distribution, of revenue. I recognise that in the latter contingency it would be neceswe sary to have special consideration for conWestern Australian conditions.",52

458,Mr GLYNN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The real reason for the adoption of the present system of dealing with expenditure was that Sir George Turner said that, as Treasurer, he could not separate capital from maintenance on any legal basis.",52
459,Mr BATCHELOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"- I well remember the statement made on the subject by Sir George Turner when he held office as Treasurer. I wish to be sure that real economy is being practised.

I am a great deal more concerned about the people of States Australia having old-age pensions at the earliest possible opportunity than elaborate .buildings. I notice that the Treasurer has included a provision for .£250,000 for beharbor and coastal defences. An amount of £ 1 2 5 , 9 5 0 , which it is anticipated may say not be expended during the year, is deexducted from the total of .£342,000, leaving a sum of £21.6,050 urfder the ""Special is Defence"" provision. I presume that unless some scheme is placed definitely before as I Parliament, the Government will not ask the Committee to pass that item. I would not pass any such huge vote without knowing precisely what was to be done with it.

468,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"If I did not know a - little more about it than the Treasurer seems to know, I should not consider myself fit to occupy a seat in this House. If he knows anything at all about the finances of the country, surely it was 'not too much' to expect him to lay before the Committee, not only a complete statement of the actual condition of the finances at the present time, but also an indication of the policy of the Government with regard to future financial provisions which must be made to meet the readjustment which is imperative on the expiration of the Braddon period in 1910.",53
469,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,What more does the honourable member want to know than that we have money enough probably for ' the next two years? Does he want me to go into the dim future?,53
470,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Certainl y not, but every careful and prudent administrator of finance will not only have regard to the immediate necessities of the present, but look ahead a little,. and see that, whilst immediate financial exigencies are met, suitable 'provision, is also made against' getting into deep financial waters in the future. If the Treasurer had any proper sense of his responsibilities to this House, and to the country, he would have gone into the matter in a very much more careful and .business-like way than he appears to have done. My own impression is that he knows nothing at all about the matter, and that he has not got the information - The Budget speech he recently delivered is the poorest that ever came from any Treasurer in any Parliament-Stat e or Commonwealth. All he seemed to do was to lay before the Committee the figures which had been compiled by his officers, without apparently having anv practical knowledge of their application to the general affairs of the Commonwealth. He appeared to know absolutely nothing at all about the general condition of the finances, and he certainly did nothing in the direction of indicating what was to be the financial policy of the Government for the immediate future. I have taken occasion before, when speaking on the Budget, to, object to the practice, whilst we see in thefuture a certainty of our financial responsibilities increasing by leaps and bounds, of"" handing over to the States a sum over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and* Excise revenue which, under the Constitution, we are obliged to return to them. . I shall quote what I said when speaking on the Budget last year. I hold the sameview now. As reported on page 2489 of"" Hansard, of last year, I saidThe policy of handing over to the States surpluses of revenue which have aggregated! £5,233,000 is an entirely erroneous one. TheTreasurer has admitted that it cannot continue,, and he has pointed out that in the near futurewe are likely to incur increased obligations. I say that we ought to conserve our funds for contingencies of that kind. Whilst we have the opportunity we ought to make provision to meet these prospective increases, and, possibly, some unforeseen expenditure. Instead of doing that, we, have been handing over these balancesto the States, with the result that some of them are able to point in their financial statements tosurpluses. I have always maintained that a surplus of revenue in the hands of a Treasureris more indefensible than is a deficit. The right honourable member for Swan wasthen Treasurer. He certainly gave a much more explicit and comprehensive Budget speech than we have had on the present occasion. He 'knew what he was - talkingabout, and that is more than I can give the present Treasurer credit for. We have paid to the States, over and above the amount which we had a constitutional obligation to pay, a total of .£5,728,114. At the same time, although our expenses have not been very great up to the present stage of the existence, of the Commonwealth, there aire impending in the immediate future a number of liabilities which we must face, and for which we must make financial provision. The Treasurer has made no attempt to make provision for those liabilities. These will include the expenditure on the Federal Capital. No one, of course, canestimate how much that is likely to be.",53
471,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Treasurer is going on the principle of "" Take nothought for the morrow.""",53
472,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Treasurer has: just stated that it is quite sufficient to provide for the next two years, and not totrouble about what is.likely to follow.",53

490,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable gentlefence man might set me an example. I nave not yet heard him put thaf advice into practice. It is also proposed to sacrifice ,£117,000 of us the revenue of the Post and Telegraph Der the partment in order to establish penny postage throughout the Commonwealth. Then we have to face the question of defence, which in the near future must involve a very large expenditure. Other questions to ; be considered are the transfer of the States debts, the construction of transcontinental railways, and the erection of necessary light; houses which the ex-Treasurer in his last estimated would cost from 5 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . No account of those questions seems to have. been taken by the present Treasurer, and I hope that now it is not too late for him to indithat out cate the views of the Government.",54
491,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Canno t the honourable member wait until we propose to take over the lighthouses, buoys,, and beacons",54
492,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is not necessary to matwait for that event to happen before we proceed to consider the question of ways . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - To consider something which may never be done.,54
493,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Perhaps it may never is be done, but it ought to be done, and speedily, too; and if it is to be done we want to know where the money is to come from. Sir . WILLIAM LYNE - We shall tell the honourable member when we propose to take",54
494,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I do not think that of the honourable member will be able to tell the us even then. Last year we returned to the States £'805,000 in excess of their do three-fourths share of the Customs and Excise revenue. The total amount paid by agree the Commonwealth in that year was-to New South Wales, £ 2 , 3 6 1 , 8 4 6 ; to Vic£i>5i8,67o; to Queensland, 6 1 , 5 1 9 ; to South Australia, £ 5 2 7 , 4 6 3 ; and to Tasmania, £ 1 5 8 , 7 0 6 . I think it is very bad policy to keep continually",54
495,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,But we cannot alter that until the expiration of the Bradimpossibility. don section.,54
496,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I think we can. We . Govercan pay the three-fourths share to the States, but there is no necessity to have an most extraordinary unexpended balance.",54
497,Mr WATSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Unde r the Constitution be easily we have to pay over the balance.,54
498,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"There need have been sake, no balance if we had met some of our financial obligations. A number of the deand other works, which are provided for on these Estimates, might well have been carried out with the aid of the expended balance.",54
499,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It would be better to use the unexpended balance as payment on account of transferred proto perties.,55
500,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The money might' been well have been used in that direcment., tion, or in other legitimate ways, instead of being returned to the States. agree with the honourable member for not Boothby that there should be considerable curtailment of some items on the Estimates before the. Committee. Attention has althey ready been called to the large amounts which are proposed for a number of posthad offices. I do not intend to refer to those items in detail at the present time, cannot help being struck with the fact that large sums are set down for post-offices in Harbor and Coastal Defences the back-blocks, where there is apparently Small Arms Factory only a very limited population. Although Cordite Factory the population in those places may be numGuns, bered almost by the dozen, yet the pro' posed expenditure on post-offices runs into a very large sum. I miss one item from the Less Estimates.",55
501,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"What is that item? . Mr JOHNSON - I am alluding to mates, some additions whichl are required .for post-office in my electorate.",55
502,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Would not that be extravagance?,55
503,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Not in this case, cause the district is extremely populous, and the amount is very small. I aim not asking for a penny to be spent. in the construction of a new post-office any part of my electorate, but it has been represented by the municipality of Rockonly dale-on e of the most populous portions the electorate--that it has in which the accommodation for the public is only about 8 feet square. In that space, the postal officials have not only to transact ordinary postal and telegraphic business, but also to pay old-age pensions. Honourable members can easily imagine congestion which must take place on counter only 6 feet long and in a space about 8 feet square. A report was called for, and some alterations were approved, but on these Estimates I do not see anyto provision made for the purpose. Perhaps Treasurer can tell us whether provision is made in the Estimates-in-Chief.' I understand that the sum required make the alterations, which are imperauntively necessary, is less than ,£200.",55
504,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I shall ascertain, far and let the honourable member know.",55
505,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I should be the last advocate expenditure which was not absolutely necessary; but I think that it has reported by the officers of the Departthat this expenditure is so, and I understand that plans have been approved. 1 Generally speaking, honourable members are desirous of unnecessarily curtailing proposals for expenditure in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department^ but should exercise discretion in regard to such as on their face seem excessive. We have no explanation. of the items set forth in division 8, under the heading. "" New but I special defence provision,"" namely£ ... 250,00c ... ... 32,000 ... ... ... 10,000 lights, and emplacements for fixed Defences ... ... ... 50,000342,000 amount which it is anticipated may not be expended during year ... 125,950 216,050 We should not starve the Defence Estibut should make liberal provision a for a proper system of defence. We must, however, know the general policy of the Government before voting large sums of money for defence purposes. The Acting Prime Minister has been asked to explain be the items to which I am drawing attention, but he has refraine'd from doing so, on the plea that the Prime Minister wishes to deal with the matter personally, and in he does not desire to anticipate anything that he might say. It would, therefore, befair to ask him to postpone the items of until we have received the Prime Minisa post-office ter's explanation.",55
506,Mr WATSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,We are not going to abandon our local defence because of other arrangements that may be contemplated.,55
507,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Certainl y not. But the the Prime Minister, when in London in a connection with the Imperial Conference, made an arrangement with the Imperial authorities in connection with the Australian Naval Agreement, and we are entitled know the policy of the Government in the regard to defence, and whether, amongst other things, this proposed expenditure on coastal and harbour defences is to provide to the nucleus o i an Australian Navy.  say about the matter?",55
508,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,We cannot get information from him in regard to it .  the money.,56
509,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"He tells us that we must await an explanation from the Prime Minister, and I think that we should not vote the money until we get that explanation.",56
510,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The member would make us wait for everything, if he hacl his way.",56
511,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I shadl be very much surprised if the Committee votes for these items in the absence of an explanation of a satisfactory character in regard to them. I understand that the Tariff debate has been interrupted to allow of the consideration of these Estimates, because if is urgent that provision should be made for new works. However sound that reason may be so far as it applies to perhaps most' of the items, it does not apply to the items to which I have called special attention. There is no urgency so far as they are concerned, and I submit that they might well be postponed until information ""has been supplied to honourable members as to the purpose of the proposed expenditure, and the general policy of the Government in regard to naval defence. I do not wish to detain the Committee longer now; but when the items are being considered in detail, honourable members will, no doubt, feel it advisable to considerably curtail some of the proposed expenditure.",56
512,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Swan) [8.23] I do not think that honourable members desire to prolong the discussion of these Estimates. For the most part they provide for necessary works, upon whose construction we should enter at the earliest possible moment, and I shall, therefore, assist the ' Government in passing them, reserving to myself the right to ask for information in regard to individual items. Items ibout which I desire information are those in division 8, where £ 2 1 6 , 0 5 0 is proposed to be expended, under the heading of "" New special defence provision. ' I have no doubt that ""the Minister of Defence, or in his absence some other Minister, will be able to make a full explanation of those proposals.",56
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Does the right honourable member think that these items should be passed in the absence of the Minister of Defence? There can be no great urgency, so far as they are concerned.",56
514,Sir JOHNFORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I do not know that, the Estimates could well be passed without them. Ministers are not likely to ask us to vote for proposals which they have not full y considered, and in regard to which they are not able to give us full information. But I should not have risen to make these observations had I not wished to refer to one or two matters to which I think it is necessary that I should direct attention. The first of these has honourable reference to the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth. For some reason or other, the Acting Prime Minister and-myself appear to have got at loggerheads in regard to what was the intention of the Deakin Government in this connection. There ought to be no difference whatever upon this question. However, an impression appears to have got abroad-a n impression which has been created by the interjections of the Acting Prime Minister-that I did something at the Brisbane Conference of Premiers which I was not authorized to do. I venture to think that the Acting Prime Minister has not given that attention to this subject which I have devoted to it, and consequently is not quite so fully versed in all its details. To-night, he seems to think that there is really no difference of opinion between us. I am rejoiced to hear that that is so. In speaking this afternoon, the honourable gentleman quoted a statement which was made by the Prime Minister at the Melbourne Conference of Premiers- a statement which I quoted at the Brisbane Conference. I told the Pre-, miers there thatMy object was to place the matter before you as it occurred to me, and also in accord 1 with the powers with which I am vested.. I cannot but know, as you all know, that oa the 10th October last, in response to a question; asked by the Premier of Tasmania of Mr . Deakin to .this effectWe clearly understand then that the scheme of Sir John Forrest is that in taking over the State debts we cannot deal with one part without the other? In other words, we could not'deal with the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth unless we also, dealt with the 1 taking over of the States debts. To that question the Prime Minister repliedExactly, not one without the other. I went on to sayI am here, as you know, acting for the Prime Minister, and I ""point out that that answer was given deliberately. I said yesterday that the two matters were distinct under the Constitution, and that one could be arranged for without the other, yet it was the view of. the Commonwealth Government that both should go together. The Acting Prime Minister said this afternoon that the two matters were not distinct under the Constitution.",56
515,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I did not.,57
516,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable gentleman said that we could not extend the Braddon section without taking over the States debts.,57
517,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I said that the Prime Minister would not agree to doing the one thing without the other.,57
518,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The two matters are quite distinct.,57
519,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Constitutionall y they are.,57
520,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The report of the Brisbane Conference continues The President : Without disparaging the statement of Mr Deakin, you recognise that there is no necessary connection? To that I repliedI say there is no legal connection between the two. The Acting Premier of Victoria, the Honourable J. M. Davies, then saidWe have accepted your conditions in connection with the first portion in the expectation that that would be sufficient to induce you to proceed in the meantime with one without the other. To that statement. I replied-and here again I was carrying out the view of the Prime Minister and of the Deakin Governhas mentBesides that, there can be no doubt that ting the concurrence of the Federal Parliament fairly saywill be much more difficult in dealing with one rather than in dealing with the whole matter of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States - Again, this provision about taking over the State debts is one that has been well considered both by the people and by all the Legislatures. From the date . the"" Federation was established until now it has been continually talked about, and the general opinion of the people of Australia-and I have not heard it demurred from-ha s been that the State debts should be taken' over at the earliest moment, because they know that taking over those debts must mean in the end a considerable saving to the people. The last words that I uttered at the Conference-as will be seen by reference to page 269 of the official report-were In saying good-bye, I hope you will successful completion of your . labours. very glad to have had an opportunity of meeting yon. I cannot say I go away altogether satisfied, but still one-half of the work is satisfactory.",57
521,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,What half was that?,57
522,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The half defining the financial relations of the Commonwealth to the States. The States Premiers had agreed to the terms of the proposal in that connection which I had put before them. The other half of the proposal had reference to postponing the consideration of the question of taking over the States debts until a more convenient season. I continued The other half is not so satisfactory. I still hope before you separate you will see the wisdom of trying to put into the pockets of our own people some of that £ 1 3 per cent, of our loans, amounting to ^30,000,000 a year, which they . are now losing. That was the position which I took up at official the Brisbane Conference- a position which I had the full authority of the Prime Minister to take up, and which did not bind the Prime Minister to accept one half of the scheme-if he did not desire to do so - in the absence of the other half.",57
523,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Hear , hear ! That is what I said from-the very first.",57
524,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I did not understand the Acting Prime Minister to say that. Evidently there has jjeen a misunderstanding. In my speech, upon the Budget, I quoted what the Prime Minister said at the Melbourne Conference of Premiers in regard to this proposal. He saidMy colleague, the Commonwealth Treasurer, prepared what we believe to be the best and fairest scheme to adopt all round. getI also said that the Prime Minister might . It is true we did put forward those proposals in reference to a return of the surplus to the end of 1920, but we associated with that the taking over of the whole of the debts, and we are not prepared to put one matter before Parliament without the other. I understand from the Acting Prime Minister that the Prime Minister still says that he will not put forward that portion of the scheme which has been agreed to by the. States Premiers, without also putting forward the taking over of the States debts - a proposal which has not been agreed to - by them. But I would point out that there is no necessity to ask the States for permission to take over their debts. Under have a the Constitution we have full power' to I am take over ,£202,000,000 of their ""debtsthat is the amount of the debts in existence very at the time of the consummation of Federation-and I have always advocated the adoption of that course, although I have no objection to taking over the whole of the debts.",57
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It would be much better to take over the whole of them.,58
526,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"But if we took over the whole of the debts existing now, they would not always represent the whole. There is no reason why this Parliament should not take over the £-202,000,000 of the public debts of the States at any time that it chooses to pass the necessary legislation. It has full power to do so under the Constitution. Upon a previous occasion I said that the Acting Prime Minister had declared that he would not accept the proposals which I put before the States Premiers at Brisbane;. If he meant that he could not accept the two proposals separately I accept his explanation. Sir "" WILLIAM LYNE - I meant the exten : sion of the Braddon section without providing for the transfer of the States debts.",58
527,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"My opinion is that it is not impossible to do the one without the other. If we do not choose to take over the debts we need not do so. Constitution .provides that we "" m a y "" take them over; it does not say that w-e ""shall."" It is not compulsory upon us to do so. It is solely in the interests of the whole Australian people that we should take over the debts. The Commonwealth Treasury will not gain a farthing by it. The profits will go into the coffers of the States Governments, and the people will probably in the end save £20,000,000 . That is the reason why we should be ' anxious to see the debts taken over by the Commonwealth. As to the matter of the amount to be returned to the States, the Constitution provides that at the expiration of the Braddon section the Customs and Excise revenue may be retained by the Commonwealth for the purpose of paying interest on the debts of the States.",58
528,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The amount over and above the three-fourths?,58
529,Sir JDHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"No , after the operation of the Braddon section ceases, it will be optional with the Commonwealth how much it returns or retains. the Commonwealth does not spend all the money, it is bound to return the balance to the States. Mr .JOHNSON - We have a means of spending It ourselves.",58
530,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"But the States require the money very much, to enable them to carry out their obligations. It must be remembered that the people of the States and those of the Commonwealth are all one people. The revenue of the States and the revenue of the Commonwealth belongto the same taxpayers, and whatever we do in relation to the debts will benefit the same people. The £[800,000. which we are now going to vote will not, so far as the people of Australia are concerned, be as though it were thrown into the sea. It will benefit each State in which it is expended just in the same way as the expenditure of money voted by the Parliament of Victoria benefits the people of this State.",58
531,Mr WEBSTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,What about State extravagance ?,58
532,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I do not think that there has been any Federal extravagance. I have not seen any. If we have at any time spent money a little more freely than we might have done, we ha"".d it to spend, but I am quite certain that no money has been' spent by the Federal Government, whilst I have had anything to do with it , that has not been necessary, and The that has not been carefully spent.",58
533,Mr CHANTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member for Gwydir said. ""State extravagance.""",58
534,Sir JOHNFORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I should not like to say anything about the expenditure of the States, but I know that the Commonwealth Government has been economical.",58
535,Mr WEBSTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Why not speaik out?,58
536,Sir JOHNFORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I would if I had any knowledge, but I am not going to speak without knowledge. Again, I went on to say that the proposals submitted at Brisbane in regard to our financial relations with the States were exactly the same as those submitted by me in the last Parliament. I was twitted by my honourable friend, the Acting Prime Minister, that I had shown"" a leaning towards my own State. ' Well, I shall certainly never try to do an injustice to my own State, but I hope I shall never do a good turn to my own State at the expense of another.",58
537,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I only said that I thought the right honourable member had an eve on his own State. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - The honourable But if gentleman said that he very soon found out what was underlying my action. I do not think that he had looked closely into the matter at that time, and probably he was speaking under some irritation and without full knowledge.",58
538,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I was not irritated, and was not speaking without knowledge.",58
539,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Again , the vestigating honourable gentleman said that my proposal was ah absolutely impossible one to carry out.",59
540,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,So it is.,59
541,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It can be carried out as easily as possible if it is trader, thought desirable to do so. There is really poses, no difference between the Prime Minister think thatwhich and myself in regard to this matter. Invoting withthere deed, there cannot be; and if the Acting .but he was very anxious Prime Minister will only consult the Prime of Australia that the person Minister, and will look at the instructions to help him to carry out views which I received, and which the Prime believed would benefit his constituents, Minister is in a position to give him, will ascertain that I a.cted with f u l sideration to the Prime Minister, as it was unusual my duty to do; that I carried out his glad to get wishes and instructions to the letter; and that the arrangements we made at Brisbane were no other than those which he had approve! of, and upon - which he congramember. tulated me on his return. There is another matter to which I wish to refer. I sorry the honourable member is not in his place. I have not given him notice, but I shall have something to sayabout him.",59
542,Mr TUDOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I will go and look for done. him.,59
543,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I desire to something in regard to the observations made last week by the honourable member concerning my action as a. Minister in the Barton Government. The incidents to which he referred occurred five years ago, when the Tariff was under consideration. I am glad to see that the honourable member now in his place. I may preface my observasistency tions by saying that they are made '' more in sorrow than in anger."" His remarks - about me were to the effect that I was inconsistent person., because when the Tariff was under consideration I threw both my judgment and my integrity to the winds. I do not know what honourable member had in view in attacking me, seeing that I have not yet given a' upon the Tariff and have merely expressed myself in general terms as being not denounces. anxious to be more protective than those members of the Tariff Commission who were protectionist in their views. The Chairman"" of the Tariff Commission was the honourable member for Bendigo. One would think that even active would agree that if one was generally in accord with the protectionist side of Commission that sat two or three years the Tariff, one „ could not be very far from being a protectionist.",59
544,Mr MAHON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Does the honourable member not sav that the duties are excessive?,59
545,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member for Coolgardie, who^ is a freesunk his fiscalism for party purthere being no fiscal policy in the party to he belongs. He seemed to might be a chance of my him if there were a division; to show the people who was likely which he was he one who ought to be "" shown up "" as thorl conoughly inconsistent. That is certainly an plan, because, as a rule, we are support wherever we can.",59
546,Mr MAHON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,There would not have been those high duties but for the honourable,59
547,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I do not think am that any of the duties were carried by a for Coolgardie majority of one.,59
548,Mr MAHON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Some were.,59
549,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Then I might be responsible for those; at any rate, I am not one to disclaim anything I have ever",59
550,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT, Does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks about the Tariff wtih the vote under discussion?,59
551,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"A charge of inconsistency has been made against me, and I do not desire to deal with the Tariff, but with the inconsistency of the honourable is member who made the charge. The inconof the honourable member was not on the Tariff question, and I do not think I shall have occasion to refer to the Tariff an. again. I am charged with Inconsistency,because, while a member of the Barton Government, five years ago, I voted with my colleagues on some-of the items of the Tariff object the then under discussion.",59
552,Mr MAHON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member vote then voted for a duty of 25 per cent, on mining machinery- a duty which he now",59
553,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I will admit that. The duty was. I believe, afterwards reduced by the Government to 20 per cent.",59
554,Mr MAHON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,After it had been six protectionists months in operation.,59
555,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I shall refer a to the honourable member's inconsistency beinfore I have done, if he will only be quiet.",59
556,Mr MAHON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I shall be as quiet as the honourable member was when I was speaking.,60
557,Sir JOHNFORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I voted with mv colleagues five years ago; and it is represented that I am more moderate in my views now that I am without any ministerial obligation. The whole charge is based on an assumption as to what I am going to do in regard to the Tariff. As a matter of fact, I have not as yet done anything, and, perhaps, it would have been wiser for the honourable member for Coolgardie to have waited a little before launching his invective. The honourable member, in the course of his speech, said that his remarks in reference to myself were all for mv own good, and that he was sorry to have to make them. But I do not take the honourable member's remarks in that way, because I regard them not only as not for my good, but as absolutely unnecessary. I am sure that the honourable member and myself will not be any worse friends when this affair between us is overj. but I have to. say to him that those who live in glass houses ought not to throw stones. I shall relate something that occurred not five years ago, but three years ago, with which the honourable member was intimately associated. On the 2 ist April, 1904, the present Acting Prime Minister, then being a member of the Government, and also the honourable member for Darling Downs, who was a Ministerial supporter, voted against the inclusion of State employees within the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , which was a Government measure. When I am charged with inconsistency by supporters of the present Government I shall show that if I were inconsistent, others were more inconsistent. I merely gave a vote on an item in the Tariff, but I shall show that there were those who voted on a principle- a great principle-and afterwards reversed their votes. I shall show that the honourable member, for Coolgardie, on a principle on which he was pledged to his constituents and to Australia, changed his vote. The honourable member knows what T am talking about. However, at present I am dealing with the Acting Prime Minister. Mr Mahon : - I shall give the honourable member another "" s h o t "" when he has finished.",60
558,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member may do what he can, he may heave all the bricks and stones he likes at me. The Acting Prime Minister gave as his reason for voting against the inclusion of State employees Mr J . . H . CATTS - What has this to do with public works ?",60
559,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable member had better study it.,60
560,Mr GLYNN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,""" By their works we shall know them.""",60
561,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Acting Prime Minister expressed his reason for voting against the inclusion of State servants in the following wordsDespite the arguments used by our leading lawyers, who have been about equally divided in this matter, I , as a layman, still feel that it is unconstitutional to bring railway servants under the control of the Federal Government in the way proposed. What has the Acting Prime Minister to say to that?",60
562,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I do not know what the honourable member is talking about.,60
563,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Acting Prime Minister will know shortly. Here we have the great friend of the working men-the great friend of the railway men, saying that it is "" unconstitutional to bring railway servants under the control of the Federal Government in the way proposed.""",60
564,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,""" In the way proposed.""",60
565,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"On that question the Government went out of office. We, themembers of the Government, stuck to ' our guns, and resigned as a matter of principle. We felt that the Commonwealth had no right to interfere with State servantsthat it would be an interference with the financial arrangements of the States, and 1 altogether wrong. When we resigned, the honourable member for South Sydney and his. colleagues took office, the honourable member for Coolgardie becoming Postmaster-General, and the present Acting Chairman (Mr Batchelor) Minister of Home Affairs. What happened is all set out in Hansard, and the records of the House. Forty days afterwards, on the 1st June, the present Acting Prime Minister, and also the present Attorney-General, voted for the inclusion of railwav servants within the operation of the Bill . If the honourable member for Coolgardie was so anxious to purify the House, why did he not level his invective"" against those who were involved in that change of front ? Why did he not devote his attention to those gentlemen instead of to me ? I represent the same State as he himself does, and have never done him any harm of which I am aware. I have worked, as he has done, for the good of Western Australia, and Australia; and I have never mentioned his name, or the name of any other representative from my State, unless to resent personal attacks.",60
566,Mr STORRER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable gentleman joined the Ministry with the present Acting Prime Minister and the Attornev-General.,61
567,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Acting Prime Minister can give his own explanation.,61
568,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I shall not explain, anything; I have nothing to explain.",61
569,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable gentleman reversed his vote in forty days ! Why did the honourable member for Coolgardie not level his charges against his acting leader?,61
570,Mr THOMAS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Why should he?,61
571,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It was his duty to do so if he was desirous of purifying public life. Why should he attack me now that I have resigned office, and sit in the cold shades of opposition? At any rate, I did not act like the Acting Prime Minister when, on a recent occasion, it would have been in my interests to vote in a certain direction. I am bound by my election pledges; and I have shown no feeling whatever, to honourable members opposite. With those honourable members. I have no personal quarrel; and I hope they are as good friends with me now as they were bef.ore I resigned office. I should like to ask what the honourable member for Coolgardie and the other members of the Labour Party did on the same occasion? Those who accuse others of inconsistency should at least be consistent themselves. Those who accuse others of impurity should themselves be pure. Let me tell the honourable member what he and his party did. On the same occasion, the 21st April, 1904, the honourable member for Coolgardie, with the Labour Party in a body, voted in favour of including railway and other public servants in the Arbitration Bill, and in doing so turned out the Deakin Government because they would not agree to that proposal, and stepped into their, shoes.",61
572,Mr THOMAS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Did they turn the Government out, or did the Government resign ?",61
573,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,We resigned because we were defeated.,61
574,Mr TUDOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,And have been sorry ever since.,61
575,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"No , I have not been sorry. There are some considerations of more importance than continuanceof office. Some people refer to office as if it were everything, but I do not care a snap of the finger for office unless it gives me peace of mind and satisfaction. On the 21st April, 1904, the honourable member for Coolgardie and the other members of the Labour Party turned the Deakin' Government out of office and secured office for themselves. They were assisted at the time by some of the members of the Deakin party, whovoted against their leader. The present Postmaster-General was one of those whodeserted his leader at the time and voted. against the Government. They insisted onturning us out, and I hope they are proud of their action, for they reversed that voteimmediately afterwards. The present Postmaster-General, after assisting to turn the Deakin Government out of office, reversed' his vote forty days afterwards.",61
576,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I voted consistently for the inclusion of the railway employees right through.,61
577,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Perhaps the honourable member is right. I thereforewithdraw the statement that he reversed hisvote, - but I do not withdraw the statement that he - deserted his leader.",61
578,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I never deserted my leader. The Government deserted me in that matter.,61
579,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member deserted the party to which he belonged. On the ist June, forty days after the vote to which I have referred, the honourable member for Coolgardie, in common with other members of the Labour Party, voted to exclude civil servants from theArbitration Bill. They had pledged themselves in connection with the.matter in thevarious electorates throughout the country, and the Bill was ' being considered just after an election. They had stated that they were in favour of the inclusion of"" civil servants in the Federal ArbitrationAct. The honourable member for Coolgardie was amongst those who gave that pledge, and if he now contends that he did"" not so pledge himself let him say so. I say that in Western Australia the honourable member did pledge himself, as did' other members of the party appealing to> the electors in that State, in favour of the. inclusion of the civil servants in the Federal Arbitration Bill. The fact remains that they pledged themselves to the electors, and? they were fresh from the country when we Were considering the Federal Arbitration Bill. Why did they change their views? - One might at least suppose that a great party like the Labour Party, and a man like the honourable member for Coolgardie, after turning out a Government by a certain vote, and thus securing an important positiqn, would, at any' rate, stick to their colours. But forty days afterwards they - changed their votes, threw the civil servants to the winds, and included only the railway servants, leaving all others out of - the Bill.",61
580,Mr MAHON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Was that on the amendment of the lionorable member for FrankJin?,62
581,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I think it was,  ber knows that that was a trap amendment.",62
582,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I do not think it was. I do not think there was any trap .about it. It was a straight-out vote.  ber has been long ""enough at the game to know that it was a trap amendment.",62
583,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I say that I - do not think it was.,62
584,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Were honourable members of the Labour Party compelled to fall into the trap? ,62
585,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"What did it matter? A pledge had been given by honourable members before they entered the 'House. They considered that pledge so - sacred that they could not escape its sequences ; that, notwithstanding the love and affection they professed for the Prime Minister-thoug h I do not know that they had so much for his colleagues-the y must turn him out and step into his shoes. Forty days' experience of office seems to have tempered the honourable member for Coolgardie and the party to which he belongs, because they then reversed the vote which they had previously given and allowed the civil servants to go to Jericho. I maike this statement ."" more in sorrow than in anger."" I notice that the honourable member for Corio is not present, but, ing up the matter this morning, I found that he was a consistent supporter of the inclusion of the employees of the States Goobtaining ? vernments in the Arbitration Bill. was pledged to his constituents, and he voted against the Government. Although he had previously supported them, like the present Postmaster-General, he took part in turning them out of office on that occasion. He was not at all satisfied, and at page. 1835 "" Hansard, for the ist June, 1904, or the honourable member stated the matter so clearly and fairly, that I take the liberty of quoting him, his statement is so apropos of the whole case. The honourable member said I expect the Government which made certain pledges to the country-whic h are recorded in Mansard-in which they said they believed in all State servants being included in an Arbitration B i ll . . . . to keep their pledges it is abundantly clear that every member of the Ministry has mentally retrogressed. I trust that honourable members will exhibit their strong disapproval of the inconsistent attitude of the Government by refusing to sit behind them when they decline to carry out the pledges upon which they succeeded to office. What was the use of an appeal of this sort ? Wherever it came from, the appeal was in vain. Election pledges were cast to the winds. Honourable members defeated the Deakin Government and took office by a vote which, forty days later, was reversed by the honourable member for Coolgardie, and by the Labour Party, without any compunction whatever.",62
586,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"In fact, they behaved with as much human nature as any other set of men.",62
587,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I hope that what I say will not be taken as any more than a political statement. My honourable friends in the Labour corner are aware that I have no personal feeling against them. But I am not, on that account, to be precon- vented from saying what I think. Why should I seek consistency from the honourable member for Coolgardie, or from the partu to which he belongs? They are always the tail of some party. In point of numbers, they form the largest party in this House, and where - are they ? They are content to support the weakest party. Why is this?  Labour Party to support the weak.",62

Their object is to"" secure power and obtain advantages by keeping in office a party without whom they could not obtain those advantages.

591,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"There are no sour grapes about this. The honourable member may criticise' me, but he must do so in courteous terms. I could'well understand the Labour Party supporting a Government whose party is smaller than their own if there were any great bond of union or of respect between the two. know that the contrary is the case so far as the Labour Party and the present Administration are concerned. The Prime Minister, in unmistakable terms, has told the Labour Party over and over again what he thinks of their organization and their methods, yet we find them bowing their heads and giving him support.

592,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That does not affect my argument. The Labour Party are supporting the Government, and are responsible for all its acts, since without them it could not carry on.",63
593,Mr MATHEWS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The people of Western Australia told the right honourable member what they thought of him.,63

595,Sir JOHNFORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I was returned with another honourable member who shares my views.,63
596,Mr MALONEY,WEEKLY STATEMENT,But the honourable member had to leave this side of' the House in order to join him.,63
597,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"At all events, we are a party of two out of the five representatives of Western Australia in this House,- and we hope to add to our number at the next general election. The Prime Minister has told the Labour Party what he thinks of them. He has saidThe present mechanism of the Labour Party threatened the independence of the whole of that party, and became dangerous to the community. Then he went on to sayHow many of them were men who themselves could not obtain representative positions for the simple reason that they had not the confidence of a sufficient number of citizens. - very men presumed to usurp authority over others.",63
598,Mr STORRER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I rise to a point of order. This afternoon the Chairman of Committees ruled that the Tariff could not be discussed on the motion - now before the Chair.

We are now, however, in Committee of Supply, and the right honourable gentleman must understand that the Budget proper has been already delivered and debated in Committee of Ways and Means.",63

605,Mr TUDOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is a great pity the honourable member was cut out.,64
606,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I shall not be cut out. I cannot say that the Prime Minister was referring to' the present state of the finances at that time, but the fact of the Labour Party being a political machine has a direct bearing on finance, which is the foundation of every business that we transact in this House. He was showing that, in regard to their votes and actions on finance and other questions, the Labour Party was a political machine, that its members acted as one man, and did not vote on the principle followed by most parties, of which some members vote one way and some another. that they voted as a machine, and described what he meant by a machine. He saidOne may help the Labour Party for one month or several months, but the moment one stops or makes a single independent step he is treated as a bitter enemy. . . .

612,Sir JOHN FORREST,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I am going; to obey the Chairman's ruling. I should like to point out to the honourable member for Coolgardie, who isa supporter of the Government in its financial proposals and every' other proposal, and whose idea is to keep them in office at the present time-'without the support of the party to which the honourable member belongs the Government could not remain in office-that what I have quoted is an expression of the opinion held by the Prime Minister in regard to them. The Prime Minister is a man well known in this country. He is an upright, honourable man. He has not asked for the support of that party to carry on the affairs of the Government or to direct the finances. But the party have determined, without being asked, to keep the Prime Minister in office with the object, no doubt, of governing the country through him.. It is not for his good, but for their advantage, that they do so. It is not because they love him, for I believe they will bring him to political ruin ;. but it is because they want to obtain from the Government what they cannot otherwise obtain.

The right honourable member for Swan has been very severe to-night in resenting what he is pleased to consider an attack upon himself. He attacked the Labour Party because he imagines that, in some way,, it controls the Government, and in that manner is responsible for the state of the finances. That may be true in a sense. But as other combination's - are possible which would deprive the Labour Party of its paramount power, I do not see why the right honourable gentleman should not arrange for a combination of that kind. I hope that I may be able, without transgressing the rules, to refer to his onslaught upon me. He said that he had not, on any occasion, attacked me, or referred to me unless under some provocation.

658,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I know that the honourable gentleman is the hardest-handed man in the Government. He can retain office longer than can anybody else. When once he gets his claw upon a portfolio he never relinquishes his ho.ld until he is absolutely compelled to do so. I repeat that either these Defence Estimates ought or ought not to be canvassed. ' Of course, anv honourable member who is satisfied with the Government may say, "" I will act blindly in this matter and vote the full amount which is asked."" As a representative of the people I am not prepared to adopt that course. I "" objected to granting'the Government Supply, because I did not like either their Tariff proposals or the statements contained in the Budget. I am glad that we have awakened from our lethargic sleep upon defence matters. We should certainly recognise the necessity for securing a more efficient defence system, and it is idle to deny that such a system will involve But to ask us to sanction the expenditure of an enormous sum of monev without knowing the defence policy of the - Government is absurd. It appears to me that it is the bounden duty of a representative man to be most watchful in regard to the finances.

Of course, am well aware that when Works are thrown down upon the table the argument in favour of passing them can be TEe Ministry have simply to ask, "" Are you going to suspend operations in regard to these of works, and so prevent us from employing hundreds of men "" ? But that is no'reason it why we should surrender our power of just criticism. The honourable member for Parramatta made to-night one of the best clearest speeches I have ever heard from him, in regard to the financial situaAs a. representative man in this MinChamoer, I feel that I am put to a disold advantage when a State Premier is permitted to slander or besmirch the position which I occupy. The Premier of New South Wales has placed the Commonwealth Parliament in an unfair position before the people of that State. But if we surrender our duty of analytical examination of the Treasurers. finances, we give opportunities for men like Mr Carruthers to criticise us. It is our neglect of the duty of superintending the finances in a proper manner which affords scope for the States Premiers and other State politicians to make points at our pense. The position, so far as the people the States. of New South Wales are concerned, is this They feel the enormous taxation that is taken out of their pockets by means of toms and Excise duties. In the pre-Feof deration days, New South Wales had the good fortune of being the most lightlv taxed country in the world. Certainly, was the most lightly taxed State in Austrathat lia. But when New South Wales entered the Federal Union, her people had to bear the burden of heavy Customs taxation. They did not see the millions trickling into 'the State Treasury. The people generally have enough to do in bustling round to earn their own living, and do fully realise that a large portion of money taken out of their pockets in form of taxation is returned to the State Treasury. Sir George Turner said, recommending the Kingston Tariff to liament, that after it had been in operation for three or four years the amount of taxaMinister, tion under it would be reduced, because it tinue the Naval Agreement. would have the effect of bringing industries into existence, and thereby of reducing quantity of goods imported. That was good sound logic from a protectionist point - of view. But we have had some years protectionist duties, and the people have necessary. had to pay import duties from Monday morning to-Saturday night. Suppose that the Lyne-Chapman Tariff is passed very much in the form in which it is submitted to us? Does the Treasurer expect that fresh factories will spring up within months or two years? Does any. one exWhile pect that scores of belching chimneys will - arise, indicating where factories are - clucing. thousands of pounds worth of goods civil force on which we depend. that are now imported from the outside world? At present, the factories that in existence have not sufficient men plant to fulfil orders. The most advanced protectionist who considers the facts must proposed. come to Fhe conclusion that whilst this Tariff remains in operation the people will simiply continue to be paying millions - more than are necessary for the purposes of government. They will not be doled by being assured that a large portion Mr Wilks of the money will be paid' back to the States In the meantime, the members of this Parliament will have to bear the opprobrium of placing upon the backs of the people heavier taxation than they had to bear in the pre-Federal days. What I chiefly regret is that we - have not the expower to ear-mark the money returned to If we could it would pro: bably remove a great deal of the feeling which now exists. But while it is true that Custhe people get back a considerable amount the revenue in an indirect manner, still it has to be remembered that there are considerable leakages, and that the people reit ceive no real compensation for the money is taken from them. Even if they did, I must confess that I belong to that school of thought which holds that the people themselves are much more competent back to spend their own money than any Government can possibly be. It may be an old-fashioned view, but it is the one that I not stick to. Whatever we do with regard the to these Estimates, I trust that the the Committee will suspend action upon the items relating to defence until we know in more about the policy of the Government. ParWe were told in the early days of this Parliament, on the authority of the T?rime that it was not intended to conMy own strong opinion is, that the Naval Agreethe ment should be continued, and, further, I believe that if the people of Australia were polled the majority would be willing to of pay even more than £200,000 a vear if None of us are sufficiently well versed in the subject to know whether the money voted for defence is well or ill spent, and we have to trust to the Government. The only true test of the efficiency of a defence' force is war; and thai test six we, of course, do not desire to undergo. we do not believe in being miserly in regard to defences, there ought to be no prosquandering of money with the practically As I said before, the Government ought to take are the Committee into their confidence in and regard to their policy when they ask us to Vote such a large sum of money as is nowThe excuse that the Prime Minister is absent is not .sufficient. No one regrets more than I do the enforced absence of any honourable member; but the affairs of Australia must not be permitted conto drift simply on account of the sickness of the Prime Minister.

662,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Then I suppose that stitution what the Prime Minister did was to tell reporters that if they looked up the record of the Imperial Conference, they would find what his attitude '.was on the matter.

However, we have the power to take over the debts of the States,, I believe that everv function of the Commonwealth Parliament should be speedily assumed. The time is not far distant when we must ask ourselves whether we are Federalists or States representatives. If "" proposal is made by which the States-may suffer injustice, or which may involve an invasion of States rights, the Senate is this the House in which the battle should be out. If I were a member of the Senate, I should hold the opinion that in dealing with such matters the House of is invading, the province of vulthe States House.

But we should realise that, no matter what Government is in power, it is a serious mistake to surrender our rights --as representative men. I complain that the Treasurer has' today dealt with matters - which should have been included in his Budget statement.",70

673,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"When , by an interjection, I referred to the Russian Tariff, the honourable gentleman's eyes glistened, as he thought of Russia with a Tariff imposing duties up to 131 per cent. I would like to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he would not,- if he had the power, impose a Tariff as high as that of Russia ? The Postmaster-General, as a high-Tariff man, believes in protection, and that everything that can be manufactured in Australia should be manufactured here. That is the protectionist belief, but I would ask the honourable gentleman whether it is right that we should extract millions of money from the people when he knows that it must be a number of years before the local manufacturers - can supply their requirements ?",71

679,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The best of all dates, but it was not the 17th of March. If some bad-livered people were present these interjections might lead to a scene, such as we have had between two members of the Committee to-night. If I could provoke a scene which would lead to my expulsion from the Chamber about a month before an election, I think it would secure my seat. It is a good plan sometimes to provoke a scene, but it is not on my list tonight. I am afraid that the honourable members for Swan and Coolgardie have to started their scene two and a half years too early. I contrast the fine speech which was made by the honourable member for Parramatta on the financial position with that made by the Acting Prime Minister. The honourable member for Parramatta analyzed the figures quoted by the Treasurer whilst that honourable gentleman took the statement written by the Under-Secretary of the Treasury and read it out to the Committee. I do not expect the honourable gentleman to be poetic every time he speaks, but I do expect him to deliver his own speech and 1 not to allow a departmental officer to make his speech for him. That is a scandal on representative government. I should prefer the rough-and-ready way in which the honourable gentleman would deliver a financial statement of his own.",71

682,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I have not said so.,71
683,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The speech which he made this afternoon will read as if it had been delivered at the Morgue. The kind of speech that the people .like is one that has some life in it . The Treasurer, with a!l his faults, would have been heard to greater advantage had he spoken in his own roughand-ready .way, instead of. delivering, a polished essay prepared by the head of his. Department. The officer in question may be one of the most skilful in the service, but I object to his making a speech in this House. honourable Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There is a standing order against reading a speech in the House.",71
684,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,We showed our generosity by not availing ourselves of that standing order. One of the blots on the present system is that the Treasurer is surrendering his rights and powers to a leading official.,71

695,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"As a Temporary Chairman of Commitees, sir, I ought to be the last to disobey your ruling. I did not intend to cast any reflection upon the Chair, and I withdraw the. remark. The point that I was trying to impress upon honourable members was--and I do not wish the Treasurer to be angry, for I feel strongly on this question-that the honourable gentleman lost the run of his notes, and that if he had been delivering his own speech the incident would not have occurred. I am not attacking the Secretary to the Treasury, but I think it time tRat some honourable member' should stand up for the rights of Parliament. Treasurer is capable c f preparing his own speeches. I am not casting any reflection upon his capacity. I have simply referred to what I consider to be. an infringement of our rights. The financial question has not been properly dealt with by the Government, and I hope that the Treasurer, when he replies later on, will clear up several points. We are here, not to deal with Joseph Carruthers or William Lyne, but with the finances of the Commonwealth; and the time is fast arriving when we shall have to take up the defence of Federal rights. c t ; The more lax our method of dealing with these great problems of finance is, the more difficult will it be for members of the Federal Parliament to maintain their true position. I am not actuated by any party feeling in speaking thus. I may not be talking to slow music, and, perhaps, if some* other honourable member were to give utterance, with a great show of dignity, to the views I have expressed, honourable members would think that they were worthy of consideration. If we are to defend the powers of the Federal Parliament, we must start early by putting ourselves in a right position in dealing with the financial relations of - the Commonwealth and the States. There is no more important work before us. I do not believe in a high Tariff, and sir, in the raising of ,£10,500,000 per annum by means of Customs and Excise taxation. Three or four years hence the Government will find that their policy of protection is ineffective. Industries cannot be built up in a month, and, as a believer in a low Tariff, I have a right to-protest whenever the opportunity offers against heavy imposts.",72
696,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Parramatta) [10.33] - The honourable member ' for Dalley, just before he resumed his seat, said that sooner or later we should require to defend the Federal power in connection with some friction that is occurring between the Commonwealth and the States. If we are to do that, we ought to take care that our own position' is beyond reproach. I therefore deeply regret the attack which the Treasurer went out of his way to-night to make upon Mr Carruthers' administration. Amongst other statements made by him was one that Mr Carruthers, during his term of office as Premier of New South Wales, had sent up the expenditure of that State by £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per The annum.",72

706,Mr JH CATTS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Mr Carruthers cannot be fair to this Parliament.,73
707,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"At all events, I do not know that anything that Mr Carruthers might say would justify any honourable member in misrepresenting the actual state of affairs with regard to the finances of New South Wales. figures are these: In 1899 the expenditure in New South Wales was ,£9,708,000 . - By the year 1904, when Mr Carruthers again succeeded to the Premiership, the expenditure had gone up to £[11,384,000, notwithstanding all the functions that had been relegated to the Federal Parliament. Consequently between 1899 and 1904'there was an increase of State expenditure of no less than £1,675,000 . ing the administration of the Government which was instituted by the Acting Prime Minister.",73

715,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I was in it until ist February, 1901. It was my Government until that date.",73
716,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member was in it therefore for nearly two years. I am quoting the increase in expenditure in five years, during two of which the honourable gentleman had charge of affairs in New South Wales. He resigned his position early in 1901. One of his old colleagues took his place, and' the personnel of the Government remained practically' the same. To all intents and purposes it was a continuous Government. I am not concerned with charging ""anything to that Government. What' I am concerned with is the correct state of affairs so fa r as concerns the present Premier of New South Wales. In 1904 Mr Carruthers succeeded to the Premiership. By that time the expenditure had gone up by no less than £ 1 , 6 7 5 , 0 0 0 . The ' correct Mr THOMAS - It is only fair to say that the payment of old-age pensions accounted for nearly the whole of it.",73
717,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I am not explaining how the increase occurred. The honourable member can supply that information if he cares to.,73
718,Mr THOMAS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I want to be fair to the Acting Prime Minister and Mr. Carruthers. That was dur- Mr JOSE PH COOK - Mr Carruthers found the expenditure at £ 1 1 , 3 8 4 , 0 0 0. His estimate of expenditure for this year is £ 1 1 , 6 8 5 , 0 0 0, or an increase in the fou r years of his Administration of only ,£301,000. Last year the expenditure was less than the estimate for this year. The actual increase during Mr Carruthers' term so far has been about ,£250,000, and not £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 as the Acting Prime' Minister led the Committee to believe to-night. There was no justification for a statement of that kind.",73
719,Mr WEBSTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Mr Carruthers has transferred the whole cost of roads and bridges to the local government bodies, - which were not in existence in those years. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What has that ""to do with it? If Mr Carruthers has transferred the cost of roads and bridges to the local government bodies, he has transferred taxation to them also. He has .given them his land tax to operate upon, and guaranteed to them huge subsidies for this year. Therefore, he has not relieved himself of one penny of expenditure this year by the passage of the Local Government Act. Ultimately there wil] be some relief to the national finances, but not this year. I am only concerned now in showing that the Acting Prime Minister did the Premier of New South Wales a great injustice in alleging that he had sent the - expenditure of New South Wales up by £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , when as a matter of fact he has only increased it by a little over .£[200,000 in the four years.",73

722,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I did not mention his Government. I mentioned the Government of New South Wales since Federation. I will give the correct figures, - which the honourable member has not given. I did not refer to any particular time since Federation took place. I said that the increase had occurred during the existence of the Federation. The honourable member for Parramatta tried very unfairly to put a wrong construction on everything I said. The State expenditure of New South Wales in 1899-1900, the year before Federation, was £ 9 , 0 4 5 , 0 9 6 . In the year 1905-6, it was £11)395)243, or an increase of £ 2 , 3 5 0 , 1 4 7 .

724,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I do not dispute them. The honourable gentleman must be very dense.,74
725,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member said that' he did dispute, them. I handed them to him. before he rose to speak, and he said that they were wrong.  Parramatta is growling, not about the figures, but about their application.",74
726,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member must be stupid. I have never applied them in this Chamber in any other than the way I am doing now. The honourable member for Parramatta tried to fix upon me the responsibility for a Go- 1 vernment that was not ray Government. I had no control over the expenditure of the Government that followed me. What I say is that during the period of Federation, and since I gave up the reins of government in New South Wales, the increase of expenditure in that State has amounted to over £ 2 , 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 .  Parramatta does not deny that.",74
727,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable' member for Parramatta does not want any one to apologize for him. The honourable member tried to fix on me a statement. I which I never made regarding Mr Carruthers. What he has said is absolutely incorrect. I did not fasten the responsihonorable bility for the increase upon Mr Carruthers at all. I never named any person or Go\-ernment. I said that during the period of Federation the See Government and the Carruthers Government in New South Wales had dealt with the finances in the way which I described. I complain of the honourable member saying that I made an attack upon Mr Carruthers. I did nothing of the kind. I was only anxious to lay before the Committee and the country the exact state of the finances during the period, of the Federation, as it had been said that the Commonwealth had been, and is, extravagant. My object was not to hit any individual or . Ministry, but to defend the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, and to show that instead of having those reflections hurled at us we should be commended for the economy which we have practised, and for not carrying out works which we might very reasonably have undertaken. The honourable member is always attributing some motive to me, but to-night I had not in my mind Mr. Carruthers or his. Government or any person in New South Wales. I came here simply to lay the figures before the Committee and the .country in order to show what had happened. The honourable member for Dalley referred to my having read a financial statement. A man who is not an expert in figures, such as the Secretary to the Treasury is, is a fool if he depends on himself and gives figures to the Committee in a not understandable way.",74
728,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,It is not the figures but the application of them that I complained of.,75
729,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The application of the figures is done in a way which even the honourable member in his denseness cannot misunderstand. Let him look through the Budget as it was delivered by me and he can understand ""it. Let him look through the reply which I gave tonight, and he can understand it. I have heard Treasurers trying to make their speeches without having had them either typed or the figures typed, and a nice mess they made of them. I do not intend to place myself in that position. I do not pretend to be an expert in dealing with thefiguresof the Treasury. I have to look to my officers to prepare the figures and to throw upon them the responsibility for their accuracy. I believe that the people would rather trust the officers who have been so long in the Treasury to furnish the figures than trust to any Treasurer, I do not care who he is, to analyze the figures and give them himself.",75
730,Mr WILKS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The figures are all right, but it is the application of them that I complained of.",75
731,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I hope the honourable member will not go on in that way. I could not allow the statement which was made to go forth without giving the true figures. I do not know whether the honourable member for Parramatta intentionally stated- I hope not-that my object was to make an attack upon Mr.. Carruthers. I assure him. that if he will read Hansard he will find that I did not mention the name of Mr Carruthers so far as the figures are concerned. Nothing 'was further from my thoughts than that. I was too anxious to give the figures correctlv to think for a moment of Mr Carruthers or any one else in regard to the matters with which I was dealing. As it is getting rather late, sir, I move That the Chairman report progress and ask leave to sit again.  MCDonald",75
732,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Order. Treasurer has moved that I report gress.  fair on the part of the Treasurer a statement of that kind,- and then conclude with that motion.",75
733,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,I am willing tt) withdraw it.,75
734,The CHAIRMAN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the. motion be withdrawn ?,75
735,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,No ; report progress. Motion agreed to; progress reported. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.,75
736,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Trea surer) [10.48] - I move That the House at its rising adjourn until 3 o'clock tomorrow. I believe that a large number of honourable members have accepted an invitation to lunch with _ the Governor General tomorrow, and that it will be almost impossible to get a quorum before 3 o'clock. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. CORRESPONDENCE : POST AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT-PROCEEDING SIN COMMITTEE - THE TARIFF : HOURS OF SITTING-NORTHER N TERRITORY-FIRE S IN NEWSOUTH WALES. - Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",75
737,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Robertson) [10.50] - Some days since I referred to the dilatory manner .in which correspondence is attended to by the Department of the 'Postmaster-General. To-day. I received from the Department three letters, namely, one in reply to a letter forwarded on the 13th April, respecting the necessity for telephone communication in my electorate; another in reply to a letter I forwarded on the 19th April,- on a similar matter of much urgency; and another in reply to a letter sent on the n t h June, respecting the great urgency of providing telephone communication to . businesshouses and private persons, and the connection of townships in my electorate. The receipt of the letters was acknowledged at time in a formal way, and today, after a period of five and three months respectively, I received a reply to them. It The shows, I think, that the Department is promanaged in a very slipshod manner.",75
738,Mr THOMAS BROWN,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The Departto make ment is. over-worked.,75
739,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It may be that the inspectors are over-worked and unable to report on matters forwarded to them for consideration. Once I met an inspector working on a Sunday in my electorate, far from the large centres of population, in order to get through with his work. was told on one occasion that the inspectors received large batches of papers and had to sit into the middle of the night in order to deal with them. Judging by the long delay in replying to my communications, the officers are overworked. I hope that the Postmaster General will look into the matter and see that some alterations are made so that one may expect to receive a reply to his communications within '.a Teasonable period. During last year I forwarded to the Department scores of letters, but up to the present time. I have not received a replv.",76
740,Mr WEBSTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"In the case of the letters which the honourable member has mentioned, has finality been reached?",76
741,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"That is not the point which I am discussing. All I wish to say is that the Department is dilatory, or it may be that the men were overworked, or unable to reach the papers until the dates I mentioned. If the latter has been the case the Department is undermanned, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will look ^nto the matter.  no use for the Acting Prime Minister to go into mock heroics, or to shed crocodile tears. We are all used to that now, as we have known him ever since the Parliament wa.s opened. I beg to inform the honourable gentleman that I am neither drunk nor stupid. I am in possession of mv faculties just as much as he is. I was listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta as intently as I could. He did not try to juggle with the Treasurer's figures. All he wanted to do was to fix the blame upon the authorities who were responsible for the increased expenditure. What he said was that there was £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 expended by the Carruthers Government over and above the expenditure of 1904. did not say that the Acting Prime Minister had misstated figures. --> Mr SPEAKER - I am not aware of the matter to which the honourable member is - referring, but if it is a matter which took place in Committee, seeing that the Committee has not reported, as I have pointed out several times, it ought not to be referred to, and cannot be debated in the House.  to say, sir, but with all due respect to vour ruling, do you think it is a fair thing for I the Treasurer to make a speech, and then move that progress be reported, so that an honourable member who has been attacked > by him cannot reply ?",76
742,Mr GROOM,WEEKLY STATEMENT,He offered to withdraw the motion.,76
743,Mr SPEAKER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I am not able to answer the honourable member's question, and to say what is or is not fair in this connection, because I know nothing of the facts of the case to which he wishes to refer. But in pursuance of my duty I must insist that debates begun in Committee shall not be continued or referred to in the House. The Committee must attend to, and do its work properly, and the House must do likewise. I cannot allow Committee' proceedings and proceedings in the House to overlap.  deal from you, Mr Speaker, from whom can I get it ? You have stated repeatedly - and promised when sworn in last February-that you will see fair treatment given to all members of the House. That is all I am asking for now.",76
744,Mr SPEAKER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member, like every one else, is entitled to fair treatment, and, I am sure, will get it from any officer presiding over the proceedings of the House. But it - is my duty to see that the rules of debate are observed, and I should neglect it if I were to allow a Committee discussion to overlap the proceedings in the House. The Committee must deal with its own business. If the honourable member desires to continue the remarks which he has commenced, he will have an opportunity to do so in ' Committee. ",76
745,Mr SPEAKER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I cannot allow the honourable member to debate my ruling.  He from you, Mr Speaker, from whom can I get it?",76
746,Mr SPEAKER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The honourable member will get justice from me in all matters, concerning .the proceedings of the House, and he will get justice from the Chairman in all matters concerning proceedings in - Committee.",76
747,Mr WEBSTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Gwydir) [10.57] - I do not intend to say anything in regard to the matter referred to by the honourable . member for Maranoa. or as to what took place in Committee between the deputy leader of the Opposition and the Acting Prime Minister. These matters can, I take it, be discussed when the consideration of the Works and Buildings Estimates in Committee of Supply is resumed', and the .honourable member for Maranoa and others will then have an opportunity to deal with them at length. But as to the complaint of the honourable member for Robertson, I desire to, say that I am of opinion that we should have great sympathy with the officers ,of the Postal Department in regard to the delays in the answering of correspondence which are laid at their door. For months past it has been impossible for the men employed in the correspondence branch of the New South Wales Post Office to meet the demands made upon them. I have already shown that that is so, and on a future occasion will do so at greater length, and will put before honourable members a more definite statement of the position than has hitherto been given to the public. I trust that the Postmaster-General and' the Treasurer will, as soon as possible, relieve the pressure from which the officers of the Department have suffered too long, and which results in delays in replying to the correspondence which members have to conduct in the interests of their constituents. Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - I thought things were to be better when we provided for inspectors being sent into the country?",77
748,Mr WEBSTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I do not think that the present System has had a fair trial. Hitherto we have not had permanent inspectors, but have employed "" acting inspectors, with the result that they have overlapped, or the report of one has been contrary to - that of another. There has been a muddle, because there has been no security of tenure, so far as the officers acting have been concerned. We cannot hope for an tion. improvement until the serious grievances which have been laid at the door Department have been rectified. I trust that the Postmaster-General, who has been looked to to effect a wonderful improveThe ment, will not merely promise to do someto thing, but will prove his sincerity by actions.",77
749,Mr STORRER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Bass) [n.o] - As the House has agreed to adjourn until 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, I wish to bring under the-notice of the Prime Minister the need for lengthening our hours, of sitting if we are to deal with the Tariff within a reasonable .time. The suggestion was made the other day that we should meet in the morning on Wednesdays and Thursdays, or on Mondays.",77
750,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,When are we to deal with our. correspondence ?,77
751,Mr STORRER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"It is all very well to consider the convenience of honourable members who wish"" to return to their homes on Fridays, but we should have regard to the interests of the commercial community, and deal with the Tariff as soon as possible. I hope that the Ministry will take the matter into consideration, and see whether they cannot propose the lengthening of our sittings, or some other steps which will expedite business.",77
752,Mr JH CATTS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Cook) r i L i ] About two months ago I moved for a return in connection with the Northern Territory. It is about time that something was heard of it. I expected that it would have been readv before this, and I now ask the Acting Prime Minister to expedite the preparation of the information which I reauire.",77
753,Mr TUDOR,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I moved for a return six years ago, and have not got it yet.",77
754,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [11.2] - In reference to the complaint of the honourable member for that Robertson, - if he will give me the particular instance I shall have inquiries made. I believe that there is a great deal in what he said. The abnormal increase in the work of the Department has not been adequately provided for by the appointment of additional men. But I hope to visit Sydney within a week or ten days, and to'make personal inquiries there. Arrangements have been, or are being, made to give clerical assistance to the inspectors which will enable them to get through their work with something like reasonable expediMr HENRY ' WILLIS - Clerk s could riot of the draw up their reports for them.",77
755,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"They could give great assistance in the preparation of the reports. system of locating inspectors appears demand inquiry, and will receive all the his attention that I can give to it. But the time available for administrative work is exceedingly short, seeing that Parliament meets four times a week.",77
756,Mr JOHNSON,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The honourable .member for Bass wishes us to make it still shorter.,78
757,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I have been trying to grapple with the far-reaching and important problems which concern my Department, and will endeavour, with the assis-. tance of my predecessor, to get at the bottom of the complaints which have been made about postal administration. As to whether the increase of business is abnormal or likely to continue, there may be differences of opinion, but at present the is too small.",78
758,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,Then why not increase it?,78
759,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"We are trying to do so. But we must know first whether the present volume of business is likely to continue, or whether the rush is merely temporary. It would not do to appoint a large number of permanent officers only to discharge them next year because of a falling off in business.",78
760,Mr WEBSTER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,At the present time the number of officers is less than when the De- partment was transferred to the Commonwealth. I am now soeaking of the officers dealing with correspondence.,78
761,Mr MAUGER,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"At all events, the matter will receive every consideration.. We shall see what can be done.",78
762,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.5] - As to the number of officers employed in the Post and Telegraph Department, I think that the honourable member for Gwydir is a little mistaken. I quoted figures to-night showing that 4,440 appointments have been made, and that there had been 3,393 'dismissals, leaving a net increase of 1,007. In reference to the question asked by the honourable member for Cook, so far as my memory serves me application was at once made to the South Australian Government, who possessed all the information necessary for the preparation of the return which was asked for. When I inquired the other day, I found that no reply had been received from South Australia.",78
763,Mr JH CATTS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I tried to get the information from the South Australian Go- .' vernment five months agu, but could not.",78
764,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"The Department cannot do impossibilities, and the return is impossible without the assistance of the South Australian - Government, fug]- 2",78
765,Mr JH CATTS,WEEKLY STATEMENT,The South.Australian Government do not seem to wish to give the information.,78
766,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WEEKLY STATEMENT,"I should not think that the South Australian Government desire to' withhold the information, because they are the most friendly of the States Governments so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. I shall see whether anything furthercan be done in the matter. I desire to take this opportunity to refer to the dreadful fires which have occurred in the coastal districts staff of New South Wales. This is, perhaps, the first time on record in Australia when a large and flourishing township has been destroyed by fire within an hour or two. Then there occurred a second conflagration between Casino and Grafton, involving the loss of twelve or fourteen houses. I am sending a telegram of regret on behalf of the Ministry,. and, with the permission of honourable members, I shall send a similar message on behalf of the House, because the catastrophies are such as to call for some expression of sympathy .on our part. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.8 p.m.",78
