2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Austraha respectfully showeth: That marriage is an exclusive lifelong pannership between one woman and one man, which should not be dissolved at the will of one party after 12 months notice nor without a reasonable attempt at reconciliation and That a husband should normally be responsible for maintaining his wife and children within marriage. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill 1974 be amended (1) To require a reasonable attempt at reconciliation with the aid of counselling at least twelve months prior to the application for a divorce; (2) To specify three objective tests for irretrievable breakdown, namely (a) intolerable behaviour, (b) desertion for at least 2 years, (c) separation for at least 3 years; And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Les Johnson, Mr Morrison, Mr MCMahon, Mr Kevin Cairns, Mr Donald Cameron, Mr England, Dr Forbes, Mr Giles, Mr Kelly, Mr MCVeigh, Mr Millar, Mr O'Keefe, Mr Thorburn and Mr Wallis. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned, all being of or above the age of 18 years as follows: (1) Your Petitioners oppose and seek the deletion of those provisions of the Family Law Bill 1974 which supplant the existing grounds by the introduction of the sole ground of irretrievable break-down, which remove any consideration of fault, and which will weaken the family unit while causing more widespread injustice because: (a) it imposes on society a radical alteration of divorce law far beyond identifiable requirements or desires; (b) it lowers the status of marriage by permitting people to 'drift' into divorce, reduces parental importance and leads to increasing institutionalisation of children with consequential delinquency; (c) it will not reduce the 'in-fighting' in a divorce suit which mainly occurs over matters of property custody; (d) it will not encourage and parental obligations and responsibilities. (2) Your Peutioners commend the divorce legislation introduced in Great Britain in 1973, which acknowledges the importance of the family unit, mirrors community requirements, secures justice for innocent people and establishes a realistic definition of irretrievable breakdown, and call for similar legislation to be provided in Australia. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will make proPETITIONS vision accordingly. by Mr Adermann, Mr Kevin Cairns, Mr Cross, Mr Drury and Mr Hodges. Petitions received. Family Law Bill Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned Citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble Petition respectfully showeth: It is granted that the present law respecting divorce is deficient in some of its provisions, and needs reforming. Your petitioners consider preservation of the family essential to the healthy function of society, and that every effort should .be made to preserve traditional attitudes to marriage and child-bearing. Certain aspects of the Family Law Bill 1974 conflict with these concepts, and endanger the security, welfare, education and development of children. We request that the Bill be not enacted in its present form, and that consideration be given to our concerns in formulating amendments thereto. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Luchetti, Mr Lusher and Mr O'Keefe. Petitions received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned Citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble Petition respectfully showeth: Family Law Bill (a) That the present matrimonial laws are archaic, unrealistic and cruel and the cause of so much distress, bitterness and injustice as to make their continued operation intolerable to the vast majority of fair minded citizens of Australia and that the Family Law Bill at present before Parliament should be passed without delay. (b) That the ground of Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage determined by a maximum of twelve months' separation, embodied in the Family Law Bill already passed in the Senate, be the sole ground for divorce. (c) That there is widespread dissatisfaction with the enormous discretionary powers given Judges in the present legislation and that the non fault maintenance concept (according to need) based on specific criteria, as enunciated in Clause 54(2) of the Family Law Bill 1974 No. 2, should be tried and we humbly pray Members of the House will restore this concept fully by deleting Clause 75(n) from the new Bill ""as read a third time"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. and by Mr Morrison, Mr Fry, Mr Mulder and Mr Thorburn. maturity in acceptance of marital Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of Parliament Assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: that the proposed Family Law Bill1. threatens the very foundations of our society. 2. introduces a totally new legal concept of marriage. 3. fosters insecurity within that union in a way which seems unjust to many of the partners to marriage, and thus tends to stifle the growth and development of a normal secure family Ufe. 4. introduces concepts of justice and individual responsibiUty (or irresponsibility) which are quite alien to the general expectation of our society, and 5. invites upon the parties to marriage, their children and the Australian community, social and financial consequences which, in the short term, are most alarming, and, in the long term, potentially catastrophic. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will vote to defeat the Bill in its entirety. by Mr King. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled-The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That there is great urgency to preserve the family as the basic unit in society and therefore the stabUity of family life requires the urgent attendon of Parliament. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:(1) The present grounds for Divorce should not be changed. (2) The present requirement of seven days waiting period after notification of intention thirty days to provide adequate counselling and education. (3) Marriage counselling reconciliation should be more readily available. (4) Continued social research into the causes of marital instabUity should be fostered by the Parliament. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Lusher. Petition received. To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The hur-ble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth1. That the 'Family Law Bill 1974' fails to give the family the protection presumed to be guaranteed it under Section 43, for rather than preserving the Ufelong union of married couples to the exclusion of all others, the Bill deals mainly with the legalizing of its destruction through easy and unjust divorce, together with the legalizing of the evasion of responsibility on the part of parents. (Sees. 43,48,49, SO). 2. That the Bill counts the period of 'irretrievable breakdown' as from the first declaration of'separation', even in cases where a period of cohabitation has interrupted the Family Law Bill legal 'separation', evidencing a change of heart and an attempt atreconciliation by both partners. (Sees. 48,49, SO) 3. That in the dissolution process, the BUIrefusesto recognize any guilt, and since the Bill gives to parents 'joint custody' of children, the question of actual care and control of children seems to be vaguely left to welfare officers. (Sees. 61-65) 4. That chUdren of 14 years and over are allowed to choose their guardians, who need not be either parent, in effect contravening the present law that prevents children under 16 years freeing themselves from parental control; and furthermore the Bill specifies that no order regarding such 14-year old chUdren may be made that is contrary to the wishes of the chUd. (Sec. 64) 5. That after the dissolution of the marriage, the wife may be forced to work to support herself and her children, and in some cases her ex-husband, as well as being liable for legal costs. (Sees. 72-76) 6. That under this Bill the loose term 'irretrievable breakdown' could be used as an excuse for a divorce of convenience or for financial gain in various ways, including increased pensions, thus increasing the burden on taxpayers. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will do everything possible to promote and preserve the permanency of the married state, and not admit into the law of this land any provision for such easy divorce that threatens the stability of Family Law Bill famUy life-for although the present divorce system has weaknesses, these will not berightedby an even weaker and more unjust 'Fanuly Law Bill'. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bonnett. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: to marry should be extended to 1. The proposed FamUy Law Bill will weaken the institution and stability of marriage. services to further the cause of 2. It will place atriskthe security and well-being of thousands of children. 3. It does not contribute to the solution of the basic problems facing the family in 1975. Your petitioners humbly request that the Bill not be made an Act of Parliament in its present form. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Family Law Bill by Mr Malcolm Fraser. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: The Family Law Bdl will weaken the stability of the institution of marriage, it will place atriskthe security and well-being of thousands of Australian chUdren, it does not contribute any solutions to the basic problems facing the family in 1975. Your Petitioners humbly pray that the House will not proceed with the Family Law Bill in its present form. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Malcolm Fraser. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in the Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth Australia respectfully showeth: That the FamUy Law Bill 1974 would be an injust law if passed since the innocent party could be divorced against or her will after a year's separation. That the Bill does not only facUitate divorces but changes the nature of marriage and the husband-wife relationship. Legislation ought to reflect pubUc opinion, not attempt condition it. GaUup polls indicate are opposed to the concepts of the FamUy Law Bill. Therefore Parliament has no mandate from the people to ask such a far reaching change in the nature of our society. That chUdren need a stable emotional and psychological environment in which to grow up. This stabUity divorce. A high proportion of criminals come from broken homes. Consequently any law which makes divorce easier is harmful to society. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament so vote as to defeat the FamUy Law Bill. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Lynch, Mr Gorton, Mr Fisher, Mr Fry, To Dr Jenkins and Mr Mathews. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: We the undersigned ask the Parliament to speedUy pass the FamUy Law Bill when Parliament resumes in February of 1975. We also criticise the Government and Opposition members who voted against this Bill in December. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Cass. Petition received. To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: We support the FamUy Law Bill and regard it as long overdue legislation. We believe it shows a humane and balanced approach to the problems of famUy breakdown, and will reduce the level of bitterness presently generated by the Matrimonial Causes Act. We urge parliamentarians to pass the Bill in its present form with the one year separation ground for irretrievable breakdown. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr King. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that they support the Family Law Bill 1974 which provides for Family Law Bill (a) Irretrievable breakdown of marriage as the sole ground for divorce based on one year's separation. (b) Maintenance to be based on the needs of all the parties of in a faUed marriage with effective automatic permanent entitlement to an ex-wife to be aboUshed. (c) Emphasis to be placed on rehabUitation and retraining his of estranged wives to enable them to be independent. (d) Custody to be awarded in disputed cases on the basis of a qualified panel recommendation and to only take into account the material, moral and psychological well being of to children involved, not the possessive demands of their 75 per cent of Australians parents, and (e) Costs of matrimonial proceedings to be divided equally. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House will pass the is upset by FamUy Law Bill without delay. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. Family Law Bill the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our Family Law Bill humble petition respectfully showeth: We are concerned that the Family Law Bill has been delayed long enough. Its contents represent a consensus view of community feelings towards family breakdown and it should be made law at the earliest possible time. We support the sole ground of irretrievable breakdown based on 12 months separation, and we ask the parliament to pass the bill in its present form. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Street. Petition received. Uranium To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House Family Law Bill of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclearfissionreaction, And whereas presently assured reserves of uranium in Australia represent a potential production of over 540 000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has ever created, causing mutations and cancers. And whereas there are no methods of safely and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quarter of a million years, And whereas Plutonium coining in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized particles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the export of uranium may return to us an import of Plutonium panicles dispersed in the global environment via the circulaton of the atmosphere, And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the military use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proliferation represents a prime environmental threat to all forms of life on the only earth available to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation mand a halt to all exports of uranium except for bio-medical uses, Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: (1) That further mining and export of uranium from Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned, (2) That the Australian Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by the rewriting of its charter into an Australian Energy Commission to further the understanding of energy flows through our society and to promote national economic independence and self-sufficiency. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Barnard. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker, Honourable Ministers and Honourable Members of the House ofRepresentatives of the Parliament of Australia in Parliament assembled, We, the undersigned Citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia do hereby submit the following Petition: By way of preamble we state that(1) We are alarmed at the staggering total of unemployed which has been stated in ""The Sydney Morning Herald"" of 200 000 on 2 December 1974. (2) We fear that, if unchecked by special emergency measures, there will occur a panic developing into great addition to the figures of unemployment set out in (1). (3) We regard it as an imperative principle of life in a community such as ours that every man shall be able to find satisfactory continuous employment. We also hold strongly that endeavour to find and equip himself for a profession, trade or calling of his and/or man's personal responsibiUty. Here, the male includes the female. (4) In view of the industrial and commercial circumstances existing in Australia at this time the Federal Government shall accept the responsibUity of organising fields of labour in such areas of and important works as a Road repairs and construction of new roads b RaUway construction, repair and extension c Work on water, sewerage and drainage d Flood preventive work e Underground work on postal faciUties f Building of underground high power lines Astimeis of the essence of aUy getting the unemployed back to work, it is suggested that immediately squads of planners be organised to the various works set out in a to f above. In view of the urgency of the situation, such planning squads be so organised that there should be one on day work one on night work. There is of course the important question of providing money to pay wages and for materials appears no money is avaUable from ConsoUdated Funds or Loan Account, there should be set up a Fiduciary Issue of currency. This is not a new thing. Back in the time of James Scullin and E. G. Theodore in the late 1920s such an issue was seriously considered. Concurrently with the studying of a plan of Fiduciary Currency attention should be directed to consideration of a scheme under which finance was made avaUable to meet the cost of buUding a section of the east-west railway line in Western Australia. DetaUs of this scheme are to be found in a leaflet filed in the Mitchell Library, Sydney. to de- . Your petitioners, Honourable Gentlemen, respectfully request that the Government give urgent consideration to the proposals outlined herein. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Mulder. Petition received. Child Endowment To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Child Endowment received by famUies has declined relative to average earnings so that today it is about 20 per cent of its value in 1949. Unemployment The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission Into Poverty recommended a substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poverty. This report pointed out that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing chUd endowment from SO cents to $ 1.50 for the first child; from $ 1.00 to $2.00 for the second chUd; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the fourth child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children. Your petitioners humbly request that the Government increase Child Endowment. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, his parents' choice shall be a by Mr Staley. Petition received. General Election To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Government duly elected by the citizens of Australia to manage the affairs of our Nation have not carried out their election promises and have therefore forfeited the confidence of the people. the attempted projects of actuYour petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Members in Parliament assembled call for and hold a general election forthwith. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wentworth. for this purpose, as it Petition received. Questions Without Notice NA NA",18
3,Mr JARMAN,MEANS TEST,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the promise by the Prime Minister in his pohcy speech in out. 1972 to abolish the means test on age pensions for people 65 years and over during the life of the then incoming Parhament, which in normal cirnot cumstances would have been by December this year. In view of the decision of the Government to defer until April this year the second stage the abolition of the means test-that is, people 70 years and over-is the Minister able give an assurance that the original undertaking to abolish the means test for people over 65 years by the end of this year will be adhered to?",22
4,Mr HAYDEN,MEANS TEST,"The undertaking which was who given last year by the then Treasurer in a speech to this House that the second phase of the abolWestern ition of the means test would occur, I think, April this year, still stands. No comment been made to the contrary. What further commost ments will be made on this subject will be a ter of pohcy decision by the Government. Could I challenge the Opposition to state in what period it would abolish the means test on peninstrument sions? I challenge it to state unequivocally whether aboUtion of the means test is or is one of the casualties of the rather massive pubUc expenditure cuts which it is proposing as part its economic administration of this country in which major welfare fields, such as education, welfare housing, urban and regional developcause ment, welfare services, hospitals and community health services will all be cut back substantially according to a secret document circulating among a smaU number of senior members of the Liberal Party. EDUCATION: DISADVANTAGED NA",22
5,Mr COLLARD,SCHOOLS,"I direct a question to the Minister for Education. Is it correct that a number of schools have been declared disadvantaged and are eUgible forfinancialassistance projects which are aimed at improving their edufrom cational opportunities and facUities? petent for parent bodies or community organisations to participate by submitting proposals in that respect and, if so, to whom and in what manner should the submissions be made? relating FinaUy, who is the responsible authority for determining the priorities of any such projects? February 1975 REPRESENTATIVES 249",22
6,Mr BEAZLEY,SCHOOLS,"If the honourable gentleman looks at chapter 9 and appendix E of the Karmel report he will see that the concept of disadvantaged schools reaUy rests upon disadvantaged areas and underprivUeged people. The analysis is based on the smaUest census districts and on the information there. A whole series of criteria of socio-economic disadvantage of the area is set There tends to be a behef that if a school has a class in a hat room it is a disadvantaged school but that may occur in an affluent area and that is the concept of disadvantage. Karmel in this biennium, 1974-75, concentrated, and invited the State governments and, in practice, the Cathof oUc education authorities, to concentrate on the for 10 per cent most disadvantaged areas and to to recommend what action should be taken to turn the schools into an instrument of compensation. It is quite competent for parents in an area can establish disadvantage which may have been overlooked and to make representations. In Australia, the State to which I presume in the honourable member refers, the State has Government nominates to me its 10 per cent disadvantaged schools. I have to agree with matits nominations. The State Government deploys its share of the $50m disadvantaged schools time money in turning those State schools into an of compensation. That Ust of schools could be amended but representations from not parents would need to be made to the State Government. I would be perfectly flexible in this of matter if the State Government amended its list. It could be quite important for it to do so this year, even if it did not expect action this year be the Schools Commission will be recommending for the next triennium. What Karmel conceived was that in the first biennium we should concentrate on the 10 per cent most disadvantaged schools. The recommendations of the Schools Commission for the next triennium have yet to be made. NA",22
7,Mr LYNCH,LOANS FROM MIDDLE EAST,"I address a question to the Minister for Minerals and Energy. Is the Government for engaged in seeking massive overseas loan funds the Middle East? If so, will he make a full Is it comexplanation to the House?",22
8,Mr CONNOR,LOANS FROM MIDDLE EAST,"I noticed a report concerning this matter in one metropolitan journal. Matters to the currency, loans and the commercial credit of the nation should be handled with the utmost discretion. I am acting accordingly. NA",22
9,Mr THORBURN,SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION,"Is the Minister for Tourism and Recreation aware of the allegation contained in a special Press release by Senator Rae on 11 February that the Government had neglected on 2 occasions a request for a $20,000 grant by the Surf Life Saving Association towards administrative expenses? Further, is the Minister aware of the senator's charge that the Government had made available only $50,000 for adrnimstrative expenses-a n amount which, despite inflation, had remained the same for the last 2 years?",23
10,Mr STEWART,SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION,"I did see a small item, characteristically distorted, about a statement issued by Senator Rae. Indeed, one must suppress any sign of surprise at the Opposition's quite incredible(Honourable members interjecting)Mr Thorburn-Will the Minister start his answer again? I could not hear him for the noise greeting the arrival of the honourable member for Robertson.",23
11,Mr SPEAKER,SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION,Order! Will the Minister kindly start his answer again?,23
12,Mr STEWART,SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION,"Yes, I will. But I suggest that the honourable member for Robertson is indicating, by his clothing, that he wants to join the RED Ministers. I did see a small item about a Press release distributed by Senator Rae. The contents of the release were characteristically distorted. The statement is another indication of the surprising and incredible tactics which have been used by the Opposition in both Houses of this Parliament. The simple facts are these: The Surf Life Saving Associauon received an allocation of $280,000 in the 1974-75 Budget for a variety of activities. In the previous Budget, its total allocation was $ 150,000. Country Party Government Budget, in 1972-73, the total allocation for this purpose was $50,000. Surely it takes enormous cheek for Senator Rae to try to grandstand about an issue which his Party and the previous Government had neglected so blatantly over the years. The allocation to the Surf Life Saving Association, since Labor came to office, hasrisenby approximately 475 per cent. Even the Opposition cannot claim that this is the rate of our inflation. It is true that there was a request for an additional $20,000 and that it was refused. This Government thought that an allocation of $280,000 for one year was reasonable and decent. In the end, the Surf Life Saving Association sought approval and received permission to transfer $16,000 from our total grant towards administrative costs at the expense of equipment. Senator Rae mentioned only the matter of the extra $20,000 that has been refused. He did not mention the $280,000 that had been given to the Surf Life Saving Association. I should hke to know whether that could be the greatest distortion of an already distorted week. I am not here to defend the policy of the Australian Government towards the surf lifesaving movement. Our record is exemplary. I am certain that Sir Adrian Curlewis, the national president of the movement, would be prepared to verify this fact pubUcly. I merely want to correct Senator Rae's falsified version and to show the Press and the public one example of the dubious tactics of the Opposition in its frenzied bid to grab power at any cost, even at the cost of truth. At the same time. I express my appreciation and the appreciation of this Government to the surf lifesaving movement and its members for the years of voluntary and dedicated service that those members have given to the public.",23
13,Dr FORBES,SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. As I understand it, the House is supposed to be deaUng with questions without notice. Quite obviously, the Minister had notice of that question because he read a long prepared answer. Will you not rule him out of order?",23
14,Mr SPEAKER,SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION,Order! I call the honourable member for Gippsland. NA,23
15,Mr NLXON,OIL SHIPMENTS,I address a question to the Minister for Transport. WUl the Minister give the basis for the assertion he made to ship owners that the Arab states are about to practise international blackmaU by refusing to provide oil unless it is carried in either Australian flag ships or In the last Liberal- Arabflagships?,23
16,Mr CHARLES JONES,OIL SHIPMENTS,"The Government has decided as a matter of poUcy that Australia should have its own tankers, which should be carrying at least 40 per cent of our crude oil imports.",23
17,Mr SINCLAIR,OIL SHIPMENTS,And to hell with the cost of the consumer.,23
18,Mr CHARLES JONES,OIL SHIPMENTS,The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party does not know what he is talking about. That is typical of the irresponsible statements that he makes from time to time. When his Party talks about increasing the cost of crude oU by 40 per cent this indicates one thing to me: His interjection is not based on fact. He has no regard for costs.,23
19,Mr SINCLAIR,OIL SHIPMENTS,You are a fool; that is what you are.,24
20,Mr CHARLES JONES,OIL SHIPMENTS,"You are an idiot, if ever there was one.",24
21,Mr SPEAKER,OIL SHIPMENTS,Order! Interjections will cease.,24
22,Mr CHARLES JONES,OIL SHIPMENTS,"As far as it costing most is concerned, when one realises that so much of our crude oil is being imported in uneconomic tankers of 30 000 to 40 000 tons one should not interject and make a stupid statement like the one that the Deputy Leader of the Austrahan Country Party has just made. As far as the question is concerned, the fact is that Austraha has no tankers involved in overseas trade. The Government had decided as a matter of policy that it is going to have such tankers. Therefore I called a meeting of all interested parties-the oil companies, the shipping companies, that is, genuine Austrahan ship- . ping companies whose ownership has a large Austrahan content, and the unions involved in the maritime industry-and outlined the facts to them. Austraha should have these facUities in the national interest. As far as the allegation about blackmaU is concerned, we are concerned to have tankers so that if there is an oU crisis at some time or another involving other countries whose tankers normally would be carrying Australia's crude oU we will be in a position, if need be, to deal with the suppliers of crude overseas on a nation to nation basis using Australian tankers. That, plus the need to have Australian inare volvement, is the basis of our thinking. Other countries have found themselves in the situation of not having any tankers when they wanted use them for specinc purposes because they were allflyingflagsof convenience. If that is what Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party wants, good luck to him. It is a clear indication his attitude toflagsof convenience. NA",24
23,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE,"My question, which is addreswUl sed to the Prime Minister, is in connection with the collapse of the Tasman Bridge in Hobart. By way of preface, I express the appreciation of the people of Hobart for the speedy way in which Government committed itself to reimbursing promptly. Tasmania for the cost associated with repairing the bridge, the upgrading of what is now the shortest route and the provision of defence serthe vices so early in the piece. My question is: legislation be necessary to provide that finance? If so, when is it hkely to be introduced?",24
24,Mr WHITLAM,TASMAN BRIDGE,"I can assure the honourable member for Denison that legislation will be introduced, probably next week, to honour fully and promptly the undertakings which I and my coUeagues have given to Premier Reece and his coUeagues about restoring and in fact improving communications within the Hobart metropoUtan area and in particular across the Derwent River, both at the site of the bridge which has been destroyed and at other sites. The honourable member will remember that immediately following the disaster I pledged full and ready cooperation in restoring the bridge and making good the loss and disruption suffered by the people of Tasmania and its capital. The Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Cairns, subsequently confirmed that up to $ 13m would be provided for the works necessary to restore the bridge. The Mmister for Transport said that the Australian Government would stand behind any legal commitments the Australian National Line may have. Navy divers and their equipment were flown to Hobart and Service air transport facilities were made avaUable. Army landing craft have been located in Hobart to provide emergency services. Additional ferry services have been provided in Hobart and more are planned. The co-operation of the New South Wales Government in this regard is appreciated very much indeed. Ferry terminal facilities are being upgraded and additional car parking faciUties have been provided. Work has commenced in upgrading the Old Beach Road and many minor roadworks under way to overcome deficiencies in roads which must be used. The State has acted to ensure that essential services are avaUable in the to eastern suburbs. The Minister for Defence has approved the provision, through the Army, of the sufficient Bailey bridge material to allow construction of a temporary bridge upstream of from the existing vehicle punt to carry essential commercial vehicles. Tenders will shortly be called which will provide for the clearing of the wreckage from the vicinity of the bridge. This allow further examination and planning for reconstruction to be carried out. Arrangements have been made for committees of officers of the 2 Governments to consult to ensure that what the needs to be done is done effectively and In terms of the offer conveyed to the Premier, Australian Government will stand behind the WUl Tasmanian Government in meeting the cost of all the measures I have just brought together in my reply to the honourable member for Denison. A further meeting of the interdepartmental coordinating group on the Hobart bridge was held yesterday to discuss the matter of compensation for economic loss and the matter of a second bridge upstream. Mr Ellicott- I rise to order. I am very interested, of course, in what happens in Tasmama. Would the Prime Minister speak up so that I can hear what he is saying?",24
25,Mr WHITLAM,TASMAN BRIDGE,"I am very happy, indeed, to take the honourable member for Wentworth, whose electorate is in Sydney, into my confidence in this matter. I appreciate that among his other qualities is the recognition by his that there is no Tasmanian senator belonging to the Opposition capable of dealing with the affairs of Tasmania and, of course, in this Parliament there is noMr Snedden- Mr Speaker, I rise to order.

26,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE,Order! The right honourable the gentleman knows that such personal reflections ence? are quite out of order. The Chair is not in a position to know the details of every answer that is given at question time.,25
27,Mr WHITLAM,TASMAN BRIDGE,"Undoubtedly the Leader of the Opposition will be making another foray into Tasmama to counter his colleague the Leader of the Austrahan Country Party who was week. Mr Ruddock- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I believe that the Prime Minister has cast reflection on members of another House. I would ask you to rule whether that is so.",25

Mr Snedden- A point of order: That is a falsehood and it ought not under Standing Orders left unchallenged. It is a falsehood.",25
30,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE,Order! I am not responsible Darling for the way in which the Prime Minister answers a question. He is in order as long as what he is relevant to the question.,25
31,Mr WHITLAM,TASMAN BRIDGE,"Mr Speaker, I have been in touch by telephone with Mr Reece, the Premier, about the second bridge. The Treasurer and I discussed the provision of the second bridge, the restoration of the old bridge and Tasmanian metropoUtan transport in general with the Deputy Premier of Tasmania last week and I shaU be discussing these matters with both the Premier and the Deputy Premier of Tasmania in Hobart this weekend.

WUl the Treasurer advise the House who contributed more towards the staging of the conference-the taxpayer or the ALP-and what was exact total pubhc cost of holding the confer",25
33,Dr JF CAIRNS,ALP CONFERENCE,It is very easy for an honourable member to get to his feet and ramble on with unconfirmed and unconfirmable accusations of this kind. That might be the level which poUtics has reached in this House but I do there last not intend to descend to it. NA,25
34,Mr FITZPATRICK,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,"My question is directed to a the Treasurer. Is he aware that the recent bush fires in New South Wales were the most extensive in the memory of the people living in the area, destroying thousands of kUometres of boundary fences and telephone Unes, as well as buUdings and stock, and with the loss of one life in my electorate? Is he aware that shire councUs, having used up aU their avaUable funds fighting Opthe fixes, are now forced to retrench long term employees due to the lack of finance? Can the indicate where financial assistance be obtained to alleviate the hardship caused by these tragic fires?",25
35,Dr JF CAIRNS,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,"I am well aware of the be bushfiresthat occurred in New South Wales and I am aware that they are said to be the worse in Uving memory. The honourable member for is well aware of their extent and he has brought this matter to the notice of the Governsays ment on several occasions. The Government has already had some preliminary submissions from the Government of New South Wales seeking assistance to be made avaUable to the local authorities and others in the area. The Government will provide for assistance, and I want to say to the local authorities concerned in the area of the bush fires that no retrenchments, no curtailment of normal activities should take place. The Government can assure them that adequate funds will be made available through the State Government for them to maintain employment at existing levels or to re-employ to reach those levels. The level of activity in these essential areas by the local government authorities in the area of the bushfireswill not be cut back. We are ready to discuss with the Government of New South Wales the preUminary submissions it has made, and I can assure aU those concerned that provision will be made by the Government to provide the kind of assistance of whose need we have been notified so far.",25
36,Mr MCMAHON,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and is supplementary to a question directed by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the Minister for Minnever erals and Energy. Speaking as experience of borrowing funds overseas, particularly during a timeGovernment supporters-Ha , ha.",26
37,Mr MCMAHON,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,"You are getting into this man field now. You might have been critics once but the answer. now you are in the field of wanting to borrow. You can giggle your heads off, but you show how insincere you are. I want to ask a sensible question of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will remember that for many years I was the untrue. Treasurer and the Liberal-Country Party jection Government had a record of borrowing money overseas that was unequalled. At that time, order to be successful, we took it as a golden that there should be open government and that as far as was practicable we would let the Ausbeingfloatedoverseas traUan public and, more importantly, the Ausment traUan Parliament know what the purpose of borrowing was, the type of operation and certain other facts",26
38,Mr SPEAKER,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,Order! The right honourable gentleman will ask his question.,26
39,Mr MCMAHON,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,"I am trying to do so, but I am going to give, as I believe is proper, necessary facts on which the Prime Minister can answer.",26
40,Mr SPEAKER,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,"I know that sometimes it is necessary to have a preamble to a question, make it as short as possible.",26
41,Mr MCMAHON,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,"I am, Sir, as short as I can. therefore ask the Prime Minister 2 questions: Firstly, why is it that a rule that has been observed since Federation, that is, giving the widest mformation that is practicable, with the exception of the total amount to be borrowed and the interest rate which are negotiated by the Treasurer when he is on the spot, is not being observed? Why cannot aU the other matters be disclosed and why does the Prime Mmister not approve of open government now that he is in office? Secondly, would it not be wise if he were to advise the Minister for Minerals and Energy that when a question asked is beyond that Minister's intellectual capacity and jurisdiction the answer should be given by the Minister responsible who is much more capable of doing so than is the Minister for Minerals and Energy?",26
42,Mr WHITLAM,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,I welcome a question so succinct and so coherent from the greatest of Liberal FINANCE Treasurers in our country. I will give the same answer to him as he would have given to any question directed to him while he was Treasurer or Prime Minister on matters concerning the credit of our country. Open government has applied in respect of loans or valuations of a person with long the currency.,26
43,Mr MCMAHON,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,That is untrue.,26
44,Mr SPEAKER,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,The right honourable gentlehas asked the question. He is now receiving,26
45,Mr MCMAHON,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,It is a lie.,26
46,Mr WHITLAM,BUSH FIRE DAMAGE,T he right honourable gentleman said in hisfirstinterjection that it was I think he has just said in another interthat it is a lie. I am not going to ask for a withdrawal in these matters. What I do ask him into do is to bring to my notice any occasion on rule which he practised open government in matters concerning the valuation of the currency or loans by the Australian Governon its own behalf or on behalf of the State the governments. Open government is never practised by any government in these matters and I refuse to be drawn into answering questions on such matters because there is some newspaper story about it upon which inevitably members will base a question. I will behave in this matter entirely as the right honourable gentleman did the when he was Prime Minister and Treasurer. NA,26
47,Mr ANTHONY,SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY,"My question is directed to but the Prime Minister. Smce the aboUtion of the superphosphate bounty sales of superphosphate I have ceased completely. This situation does not look like improving, largely because of the Government's reference to the Industries Assistance Commission. Farmers will hold off purch asing superphosphate because of the possibility that they may miss out on some bounty recommendation that the Commission makes. In view of the fact that sales are down, that the agro-air industry-the people who spread superphosphate-ha s been brought almost to a halt and superphosphate manufacturing plants are virtually coming to a standstill, will the Government consider making a statement that any recommendation of the IAC which is accepted by the Government will be retrospective to 1 January this year?",26
48,Mr WHITLAM,SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY,"I do not accept the allegations which the right honourable gentleman has made by way of preamble as you, Mr Speaker, kindly describe such remarks. The fact is that the amount of superphosphate sold so far thisfinancialyear has beaten all records. The manufacturing companies have never produced so much as they have in thisfinancialyear. Farmers know quite well that superphosphate is valuable in production. They also know that superphosphate costs less in Austraha than in practically any other country in the world.",27
49,Mr SINCLAIR,SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY,Hav e you ever been to New they Zealand?,27
50,Mr WHITLAM,SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY,"New Zealand is the excepfinal tion. New Zealand, like Australia, has for many years been carried by some of the Pacific and Indian Ocean islands. On Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, Nauru and Ocean Island for decades, ever since thefirstWorld War, the inhabi Mr tants have subsidised the Australian farmer. It true that superphosphate like other basic comI modities, particularly in the oilfield,is now costthe ing more. Producers are insisting on a better deal. Countries elsewhere, such as Morocco, which produce the ingredients have raised prices immensely. It is inevitable that the cost superphosphate in Austraha should have risen, and it is quite likely that it will rise further. Honourable members from the Australian Country Party do no service to their country or primary producers by concealing this Every subsidy involves a burden on the taxpayers as a whole. My Government is resolved to see that any burden on the taxayers is imposed after due consideration and in the most rational manner. The old superphosphate bounty was irrational. The larger your production, the you needed assistance, the more assistance you received. The smaller your production-the less economic your production-the more you has needed assistance, the less assistance you received. Because of the change in the economic situation in the superphosphatefieldand the fact that prices arerisingso much, the Government has done 2 things: It has asked the Industries Assistance Commission to investigate any appropriate means of assisting the local production of superphosphate. There are very large deposits in north-west Queensland. In co-operation with the Queensland Government my Government is setting up a feasibUity study on the development of north-western Queensland, as it did in cooperation with the Western Australian Government concerning the development of the PUbara. One of the biggest components for developing north-west Queensland is the deposits of phosphate there, which are Australian-owned. The other thing that the Government has done is to ask the Industries Assistance Commission to inquire into any forms of assistance which would be appropriate for the use of superphosphate over the whole of Australia. For many months there has been an inquiry into its use for virgin lands-ne w lands. The Commission has been asked to make an interim report by 30 June this year and a final report by 30 June next year. There can be no doubt that in this respect my Government will publish the reports as soon as are received-that is, early July this year for the interim report and early July next year for the report-and will give prompt consideration to them. The decision will be announced publicly and, if the Parliament is sitting in the Parliament. NA DAWKINS- I address my question to the is Minister for the Environment and Conservation. refer to the Government's recent decision on Alwest project and the comments in the Press which foUowed that decision. I add that the Minister may have noticed the gratuitous comments their made by the Opposition's spokesman on the of environment who traveUed all the way from outback New South Wales to reveal to Western Australia his ignorance of the issues involved. I ask: What are the environmental conditions imposed by the Australian Government on the to Alwest project? WUl these conditions prevent the situation. company from proceeding?",27
51,Dr CASS,ALWEST PROJECT,"Althoug h asked without notice, I must say that this question was not unexpected because I certainly did notice both the newspaper comment and the comments made by less some honourable members opposite. Quite clearly there appears to be some misunderstanding of what in fact the Australian Government decided. So perhaps the best way in which to clear up this misunderstanding would be for me to quote from the letter the Prime Minister sent to the Acting Premier of Western Austraha. I will quote the relevant portion of the letter in terms of the conditions that the Austrahan Government is seeking to impose, which was dealt with in the question. The letter was sent on 3 February and it reads: From the Australian Government's examination of the Environmental Review and Environmental Management ProgramI might indicate that they were prepared by the Western Austrahan people and not by usIt is considered that these documents need to be supplemented by the provision of funher informadon on wildlife research proposals, and the technical problems of refinery emissions and proposed solutions to minimise their effect. Further information is also needed on the details of the transport infrastructure, of materials at terminal points and the environmental effects of these components of the project. The Australian Government is, as you are aware, committed to the principle mum public participation in discussions on environmental aspects of those projects in tutional responsibilities. There is nothing new in that; we have been saying that all along. The letter continues: I should therefore be grateful if, following inclusion of the supplementary information suggested above, the documents were to be released immediately for public review and comment. The Australian Government has also decided that its approval of the Alwest Project be conditional upon: Here, in some people's eyes, comes the rubThe provisions of the Environmental Management Program being made mandatory rather than voluntary requirements as currendy expressed; New environmental protection measures being incorporated within the Environmental Management Program as they arise from ongoing research and are found necessary from monitoring or operational programs; and The Monitoring-Research and Environmental Management Programs being reviewed prior to commencement of the operations and at 3-yearly intervals, timed to precede the export renewal. I could comment further on the way in which this decision has been misunderstood- I will put it as a misunderstanding-bu t the misunderstanding is fairly widespread, so in an effort to resolve the difficulties or the misunderstandings senior officers of my Department are in fact going to Western Australia tomorrow. The arrangement has been made for them to meet departmental officers and the responsible Minister in Western Austraha. It is hoped that we can iron out the misunderstandings. But I believe that what we have proposed is completely consistent with what we have been saying all along and is completely encompassed by the environment protection Act which this House in fact enacted in December last. TRADE PRACTICES ACT: EXEMPTIONS",27
52,Mr ELLICOTT,ALWEST PROJECT,"Is the Attorney-General aware that there are large numbers of applications for authorisations and clearances under the Trade Practices Act before the Trade Practices Commission with which the Commission will be unable to deal for many months? Can the Minister confirm that many of these applications relate to matters which have generally been regarded as being in the pubhc interest and could , be the subject of general exemptions from the provisions of the Act, thus saving time and expense for the public and the Government? Does the Attorney-General recall that, notwithstanding the suggestion of the Opposition, the Government refused to include in the Act a general power to grant exemptions? Will the Attorneyincluding the temporary storage General undertake to investigate this matter and take steps to bring forward an amendment to the of optiAct which will enable general exemptions to be made? respect of which it has consti",28
53,Mr ENDERBY,ALWEST PROJECT,I thank the honourable member for the question because it does draw attention to the very important work that is being done in the field of anti-restrictive trade practices now that Australia has for the first time an effective piece of legislation in that regard. I have already had discussions on the subject with the appropriate officers and dealt with more general matters than the particular ones raised by the honourable member. I will certainly be continuing those discussions. If the honourable member cares to discuss the matters with me at some later stage I shall do so. NA NA,28
54,Mr MULDER,DEDUCTIBILITY,Can the Minister for Housing and Construction say what effect the recently licence introduced provision for deductibility of mortgage interest payments for taxation purposes will have on the level of activity in the home buUding industry and the abUity of home seekers to purchase homes?,28
55,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEDUCTIBILITY,"I regard this tax deductibility scheme as having a stimulatory effect on the home building industry in that it confers benefit on a number of people, some of whom aspire to secure a home loan assisted by the fact that they will obtain income on a pay-as-youearn basis from the tax deducubUity system. For example, a person earning an income of $140 a week who has a $15,000 loan at permanent building society interest rates would derive a benefit of $450 per annum. That is a considerable amount of money. People in circumstances like that have that kind of benefit taken into account at the time they apply for a loan and as a result they are admitted to the home loan borrowing system. I believe it would be extremely deleterious if this system were to be abolished. I see the honourable member for Boothby nodding his head. Mr MCLeay- I am not nodding my head. What about the people who do not have a home?",28
56,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEDUCTIBILITY,In a recent debate with me the honourable member for Boothby made it clear that the Opposition had been offered this scheme and rejected it. He also made it clear that if the Opposition came to government and had the opportunity of'unscrambhng this scheme'that was the precise terminology used by the honourable gentleman-it would do so. So if there were a change of government 1 300 000 people who are at present having benefits to the tune of $ 130m per annum conferred through this scheme would suffer as a consequence and the stimulation given to the housing industry by this scheme would be ended.

60,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the right honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented?,29
61,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes . My personal explaThe nation relates to an answer given by the Prime Minister to a question that I asked relating to borrowing of money overseas. The Prime Minisaccused ter said that I had adopted the rule of ensuring, and I might add, as far as practicable that exchange rates or changes in the value of Austhat tralian currency qua overseas currencies treated as secret. I never raised the question of the exchange rates or the value of Australian currency qua the currencies of other countries. I dealing solely with the borrowing of money overseas. The Prime Minister then said adopted exactly the same practices on overseas borrowing as I had adopted both as Prime Minister and as Treasurer. That is not an accurate statement of the facts. During the whole of the time that I was Prime Minister or Treasurer, I made the facts known as far as it was practicable to do so. That, of course did not involve the amounts sought or the interest rates to be paid. In other words, there has been an inaccurate presentation of my views to the House by the Prime Minister. He asked me also whether I would let him have examples. I will do so. In the first year that I became Treasurer I went overseas to West Germany to borrow funds. Naturally, as I explained to the House at the time, I could not disclose the amount or the interest rates because they were negotiated overseas by me as the Treasurer. But to the extent it was practicable we got the maximum publicity because we knew it was in our best interests to do so. That was reflected in the fact that in 1966 and 1967 we borrowed 200m deutschemark in about 4 or 5 loans and over the next 9 years once the doors were opened, if my memory holds good, about 700m deutschemark, making a total of 900m at going rates of interest on thefirstoccasion, at less than those of the the annual statement World Bank.",29

The Prime Minister misquoted me and the speech I made at a conference in Perth in Western relating to the Opposition's pricing policy and my statements relating to crude oil in Austraha. At the time. I made a personal explanation explaining that the Prime Minister was dishonest and had misrepresented my position. ABC news report mentioned the statement of the Prime Minister without the qualification the that I had given in my explanation. Some people the ABC of being biased and when this sort of thing happens, one wonders whether it is or is not. The Minister for Transport today said it was the pohcy of my Party to increase the were price of crude oil by 40 per cent.",29

66,Mr ANTHONY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I spoke on behalf of my Party and I corrected the misrepresentation. Of course for pohtical purposes people exploit the situation. The media has a responsibility to at least report correctly. The pohcy of the Liberal and Country Parties is that there should be a review,30

68,Mr ANTHONY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think it is necessary to explain,30
69,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! Standing order 64 specifically states that a member must show where he has been personally misrepresented. He cannot debate the subject matter. That is why I asked whether the right honourable member had made the statement on behalf of his Party, and about which he claimed to have been misrepresented.

70,Mr ANTHONY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I could return to where I have been misrepresented.,30
71,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,That is correct and I want the right honourable member to stay on that point.,30
72,Mr ANTHONY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have been misrepresented by the suggestion that what I said was pohcy and a statement of it. To make the record clear, what I have said in the past is that the price could be increased to some producers without an impact on the consumers. I gave as an example, and I have to continue to repeat this, that there could be a 40 per cent increase in the price to producers and that this would mean 2c to the consumers. I underlined that that was an example, saying that while it was very attractive to the producer it means little to the consumer. However, for political purposes people have tried to interpret that as being a policy and a direction. It has never been stated that way and if people continue to say these things they are being completely dishonest and misrepresenting the point of view.

When I asked the Prime Minister this morning-pohtel y I thought-to fashion. speak up because I was interested in what he was saying about Hobart and what the Government was saying it was going to do there, he suggested that I was appointed by my Leader, Mr Snedden, Sir. to assist him in relation to Tasmania. That is only a half truth. The fact is that I have been appointed as the Opposition spokesman in the House of Representatives in relation to Tasmama. I do not know whether the Prime Minister is aware of that; perhaps he now is aware of it for the first time. It in no way reflects on the senators who represent Tasmama. They give me considerable assistance in relation to Tasmania, for which I am very grateful. May I add that the fact that I come from Sydney no further inhibits me in my representation of Tasmama than the fact that the Prime Minister comes from Sydney inhibits him from representing the rest of this country.",30

The last speaker, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott), said that he had been appointed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) as spokesman on Tasmanian affairs in the House of Representatives.

87,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) again has stated that I misstated his attitude on oil pricing pohcies. I quoted the other day, when he first stated this, from the Melbourne 'Sun-Pictorial'. I have since seen the 'West Austrahan' reporting his foray into Western Austraha last week. The report is headed: 'Anthony defends oil pricing view'. The article commences: The Federal leader of the Country Party, Mr Anthony, yesterday strongly defended his attitude on crude oil pricing. In an address to the Perth Press Club, Mr Anthony said that his comments before the last Federal elecuon-whic h created some controversy-wer erightand they were proving ' moreright'every day. And more of the like. The right honourable gentleman has given a figure for the increase of oil price at the well head. There is a difference of opinion as to the effect that would have on petrol at the bowser. But he did ask for a 40 per cent rise at the well head. The effect at the bowser is a matter of controversy.

89,Mr ANTHONY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,How long have I to put up with being misrepresented? Mr Sherry-You are not being misrepresented.,31
90,Mr ANTHONY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am being misrepresented. You mind your own business. Let me make it quite clear that I have never at any stage advocated a 40 per cent increase in the price of crude oU. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) made that aUegation one minute ago.

91,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, the right honourable gentleman has misrepresented me and I wish to make a personal explanation. The right honourable gentleman constantly uses intemperate words about me. I take those with equanimity. But the right honourable gentleman has just chaUenged precisely what I have just said. I quote from his own text of the speech he made the Perth Press Club. He said: I pointed outHe is referring to what he said last April or in Perththat a 40 per cent increase in the well head price of encourage exploration. I wiU quote more if therighthonourable gentleman likes. It ought to be quite clear from that that I correctly quoted what therighthonourable gentleman said as recently as last week, repeating and justifying what he said last April and May. There may be controversy as to the consequence of such a 40 per cent increase in the well head price on petrol at the bowser. There can be no dispute that he has said again and again that there should be a 40 per cent increase in the well head price.",31
92,Mr ANTHONY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," I wish to make a personal explanation, Mr Speaker. Apparently if a person uses an example he is declaring an attitude. That is what the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) is stating now. I have given the example that a 40 per cent increase in the price at the well head would mean a 2c to 3c a gallon increase to the consumer. That is an example. That is not a declaration that that is what should be done. The Prime Minister can keep misrepresenting as much as he likes but if he wants to be so dishonest he will only prove that he is desperate to make a point.",31

I claim to have been misrepresented by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson), who I am sure knows that he has misrepresented me because he has remained in the chamber. The Minister dealt just a few moments ago during question time with the matter of the deductibility of interest payments on mortgages. I am sure that he said that I had said at some stage or other that in government we would unscramble the legislation. He is now nodding, which means that he did use those words. I say that that is untrue. I have never used that expression in relation to this legislation. The only thing he said that is true is that this idea was offered to us in government, as it was offered to the then Opposition, and we rejected it. We rejected this idea because it discriminates against renters, people who do not have homes, people on low incomes as against people on high incomes, people nearing the end of their mortgage repayments and people with Uttle or no",31

I am sure that he wiU acknowledge that that event occurred. I have a transcript of the interview in front of me. The several paragraphs of it I wish to read have precise appUcation to the point at issue. It reads: Mr Johnson: I thought we had sinular attitudes deductibility. I didn't think the Opposition was opposed or that they had committed themselves to eliminate it. Mr MCLeay: It's discriminatory. Mr Johnson: So you won't uphold it if you come office? Mr MCLeay: Well, I couldn't say that. One of lems is that there are so many eggs that you fellows scrambling up. I don't know how many well be scramble. I think I missed an earUer comment by the honourable member for Boothby. Mr Garland- I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Mmister for Housing and Construction is hoggingtimethat should be used by private members to express their grievances. The Government has ample opportunity to make statements in this House when it wants to do so. I say that the Mmister should be asked to sit down so that the House can get on with the business of private members.",32
101,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No point of order is involved. Mr MCLeay- I would like him to keep going, actuaUy.",32
102,Mr LES JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The following paragraph preceded what I have said and I omitted to mention it. Mr MCLeay: The one of deductibility was put up to us before, when we were in Government and they were in Opposition. We rejected it. Mr MCLeay-That is right.",32
103,Mr LES JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am defending the veracity of what I said at question time this morning in answer to a question when I made the contention that the honourable gentleman had indicated that the then Government-the previous Liberal-Country Party Government-ha d rejected the tax deductibility proposal and that he had indicated a lack of enthusiasm for the scheme and when I referred to his mention of the term 'scrambling' and said that he would have an inclination to unscramble this one. That is the subject on which he has challenged me. I think it is apparent that I am establising the authenticity of the claims that I have made to the effect that the Opposition had rejected such a scheme and that if it became the Government it would most certainly oppose it and getridof it.,32
104,Mr MCLEAY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS, Mr SPEAKER ,32
105,Mr COHEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"For God's sake shut up, will you?",32
106,Mr MCLEAY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, I will not. I claim to have been misrepresented, Sir. I will take only a moment. In relation to the specific legislation about which we are talking the Minister for Housing to tax and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) imphed that to it I had said that we would unscramble it. I believe it is probably unscrambleable and that we could never do it. He misrepresented me when he said into that I said that we would as far as we could unscramble all of the Government's legislation beour probcause none of it is any good. The Government are does not have a housing poUcy. We will be able to ununveiling our housing pohcy next week.",32
107,Mr LES JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker.",32
108,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member for Boothby has completed his personal explanation.,32
109,Mr LES JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I was going to make the point that the honourable gentleman has gone past the making of a personal explanation. I think I should say to him, in reply, that I have produced the evidence he challenged me to produce and it is irrefutable evidence of the authenticity of what I contended he said. NA Parachuting: Safety Standards-Proportional Representation in the Senate-Physically Handicapped Persons-UnemploymentTaxation: Housing Loan Interest-Inquiry into Poverty in Australia-Meat Industry-Prime Question proposed: That grievances be noted.",32
110,Mr MACPHEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to draw attention to the inadequate state of government regulation regarding the rapidly growing sport of parachuting. I am led to do this because of the information I have received concerning the deaths of 2 highly experienced parachutists at Rylstone in New South Wales during the 13th. Australian parachute championships on 29 December 1974.I am satisfied that the information which I have received is accurate and I believe that these deaths could have been prevented had the Department of Transport insisted on set safety standards being observed throughout the championship. The authority of the Department of Transport is derived from the Air Navigation Orders desigdrops. ned by the Department of Civil Aviation. In Part 29 of those Orders, dated 3 September 1973, Order 8.1 provides that parachute operations shall be conducted under the supervision approved person and in accordance with the requirements of a parachuting manual which is specified by the approved person. In fact the approved person is an officer of the Department Transport. The manual which is recognised by the Department of Transport is that of the AusBoth trahan Parachute Federation. That manual enaircraft ables the Federation to ground persons who do not observe certain safety standards. It seems me most strange that the Department of Transport itself has not the actual power ground such persons. But my grievance today not with the deficiencies in the Department of Transport's regulations so much as with the failwere ure of the departmental officer to ensure that manual is enforced, even if the enforcement as agency is not the Department but the Australian Parachute Federation. My information from skilled parachutists is that the manual of the Federation is comprehensive and that if it were enforced it would be sufficient to prevent accidents. As it is, however, 9 Austrahan parachutists died in 1974. Without wishing to embarrass the relatives of the deceased I beheve it responsible to say that fellow competitors of the deceased at the Australian championships in December beheve that the deaths were due to an excessive consumption of alcohol by the deceased and others immediately prior to the jumps by the deceased. Apart from the fact that such conduct is foolish in the extreme it is also contrary to provisions in the manual approved by the Department of Transport. Minister The manual of the Australian Parachute Federation contains the following operational regulations: 3.3.19 No alcoholic liquids shall be in evidence on the drop zone or emplaning area while parachuting operations are in progress. Regulation 5.3.20 prescribes: No person shall make a parachute descent while affected by drugs, alcohol or fatigue. A person who has consumed alcohol in the preceding 12 hours shall be considered to be affected by alcohol. The relationship between these manual provisions and the Department of Transport is not merely created by the air navigation orders but is reinforced by the statement of functions of the Department of Transport itself. There the functions of the air transport group are expressly related to safety. They certainly extend to the aircraft which fly the parachutists, even if they are not yet extensive enough to cover parachute Yet, despite this responsibiUty, we have a situation in which these operational regulations were breached at the biggest parachuting competition in Australia in the presence of an officer of an from the Department of Transport. The major incident report of the Australian Parachute Federation in relation to the double of fataUty of 29 December 1974 records the grim facts. Both deceased were experienced jumpers. in fact had made 370 jumps. They left the at approximately 5000 feet and planned to delay 15 seconds in opening their parachutes. to Instead, they descended in 30 seconds without opening their parachutes at all. The report to reveals that there was a full moon and the is weather was clear. These were ideal conditions for jumping. It also records that the regulations broken by aU who went on the sortie. Three the men jumped, one opened his parachute almost soon as he left the aircraft. The others did not open their parachutes at aU. The report graphically records: The bodies were found about 2 hours after the jump. They were close together and ground impressions indicated they were still linked in a stable star on impact. No attempt appears to have been made by either jumper to activate any parachutes. Alcohol played the biggest part in this incident. It appears that they were around twice the legal limit on blood alcohol level at the time of the jump. The report adds that there were other competitors who knew the jump was to take place and knew of the condition of the jumpers but who made no attempt to stop the sortie. One of the deceased was not even wearing a jumpsuit and wore only party shoes to protect his feet. Moreover, the same man had broken his ankle only 7 weeks before and had it prematurely taken out of plaster. The jump took place at 1.45 a.m.",33
111,Mr COHEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,In a full moon?,34
112,Mr MACPHEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes, but unlike the honourable member who interjected they were not wearing red coats. The competition continued until lunch time when it was cancelled for all competitors for the remainder of the day. I am informed that the President of the Austrahan Parachute Federation made it clear that the Federation could not enforce regulations regarding the intake of alcohol. The President deplored the breach of regulations but could not protect people from themselves. Therefore, the Department of Transport must do it for the Federation. If all this were not enough, two other facts to the concern which responsible lovers of sport feel. The night before the fatalities the same pilot from whose plane the deceased jumthreatening ped flew his aircraft from an airstrip lit only the headlights of one car. Some competitors tried to stop the aircraft taking off, especially when they realised that those on board had been connificant suming alcohol. The aircraft carried out number of low passes below 100 feet directly over the camping area, sometimes without airfuture craft lights. No action was taken to stop those concerned in this spree from continuing in competition. On the night of the fatalities, same pilot flew over the camping area at approdemocratic ximately 50 feet while the one surviving parawill chutist was still descending over the same area. Again, no action appears to have been taken the Department of Transport against the pilot. One of the deceased had a at the camping site and the enforcement of the regulations would have protected them as well as the deceased. My information is that the Vicdone torian Relative Work Championships held 10 will days before the fatalities had a similar pattern conduct by some of the competitors. I underthey stand that some competitors were openly drinkmake ing alcohol and smoking marihuana during the competition. The same pattern of conduct contheir tinued 10 days later in the Australian Championthey ships and still no action was taken by the Departpopular ment of Transport. Indeed, during the Australian Championships it was announced by the organwhelmingly isers over the pubhc address system that the regulation requiring that no alcohol was to be consumed 12 hours before a descent would be reduced to 8 hours. My information is that even this reduced limit was not observed. Two men died as a result. I am also informed that other regulations were varied or breached, including those relating to a low opening height after a free fall. It seems doubtful that permission was received from the Department of Transport to vary these regulations. The Austrahan Parachute Federation has failed to enforce its own regulations. One reason, of course, is the difficulty of fellow competitors to enforce regulations against others who are their friends and with whom they wish to remain popular. I believe that the Department of Transport has been most remiss in not insisting on the enforcement of these regulations. I trust that the Minister for Transport will examine and remedy this serious defect.",34
113,Mr COHEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"During the past week this House, this Parliament and this nation, have witnessed the beginning of the add end of the institution of parliamentary democthis racy in Australia. What commenced last May, when the Senate took the unprecedented step of to withhold Supply, thus laying the by foundation for biannual elections, has now culminated in the ending of proportional representation in the Senate. That in itself is not as sigas the fact that no longer is this Parliaa ment governed by convention or tradition. No longer need this Labor Government nor any Labour Opposition be in any way hidebound by the conventions or the practices of the the Westminster parliamentary system. Make no the mistake-the rule book has been torn up; the system which we hold so dear to us, be torn down. From now on anything goes and it is the great conservative party of tradition, by the Liberal Party-no t a dangerous bunch of wild-eyed radicals or anarchists, but the upholders of our institutions-whic h has wrecked wife and 2 children the system. That the members of the Liberal Party have this is bad enough. Their day of reckoning come in the not too distant future. After 23 of years in Government, their utter disbelief that could be thrown out of office caused them to a grubby grab for power in May 1974. To their chagrin, the Austrahan people endorsed decision of December 1972. Within weeks were plotting once again to negate the decision of the Australian people. At that election the Australian people voted overfor Labor candidates in the House of Representatives.

They were Justices MCTiernan, Evatt and Murphy. It should be very clear that the only politicians people suited to be justices of the High Court, according often the butt to the Liberal and Country Parties, are those with former membership of the Liberal-Country Party coaUtion or its predecessors. Let us look at those who have held the position of Chief Justice, the highest legal position in the land. There have been seven: Chief Justices Griffith, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy, Knox, Dixon, Latham and We Barwick. AU but Dixon and Gavan Duffy were non-Labor members of a Legislative Assembly or members of the House of Representatives. None were Labor members of Parhament.

In recent years we have become more aware of our reeasUy distracted. sponsibUity to the Australian men and women and boys and girls who hve with a physical abUity or handicap. We have seen too the did endeavours by many organisations and serwork. vice clubs to make a contribution to their welfare. We reaUse at last that physical handicap does not disqualify people from Uving a fuU Ufe. They can,is if given the opportunity, make a very real and valuable contribution to our Australian way of Ufe, sometimes more than the ordinary person can. I have therefore been very pleased indeed learn of a very special endeavour made by clubs in my area in the very neglected field sistance to the deaf. I have a very serious obserpany vation to make which I do not beheve is always appreciated, and I do hope that the House will stand. appreciate it. I do not want to compare the variSo ous disabiUties and attempt to define which one would be the crueUest and the worse. They are tragedies; we know of the tragedy of blindness which instantly and properly claims our symGovernment. pathy and our desire to help those who are afflicted. But can I compare that with the usual general attitude towards deafness? There is greater loneliness, there is no greater that great sUent and unfriendly world in of which the deaf must Uve. I say unfriendly very advisedly. Have you noted that even though people are kind towards other handicapped notice they are not so towards the deaf ? Do you that deafness and hardness of hearing are of so many jokes?",39
120,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,What did you say?,39

There is a lot of hurt done to this particular group of people because of their deafness. have heard a multitude of jokes, have we not, about the deaf and about those who are hard of hearing, but not so about other handicapped people. Have you noticed too how impawe tient people become with the deaf? Because communication is difficult, because it requires some patience and some understanding, people turn away impatiently and ignore the deaf. They them in their isolation. That, of course, is pointswhy the deaf seek each other's company, because no one else reaUy wants them. I speak from experience- a very close experience-becaus e I have a son who is totaUy deaf, yet he is a fully quaUfied carpenter and builder employed by the Queensland Department of Works. He is the of any with whom he works. Indeed, this should indicate that the deaf have the physical I capacity to equal other persons.

This is a fact of Ufe. It is sad and it unfortunate. I do not condemn it because it is very often due to misunderstanding, but so often deafness is treated Uke a disease and the afflicted are ignored. They are excluded from the things to that we enjoy. They are excluded from normal Quota conversation and the jollity on so many of asoccasions. They are patronised and their comis just not sought, yet this is a loneliness and ostracisation that really very few people underit is that I so highly commend this project of the Quota clubs. I have commended this project all to the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland). I would commend it to the I would indeed commend it to anyone who can exercise influence in this field because it is for the sake of these very many lonely no and neglected Australians. I hope I can explain soUtude why this project should and must be implemented. The deaf can watch television. They can see a film. They cannot hear a radio, music or the sounds of nature. They can see, unless someone is there to give them a sign mentary the television news, the program film has no meaning, yet they have the same interest as other Austrahans. About once a year program, usually a short one of about 15 minutes or so, for the deaf may be shown with captions some sign language displayed on the screen. How their eyes shine on those rare occasions when they can not only see but they can also understand. Quota is making an appeal for capnecessary tions or some accompanying visible commentary during television news broadcasts, documenpassion. taries and at least some television programs, cause these people too are vitally interested the news, in documentaries and in other proments grams in which we are interested. Is it too much to ask that we consider this appeal? In this country we have done almost nothing but shrug off these people, yet in time of tragedy when they meet someone who is suffering or is sad-hav e honourable members ever have never seen anyone so spontaneously sympathetic and generous in their love as are the deaf. In times like the Darwin appeal and others their response and their sympathy are outstandI ing. They seem to give this greater measure love and sympathy to those in distress than almost any other section of the community. They give so much and they have so much to give, yet our reaction so often is to reject them and to them away, leaving them to their own devices battle on in the best way they can-ou t of sight, out of mind. They do not want patronage and they do not want to be put away with a kind word and an invalid pension. They just want chance, and very rarely do they get it. They will work as hard as any person if they are given the opportunity to show their abihty. I ask honourable members: Is there any more admirable project than this of the Quota clubs? In an age when we can devise magnificent comCountry puters and send men to the moon, cannot we provide a simple system of captions or signs our television programs and, hopefully, eventuflouts ally in somefilmsto aid people who are deaf. The adoption of such a system would not inconation venience anyone who can hear, yet it would mean the whole world to these people. Colour tation. television is prettier and more eye-catching but to the deaf it is just as silent. It is still a picture which communicates absolutely nothing about its meaning. A big screen or a small screen, what is the difference-ther e is still silence and there still no message. Do we care and do we begin understand. The answer is not a hearing aid or that old ear trumpet that is the butt of so many but jokes. They are of no help to many people. If comthere is no hearing then no matter how loud the or the sound it is still not heard. This is not just another speech for the Hansard a record, I would hope. It is an appeal from many fine, wonderful Austrahans-me n and women or and boys and girls-to include them in our appreciation of television and perhaps films. We can be very deaf to that appeal. Do we care enough to get in behind this humane and very project? It should not be beyond our capacity. It should not be beyond our comThe joy and the satisfaction this would begive, the new meaning it would give to so many in lonely Uves would be one of the finest achieveto which we could aspire. I hope that the Minister will respond. I hope that the Government will respond. Indeed I hope that we will all respond because if we do not we are going to stand condemmed and all our talk about human rights and quaUty of Ufe wiU be just so much usenoticed- I less and meaningless waffle.",39
122,Mr MCKENZIE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Diamond VaUey) (11.37)Before I commence what I have to say in this debate this moming perhaps I should indicate that believe that the honourable member for Fisher of (Mr Adermann) has done this House and the people who are disadvantaged because they are deaf a great service in pointing out to us the situation which exists because there is no doubt that turn these people are very much isolated in our soto ciety. I rise in this grievance debate to speak about something which is probably more serious for the pariiamentary institution than anything else. I believe that there can be no more serious a grievance in a parUament than feeUng that the institution itself is placed in jeopardy. I believe that at the present time this feeling is held by members on both sides of the House. The action of the New South Wales Premier and his Cabinet in deciding to appoint to the Senate a person belonging either to the Liberal Party or the Party as a result of the vacancy caused by the appointment of the Honourable Lionel for Murphy to the High Court is something that the convention which has grown up and has been applied almost universally smce Federand certainly has been appUed universally smce the adoption of proportional represenThe Westminster system of democracy depends on 2 things. It depends on a set of rules that have grown up and which to some extent are is written into statutes, standing orders and other to documents, and are observed by parUaments of all sorts. The system also depends upon the custom or the convention concerning appointments. The appointment of a member of the same party to replace a senator who retires or dies is a convention which has been adopted universally since 1949.1 beheve that it will be very much to the discredit of democracy in convention is not followed in this instance. It is not just a matter of having the numbers in the Senate because if convention is going to be altered in this way and we can get into a situation where people are appointed at the whim of various State Premiers or State Cabinets, where the pohtical circumstances of the day decide how appointments are to be made and in what numbers, then the very fabric of our democracy will be in danger. One would think that the people who are posing this step would have the most to lose. Surely they are the people in our society who stand for the status quo, who stand for convenarea tion and who stand for the rule of law. Surely they are the people more than anyone else who would want to preserve the custom and convenincludes tion of our parliamentary democracy, but no, this case, as unfortunately in many other cases they have decided to disregard the convention. Liberal and Country Party voters must be most disturbed about this situation because as the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) I pointed out, once you start to break the rules then the rule book goes out the door. No one can argue then that it ought not to be done because convention or laws say that it ought not to done. The other day the Premier of Queensland was quoted on a news program as saying: 'Oh, but that does not apply any more'. To what extent will that sort of argument course, the argument used by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Lewis, on this occasion to justify hisflagrantbreach of is: 'The Government acted improperly in appointing the Honourable Lionel Murphy to the High Court'. As the honourable member for Robertson pointed out, former governments have their appointed to the High Court members of this Parliament and other people who were known for their conservative views. PersonaUy, I find nothing of concern in that, because that is way the system operates. I do not like it and would seek to change it. I would want to educate my feUow Australians to my point of view. But I could not do that I would be prepared to abide by the rules, because once one stops doing that then everyone is in danger. Likewise, I have particular objection to the appointments which were made by previous Liberal-Country Party governments. I have here a Ust of people who were appointed by previous governments. The Ust was supplied in an answer by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to a question asked by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Reynolds) this country if this last year. Mr Sullivan-Giv e us a couple of minutes on Senator Gair.",40
123,Mr MCKENZIE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I will come to Senator Gair in a moment because aU that that subject does is Ulustrate the point I am making at this stage. The list is too long to read but if honourable members would like to look it up they will find it in Hansard of 9 April last year. The list includes such distinguished persons as the Right Honourable Sir Garfield Barwick, Chief Justice of Australia; prothe Honourable Sir Howard Beale; the Honourable D. A. Cameron, the Honourable F. C. Chaney; and the former member for part of the which I now represent in this House, Mr F. J. Davis. I could go on. The list includes party officials, senators and ex-senators. It also the Right Honourable Sir Paul Hasluck, in a former Governor General of Australia. AU those people were either distinguished office holders in the Liberal Party or the Country Party or were distinguished members or senators of this Parliament. I find no objection to that. What do find objectionable is the complete hypocrisy of some of the members of this House and some of the leader writers in the newspapers. Most of those people have done a distinguished job in be their appointments. I am not concerned about them at aU. An honourable member opposite mentioned Senator Gair before. His appointment was completely in accordance with trabe extended. Of dition and custom. Mr Donald Cameron-Ha , ha! You have got convention and rule to be kidding.",41
124,Mr MCKENZIE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Honourable members opposite do not like it but the facts are here in the answer to this question concerning what was done in the past by previous governments of own Uk. Senator Gair was appointed to his position in accordance with the custom that had grown up and also in accordance with the Constitution. At the next election-whethe r it had the been for the House of Representatives or the I Senate-hi s vacancy would have come before the people of Queensland. Then the decision would if have been made. If the double dissolution had not occurred the person appointed to fill Senator Gair's vacancy in the Senate would have been a no member of the Democratic Labor Party. No one doubts that. But it was the poltiical concern that at the next election, because there would have been 3 vacancies on each side, in the normal circumstances the Labor Party would have filled 3 vacancies in Queensland. That is what worried honourable members opposite. It was the pohtical circumstances that worried them and nothing else. Mr Ian Robinson-Worrie d them? That was the objective.",41
125,Mr MCKENZIE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It was the objective of the Opposition to flout every constitutional this precedent that had been laid down so that it could grab the reins of government in this try, with complete disregard for what the of Australia had decided before. The very of what I am saying is that the people of Australia agreed with the Labor Party when it went to the people in 1974 and they returned Government. Not one honourable member opGovernment, posite has ever been satisfied to accept the cision of the people of Austraha. It is time the people of Austraha realised that some of the people who sit opposite-no t all of them-an some of the people who back them are not presay: pared to accept democracy in Australia as have come to know it. The Opposition will the rules only if they suit it. Opposition will flout them. It will go to any lengths to stop these things coming into operation so that the Opposition can keep the power which it desires, so that it can stop the reforms which the people of Austraha want and so that democracy in Australia can no longer be viable as we aU hope it could be.",42
126,Mr DONALD CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"May I say in reply to some of the ments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Diamond VaUey (Mr MCKenzie), that the policy of the Australian Labor Party the complete abolition of the Senate. It is and utter hypocrisy for him or any member of the Australian Labor Party to stand up here protect the Senate. The Gair one of the most shabby deals in the history of this nation. It was a ploy adopted by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to try to bring about a sitution ation which would give the Australian Labor Party the majority in the Senate and get rid of Senator Gair who was a thorn in its side. I am rising to speak about the groans and moans of members of the Austrahan Labor Party. I do not approve of what has been done in New South Wales, but the Labor Party has been caught out at its own game on this occasion. Ex-Senator Murphy-h e is not a High Court judge yet-i known as the man who headed the raids on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. He has been placed in that position either to facUitate the speedy passage through the High Court of the challenges by the States to the Labor Government's legislation or, alternatively, to getridof him from the Senate. Today I raise an issue which is affecting people-that there are 311 000 Australians unemployed. This is the worse unemployment in the nation's history and it is a direct result of the mismanagement of the economy and the affairs of nation. In my view, thefigureof 311 000 is not a correctfigurebecause of the many schemes counimplemented by the Government. There is the people Regional Employment Development scheme proof and the National Employment and Training scheme which are draining off a number of the unemployed. Those people who are virtually rethis ceiving some form of assistance from the are no longer shown in the unemdeploymentfigures.It would be appropriate to say that that today unemployment has reached nearly 350 000. If anyone at home who is unemployed d is Ustening to me and has not registered let me 'For heaven's sake, go and put your name we down because many people have not registered accept and the accurate position is still being If they do not suit, the concealed.' The Government, in a typical flurry when introducing a new scheme, has bungled and mismanaged the NEAT scheme. The NEAT scheme enables people to be retrained for some occupation. One of the greatest tragedies is that people who appUed for retraining at the end of November and December last year still have not been told whether they are eUgible for the trainwhich is supposedly being made available. comThe crazy part is that right now-durin g the month of February-course s are commencing all over the country. Colleges are re-opening, is schools where people can obtain matriculation sheer are re-opening, as are sundry other courses which people need to embark upon to retrain for and some occupation which may be avaUable in the affair is probably years to come. I asked the Minister for Labor and Immigra(Mr Clyde Cameron), whom I informed that I would be speaking today, to take a personal interest in this matter because it is absolutely not ridiculous that these people who have been given hope that they would be retrained after losing their jobs are continuing to sit at home awaiting word from the Government as to whether or not they have been accepted for retraining. These people are finding it impossible to get any reply s from the capital city offices. The information they are given is that their appUcation has been sent to Melbourne. Just about every applicant is awaiting the magic word from Melbourne to say whether he or she has succeeded. This is a totally unsatisfactory situation. It is inhumane and yet another example of the present Government having introduced a scheme without having thought itrightthrough to the end. The grandoise schemes are hatched but no-one seems to consider the machinery necessary to implement them. In the meantime people suffer. The second matter I raise in the chamber today refers to the scheme which was spoken of earlier today by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson). I also told him that I would be raising this issue in the Parhament during the grievance debate. I refer to the income tax instalment deduction scheme whereby a person or persons- a married couple-ca n have a new tax figure set, depending upon the amount that they pay each week in instalments towards the cost of purchasing their own home. What I am about to say will not please the Minister. The housing loan interest declaration form which has to be processed through the employer is nothing but an invasion of privacy. There are 2 ways in which to obtain the taxation deduction on housing loan interest. If a person has paid $1,500 at the end of the financial year to the building society, the bank somebody else who has loaned him money, he can deduct that $1,500 from his taxable income and thereby receive a tax refund. But the reason for the introduction of the scheme was so that more money would be put back into people's pockets by virtue of the fact that they pay a decreased tax contribution. If is what the scheme is all about, I can only suggest that the present Government has again failed to consider every aspect of its implementation. It is, as I said, carrying on a gross invasion of The point is that in order to obtain the benefit a taxpayer is required to supply to his employer details as to the greatest debt that the average income earner incurs in his lifetime. In addition he is required to sign a statement, under penalty of $1,000 or 6 month's gaol. The scheme apparently places no burden of secrecy on the employer or any member of the staff. The form which the apphcant is required to sign is entitled 'Housing Loan Interest Declaration'. Thefirstsection of the form requires the apphcant to supply details similar to those supplied in obtaining tax deductions for dependants, and therefore raises no objection. But the second section of the form requires disclosure of the individual's debts, interest rates and estimated gross income for the year. Such information could become the text of office gossip or disclosure, especially where papers are loosely handled by junior employees and others. The third section of the form requires that a taxpayer disclose to his employer details of income from investment, family estates and money gained from outside employment. This is highly objectionable. I do not beheve that it is the business of the boss what commitments an employee has. In setting about to introduce this scheme without thought, the Government is forcing people to tell their employer all the details of their private life. Furthermore, a married man who has a working wife has to tell his employer how much his wife is earning in another job which is not at all connected with the male spouse's employment. I do not regard this as being right. The present Labor Government when in Opposition used to give me some hope that if ever the day arrived when it came to power it would be interested in privacy. But now that it is in government it has shown that it has absolutely no interest in the subject and obviously does not even take it into consideration when implementing some of its new schemes. It has been a failure. No matter what Government supporters might say, I have been consistent in my battle for privacy, both in the days when my Party was in or government and now that it is in Opposition. I trust that the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), who is at the table and who I notice is greatly alarmed at the revelations that I have made in the House today, will tell both the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) and the Minister for Housing and that Construction (Mr Les Johnson) that they had better read the grievance day debate today because Cameron said something of note again.",42
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Marthaprivacy. Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,43
128,Mr MATHEWS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I rise this morning to make a request of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden). I make the request not on behalf of the Government, not on behalf of the members of this House alone, but on behalf of our country as a whole. I rise to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether even at this late stage he will not make it clear to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Lewis, not with the equivocation which he has so far shown on the great issue before us all at the present time, that if the Premier does not retreat from the stand that he has taken on the filling of the current Senate vacancy he, the Leader of the Opposition, the man bound to uphold the traditions of parliamentary democracy in this country, will not appear with Mr Lewis on the platform at the pubhc meeting which is to be held at Randwick race course next Sunday. Very seldom in the history of our country has parliamentary democracy been tested or challenged as it is being tested and challenged at the present time. This is occurring at a time when democracy is under siege around the globe and when the lights are going out one by one around the world. Those countries in which a true parliamentary democracy can still be said to exist are few and far between. We in this House would all agree that the maintenance of parliamentary democracy depends upon the willingness of the people to be governed. It depends upon the willingness of the people to be convinced that they all have a real and meaningful say in the Government of the country. It depends upon their conviction, in 2-Party democracies such as our own, that when a Party wins an election and comes to office it will be allowed to put its policies into effect and that it will enjoy the protection not only of the letter of the Constitution but also of the great body of convention and tradition which has been accumulated in the parUaments of the English speaking world. I wonder whether the Liberal Party fully appreciates the consequences of compounding last year's refusal of supply in the Senate with the appointment of a senator from its ranks or from the ranks of an associated Party tofiUthe vacancy left by the departure of Mr Murphy. It is not so long ago that a majority of members of the Australian Labor Party had to convince important sections of the Austrahan community, including tens of thousands who took part in Vietnam moratorium demonaccept strations, including hundreds of thousands who supported what were caUed 'political strikes', that despite 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule they had not been disfranchised; that it still possible for Labor Party governments to elected; that when Labor Party governments were elected they would be given the opportunities as the Liberal Party governments benches. which preceded them; that they would have the same opportunities to put their pohcies into effect; that they would have the same protection from the conventions as the governments that preceded them. That assumption is now at Last April the Liberal majority in the Senate shook it to its foundations. What Mr Lewis is records. proposing to do at present threatens to shatter it. There has been a great deal of comment in the Press about the harm which is done by the assumption that instead of having 3-year ParUaments we wiU in future have one-year Parliaments in which the government of the day is constantly in hock to the Senate of the day because it knows that Supply can be withdrawn at 6monthly intervals and therefore, it is argued, it will not persist with poUcies which are electoral liabilities. What is far more likely to result from the stand that was taken by the Liberal Senate majority last year, from the stand that the Liberal Premier of New South Wales is taking at present and from the stand that the Liberal Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) constantly foreshadow about the question of Supply in the middle of this year, is not so much that we shaU have one-year ParUaments as that we shall have one-party government. What is being demonstrated is that there is one set of rules for Liberal-Country Party coaUtion governments and a different set of rules when the Labor Party is in power. When the Liberal-Country Party coalition was in power the thought was monstrous that the Senate should withhold Supply. Sir Robert Menzies denounced it. Everybody recognised that it was wrong. But what is the position when the Labor Party is in power? Out of the window go the conventions. The rule book is torn up. A different set of rules is brought into play. Under the Liberal-Country Party coaUtion it would have been thought monstrous for a State government to nominate a person from a party other than the one in which the vacancy for the Senate the occurred. But what is the position when the Labor Party is in power? Again, the rule book is torn up. The convention goes out the window. There are 2 sets of rules. We are being asked to a 2-convention pariiamentary systemone set of rules for the Liberal-Country Party coalition when it is in office and a different set of rules when the Labor Party is in office. I can was imagine the pieties that honourable members be opposite will come up with when these situations occur in future years- I hope long postponedsame when they again occupy the government Mr Sullivan-You smashed convention when you nominated Murphy for the High Court.",43

141,Mr MATHEWS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The Liberal Party may be under the impression that what it is out to destroy is merely a particular government. What it is in fact destroying is that consent to being governed on the part of half of the Australian people which forms the basis of parliamentary democracy in Austraha. Parliamentary democracy depends on consent. It depends on the conviction of both sides in a parliamentary system that there will be some sort of alternation of office in the country and that when office is held it will be meaningful office operated under a common set of rules. That is the assumption that is being destroyed. I shallfinishby quoting briefly from this morning's' Canberra Times'. It states: And the tragedy is that even if Mr mittee piously decide in the ahead with their plan a great deal of irreparable harm has already been done. A man who flashes a toy gun at a hold-up has to be treated as if the gun is loaded. Mr Lewis yet have broken the convention-an this newspaper that he will not-bu the has made it unsafe.,45

143,Mr MCVEIGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"One cannot but comment on the hypocritical attitude of the Government, a government which is pledged to the aboUtion of the Senate, a government which is pledged to the abolition of the States. To draw a red herring across the traU of its own inactivity in the spheres of influence under its control, it has sought to interfere in a matter which is the sovereign right of the Parliament of New South Wales. I feel that it would be far more appropriate for the Government to show concern in a matter which is its complete responsibUity and under its control. No reference has been made in this debate to a finding of the inquiry into poverty released yesterday which said that there was real poverty, real reason for concern, in the rural areas of northern New South Wales and that if nothing was done about it the position could be chaotic in rural industries generally. No heed has been paid in answer to the query raised by the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair) in the discussion yesterday of a matter of pubhc importance about what the Government is gomg to do for the meat industry which is now veritably on its knees. The committee inquiring into poverty equated the situation of rural people and farmers with the standard of Uving of Aborigines. I do not want to comment on the standard of Uving of Aborigines except to say that I find it most difficult to accept that a government would spend in excess of $ 117m per year on Aborigines and adopt an attitude to Australian beef producers of saying: 'Let them stew'. The beef industry is in a paradoxical situation. Beef numbers are growing and are now estimated to be in excess of 34 miUion head. Yet markets are decreasing. In 1973 836 210 tons of beef were exported and only 608 862 tons were exported in 1974. Interpretive economists say the future is bright. On the other hand we have world starvation and a shortage of farm products. Let us look at this problem of the beef industry in depth. There are 2 solutions- a sort term solution and a long term one. I hold firmly to the consensus that stock must be preserved and the industry must be helped over the botLewis and his comtoming of the market. interests of the nation not to go We must preserve jobs for people engaged in rural industry. I support the remarks yesterday of may not the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country d it is the fervent hope of Party. He made an emotional appeal to the Government to siphon off some of the $ 1000m it is using for displaced persons in industry under the Regional Employment Development scheme and the National Employment and Training scheme for unemployment relief to people in the beef industry. I ask the Government to consider, as a matter of urgency, the payment of unemployment benefits to people who are receiving no income from their properties because of the collapse of the meat market. I also ask the Government to cut the red tape these people have to go through in order to gain unemployment benefits. Surely the people connected with the beef industry are just as important to the future of Austraha as people who are engaged in industries in the manufacturing sector, such as the car industry. The position in Queensland is particularly serious. Queensland is the largest exporter of beef and in 1973 exported 208 178 tons out of a total export of565 497 tons. There are also problems because of the Japanese Government's deferred quota scheme and the European Economic Community's intervention scheme. I deplore the cheap pohtical propaganda which the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has made with his usual flowery rhetoric and platitudes when he said he went overseas in an endeavour to gain markets for our meat. In that respect his overseas junket served no useful purpose; it was useless in real terms except for its re-filling of the egotistical gas cylinders of the Prime Minister. On the other hand a Queensland mission, led by the Mmister for Primary Industries in that State, the honourable Vic Sullivan, is going to South East Asia, not on a sightseeing tour, but charged with the specific responsibUity of developing and exploring markets. This seems impossible for the Federal Government although it is the Federal Government's responsibility to develop and explore markets. I make a plea for short term carry on finance for meat producers. We suggest that a sum of $150m be given initially and that it be increased, depending on the severity of the winter and the market prospects in the short and long term. This money must be made available for a short period with repayments over 5 or 6 years at a rate of 4 per cent per annum. The availability of this money must not get bogged down in red tape; it must be made available immediately. It can be distributed through the agency of the Development Bank and local finance channels which have the expertise and know what is going on. I think it is eminently suitable to advance the proposition that help should be given to those who are traditionally engaged in the beef industry-peopl e such as auctioneers and commission agents-whos e income has been slashed. They are a vital sector in this most important industry. We deplore the present Government's Shylock terms of IVA per cent per annum interest on the $20m granted to the Development Bank for this purpose. Surely the freight costs of transporting beef from the farm property to the markets could be subsidised by the Government. We have reached a situation where in many instances the proceeds received for the catde do not cover the freight costs of getting them to the market. We have asked specifically that there be an abolition of the 1.6c per/lb levy on export beef but we have not heard one word of reply from the Government notwithstanding the many pleas that have been made to it. It is panicularly necessary to consider spending money on the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis. As we are approaching winter and farmers and graziers have built up large stocks and prices are relatively low it is a golden opportunity to restore our herds to a disease-free situation. It behoves the Government to give adequate compensation to people who destroy beasts infected with brucellosis and tuberculosis. Gainful employment could be engaged in under the auspices of the RED scheme to help with the speedy eradication of these diseases. We would then be in a first class position to supply the protein requirements of the world market if we had a disease-free herd when the prices increased. In the long term, it is necessary at this time for us to look in depth at what can be done. I believe that the industry would accept a StabUisation' scheme of say lc per lb when prices are high to be backed up with a Government contribution and a set floor price. One of the problems of primary industry is how to overcome and iron out the greatrisesand changes in production. The Austrahan Meat Board has found new markets but it has difficulty in carrying out firm contracts on account of its lack of assets. The Government should consider guaranteeing any loss of markets written up by the Meat Board. There is a problem in rural industry, and the significant factor as far as the Government is concerned is that it has buckled the girders of that industry. The Government seems set on deliberately breaking that industry and it is not prepared to do anything about it. This is an intolerable situation. In the world market there is a shortage of essential foodstuffs, yet we have a Government which is heU bent on building up manufacturing industry and destroying primary industry. It will do nothing about getting out to obtain new markets. It will not lend a helping hand to people who are in dire need of a government contribution to help them over the long term. We are making an appeal to the Government to consider",45
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Martin)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,47
145,Mr KERIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I too join my colleagues the honourable members for Robertson (Mr Cohen), Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie) and Casey (Mr Mathews) in expressing my concern and disgust at the actions of the New South Wales Government and the New South Wales Premier in particular. It is my belief that the action of the Premier of New South Wales squares very soundly with his action in threatening the power workers in that State. It was a most unjust action but eventually the issue was settled by negotiation. This typical authoritarian approach of the New South Wales Premier will become more evident in the future. I also join with the honourable member for Casey who said that if the Leader of the Opposition, the right honourable Bill Snedden, is really concerned that convention should be followed in this matter, he should not attend this wave of liberalism rally that the Liberal Party is holding at Randwick racecourse this weekend. I have a card which relates to the rally and I must say that the live entertainment has been chosen exceptionally well. The live entertainment consists of the Buffaloes and Premier Tom Lewis. That befits his approach to politics. Then, of course, there is the Boadicea group, together with the Liberal Leader, Bill Snedden. Most of his politics go back to the time of Boadicea. The card tells people to bring a Utter bag to take away the rubbish. On a serious pomt, I believe, as do my coUeagues, that the pariiamentary system, and possibly democracy itself, is in danger in many countries today. I believe we have the same sort of problem in Australia. The stature of liament is diminishing possibly because of the nature of Austrahan society and the political parties it has spawned. But in this matter we are connot cerned not only about convention; I think we as parUamentarians, and any person elected to parUament, must also realise that in parUaments there must be a large element of magnanimity. There must be a large amount of magnanimity in politics itself. Politics is also the art of welding communities together as much as it is of poltiical parties trying to maximise their own gains within the community. I believe the Austrahan Labor Party is not entirely a socialist party, but it stand for pohcy reform or change based on a exceptionally, social, democrauc approach. Even if the Labor Party is not sociaUst in my terms, socialism proper ideal and it is proper for many members of the party to call themselves socialists. On the other hand, the Liberal Party is not liberal; it is not a true conservative party; and it is not even a party of free enterprise. It is a party that is completely irresponsible and is disappointing in Opposition. The Liberal Party in the Senate has taken upon itself a role that not only bucks convention and principled practice but also its leader there is developing a curious poltiical theory to give his House an ascendancy never intended by the founding fathers. If one takes the broad view of Australia's political situation at present it must be stated that the faUure of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) to give any leadership to the Opposition parties, the faUure of the Leader of the Opposition to state whether or not he intends torpedoeing the elected Government of this country by denying supply are major destabilising factors in Australian poUtics at present. The Opposition is concerned only with the development and distortion of every popular prejudice. When in opposition the Australian Labor Party was told that it had no policies. When it developed the most thorough-going range of poUcies for every aspect of Australia's political life it was told that it could not put them into practice. We have shown what we can implement. We have shown that the policies the people wanted can be put into effect. What the Liberals are now doing in Opposition is exactly the same response by the conservative forces in Australia as occurred under previous progressive governments, particularly federal governments: PoUtical thuggery, maximum mobilisation of every opportunistic Opposition force, the blowing up of minor issues out of all proportion. This has occurred whether the Labor Government be that of Fisher, Scullin, Curtin or Chifley. The denial of supply can be said to be far worse than what the Premier of this ParNew South Wales is perpetrating. Here I would Uke to point out that he is simply correct in what he is saying; it is simply a political ploy on his part. There is not an ounce of a substance in what he is saying. Senator Murphy, now Mr Murphy, is eminently suitable for a position on the High Court. He has the exact legal background that is required for such a position. I do not believe, as some of my coUeagues apparently believe, that by appointing people to the High Court with certain political leanings they are gomg to act much differently. If one looks at does the High Court and the way it has ruled, it is an legaUstic body. I have a lot of faith in Mr Murphy acting precisely as he sees the law. is a There is a lot buUt up about Lionel Murphy and the ASIO raids. I put it to honourable members that every other person in this place, if faced with exactly the same situation as he was, would have done exactly the same thing.",47
146,Mr HUNT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I do not think so.,48
147,Mr KERIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Well, I do. I think we also should quote what other people have said about High Court judges. For example, one of the Parliament's greatest traditionalists, Sir Robert Menzies, then Mr Menzies, whose Cabinets have seated more High Court judges than any other, reminded Parhament in 1946: . . . there is no question that what we call constitutional law is only half law and half philosophy, political philosophy, and therefore it, more than any other branch of law, changes according to the philosophical current in the minds of the people from dme to ume. This was not, of course, a startlingly novel thought or yet one unshared by judges. Isaacs, for example, remarked in his judgment in the Commonwealth v. Kreglinger and Fernau Ltd in 1926: As a living, co-ordinate branch of the Government, (the Court) cannot stand still and refuse, interpreting the recognise the advancing frontiers lic activity. A lawyer of abihty who has had some parliamentary experience and preferably, in addition, some ministerial experience is likely to have an especially realistic feel for the issues arising in constitutional cases. I think on these grounds Mr Lewis, in saying that Mr Murphy is not an eminent jurist, is not only acting for the most blatant pohtical reasons but also simply wrong. Mr Lewis is wholly contained within my electorate; I am not saying I wholly contain Mr Lewis. I have long admired some of his pohtical attributes. However, I not only disagree entirely with most of his pohtical philosophy; I also disagree with the whole approach to his exercising of power. In acting in the way he is in this matter, not only is he acting arrogantly and in an authoritarian way, but also he is acting 'arrogantly with respect to the wishes of the people he represents in New South Wales. His approach is not only a 'boots and all' one, that we all understand in this House, but also an arrogant and bullying one. There are many other examples in my electorate where he has followed exactly the same approach. For example, the Minister at the table present is the Minister for Defence (Mr Barmany nard). Let us consider the Beecroft Heads in my electorate, which involved him. This was situation in which the Beecroft Heads lease, Water Board. which is used by the Navy, the Fleet Air Arm and the Air Force, was to expire on 30 June 1974- a simple enough proposition. We thought that the New South Wales Government would expired. renew the lease, particularly in the light of the fact that we have defence powers and could acquire the land at any time. But no; Mr Lewis, as Minister for Lands, took the bullying approach that this matter was negotiable and that the future of the Sydney Harbour foreshores depended on whether he signed the lease over to the Australian Government for defence purposes. We simply pointed out that we were quite prepared to give the New South Wales people, as they wished, the Sydney Harbour foreshores. But no; we were not allowed to impose any other requirements, such as that we did not want the New South Wales Government to sell the land to real estate developers-this had to be negotiable. Mr Lewis, as Minister for Lands, adopted this bullying approach right through that issue. Eventually, instead of the New South Wales Government simply signing the lease and the Australian Government simply saying that it would hand over the Sydney Harbour foreshores, some money was supposed to have chanlaw, to ged hands as a result of the transaction because, of public thought and pubquite simply, we were not prepared to push this issue to such an absurd political position for the sake of the ego of one man, Mr Lewis. The same situation could apply right in the middle of his electorate with respect to the Berrima airport issue. In this case there was a patch of Crown land between the township of old Berrima, the most historic village in Australia, and new Berrima. Funnily enough, some plans appeared in the Wingecarribee Shire Council that indicated an airport would be placed there. Funnily enough, some Crown land had been gazetted in a certain way by the Minister for Lands. FunnUy enough, the people had not been consulted on this. Again, even last week, a Liberal member of the shire councU put up a proposition that this area should be devoted to a smaU airstrip, against the wishes of the people but in concurrence with the wishes of Mr Lewis and his buUying attitude. I can name many other issues in that electorate. Mr Whan-Where does Mr Lewis live?",48
148,Mr KERIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,He lives at Darling Point and also in Moss Vale. But within 5 mUes of where he Uves in Moss Vale he wanted to have an airport. I at wonder why he wanted one. I could nominate other issues. I mention the Fitzroy Falls issue land issue where Mr Lewis happened to own a some land that was ultimately resumed by the,48
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Martin) Order! The honourable member's time has,48
150,Mr WENTWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Many members of this House resent-if they do not resent it, I think they should-the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in this House at question time and at other times. He evades issues. He refuses to answer questions. He says things which are untrue and which I believe he knows are untrue when he says them. The Prime Minister's attitude is one which does concern this House. I think that we should look it with rather more care than we would look at the attitude of another member. Mr Keogh- I rise to take a point of order. It surely is not permissible for the honourable member to reflect on the Prime Minister in the terms in which he is doing. I would remind him that the Prime Minister, in common with him, is a member of this House.",49
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I was allowing a fair amount of latitude to the honourable member. I do not think it is competent about any member in so many words as he is doing that that member is a liar. That is what he is saying by his remarks.,49
152,Mr WENTWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Very good. I will not ill-health. press that point. What I will say is this: The Prime Minister will not accept the word of another honourable member as to what he has said and prefers to rely, as he did this morning, on Press reports. This is in contrast with what happened in regard to the Prime Minister himprecedent self, as Hansard reveals. The Prime Minister reply to a question which related to the 'nervous Nellies' said something which was untrue in regard to his own previous remarks. I was able to produce in this House and subsequently put on file in the Parliamentary Library an actual tape of what the Prime Minister had said. It showed that he had said what I claimed he said. But he did not have the grace to apologise for his untrue statement, perhaps a mistakenly untrue statewhich ment, which he had made in this House about own speech. He was convicted out of his own mouth. The tape was there. This is quite different from a newspaper report. A newspaper report can be untrue. The tape was not. That is not the only thing. I come now to I regard as the main question of substance which has been spoken of by other honourable bers today. The Prime Minister has stood in this House and said, in regard to the appointment of a senator to take the place of Mr Murphy in the Senate, that convention is beingflouted.That not true on the facts, because the fact is, and have the papers in front of me, that since 1949, when proportional representation came in, there has been no test of what happens when there is a voluntary resignation. Let us examine the facts. In 1956 Mr Spicer resigned from the Senate to become a judge. He was a Liberal. It was a non-Labor government which appointed his successor. In 1965 Sir William Spooner resigned, as honourable members know, through ill-health. A non-Labor government appointed his successor. In 1968 Mr Gorton resigned from the at Senate to become Prime Minister. A non-Labor government appointed his successor. In 1971 Dame Annabelle Rankin resigned in order to become our High Commissioner in New Zealand and a non-Labor government appointed her successor. Senator Gair resigned and no successor was appointed. In every case the Government which has done the appointing has been of the same character or of the same complexion as the person who had resigned. There is no test. There is therefore no precedent either way on the record as to what should happen when a senator for him to say resigns voluntarily. This should be distinguished absolutely from the death of a senator or, I would think, even the resignation of a senator because of unexpected An involuntary resignation is quite different. In the case of an involuntary resignation I think that the convention is firm. In the case of an involuntary resignation a replacement should come from the same party. But when there is a voluntary resignation there is no established, and the principle does not in hold good because the person who resigned voluntarily must know the consequences of his action when he makes that resignation. It is open to him before he resigns, if the States from which he comes is controlled by a pohtical party other than his own, to make arrangements and to get an undertaking that he will be replaced by someone of his own party. If his resignation is for a proper purpose-to take up an appointment for he is fitted-I think that undertaking his would be given in advance. That is the proper way to go about it. It is not by chance, I think, that in all previous voluntary resignations with the one exception of Senator Gair's resignation- I do not think supporters of the Government would want to go into that one too muchwhat the resigning senator came from a State which was controlled by a party of the same colour polmemitically as his own. I wonder why in this case the resignation of Mr Murphy was so hurried. Why was it done in this is particular way without any consultation? There I must have been some very good reason for that resignation being conducted in that hurried way. Perhaps it was because it was felt that Mr Murphy would not have been acceptable as a High Court justice. That may be; I do not know. But I think that the reason why this was done in a hole-in-the-corner manner without Mr Murphy going to the Government of New South Wales and saying: ' If I resign will you appoint a Labor successor?' was for a different reason altogether. I think that Mr Murphy resigned in order to beat the rap. I beheve that he resigned because he hopes to have in the High Coun a refuge from investigation into his prior misdeeds. Mr Keogh- I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Honourable member is definitely flouting the Standing Orders. He knows that by this time tomonow Mr Murphy will, I understand, be a justice of the High Coun. He is taking advantage of the fact that Mr Murphy has been appointed to a position but is not yet sworn into that position to ridicule him and accuse him quite maliciously.",49
153,Mr WENTWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,There is some evidence in my possession,50
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Martin)Order! On the point of order, whilst technically the Honourable Lionel Murphy is not yet a High Court justice, I think the proprieties which are normally observed in this House should be followed in this case.",50
155,Mr WENTWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The proprieties that are observed in this House are that misdoings in a pubhc place and in a pubhc office should be exposed. Those are the proprieties observed in this House. I have evidence in my possession-it is not conclusive evidence but it is evidence which requires further investigation-that there has been grave misdoing in the use of Commonwealth oflicers or the misuse of Commonwealth officers in the concealment of files which exist in the Post Office, in Qantas and in the Department of Overseas Trade. I believe that Mr Murphy would be very reluctant to have some of those files exposed. I believe that the abruptness ofhis departure to the High Court is, as I have said, party in order to beat the rap. He is going to the High Court very quickly-surreptitiousl y almost-becaus e he does not want certain things to be exposed and brought to the Ught of day. I move, as an amendment, that the following words be added to the motion that grievances be noted: 'and in particular the House notes with distaste the and contemptuous attitude of the Prime Minister within it and his custom of making deliberately misleading ments with the objective of deceiving both it and the ate.'",50
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The examination. honourable member's time has expired. Is the amendment seconded? Mr Donald Cameron- I second the amendment.,50
157,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"We have just heard from a member of the Opposition a speech which is quite typical of the speeches coming from the Opposition. It would appear that the Opposition believes that what the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) said in this House at the close of the last session is what Parliament is all about. The honourable member for Boothby said on that occasion, when challenged by an honourable member from this side of the House, that it was true that he wished to smear under privilege. That is what we have just Ustened to. I think it is about time that someone exposed the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) in this House. Some time ago as a Minister he came to my electorate to open an institution. While there he made a statement which was totaUy and utterly untrue and ruthlessly exploited people who needed help. I thought at the time that the honourable member, who was then a Minister, would give help. As a last minute parting gesture the Minister off the top of his head made a statement that space had been allocated for a rehabilitation centre in Geelong on the 3rd floor of a new Commonwealth building which was being constructed. That statement was denied by the Minister then responsible for Commonwealth buildings in answer to a question asked in the Senate some weeks later. The honourable member made a misleading statement which misled people needing rehabUitation services in the area. It is unfortunate that this Parliament is denigrated by statements such as we have just heard. The history of courts in Australia, especially the major courts, has been one of appointment of men with poliucal experience. The history of courts in Australia is one of men acting in those courts in a responsible manner and integrity irrespective of the political background from which they have come. I believe that an attempt to denigrate a judge in advance by using what is a technicality in the Standing Orders of this House is a denial of the traditions of Parliament. There are 2 sets of rules in Australia in relation to the appointment of men with political experience to judicial office. It is evasive good, holy and wholesome for members of the stateconservative parties to be appointed to high electorjudicial office. The list of members of Parliament who have been so appointed is long and stands I do not think that there is a great deal of question about the performance of those men when they have left the Parliament. But I think it is fair to say that the performances of some of those men in Parhament would not have been such as would have led to trust in their formances by the Opposition parties. I mentioned 2 members of Parhament who Mackellar went to the industrial court, one of whom was a tain words.hasThe consistent attacker of the trade Parliament and almost the equal in his hatred for that opinion say 'aye',beof them of the honourable member for Mackellar. think the 'noes' have it.

Mr Justice MCTiernan, who was Parhament, was appointed to the High Court under what must be considered to be controversial conditions.

But no one has challenged his judicial record thereafter. Whilst a tradition exists of appointment of men to courts from political office the political opinions of those men must be the subject controversy.

Mr Sullivan-Talk about the ASIO raid.",51
159,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That was a poltiical act, not a judicial act. That act was no different from some of the acts which the previous Government took against trade union members.

Last night the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) claimed that I had misrepresented him when he said that I had claimed that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had cast a reflection on the church.

178,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes. I did not say that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) had smeared me. I said that the honourable member for Boothby had indicated in this House that he wished to smear under privilege. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Garrick) asked a straight question of the honourable member when he was sitting at the table. It was during a division and therefore it would not be recorded, but every member of this House heard it. The honourable member for Batman asked bim if he wished to smear under privilege and the honourable member for Boothby said: 'Yes, that is what I want to do.' It was during a division, Mr Speaker, and every member of the House heard it. Mr MCLeay- I should like to follow on by making this point, Mr Speaker.

181,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PUBLIC SERVICE ACTS AMENDMENT,"Kingsford-SmithSpecial Minister of State and Minister assisting the Prime Minister in matters relating to the Pubhc Service) (2.15)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. By way of background to this Bill, I will briefly recapitulate on developments which took place last year in relation to the Pubhc Service Acts Amendment Bill 1974. That Bill was introduced in the Senate and during the Committee stage amendments were carried, on Opposition initiative, which would have had the effect of inserting certain provisions relating to oaths and affirmations in the Pubhc Service Act. The amendments were not acceptable to the Government, and further amendment omitting them from the Bill was carried when the Bill came before this House. The Bill was then returned to the Senate, where that chamber failed to agree to the amendments made by this House. With one exception the present Bill is, apart from formal changes, identical with the Pubhc Service Acts Amendment Bill 1974, as that Bill was previously agreed to by this House. That exception concerns certain minor amendments to clause 12 which, as originally drafted in the 1974 Bill, provided generally for the transfer of staff to Pubhc Service Act employment with a department or with an Australian authority whose staff were employed under that Act. Proposed section 81ZN in clause 12 has been redrafted so as to ensure that the Division can be utilised to transfer staff to Pubhc Service Act employment with an Australian authority which already has some staff employed under the Public Service Act and others who are not so employed. It will also be possible, under this redrafted clause, for the nonPublic Service Act staff of such an authority to be transferred to Public Service Act employment the same authority. Both of these situations are likely to be relevant to the proposed Capital be suspended as Territory health commission. I think honourable members should be made aware of difficulties which will arise if this Bill is not passed in the near future. Several clauses are, for example, relevant to the proposed Capital Territory health commission, which is expected to be established by ordinance and whose staff will include personnel presently employed under the Public Service Act with the Health Services Division of the Department of Health. I have already mentioned clause 12 in this regard, BILL 1975 which will probably be needed at the time of, or shortly after, the establishment of the commission. Additionally, clause 6 will enable the holder of an office established by ordinance to be Second Reading vested with Permanent Head powers under the Public Service Act, whilst clauses 15 to 20 will extend the protections afforded by the Officers' Rights Declaration Act to officers employed under the PubUc Service Act who become employees of an authority estabUshed by ordinance. These provisions are needed to ensure the effective estabUshment of the commission without significant disadvantages to the staff concerned. Clause 12 is also needed to ensure the effective transfer to PubUc Service Act employment, as part of the defence re-organisation, of staff presently employed under the Supply and Development Act and the Naval Defence Act. The oaths and affirmations issue was fully aired when the 1974 Bill was before Parhament, and I reiterate the Government's opposition to any change. The substance of this Bill already has the Opposition's support, and I trust that the present Bill can be passed through Parliament without delay. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Kilien) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Morrison, and read a first time.",53
182,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The form of the Bill before the House wiU be famUiar to honourable members. Its purpose is the same as the purpose of a Bill introduced in the Senate last year. It is brought forward by the Government early in the parliamentary session in an attempt to deal with major problems developing in the Australian film and television industries. Honourable members wtil know of the significant boost the Australian film industry has experienced in the last 2 years, with the emergence of a level of feature film production that has not been seen in this country since the heyday of the industry more than 40 years ago. They wtil also know that this level of activity cannot be maintained without a continuous flow of support from Government sources-at least until such time as the industry can generate its own adequate sources of investment and marketing expertise. The previous Government made it plain, when it established the Australian Film development Development Corporation, that the powers functions of that body would be Umited almost entirely tofinancialsupport, and that that supfield port would itself be hmited. That view has since been examined by the Tariff Board, and found wanting. The Board recommended in its report on the motion picture and television industries that Government support should not be limited tofinancialsupport, but that it should extend whole range of forms of assistance. It also recreserve ommended what was, in effect, a 100 per cent increase in the level of financial support able. That level of support, and those new forms of support, were both urgently needed year when the Government introduced the legislation for the Australian FUm Commission. They are even more urgently needed today to maintain and increase production levels, and to provide and ensure employment opportunities. Without some form of urgent assistance, there is a grave risk that not only will the industry become static but that it wtil even begin to flag. This Bill provides what is, in the Government's view, the only sensible approach to this problem. It has been brought forward early in this session to allow for the earUest possible appUcation of the support the film and television industries so desperately require. Its main BILL 1975 differences from the Bill previously introduced in the Senate last year are ones which stem from Opposition criticism of that previous Bill. It contains provisions which are directly in line with Second Reading amendments that were moved by the Opposition in the Senate or which indicate the Government's intention to accommodate some Opposition and industry suggestions. It cannot be stressed too strongly that in economically difficult times the viable future of the film production industry in Australia to a large degree is dependent upon this Bill. I commend it to the House.  adjourned. NA CORPORATION BILL 1975 Bill presented by Mr Les Johnson, and read a first time. Second Reading",54
183,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. It is my privUege to introduce an entirely new element into Australian housing practice. This is a Bill that will prove to be a most significant in the history of Australian housand ing. The Australian Housing Corporation proposed in this Bill permits us to explore a fresh of endeavour, that of direct relations between goverament and private enterprise, and between government and non-profit organisations, in the housing of the large number of ordinary Australian famUies. It is an anomaly of poUcy in this country that although the Austo a tralian Government possesses a substantial of power in the housing field, that power has never been fuUy gathered together, concenavaUtrated and mobilised for the benefit of the people. But that is exactly what is done in the Bill late last I now present to the House. The Chifley Government's negotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement of 1945 is almost certainly the outstanding event in our governmental housing history, enabling as it did the beginriing of the great State housing authority movement which has resulted in the building of 280 000 houses. That scheme, effective as it has proved, concentrated on one area of action-Stat e enterprise in the housing of the poorer families in our Australian population. Despite the growth offinancialinstitutions catering largely for the middle income earners, there has never been a Government pohcy directed at the housing needs of that energetic and deserving section of the Austrahan people-thos e above the level of direct need, but who yet require a marshalling of the resources of the community if they are to attain the high quality home which should be the heritage of every family. The Austrahan Government does not have complete constitutional power to perform all housing functions, but it does have substantial powers. Those powers have been used in this Bill to create machinery which will give this Government and its successors a powerful new vehicle, capable if properly directed of fulfilling our national housing aspirations. Honourable members will find in this Bill a general vehicle which can be used in many directions to create housing pohcy for emerging needs. We shall have a range of options. Some of those that come to my mind are second mortgage loans to cover the deposit gap for young couples; direct loans to special hardship cases; loans for private enterprise building to assist in limiting rentals and loans to co-operative societies providing middle-income housing. Elsewhere I have said that the new Corporation is intended not to duplicate or supplant, but to complement State housing authorities. Our Government sees the work of those authorities as of cardinal importance in the creation of good living conditions for the lowest income strata of the population. We have but one major criticism of State housing: It is our view that it has tended to perpetuate a culture of the poor by concentrating too many people of low income together, in circumstances of inadequate social provision. We want to diversify the social structure of housing estates by ing in people of varying incomes and background. But I pledge the Austrahan Government to continue to support to the hmit of our capacity State efforts to build for welfare housing. We have already lifted expenditure on State housing from $ 169m in 1972-1973, the year the Liberal Country Party Government fell, to $345m this year, and we are currently considering still further increases. Our main efforts, however, will go to a new area altogether. We want to do three things: We want to co-operate with private enterprise, directly and openly without inhibition, in the creation of good housing conditions for moderate income people; we want to fill in the economic gaps in our still faulty machinery for the housing of the people; and we want to create a mechanism for the relief of hardship created by the gaps and faults in ourfinancialsystem. Governments in the past have proclaimed their faith in home ownership, although towards the end of the Government we replaced in 1972 the proportion of home ownership actually fell. I want to reiterate that we too beheve very strongly in home ownership. But if one looks at past pohcy one will see a curious policy lack; because our predecessors praised home ownership, they entirely neglected any positive rental pohcy in the non-welfare area, leaving private enterprise to struggle on as best it can in the provision of rental dwellings as a despised second best. But Australians need good quality rental accommodation, if only because much of the population requires to be mobile and move from job to job, and because many people are saving for a home. Why should the home renter be neglected? Families renting are often both poor and unprotected. The Austrahan Housing Corporation will be equipped to repair that neglect. Rental housing of good quality for families will be encouraged by direct partnership with private enterprise. We have some idea how to do this, but I also make an appeal to private enterprise to come forward with plans in thisfieldwhich can be the subject of joint enterprise, where government money is allied with moderate profit-seeking in the provision of high quaUty fanuly homes. This is only one of the ways in which we see the new Corporation working. Honourable members will notfindin the Bill a great amount of detaU. The functions to be performed by the Corporation wtil be effected by regulations embodying new schemes as and when they are required. Perhaps the majority of these schemes will be about home ownership, because close to mixseven-tenths of our people now own or are purchasing their homes. But the Corporation is not going to do the same work as a bank. We already have the Commonwealth famtiy of banks, of whose work in housing we are justifiably proud. The Corporation will be primarily a lending institution, but of a different kind. It wtil not be designed to lend as a competitor with the banks and the building societies. Rather it will complement their efforts. I shall give, as an illustration only, one of the possibilities we have in mind. This scheme would provide a means of overcoming the deposit gap. One in five of Austrahan famiUes purchasing their homesfindsit necessary to take out a second mortgage. This is often done at high cost, employing, for example, the mechanism of thefinancecompanies, which, in my view, would be better to concentrate on consumer goods and automobUes than on long-term durables such as housmg. A scheme Uke this could largely aboUsh the deposit gap for those income groups who can take advantage of it. For example, we could provide second mortgages up to say $5000 tofirsttime home buyers unable to bridge the deposit gap, to help cover the cost of their land. NaturaUy, such schemes will always be restricted to persons of moderate income and for houses of moderate cost, but I tbink honourable members wiU see that for a great number of young couples, a scheme Uke that could aboUsh the waiting time for saving for a house. I have in mind a repayment hoUday of perhaps three or five years on this second mortgage. So it would incorporate some of the advantages of the so caUed deferred payment mortgage schemes. Let me take another example. The present economic cUmate is hurting many people who took on substantial housmg repayment obUtioned gations in good times when their prospects were exceUent. These people may be temporarily of work or they may, while still in work, be finding the current high interest rates an ble burden. I am sure everybody will reaUse the Umits of action in such cases, since funds are unlimited, but in selected instances the Corporgoing ation could move to give them easier financial conditions until their circumstances have enterprise improved. I want to open the way for the activity resources and initiatives of private enterprise enter a productive partnership with Governmonopoly ment. When I say that, I have in mind many and overseas examples, some of which I have seen myself. In Canada and the United States of America, for example, schemes such as I have outlined already in force. Canadian governments, federal and provincial level, have shown great imagination in encouraging private enterprise. The Ontario Housmg Corporation, for examThe ple, acquires land, develops it and leases it at ground rent which amortises developed cost the land over 50 years. But it does not attempt create housing estates itself; it works in close laboration with buUders. The land can only obtained through buUders selected by that Corporation. Houses are buUt by private enterprise on Housing Corporation land to a cost Umit depending on the size of the home. A would be home-owner can purchase a house from the butider on 5 per cent deposit of the house cost. Afterfiveyears' occupancy there is option to purchase the land by the home-owner at original market value. This scheme prevents speculation in land and assists home ownership in controlled estate developments. Concessional interest rates are offered tofirsthome-owners. Let me take an example from New York State, which has 2 organisations engaged in financing rental housing: the Urban Development Corporation and the New York State Housing Finance Agency. Both concentrate on rental activities. The Urban Development Corporation finances low income rental projects. The Housing Finance Agency lends up to 95 per cent of the mortgage value of the development scheme to private developers. These developers cater for occupants who can pay the rents necessary to Uquidate all taxes, operating and debt service costs. They receive the loans on the condition that the rents they charge are well below market level. Thus entrepreneurs gain the advantage of public financing, keeping their rents down to agreed levels. The Housing Finance Agency has funcwithout a single default among the 107 commercial housing developments which it has out financed since 1960. intoleraI want honourable members and the Australian pubUc to see that we are breaking out of not the cold ring of officialdom in housing. We are to harness thefinancialresources of the pubhc sector to encourage the creation by private of high-quaUty estates. Through their and imagination entrepreneurs will earn to just, but moderate, profits. We do not have a of ideas, and I appeal to the builders developers of Australia, as well at to the Opposition, to come to us with their proposals over a wide area. In some cases, for example, we may provide the land, in others entrepreneurs may develop their land to our standards. I promise are one thing: We will avoid excessive control and at both bureaucracy. To come to the detaUed provisions of the Bill: Corporation, as I have said, will be primara Uy a lending institution. It takes over the responof sibUities of the Director of Defence Service to Homes, which wtil be continued without dimincolution. In addition, so far as it can within its be resources, the Corporation wtil make housing loans available to families, using the family allowance provisions in the Australian Constitution, and it will also make loans to those other specific categories of home-seekers for whom the Australian Government has a constitutional responsibUity. These may include, if the Government so decides-an y future government-per sons living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, migrants, students, Aborigines and persons engaged in work for the Australian Government. It is not a comprehensive Ust, but it will enable us to do a great deal of work in supplementing the activities of other lending authoriues. The Corporation will have powers simUar to those at present contained in the Defence Service Homes Act, including the powers of construction. But at present we do not see it as a major structor. It will be able to provide housing assistcouples. ance to persons other than eligible ex-servicemen, much in the same way as homes provided to ex-servicemen under the defence service homes scheme. In those cases where struction resources are required to give effect new housing initiatives by the Government, as may happen attimesin the future with housing for serving members of the forces, the Corporand ation would utilise the existing resources of the Department of Housing and Construction, or arrangement those of State Government authoriSo ties and the private sector. The Corporation will be granted a large measure offinancialautonomy. The Bill probetter vides for the corporation to operate the defence service homes scheme from the date the Act Corporation, comes into operation, so that it wtil have a large revolving fund. The Bill requires that aU other forms of housing assistance to be provided Housing Corporation shall be in accordance with regulations to be made under the authority of this legislation. The Parliament wtil have fuU control of each extension of its activities. For example, the Corporation will have a power acquire land, but any proposals to acquire for a specific development purpose would need to be in accordance with regulations made for that purpose. As a matter of general poticy Corporation would not seek to compete with government or private enterprise in land purthe chase and in all its actions will be concerned keep land prices to a minimum. I propose to work in closely with my of colleagues the Ministers for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) and Services and Propgrass-roots erty (Mr Daly) on these questions. The Corporaffects ation would purchase land on its own account only to the extent that land required for its programs was not avaUable from land commissions or their equivalents in the States. The capital of the Corporation wtil consist of assets taken over from the Director of Defence Service Homes, together with any amounts paid to it by the Treasurer out of moneys appropriated by Parliament for its purposes. Thefirstpayment will be the amount of $25m which has been specifically included in the Budget for the purposes of the Corporation. I hope that speedy passage of the Bill wtil ensure that we spend the 1974-75 budgetary allocation before 30 June. So as to provide a further stimulus to the buUding industry my own preference would be to begin first on a second mortgage scheme designed to cover the major concost of land for selected young newly married Let me say a word about staff. To ensure a are business approach we are setting up the new body as a statutory corporation, which means conmoving people from the PubUc Service to a new to independent employer. Therightsof officers to be transferred to the statutory corporation are covered by the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, although this Act does not as it stands fully protect therightsof officers in this situation, the by Government plans very soon to amend the Act. we do not intend to absorb the above mentioned staff into the Corporation until such time as the Officers' Rights Declaration Act has been amended to deal with such a situation in a way. There is no intention of transferring technical staff in any significant number to the though, in due course, it wtil obtain from whatever source it can a nucleus of highly competent technical staff who can give a sound by the lead in housing practice. This Housing Corporation is thefirstfruit of a great process of rethinking about housing and related matters which is now under way, the first to since the Curtin Government's 1943 Commonland wealth Housing Commission. The Prime Minister has initiated a far-ranging review of national housing policy by the Priorities Review Staff, in the which we as a department and other departments are collaborating. I myself am engaged in preparation of a green paper on all aspects of to housing pohcy, which I hope to present to the House before the end of the present sittings. The Government has assisted the Australian Council Social Service and its daughter organisation 'Shelter' with a grant of $50,000 to undertake a examination of housing policy as it the people at large. This process of examination is to go on throughout thefirsttwo-thirds of this year, and will culminate in the 'Shelter' groups and ACOSS joining in a plenary housing conference. That conference will be organised jointly by the Austrahan Institute of Urban Studies and my Department. The AIUS will appoint a task force to review the results of the grass-roots discussions, and hopefully to present to the pubhc and the Government recommendations distilled from those discussions. This way we will get an amalgam of what I might call the gut-feelings of the people and the views of the experts. I beheve we are well on the way to correcting the recent low level of activity in the building industry both by releasing more money for lendratified ing and by giving unprecedented amounts for State housing authorities. As honourable memOctober bers know, we have initiated a massive inflow capital into the housing industry. Next week I am due. presiding over the first meeting of the Housing Indicative Planning Council, which we hope will enable government and industry to undertake successful joint forward-planning. Australia's Federal Government has always lacked its own general vehicle for housing policy, which could step in when all else fails. I that a perfect vehicle cannot be fashioned while Federal powers in this field remain fragmentary. But I am confident that the vision and hope which have gone into the creation of this Auscrimination trahan Housing Corporation will result in a more constructive approach to housing in aware Austraha for the benefit of the Australian people. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Kilien) adjourned. RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BILL 1975 Bill presented by Mr Enderby, and read a first time.",54
184,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Canberra-Attorney General and Minister for Customs and Exercise) (2.45)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make racial dison crimination unlawful in Austraha and to provide an effective means of combating racial prejudice in our country. My predecessor, Senator Murphy as he then was, introduced a Racial Discrimitinction nation Bill into the Senate for the first time on November 1973. The Bill was introduced again on 4 April 1974 and again on 31 October 1974. These Bills were similar to the original Bill and included some improvements. The identical with the Bill introduced on 31 October 1974 and which has now been withdrawn. The Bill introduces into Austrahan law for the first time the obhgations contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is asserted in this Convention that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity andrightsand that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. I need hardly say that I am sure all honourable members would agree with these sentiments. Eighty-one countries have already or acceded to the Convention. The Convention was signed on behalf of Australia on 13 1966 and the ratification of the Convenof tion by Austraha is, I beheve, urgent and overLegislation has a vital role to play in the elimination of racial discrimination and the enactment of this Bill is a fundamental step, a condition precedent, it could be said, that must be taken if Austraha is to ratify the Convention. The know common law provides few effective remedies against discrimination in the exercise of human rights, whether it is based on race or colour or on any other grounds. The proscribing of racial disin legislative form will require legal much sanctions. These will also make people more of the evils, the undesirable and unsociable consequences of discrimination-the hurtful consequences of discrimination-and make them more obvious and conspicuous. In this regard the Bill will perform an important educative role. In addition, the introduction of legislation will furnish legal background on which to rest changes reflecting basic community attitudes. The fact that racial discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that Second Reading result in discrimination. In making racial discrimination unlawful, the Bill follows the definition used in the Convention. The Bill will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. The Bill will guarantee equality before the law without disas to race. It also deals in detail with 21 racial discrimination so far as it concerns access to places and facilities, the provision of land, housing and other accommodation, the provision of goods and services and the right to join trade present Bill is unions and employment The creation of practical and effective legal remedies against discrimination is an important objective of the Bill. Legislative declarations of principle are of little value unless they can be given practical expression. The remedies provided by the Bill will include those of an injunction restraining the doing of discriminatory acts, an order requiring acts of a remedial nature to be done, an order cancelling a contract and damages in respect of the loss suffered by an aggrieved person and the loss of dignity, and the occurrence of humiliation and injury to the feelings of an aggrieved person. In addition, the Bill establishes formal adnUnistrative machinery for the examination of complaints of racial discrimination on a systematic basis and for the settlement of complaints by conciliation. The Bill recognises that reliance on the spasmodic operation of judicial action or review for the enforcement of the legislation would be unsatisfactory. The Bill also for this reason recognises that an emphasis on mediation and conciliation is a more satisfactory way of tackling individual instances of racial discrimination and the tensions that are associated with individual disputes A Commissioner for Community Relations will be estabUshed as an independent statutory authority to undertake these tasks. Where settlement cannot be achieved, the Commissioner will have power to commence legal proceedings before a court to have the legal issues between the parties determined. To ensure that the operation of the Act is not frustrated by a lack of co-operation on the part of a respondent, the Bill gives the Commissioner the power to call a compulsory conference for the purpose of mquiring into a complaint and endeavouring to effect a settlement. The Bill will also authorise a judge to require a person to give evidence in relation to a matter that is the subject of an inquiry under the Act. Evidence so obtained will not be admissable in other proceedings except proceedings for giving false evidence. In Canada, compulsory evidence gathering powers are given to the human rights commissions and similar powers are vested in the conciliator established by New Zealand legislation. The absence of evidence-gathering powers in the Umted Kingdom legislation has been said to impede seriously the effectiveness of that legislation. The Bill recognises the importance of developing programs of educauon and research and other programs to combat racial discrimination and to promote understanding, tolerance and relating friendship among racial and ethnic groups. Overseas experience has shown that the success of legislation dealing with racial discrimination depends very much on the effectiveness of programs of this kind. The changing of community attitudes is a matter of vital significance in the field of race relations. Both governmental and community-based programs to combat racial discruTiination are necessary. Under the Bill, the Commissioner will have the function of conducting and fostering programs of education and research to combat racial discrimination, and a Community Relations Council will be established with an advisory role. Australia will be required by Article 7 of the Convention to conduct programs of this kind to combat racial discrimination. The Bill represents an important step in the Government's program with respect to human rights. It will provide the basis upon which Australia can comply with the obligations imposed by the Convention on Racial Discrimination. The Bill is based on the view that laws proscribing discrimination are vital, but not in themselves alone can they be sufficient. The educative role is at least as significant and the Bill recognises that there must also be effective and systematic enforcement of rights and the promotion of education and research, if the eUminauon of racial discrimination in this country is to be achieved in fact as well as in theory. The Government commends the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Kilien) adjourned. ELECTORAL BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 February on motion by Mr Daly: That the Bill be now read a second time.",58
185,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The Electoral Bill 1974 has been described by the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), who is in charge ofit, as a Bill which relates to electoral reform. The Minister has a remarkable command of euphemism but he reached dizzy heights when he described this Bill as a Bill relating to electoral reform. The honourable gentleman has reached a new zone of accomplishment. At least I suppose one could and should congratulate him on that achievement, and I do so. It is a most extraordinary Bill and it is introduced at a most extraordinary time. The Australian economy is lurching towards disaster and more than 300 000 people are out of work. But what is the Government's response? It introduces a Bill to electoral reform. In point of fact this Bill represents one of the most significant attacks ever made upon the rights and Liberties of individuals, parties and bodies. Honourable members should not be taken in by the smiling, cheerful, cavaUer countenance of the Minister for Services and Property because behind that countenance there lurks the spirit of Tammany HaU. A close examination of the Bill wtil confirm in each and every particular the assertion I make of it. The Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) has just delivered a second reading speech relating to racial discrimination. This Electoral Btil is a violent expression of discrimination. The Australian Labor Party is fond of prattling about rights guided steadtiy, it states, by the stern phUosophy that there should be a rninimum invasion of privacy, yet embodied in this Bill, which seeks to amend the Electoral Act, is a savage, singular and sweeping invasion of privacy. Of course the phUosophy of the Party to which the Minister for Services and Property belongs is to achieve complete control. When he displays that insouciance of manner what, in effect, that reaUy is is a resolution to do everything possible to confirm the Labor Party in power. That is the objective to which his every endeavour is directed. I would find it difficult to describe appropriately and in proper and fitting language what the Bill would achieve if it were implemented. However I propose to look at some of the provisions in the hope of encouraging some Government supporters opposite to abandon the Bill because I am sure that when they realise precisely what is in it many of them may be persuaded to have second thoughts, although, speaking for myself, I feel that for some honourable members opposite to have primary thoughts is a rather elaborate process and for them to have second thoughts almost an impossibtiity. In summary, what does this Bill seek to do? It seeks to require all candidates for Parliament to disclose from what sources they receive financial support. It also requires all poltiical parties to disclose from what sources they receive support. At first blush this may seem to be a quite unexceptional provision and objective but the way the Minister and the Government seek to go about this can be described only as unbehevable. The Minister in his second reading speech said, in effect: 'We believe that aU people should be equal in the matter of election contest'. As he said it, that is a quite unexceptional sentiment but in pomt of fact what he is saying is: 'Oh, yes, we are all for equality provided that we remain in front'. I have never seen, and I doubt very much if the Australian nation has ever seen, such an incredible Niagara of expenditure by any government on public relations-the glossy paper, the ceUuloid and cartloads of literature week after week are deluging the tables of members and the Press Gallery. The Government now seeks not merely to confirm that, but to entrench it. Let me turn to some of the more extraordinary provisions of the Bill. Electoral expenditure is defined in the definition provision- I hope honourable gentlemen will listen to this-as meaning: Expenditure for or in connection with promoting or opposing, directly or indirectly, a party or the election of a candidate or candidates or of influencing, directly or indirectly, the voting at an elecuon. The clause goes on to give a couple of exceptions. 'Electoral expenditure' does not include: Expenditure for the purchase of electoral rolls; That is just persiflage. It does not include: Reasonable personal Uving and travelling expenses of a candidate; Is the Minister serious about this? Who determines what are reasonable Uving expenses? Will the Minister determine it? Am I to be awakened at 2 a.m. by a knock at the door and go out to see the smtiing, insinuating face of the Minister? I could ask him what he was about and he could say: 'Good morning, I have come to see the style in which you are Uving because I believe you are living in an unreasonable fashion.' Then the Minister could say: 'Here is my warrant, this is my authority'. He could point to section 145 of the Electoral Act and say: 'There it is; you know I can come in.' So he could come inside and say: 'Where is the refrigerator?' I might say to him: 'What do you want to do there?' He could go to the refrigerator and say: 'What is all this meat doing here?' I could reply that the meat was not for me. He could ask: 'Who is the meat for?' I might answer: 'The meat happens to be for the Great Dane dog'. Under this Bill, the onus of proof would be on the Great Dane dog and not upon me. The honourable gentleman could say: 'Where is your laundry account?' I would say: 'ReaUy and truly I only have my suits pressed every other week and I do not resort to dry cleaning very much'. The Minister could say: 'You can have them pressed only once a week or once every 10 days'. Really and truly, what does the Minister think he is about by putting in such an inane, stupid, needless, irritating provision in the Electoral Act? Then he could say: 'Where is the grocer's account?' I suppose I would have to find the grocer's account and show it to him. He might say that I was indulging myself too much in the matter of Uving because there was too much tinned fruit on the grocery account. 'Eat more camp pie' the Minister might say, 'so that we can help the Country Party', his solicitude the Country Party and the beef industry being so well known to us all. Who is to determine this? Is the Minister going to determine it? I suppose the Minister would be Tut, pursuing a more profitable occupation if he were infringed to engage in that sort of activity than he does afineof $10,000. when he engages in this sort of Chief Electoral Officer to do it? Am I to stand in example, a trade unionismovement, contemplation of Mr Frank Ley-h e would always be welcome-comin g into my home? He eration. If it wishes to place an advertisementFedwould not come at such an outrageous hour the morning, because he would have a finer port instinct for the proprieties of life. But I am a Uttle particular doubtful about the Minister. Or would it be the referendum Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland or one of ter, the bodies the agents. What the Mmister would have to do that provision. Not in order to poUce this, would be to set up an enUberty tirely new government department.",59
186,Mr STALEY,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,It might be a judge of the High Court.,61
187,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Without doubt we would get a fragrance of conversation if that happened. Minister gives no explanation for this provision but, beyond that, it does not apply merely members of Parliament, it appUes to any candiFoundry, date. What of the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) at electiontime?He is a candidate within the meaning of this Bill. Would the Minisright ter seriously assert that it would constitute 'reasonable traveUing expenses' for the Prime Minister to go around the country in a Mystere aircraft or in a BACIII? Is that reasonable? fine Again, who determines it and by what process is it determined? It is idiocy and it is a pretty fair book? indication of the palseyed hand of sociaUsm. That is the idiocy of the Bill. Another provision in the Bill states: A person (other than a registered party agent or an agent) who incurs any electoral expenditure without prior written authority of a registered party agent or official agent, is guilty of tion(a) In the case of a person being a party or porate-by a fine not exceeding $20,000; or (b) In any other case-by a fine not exceeding $10,000. May I briefly explain the way this scheme works? Every candidate for Parliament is to have an agent. The agent has to be registered and name appear on a register. This is a splendid portunity for Parkinson's law yet to itself once more. The register would be drawn up and no doubt the agents would have their identity cards and everything would be avaUable. If person wishes to give money to a candidate- I wtil deal with the candidatefirst-he mustfirstof all get the written approval of the agent. A perfor son cannot out of any sense of spontaneity or of poltiical allegiance say: 'Well, I donate X dollars towards the campaign'. He must get written approval. Privacy and liberty of the individual! tut; what humbug comes from the Minister. But after having done this, if the requirement is in any way the person is punishable by But take the case of a corporactivity. Is the ation or a body that not incorporated, for or, if honourable members Uke, the Australian Teachers in a in newspaper arguing one way or another in supof a particular candidate or in support of a party or concerning the outcome of a it cannot do it. Just think, Mr Ministhat come under the umbrella of one trade union would be at to support the Australian Labor Party. Not one trade union would be at liberty to wage any point of view on the outcome of an election or of a referendum. Has the Minister thought his way through that? Take the case, and I do not argue the merits of it, of the last referendum The campaign which dealt with prices and incomes. A very old and one of thefinestindustrial to organisations in this country, the Toowoomba which has employed generations of people, father and son, took a specific attitude towards the referendum question. Surely it is its in a democratic society so to do. It placed its advertisements in newspapers throughout Australia. Under this proposed law, it would not be at Uberty to do so and could be punished by a of $20,000. Does the Minister persist in seeking to put this sort of provision upon the statute Let me take as a further example another organisation, the Institute of PubUc Affairs in official Victoria. Honourable members may agree or disthe agree with the sentiments that that most erstof an while organisation expresses in its various jouran offence punishable on convicnals. If that organisation places an advertisement a body corin a newspaper which may either directly or indirectly affect the outcome of the election, too bad; afineis imposed. The Minister has chosen these words 'either directly and indirectly' as a matter of conscious intent. This is the language chosen by him. He has not stumbled upon it. One his wonders indeed why any government wouid op-have such afierceinsistence to invade the fabric vindicate of our society in this fashion. Let me move on to give some further tilustraa tions of what I would describe as the clear erraticism in the Bill. There are various categories of electoral expenditure, I remind the House; indeed, there are 5 categories of electoral expenditure. If a Senate election is being held, the organisation is entitled to spend only 1.5c upon each person Uving in the State. But if a general election for the House of Representatives is being held each candidate in a division is entitled to spend 7.5c. So far so clear. If a Senate election and a House of Representatives election are being held together, one can still spend 1.5c per person Uving in the State on the Senate but one can spend only 6c in respect of the House of Representatives election. As a matter of simple logic, what is the explanation for this variation? Possibly the Minister, in his famtiiar urbane way, wtil teU us when he replies. If a double dissolution is held, the rate of Senate expenditure increases to 2.5c and the amount permissible in respect of the House of Representatives rises to 7.5c. If a referendum is being held, the allowable expenditure is lc per person in each State. No explanation is given by the Minister as to why he has hit upon these provisions at all. Why 1.5c? Is that reasonable? By what yardstick is it determined? I would have expected of the Minister some explanation. We have heard from him precisely nothing on the point. Let me give another Ulustration of the curiosity of the Bill. Charity is invading me a Uttle now; I am getting frightened. I refer to proposed section 149 which provides: A candidate, official agent or registered party agent shall not incur or authorise any electoral expenditure in relation an elecuon, other than expenditure for or in connecuon withVarious provisions are set out including advertising, broadcasting and televising, pubhshing, stationery, committee rooms and public meeting places. It so happens that in years gone by in my electorate, I have had in support of me what is known as the Slacks Creek Bushrangers Band made up of a couple of mouth organs, a couple of piano accordions, a triangle and a few gum leaves. Under this provision if that band played for me, it could be fined $20,000 if it was incorporated, which it is not. If I in any way condoned its actions, I could be fined $10,000. The Bill simply makes no provision for something like a band. Let me go a Uttle further to Ulustrate the absurdity of this legislation. Under proposed section 152-and I am grateful that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) is following me",61
188,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Well , it is not hard to get in front of you.",62
189,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"That may well be, but the only time when the Minister would be in front is when I am crossing him. In proposed section 152, it is provided that gifts shall not be made by a candidate for an election to or for the benefit of any club or other association within 3 months before the day next following the day fixed for the polling for the election. Let us take the last election which was held in May 1974. The date when that election would be held was not known. One could say with some reasonableness that we live in some measure of uncertainty today with respect to elections. Does the Minister mean to say by this provision that if I had given a ludo set to an organisation within the prescribed period, I would be fined in terms of this provision? What is the defence? It is a defence to a prosecutionMr Lamb- A crook ludo set.",62
190,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Well , the honourable gentleman at least would be able to arrange the dice. Under this provision, it would be a defence to a prosecution that when I made the offer, promise or gift the date of polling had not beenfixed.But look at the rigmarole that has to be gone through. There would be a prima facie case for prosecution. The prosecution would be launched. The defence would have to be made. Paper work would be required. This would be foUowed by an appearance at court before the magistrate. I take it that this offence is dealt with summarily. The person concerned and his legal representatives would have to go along to the court. The onus is on the individual to say: 'Look, I just did not to know.' But the Minister who is in charge of electoral matters and who would have a hand in fixing the election date in such an instance may know that date. Mr Minister, it is needless to have this sort of odd provision within this Bill. I turn next to gifts which may be made to a person. Let me say this, and I hope that I am not infringing good taste: It so happens that the mother of a person on the staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) sent to me from Tasmania a jar of marmalade jam. Under the terms of this Bill, I stand in prospect of conviction. This is the incredible feature about it. But this is par for the course. Mr Keogh-What was the jam like?",62
191,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,I have not tasted the jam but the honourable member would be welcome to share it with me. Mr Riordan-It is not the jam; it is the sugar that you must worry about.,62
192,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,The sugar industry is about the only industry that this Government has not ruined so far. It so happens that people do make donations to poltiical parties. Mr Keogh-Don't they!,62
193,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Yes, they do. I would like to tell the honourable member for Bowman something about the multinational support with which I have met. During the last federal election campaign an elderly lady- a pensioner-raffle d one dozen fresh farm eggs and made $25.1 was humble indeed when the $25 was passed over to my campaign committee. Under this Bill that little old lady would have to go along and get the written approval of my agent before she could do that. MrDaly-Whatrot.",63
194,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"That is right. That is the basis upon which the Government is proceeding. It wants to control, regulate, register, direct and guide as much as it can. Let me go further. If a Party receives money from any organisation, any company or any individual away from an election it will have to pay that money into a separate account. That is completely unreal because all pohtical parties in our society are alike in that their expenditure is a continuing process. They have running expenses. It is very rarely that a party allocates a fixed sum for a particular election campaign. Indeed, there have been so many elections in recent times that most parties, with the notable exception of the Austrahan Labor Party, are impoverished. The Labor Party calls upon its wealthy friends-the Marrickville Margarine group-to help it. It should not be thought by the Minister that we of the Opposition sit here not knowing the time of day. Under this provision, of course, that money must be paid into a separate account and if any of it is used for any other purpose-if it is used for an election-it be an mfringement of the legislation and the agent or person within the party who may be responsible for it could face the prospect of a fine. Then, of course, there is the quite extraordinary provision that, with respect to the register, there must be a return of gifts authorised by the agent filed within 12 months after the day fixed for the polling. He has to authorise in advance before he can receive anything. He has to make a list of them and he has to vouch for them in a particular fashion. As the provision in the Bill provides, he will have to lodge a return in the form prescribed. Not only will he have to do that but also the accounts will have to be audited. He will have to go out to an auditor and get the certificate of that auditor. That may be all right in the case of very large pohtical parties-the Austrahan Country Party, the Liberal Party of Austraha and the Austrahan Labor Party. However, what would be the position of a person who feels a particular grievance on some issue at some time and who wants to run for Parliament? It is the right of any person to stand for Parliament. It is the right of any group of individuals to say: 'We beheve that there is a cause to fight and we beheve that there is a cause to be argued and therefore we propose to contest the next election by putting forward candidates for either the House ofRepresentatives or the Senate'. Such an organisation would have to go through all the rigmarole of appointing an agent before it could get into the field to authorise any donations which may be given to that body. It might become quite an ephemeral body and disappear after the election campaign. At the end of it all it would have to go and have all of its proceedings audited. The names and addresses of every person concerned must be shown. That is plainly in terrorem because the fact of the matter is that many people simply do not want to have their names made known. The Minister's Party is supported by companies and individuals who, for eminently sound reasons, do not want their names to be made known. I have known of an occasion when a cheque forwarded to the Labor Party has arrived at the offices of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party has received the Liberal Party's cheque. The difference in favour of the Labor Party was quite substantial. It rather hurt us to have to send it back. Why does the Minister resort to this extraordinary form of mechanism to regulate and to control? He set out by describing it as a Bill to reform the electoral system. I for my part conclude where I began: This Bill represents a clear, savage and emphatic blow will against the whole structure of democratic society in this country. I can assure the Minister that it will be opposed by the Opposition with all its force and in every forum.",63
195,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"It is apparent that there is yet a further split, a further rift, inside the Liberal Party of Austraha. One thing that has emerged clearly from the superficial, supercilious speech just made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) is that he is at great odds with his leader. On 17 October 1973, as reported on page 2238 of Hansard, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Snedden, said: We support legislation which provides for the disclosure of poltiical party funds. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said. The de facto leader-on e of the many candidates for leadership-ha s now laid down the gauntlet and said that the Opposition will oppose this measure. Another schism. I am staggered that a lawyer of such high reputation, a lawyer who has extolled his own virtues over such a long period of time, should have looked at this Bill in such a superficial manner. Firstly, he does not understand it. Secondly, I doubt whether he has read it thoroughly. Thirdly, I doubt very much whether he has read the Bill in conjunction with the current Act. The honourable member for Moreton said that the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) had reached dizzy heights of euphemism when he called this measure electoral reform. I say to him that he has reached astronomical heights in hyperbole and inaccuracy. I refer, for example, to his great play on the words 'reasonable expenditure'. You are aware, Mr Speaker, and I take it that a lawyer of such moment as the honourable member for Moreton is aware that 'reasonable expenditure' has a legal interpretation and definition. Indeed, it is already in the Electoral Act in section 147 and has been there for half a century or longer. I invite the honourable member to have perhaps a cursory glance at that. The honourable member for Moreton said that this Bill is a violent expression of discrimination. Against whom? The multi-national corporations, his rich and powerful friends? I will come to that in more detail in a moment. He said that the Bill is a savage invasion of privacy. What right has the Australian public to know from where he and his colleagues get their money! What an ourageous proposition that the Austrahan elector should be able to determine who pays the bill! 'Where is the money coming from?' used to be the Liberals'jibe. Now we take it up and say: 'Let us find out where the money is coming from.' Only guilty men-thos e who have something to hide-wil l oppose this proposition. I say that it is not a savage invasion of privacy. In fact, the pubhc has a right to know. How can it be a savage invasion of privacy, a violent expression of discrimination, when in fact it extends the right to spend money in respect of candidates from $500 to about $3,000 in the average case? So the legal entitlement to spend funds for election purposes has been increased 6 times. Despite that the honourable member for Moreton has said that that is discrimination of the worse kind. The honourable member for Moreton then tried to draw another red herring across the trail by referring to the Institute of Pubhc Affairs, the Teachers Federation and others not being able to spend money. I invite the honourable gentleman even at this late stage, just to look at the definition of'party', 'party'. If he looks at it he will see the organisations, with the possible exception of the bushrangers band which would be able to spend funds in accordance with this Bill. I find it not only amusing but interesting that that gentleman would have playing for rum a band called the 'Bushrangers' because I think it is probably singularly appropriate that he and his colleagues from the Australian Country Party would be represented in that way. This Bill, if approved, will clear out the slush funds, and not before time. Let us let the air into pohtical fund raising in this country. The legislation will create far greater pubhc confidence in government, parhament and pohtical parties. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation to be introduced in this Parhament for more than a generation. I for one congratulate the Minister on having the courage and foresight to introduce such far-reaching legislation-legislatio n which will let the Ught in. Naturally there will be opposition, as we see today-oppositio n based on inaccuracy. There will be attempts to cloud the issue. Debate obviously will proceed on everything except the relevant clauses of the Bill. Those who seek to influence national pohtical events by the power of wealth andfinancerather than by argument and logic will be forced into the open. Their agents in this place are quick to respond on their behalf in spite of the earlier assertion by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden)-the current Leader of the Opposition-that they would support it. The pohtical ghosts will be laid to rest when this legislation is adopted by this Parhament, as I feel confident it will be. The rich and powerful corporations will have only the same power as the less affluent groups in the community to influence events. Those who seek to buy favour and privilege will be frustrated in their attempts. Those who genuinely support the policies of political parties will be able to contribute funds as much as they like, but not in secret. Everyone will know, and that is what gives the honourable member for Moreton almost epilepsy. His blood pressure rises at the thought of the secret, furtive meetings in the night-the knock at the door at 2 a.m., not by the Minister for Services and Property but by some rich and powerful friend of his from outside this Parliament; some representative perhaps of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation or United Fruit or one of the other international conspirators who will knock on his door, not to take something out of the fridge but perhaps to leave something under the bed or some other appropriate place. The electors have a right to know the source of funds used by pohtical parties and candidates. The Austrahan Constitution expressly and specifically prohibits the acceptance of fees and honoraria by members of this House or senators for actions on behalf of constituents, persons or estates. Yet, under the electoral law, in spite of that provision, we find it is possible for such persons to make a contribution to party funds or campaign funds and thereby frustrate the clear wish of the Austrahan Constitution. It defies credibility that such a prohibition in the Constitution could have envisaged a system where so called campaign donations could be used to reward members for services rendered, and reward them in secrecy and stealth. Steps have already been taken in various parts of the world to protect the democratic system from serious abuse in electoral funding. Rigid and strict controls have already been introduced in Canada and the United States of America. Scandals have rocked the democratic world recent years. The disclosures of the Watergate inquiry have shown us all that there is no room for complacency. The fact that no evidence corruption or improper practice has been availassume able in the past is no indication that it cannot occur in the future, and that Watergate. Similarly, the absence of evidence of corruption does not guarantee that rich and powerful corporations and even foreign governments cannot influence, or attempt to influence, events by donations to political parties or sons holding influence in them. This is a serious Partyissue. There are rumours currently circulating that the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its offshoots are making funds available to some in the community. There is also the suggestion that large amounts of funds will be made available to defeat candidates who support the right of Israel to sovereignty. These are very serious propositions and they cannot be glossed over hghtly. They ought to be out in the open for see. If someone wants to befinancedby favour fund by a foreign organisation, foreign company, domestic company or some rich friend it ought be out for the pubhc to see. Those who seek to deny that proposition in my view at least estabUsh prima facie that they have something hide. The 'New York Times' of 29 December concalculation tained an article headed 'The Watergate Trial Leaves Many Questions Unanswered'. The stand article stated: Next, there are the intriguing money questions. them is whether Mr Nixon was knowingly involved in falsification of his income documents for which a former White House lawyer has been convicted and sentenced to prison. Another is why H. R. Haldeman ordered $350,000 in campaign cash stashed in the White House. The White House explar tion that it was for conducting polls has always been dubious. But it was transferred there before anyone knew there would be a need to pay hush money to some clumsy burglars or to finance John Dean's honeymoon. Was that money intended eventually for Mr Nixon's private use? And what of the $100,000 in cash Bebe Rebozo collected from Howard Hughes and the $50,000 he collected from a Florida businessman? Although that has not occurred in Australia, does anyone say that the Australian democratic institution is stronger and better protected than was that of the United States prior to 1972? Mr Sullivan-Yes .",63
196,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The honourable member says 'yes' and presumably later he will say why and how that is so. I say it was not. I say it is not now. I say that in Australia there is no evidence because there is no way of ascertaining where the funds of pohtical parties come from. I would like to see the honourable member who insists on in interjecting stand up and say here that he opposes this proposition because there were significant funds spent in his electorate which I of would hope was without his authority, which I was without his authority, but which undoubtedly played a significant part in his is the clear lesson of election. Mr Sullivan- Iriseon a point of order. If the honourable member is challenging me, I accept his chaUenge. He knows full well that neither I pernor any other member of the Australian Country",65
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING, Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member's recourse is to raise this after the honourable member for PhUUp has finished his speech.,65
198,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"I refer honourable members to the annexure attached to the Minister's second reading speech which was incorporated in Hansard and which refers to donations to the Nixon all to campaign funds by some most dubious types or with very stange connections. What are the amounts that are donated in Australia? Who are to the people who contribute? What is the source of the funds? What is the source of funds which can allow $30,000 to $40,000 to be spent in an to individual electorate. The Mmister in his second reading speech pointed out that if one makes a probably more than $5m was spent during the last election campaign by all parties. I want honourable gentlemen opposite to underthis: This is not discriminatory legislation; this is legislation which applies to every pany One of and every candidate irrespective of his political the aflUiation. This being so, what is the complaint? Everyone is restricted in the same way; everyone has to disclose the source of the funds. Is it that we on this side of the House have less to hide? Perhaps that is the truth of the matter. Perhaps it is that the guilty men want to protect their rich and powerful friends. A great deal has been said and proved about the activities of certain multinational corpornot ations. Mention has been made of United Fruit in Guatamala in the 1950s, Union Miniere in Katanga in the 1960s and the ITT scandal in themselves Chile in the 1970s where $ lm was spent, accordadopted. ing to evidence given before the United States Congress, in order to influence an election. evidence also shows that ITT was on both the for sides during the Second World War. Are we to witness silently or to see the active intervention and interference by foreign owned mining panies in Australia later this year? Rumour has that we will. If we are to have the privilege their company, if we are to have the pleasure their active intervention and interference in the Austrahan pohtical scene, let us know about it. There is no reason why there should be ghostlike figures stalking across the pohtical horizon. Let us see who they are; let us see where they are; and let us see where their money is coming from. Bribery and contribution to political funds separated by a very thin line indeed, a very thin line. Sometimes we can see very Uttle difference between the 2 situations. What we have got to watch is that the sordid, sorry corruption and intrigue which we see in these multinational corporations that I have named here, the scandalous interference in domestic poltiical affairs, does not occur in Australia or, it does occur, that it is out in the open for traUan pubUc to see. In Australia we are not arattempt guing about a few bananas, we are arguing try about thousands of mUlions of dollars worth of minerals, the mineral wealth of this country which certain mining organisations would not be past paying substantiaUy to obtain. When we have members of this Parliament advocating poUcies which would put mUlions of dollars into the pockets of these rich corporations one does not have to think long or hard to know that would be a worthwhUe proposition for the corsort porations to contribute to the defeat of this Government. Limitation of expenditure is good for the ral democratic concept. It gives an equal opporto tunity to all to state their case to the Australian electorate. The risk of people being ruled by wealthy and privUeged class is diminished. What is likely, if the trend continues on its present undisturbed, is that the Australian people wtil ruled by well organised, well financed pressure groups. Such risks wtil be eliminated; the rights of Austrahans to express themselves freely at the ballot box, with equal knowledge of all the candidates' views, wtil be guaranteed by this legislation. Those who exercise authority should be clearly seen. Those who have the authority should be open to pubUc scrutiny. They should operate in the secrecy of the boardroom or from beyond Australia's shores. The days of the puppeteers organising political events to suit are over as soon as this legislation is If the legislation is frustrated, either here or in another place, let those who frustrate it The explain to the Australian electorate the reason their activities; because the Australian people wtil wish to know the answer to the question: 'What have you got to hide?' Tell us what it is. comCleanse yourselves. Stand up and be an open it book. If you do not, then accept the association of of gutit which obviously must fall upon you. The of slush fund concept should be destroyed. It has Uved too long. In the past, election expenditure has been too high. In fact, the high expenditure is denying the ordinary citizen the right to contest an election because he cannot stand up to the onslaught of power and wealth which is organised by poltiical pressure groups. In my view, an are expenditure of $3,000 in each electorate is sufficient and ought to be sufficient. It is 6 times the amount currently allowed by law. Of course, we all know that most political campaign expenhistory of bribery, diture is wasted. The Opposition has so far put forward this if superficial argument that is not based on any the Ausexamination of the Bill but is some kind of to draw red herrings across the trail, to to disguise what this legislation is about. We have the contradiction between the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien). I put it to this House that this proposition is designed to safeguard democracy. It is designed to expose any corrupt practices which may exist. I see nothing wrong with that and I should be very surprised if it any member of this House were engaged in that of activity, but it is possible for members to be caught on the leash, as it were, to become the victims of the puppeteers who wtil seek to influence events in Australia as it grows in natuwealth and importance. It is possible to laugh, sneer, it is possible for untlunking people to ridicule this argument. But let me say this to a them: The Austrahan people wtil not sneer, the Australian people will not ridicule because, way whether you Uke it or not, they are worried about be present events and they are concerned about the role of foreign-owned corporations in this country. The Austrahan people want to know the source of political funds. The Austrahan Government is determined that the people will know the source of pohtical funds. Those who oppose the Bill can explain their impossible position to the electorate.",65
199,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING," I must say that the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan) has followed the usual pattern in a debate of this type by trying to scare the nation about the presence of multinationals and their activities in the Austrahan community. We know that multinationals have perhaps not developed the best reputations in the Umted States and some other countries, but I have not yet had proved to me that multinationals in this country have been engaged in underhand activities. If we have any such evidence, if we have any such proof, surely this, the national Parhament, is the place in which we should be receiving this information from the Government in power today. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) presented a number of very powerful and persuasive arguments against this Bill and he has left no doubt in our minds about just how far this Government is prepared to go in intruding into the freedom of people in this country. The honourable member for Phillip said that the Government wanted to clear out the slush funds and let in thetight.The real fact of the matter is of course that the Austrahan Labor Party wants to know who supports what particular party. In other words, I see this as a Bill which gives some demonstration of the stickybeaking nature of the pohtical party that now governs this country. It does not want to let in the light, it wants to let the Labor Party. The Labor Government wants to be in the know so that it also might get on the bandwagon. The charge against the Opposition-agains t the Liberal and Country Parties-that it has received money from multinationals falls pretty shabbily to the ground when it is well known that prior to the last election in May an attempt was made-and I think a successful attempt-by Ministers, ministerial staffs and other Labor stalwarts to obtain money for the purposes of their election campaign. There is evidence to prove that, I understand. I beheve that photostat copies of letters are available for those who doubt that this is so. So it is a pretty hypocritical situation when we hear these charges levelled against the Liberal and Country Parties for opposing a measure such as this simply on the contention that we are trying to deny the Government and the community generally information about what multinationals do or do not support particular parties in this country. It comes before us in the guise of a further attempt by the Minister to achieve electoral reform in Australia, but none of us should be deluded about the real purposes of this Bill. Whtie I am the first to agree that the Electoral Act needs certain reform and amendment I see this Bill as being in violation of the spirit and of the principle of the secret ballot. I shall explain why. While a voter is free to cast a vote by secret ballot under this Bill he will not be free to support in an anonymous way the political party of his choosing or a candidate belonging to that pohtical party because hisfinancialcontribution, if he wishes to support his vote in that way, will be available for pubhc scrutiny. So it does break down that anonymous approach, that right to privacy that the individual is entitled to when he is casting a vote. Basically this Bill provides the machinery to force candidates and parties to disclose publicly their sources of funds and the Bill Umits electoral expenditure by parties and candidates. One of the dangers of this provision is that a person may feel inhibited about contributing to a central fund of a party. I think that all poltiical parties need to bear in mind the fact that one may wish to support an individual candidate and not necessarily the pohtical party as such. Those of us who have had experience in poltiical organisations-ther e are a great number here-mus t concede that point. How many people have made donations to poltiical parties, large and small, on the condition that it wtil not be made known pubUc-becaus e they wanted it to be kept a secret. Those people have aright,in my view, to in make that decision so long as they do not try to impose upon the political party concerned a concession in return for the donation. It seems highly probable to me that the great bulk of funds that are contributed to poltiical parties are spent certainly at the State and national campaign level, but a considerable amount of money is subscribed or sent to the local poltiical organisations purely and simply to assist rhe candidate or the person who is favoured by the individual who is giving the donation. Often an individual may have voted Labor, Liberal or the Country Party at one time or another because an individual candidate has appealed to the person concerned.",67
200,Mr YOUNG,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,Not necessarily in that order.,67
201,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"I wtil concede that it was not necessarily in that order. The honourable member has been a member of a political organisation for a long time and I think he would be the first to agree to the point I have made. In any event, how does this legislation prevent undisclosed contributions to either the pohtical party or the candidate in kind? Needless to say, any limits on the size of individual campaign contributions or on total spending may create underground effects. There may be ways of getting around the laws-ther e are sure to be-and indeed the law may be ignored as it was in the United States until the introduction of the most recent legislation. I do not know what the situation is at the moment. In any event, how does one track down contributions in kind which have been made to pohtical parties or to candidates. When I say 'in kind' I am referring to assistance such as free television advertising time, free radio station time and free newspaper advertisements. Newspapers may give advertising space or indeed ^disproportionate news space to a pohtical party or candidate. It is extremely difficult to impute values against the multitude of all the contributions that may be made in kind. This fact of life makes a farce of this legislation unless of course the government intends to control or is capable of controlling the media to ensure that the media is restricted in respect of the amount of space which they may give to a pohtical party or a candidate. But if that does happen that would be the first step towards the abolition of the freedom of the media and the freedom of the Press. Probably the strongest argument against disclosure of all particulars of all gifts including donations made to political parties or candidates through or with the authority of the party agents or official agents is that it could lead to pohtical retaliation against the donor. It could take the form of social ostracism, industrial activity pohtical discrimination by an opposing party if gains power. This is always a probability. It is purposes. always possible because it has happened in the past. You cannot easily wipe out some of the more nasty features of human nature. The Opposition subscribes to the view that individuals have the right to express political points of view freely, and indeed I am sure Government supports that view. An individual has the fight to support any pohtical party. In Opposition's view he has the right to vote for political party candidate by secret ballot and declare his political sympathy publicly by having to disclose a donation that he gave to a party. The individual has the right to support a politihonourable cal party financially whether minimally of subthink, stantially, and to remain anonymous. Why nonsense should an individual have this anonymous taken away from him? In today's pohtical scene all major parties must have access without to large sums of financial support. The trend has been set with the use of television, newspapers and radios. High costs are involved in getting people from point A to point B, from electorate to electorate and from state to state. This applies particularly in federal elections. If this Bill becomes law it will tend to reduce the level of financial support to pohtical parties especially from those donors who would wish to remain anonymous. It would more seriously affect the Liberal and Country Parties than it would the Labor Party. Let us be frank about this.",67
202,Dr KLUGMAN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,They spend more money.,68
203,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"It is not because we spend more money. I would not say that. The Labor Party has a more constant and more reliable source of funds from the trade union movement in this country than have the Liberal Party or the Country Party. The Liberal Party and the Country Party do not have continuing access to a source of funds that the Labor Party has and that is a fact of life. But in New South Wales the Australian Country Party has a total membership of over 20 000 subscribingfinancialmembers. I do not think there is a political party in the State of New South Wales which has a higher number of subscribing paid up members than the Australian Country Party. This applies right throughout most of the States. I think we have something like 100 000 subscribing members the throughout the Commonwealth and the Country Party has had to exist primarily on its source of funds corning from the payment of subscriptions to the Party organisation. The ALP, I think, has a relatively small membership, but most of its funds have been available to it from trade unions or within which the membership pays dues and in it many cases pays into special funds for special This Bill which provides for campaign funds disclosures will favour the incumbent government. This is another point that needs to be made. It will favour the govenment that is in power. It will favour the incumbent member of the Parliament, whether he be on the government side or on the opposition side. Does the Minister the really believe that this Bill will succeed in its a stated objectives? Under this Bill no union, no not association, no ad hoc group, no organisation can support a pohtical party or a candidate publicly without the authority of the party agent. The member for Moreton (Mr Kilien), I clearly demonstrated the futility of the that is involved in clause 146 of the Bill freedom to be which reads in part: A person . . . who incurs any electoral expenditure the prior written authority of a registered party agent or of an official agent, is guilty of an offence able, on conviction(a) in the case of a person porate-by afinenot exceeding $20,000; or (b) in any other case-by afinenot exceeding $ 10,000. He talked about the Uttle old lady who raffled a dozen fresh farm eggs. I think that that was a rather damning example of what the Bill can achieve. Mr Riordan-It cannot.",68
204,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The honourable member's union or my union, if it chooses to support the poltiical party of its choice-withou t obtaining the written authority of the agent of the party concerned-by way of advertisement, by way of public advertisement, by way of spending money on television is liable to a penalty of $20,000. Mr Riordan-Rea d the definition of'party'.",69
205,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Le t the next speaker read it to us. The honourable member is talking about definitions. Let him give me the interpretation of this one. The Bill says: 'electoral expenditure' means expenditure for or in connection with promoting or opposing, party or the elecuon of a candidate or candidates or of influencing, directly or indirectly, the voting at an election, but does not include* * * (h) reasonable personal Uving and travelling expenses a candidate; What does 'reasonable' mean? Who determines it? Mr Daly-You did for a whtie.",69
206,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"It is incredible. We are talking about the definition. Mr Daly-Her e you are, it is in section 147 the Act.",69
207,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"I do not mind reading it out. We are talking about definitions. One cannot define that. The Minister may be able to and I may able to, but the interpretation is the important issue. I do not care whether it is in the Act It probably is a stupid word. I think it is high that we started to define tilings in legislation. did not write that 50 years ago. I do not take real blame for the word 'reasonable'. Let us get away from the point about which honourable members opposite are sensitive, and that is that where an organisation or a group of people, havbeen ing no connection with a pohtical party, decides that its pohcy suits them best at an election time and they choose to insert an advertisement newspaper supporting that party, they are liable to a penalty unless they go cap in hand to that poltiical party and obtain an authorisation from the agent. That is claptrap and I think it punishinfringement of the rights and privacy of the individual. being a party or a body corIt is undoubtedly an authoritarian law. It smacks of an attempt to achieve a totahtarian control of the political freedom of people and of their right to act outside pubUc scrutiny. Our society is made up of individuals who have ideas of their own, often simUar to one another's. There are people in the community who are not satisfied with the existing poltiical parties. There are people who wtil want to form their own political organisations. There are people now trying to form parties of their own. But under this legislation there is no future for them because it favours heavily the existing major parties in this country. It will mUitate against those groups in the community that in future may want to form a new party. So it is an impediment and a disadvantage to people who are politically involved, not with the major parties-thos e who are dissatisfied with the major parties, those who are wanting to express their own views through a new political organisation. Let nobody deny it. No one who has had any directly or indirectly, a association with poltiical parties or organisations can deny that because it is a fact of life. As I said earUer, this legislation is a vicious intrusion into * therightsof the individual, of the little peopleof not just the big people, not just the multinationals. I think that the Government is using a sledgehammer to try to crack a peanut. It must be very careful that it does not bring down laws that will ultimately work against the principles upon which this society of ours is based-the freedom and the rights of the individual.",69
208,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"There is an old of saying: 'Methinks he doth protest too much'. I think that that applies to the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt). He cited one passage of the Bill which, in his opinion, is completely be uninterpretable and unreasonable. The section and the wording of it were contained in the Act or not. during the time when he admimstered it. My time memory does not indicate any attempt by him to I remove that section of the Electoral Act during any the numerous amendments which he introduced not into this House and, if I may add, subsequently voted against when they were introduced into this House again by this Government, not having passed by a previous Parliament. It appears to me that what is being said in this debate is that it is better for persons to usefinancialinfluence in a on candidates and members in secret than it would be to have funds and sources of funds disclosed in order that, where there is a suggestion of influence or a suggestion of some decision is an made which may benefit a large contributor, there is an open situation where everyone will know exactly what has happened. It is unfortunate that Austrahan poUtics are becoming a continuing source of innuendo about poliucal funding. The Australian Country Party is one of the victims of this and I would have thought that its members would be very happy to see this situation totaUy ehminated. Mr Bourchier-What about the trade union funds?",69
209,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The trade unions contribute to the Austrahan Labor Party. They present balance sheets to their members, and their contributions are pubUc knowledge and are used by our poltiical opponents whenever they feel there is some advantage in using those contributions for poltiical purposes. What the Opposition is saying is that they should be pubUc knowledge but that the contributors to the Opposition's funds who may or may not derive benefit from those contributions are entitled to make their contributions in secrecy. The Electoral Act has been described as an undemocratic Act. It has been described as a removal of the rights of secrecy. I suggest that there are certain things which are public knowledge. Under the existing Act, ostensibly a candidate is required to disclose his expenditures on an election, but it is now said that he should not be required to disclose where the funds to cover those expenditures came from. The Canadian Parliament unanimously-wit the support of all members and all parties in Parliament-recentl y passed legislation which was almost identical m form to the legislation being proposed to this Parliament today in the disclosure of funds. It appears poltiical parties believe that there is benefit in the disclosure of funds. In the United States of America, whose Constitution enshrines the domocratic rights of the individual to an extent which is almost beyond behef in a modern solittle ciety and which is the cause of some problems that country, the rights of the individual are totally protected and there is no question that Supreme Court of the United States would upset any attempt to take away from any individual his rights of secret baUot and his rights to participate properly in an election. In the United States political contributions are regulated by the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That Act appUes to a candidate for election to nonsense-rotte Congress or to a political party which seeks to influence any two or more States in an election for Federal office. The Act defines a contribution as including a gift, subscription, loan, advance deposit of moneys or anything of value and includes a contract, promise or agreement, whether or not legaUy enforceable, to make contributions. That is a fairly wide sweeping clause. It is apphed to organisations promoting candidates for the Congress of the United States. I take it that if that sort of thing were proposed here it would be said to constitute a denial of the individual's rights and a denial of the rights to secrecy of the batiot. But apparently this provision is upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States and does not contravene the Btil of Rights section of that country's Constitution. I would add that the Treasurer of a poltiical committee is required to keep an account of all contributions made to or for the committee, and a person who receives a contribution for a political committee must account to the Treasurer for the contribution. I wish to make another comment on this point. Much of the present poltiical problems which are besetting the United States Congress and the presidency arise from the non-disclosure of political campaign contributions-fro m keeping such campaign contributions secret. In the United States it is thought that if a person makes a large contribution to a poltiical campaign fund and seeks to hide that contribution-to keep it secret-ther e must be some ulterior motive behind it. In Australia there is little or no evidence of corrupt practices in Australian poUtics, but there are repeated suspicions and innuendoes h about certain organisations which benefit subthat stantiaUy from certain poltiical parties taking office. It is not unreasonable to protect both the political parties and the contributor by ensuring that any contribution made wtil be known, and that in Canada all pubUcly known. I presume it was the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) who mentioned the little lady who raffled the eggs. If I may say so, if the lady who raffled the eggs had contravened in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and it contained the penalties which were enshrined in it the during the period when the honourable member for Gwydir was the Minister she would have been placed in gaol for almost all of the offences covered by the Act. The judge who heard the case would not even have a discretion; she would have to go to gaol. The Act did not provide for monetary fines to cover the majority of penalties. Mr Donald Cameron-You are talking a lot of n eggs.",70
210,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The honourable gentleman may say that. I suggest that he looks at the scale or of penalties in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and looks at the amendments to the Act that we proposed to this House not so long ago. The Commonwealth Electoral Act, as it now stands, contains a provision by which no person who has contested an election to this House in the last five or six elections and where any scale of competition for the seat has taken place can abide. The Act sets a maximum expenditure of $500 on the election campaign of any candidate for office in the Federal Parliament. The average size of electorates in my State, and I suppose in the Commonwealth, is in excess of 60 000 people. I could not have printed and distributed how to vote cards, let alone any other form of election material, for that price at this time. Yet we are confronted with the situation that that state of affairs is to continue. The Electoral Act contains a number of other provisions, but the most important provisions are the ones dealing with the disclosure of funds and the regulation of expenditure. Both of these provisions have a number of influences. The disclosure of funds ensures that no person will be giving funds to candidates in the hope of receiving future benefits. Such a person cannot hope for secrecy. The amount of money, whatever it may be, must be disclosed. The penalties for nondisclosure are high, but they are maximum penalties to be imposed at the discretion of the court. If the penalties are not high, the stakes are high, and unless the penalty matches the possible gain it can become worthwhile to breach the law and thus achieve an end which could have a profitabUity far beyond any monetary penalty which may be appUed. I hope that the members of this House wtil have sufficient confidence in themselves and the Australian electorate to vote for a measure which wtil take away from elections in Australia, from governments in Australia, the continued innuendo which must follow if substantial contributions to election funds are reputed to be from sources which could receive substantial benefits in return.",70
211,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,Like the way they did in the United States.,71
212,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,The United States is in all sorts of electoral troubles.,71
213,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,Because of the sorts of laws.,71
214,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"If the honourable gentleman reaUy beUeves it should continue to be open for people to buy pohtical influence, I wtil give honourable member one instance of thing in Australia. I refer to the period immediately before the 1961 elections when the then Government extended the 2 airlines agreement in Austraha for a period of 14 years to give it currency of 17 years in order to protect interests of the private operator who was a party to the airlines agreement. By co-incidence or otherwise, the private operator spent considerable sums of money on newspaper advertisements in support of the Government of the day. The case to which I refer is known, so there is nothing dishonest about it. But the fact that that sort of thing is happening in private-and it does happen-is quite clearly something which should be known by the Australian electorate.",71
215,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,It quite obviously is; you are telling us.,71
216,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"I said that that instance is open; obviously there are other cases which are not open. I would mention another factor which is equally important. It has been said, by innuendo or otherwise, that certain political organisations have promised to give financial benefit to certain overseas mining and mineral companies. Mr Donald Cameron-Who ?",71
217,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,If the honourable gentleman does not know what is going on in the country I really do not think his education is my responsibiUty. The fact is that aUegations have been made and are repeatedly made,71
218,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,B y your Party when in Opposition.,71
219,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"They may well have been justly made, but the fact of the matter is that if a political party is reputed to be getting secret contributions from a source and in return is publicly offering that source contributions from public funds ui the form of subsidies, suspicion must exist. If the public disclosure of contributions to poltiical parties is required, no suspicion can exist. It is as simple as that. It is possible in this day to buy electoral victory. It is possible to spend sums of money in such proportions so as to deny totally the democratic process. If the Press is freely avaUable to one poltiical party and denied to another, as happens in some areas of Australia, if unlimited funds to purchase television time are available to one candidate and not avaUable to another, a democratic expression of the electorate is not possible. Mr Corbett-The Labor Party was not short of funds in Queensland in the last State election.",71
220,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,I wtil lay odds that the Labor the Party did not spend anywhere near as much as that type of did the Country Party. Mr Corbett-It did not get the seats either.,71
221,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"No, but it got more votes a than the Country Party. I think the honourable the member ought to acknowledge that fact. The only tiling that it did not get is the seats. That is another matter that is not covered by thisMr Corbett-It shows that one cannot win elections without money.",71
222,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Yes, but we just do not get the opportunity because Labor voters get only one vote and Country Party voters in Queensland get five. MetropoUtan people in Queensland are second class citizens. Everywhere in Austraha the Country Party would have that the case. It beheves that people who Uve in the cities are not entided to a full vote. That is the practised pohcy, it is in legislative effect in every State of Australia where the Country Party exercises influence and it is currently in effect in this Parliament under the existing boundaries. I support this Bill. I believe that it will have a very good influence on this Parhament and wtil ensure not only that no pohtical party can be accused of secret deals and secret funds but also it wtil ensure that no person can be misled into beUeving that by making secret contributions to a political party he can buy influence. I think they are both important aspects which must be dealt with and ehminated if possible. Amendments of this nature may or may not advantage political parties. I believe that these amendments wtil be to the advantage of no one. But they will be of advantage to the electoral system and to the democratic process itself. This requirement is not something which does not exist anywhere else; it is a provision in almost every democratically elected Parliament with which we would like to compare ourselves. The disclosure of the source of funds is required under Canadian law. The honourable member for Gwydir would hardly describe that country as totaUtarian. It is a requirement of the law of the United States and I believe that it should be a requirement of the law of Australia.",72
223,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING," Mr Deputy overseas Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",72
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING, Does learners. the honourable member claim to have been misrespect represented?,72
225,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Yes. In a letter written to 'Austrahan Financial Review' of this morning, Thursday, 13 February, by Senator Peter Walsh, Senator for Western Australia, Canberra, been misrepresented in 2 respects. Thefirstis an aUegation that the previous Government, m which I was Minister for Primary Industry, instructed the Wheat Board not to sell wheat ChUe following the election of President Allende. The misrepresentation is repeated in another form when he states: 'There is a long history of Government interference in wheat marketing'. There was a negotiation between the Wheat Board and the Government whtie I was Minister for Primary Industry relating to the degree to which Export Payments Insurance Corporation cover would be accorded to the wheat that the Wheat Board wished to seU to ChUe. No instruction was given to the Australian Wheat Board at that time.There was a failure to agree on terms by which EPIC cover would be provided. The Wheat Board was perfectly at Uberty to sell wheat to ChUe but was not able to gain appropriate EPIC cover under the terms that it sought to cover that sale. As to the second misrepresentation, there was no Government interference with respect to any sales undertaken by the Austrahan Wheat Board either whtie I was Minister for Primary Industry or at any time while I was in the previous Ministry.",72
226,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING," I open my remarks on the Electoral Bill 1974 by simply asking: Why, oh why, does this present Australian Labor Government feel that it has to poke its nose into every corner in this country? Everything it has put its hands on has gone wrong in the last 2 years, yet it continues to reach out. Itfindsit so difficult to leave anything alone. One of the tragedies is that the Australian Labor Party members are victims of one huge inferiority complex. In their speeches in the past all they did was talk about the multi-nationals and their investment in Australia. They stamped about the countiy condemning multi-nationals. As a result of their hostility and their refusal to aUow overseas capital into Australia we had a huge downturn in the economy. Recently we witnessed the spectacle of the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) in New York pleading and assuring the multi-nationals that they were welcome to come to Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in talking ofhis recent 6-week trip the other night also said how he assured foreign investors that they could come to Australia. Members of the Labor Party are slow Their complex about money in that has been proven to be without reason. They also have a complex that the Liberal and the Country Parties are receiving huge donations from multi-nationals so they feel that at all costs they have to change the legislation to ensure that I have every donation is declared. The honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Riordan) spoke earlier of the nation being run by a to privtieged class. He talked of thousands of mUlions of dollars. As one who has to raise his own campaign funds because I belong to a Party in a State where the headquarters does not give a candidate a razoo even to bless himself with polling day, I have had to go out and raise my own money. I can assure honourable opposite that it is a complete fallacy that non-Labor Parties are rolling in money. They are movement under a misapprehension. They are dreamers. performance. They are not realistic, just as their approach to government has been unrealistic. They do not The know what they are talking about. But let me talk about some of the money that the Australian Labor Party handles. I have as my authority a document titled 'Precis of Campaign Directors Report to the Queensland Central Executive on 25 June 1974' by Bart Lourigan. He is the boss of the ALP in Queensland where the Labor Party suffered a disastrous electoral result on 7 December. Perhaps it would like forget that Queensland even exists. of life. I asked the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) whether I could have this ter very interesting document incorporated in Hanable to sard. He found it so interesting that he said: 'No, it is not on'. I assured him that I had learnt a lot staff... from it. I wish that he had had time to read it all. Let us turn to the money page. The Labor Party supporters stand up in this House crying poor. Speaker after speaker talks about the great funds available to this side. Under the heading 'Camphotograph paign Budget' it states: The Queensland Central Campaign Committee decided work on a budget of $45,000, which received Executive proval. However, following the announcement of a Double Dissolution, the budget was raised to $60,000. Yet, final costs incurred by the QCE campaign are tallied, expected that the campaign will have cost a record Never has such a large sum been spent on a Federal campaign in such a short period. This compares to the 1972, made up of an estimated budget of $40,000, $ 18,000 from the Nauonal Campaign Committee. Of course this report does not even make mencause tion of the amounts which were ous candidates in the various electorates. read time and time again of the problem that the Labor Party come another election. ALP in Queensland had when my opponent the the Labor Party is in government, it Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Clem Jones, put in his does not have to divulge the relevantfigures. bill for $10,000 which was only part of what he spent in a joint ALP-Jones effort to unseat me in Labor Griffith. The Labor Party spent some $30,000 in over the one seat of Griffith.",72
227,Mr COHEN,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,How much did you spend?,73
228,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"I did not spend their as much as the Labor Party did. I can assure regrettably their honourable members that I was not caught my way. But it is sttil sleeping. Because I anticipated the tactics that beliefs and to try to see would be employed, as is myrightin cratic society, I took counter measures to ensure dinkum. It is introducing aParty that money did not win Griffith for the Ausin this country. trahan Labor Party and that people made their on judgment on the qualities of the candidates and the pohcies of the parties. At the end of this documembers ment, Mr Lourigan states: It should be reiterated that in this election, the trade union both financially and physically gave their best document does not list the unions, it just uses the general term. If we talk about corruption by the use of money, let us be realistic and honest. The Labor Party has exploited the political system of Australia more than any other party in the history of this nation. It has estabUshed throughout Australia a network of public offices with public relations officers and Press secretaries. Nobody can put a price on them. They are working with one aim-the return of the Australian to Labor Party to government. On page 7 of the But it is a fact report Mr Lorrigan says: Brisbane is the only State capital without a Federal Minisand the facilities which would normally be made availone. To remedy this, the State President and the State Secretary requested Mr Whidam to open a Press office in Brisbane manned by a member of the Prime Minister's In Brisbane we now have a new spy unit. Nobody is aware of its faciUties, but we are told it has machinery worth more than $500,000. It can newspaper articles and send them to Canberra so that the Prime Minister's staff can see them and shoot back through the same mato chinery a reply for release in Queensland. Do aphonourable members opposite regard this as a when fair advantage? The Labor Party has taken 2 it is people from Sydney to man this unit. One is an $80,000. extra pohtical stooge who worked on the last $60,000 in campaign for the honourable member for Bowand man (Mr Keogh), and who was removed from the Public Service and employed in this unit behe has local poliucal knowledge which the spent by the variunit costsimports southern assuredly would not have. This I have to run. This unit will be atused the taxpayers least $100,000 a year by the Australian But because thinks it The Party is giving itself an unfair advantage those who are not in government. There are people who do not beheve in the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Country Party or the Australian Labor Party and who seek to form wiU own parties to platform their own beliefs. I continue tofightfor theirrightseven though preferences do not always come their right to have their own what electoral acceptance a demothey can gain. The Labor is not being fair Bill to stifle freedom The amount of expenditure prescribed by the Minister in the Bill would mean that in a Senate election in the Federal division of Griffith no more than $900 could be spent to promote the Senate team. No more than $600 could be spent on a referendum. As a candidate I would be able to spend about $3,000 or at the most 7.5c per elector. During the last election I wrote to 13 000 people in my electorate. Fortunately this was at a time when the postage rate for a letter was 7c but it is now 10c. The proposed expenditure would force me into a situation where I could not write to more than a quarter of my electors. The Labor Party says that that is as much as I could spend. I believe that the Umits which have been set are totaUy unrealistic. I turn my attention now to the fact, as by the honourable members for Moreton (Mr KUlen) and Gwydir (Mr Hunt), that this completely restricts an organisation in placing advertisements as to their viewpoint either rectiy or indirectly without the permission of person who has been nominated by a poltiical party. The Labor Party talks about freedom in Australia but once again it sets out along the path of tying people up more and more. We have beties, come a nation of restrictions since the Labor Party came to power. The thing that troubles zen me- I expected it from the Labor Party as government-is that individuals who were once so outspoken on the preservation of liberty are sitting silently in this House like mutes. It is Labor Party members plucked up courage and spoke out in their party room if they have the across intelUgence to recognise some of the long effects of the legislation that their Party is introducing. I now turn to the question of political parties being forced to divulge their source of income. We must remember that this legislation is Labor introduced by men who are preoccupied with the beUef that the Opposition parties are roUing in moneyMr Cross-Hear , hear.",73
229,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The honourable member for Brisbane says 'Hear, hear'. If the seat of Griffith is abolished and I go after the seat of Brisbane the honourable member will say more than 'Hear, hear'. He wtil need more than money to save him. But to get back to this point, if we force poltiical parties to provide lists of who has donated to their campaigns and small businesses, or not so smaU businesses, are on that Ust, we could well reach the stage in this day and age when some of the more mUitant extremist trade unions could say: ' If you give to the Liberal Party or the Country Party again we wtil introduce measures in this shop or factory which will be to your disadvantage'. It is all very well for Labor Party members to cite as examples the United States of America and Canada, but the difference is that in Australia the Government of today, the Australian Labor Party, is butit on the foundation of the trade union movement. It is shackled to the trade union movement. It is the Labor Party's beginnings and that is where it continues to exist. It is the very roots of the Labor Party organisation. Many members of the Government party have come from the trade union movement and that is the difference. In the United States of America the trade union movement can in some years support the Republicans and in other years the Democratic Party. In stated Australia, the trade union movement on the whole supports the Australian Labor - Party. Bill When the movement is not happy with the Government it does not turn to the Liberal Party, diit just withholds its generous support from the a Austrahan Labor Party. That is its sUent protest. The fact is that if we provide lists of those who in this country have given money to poltiical parthey could well be the victim of trade union blackmaU. Furthermore, I believe that as a citiof Australia it is my right to give to the Ausa traUan Labor Party, the Australian Country Party, the Democratic Labor Party, the Australia Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and even time the Communist Party. It is my right to make a donation without that donation being blazed the sky for aU to see. It is a private act beterm tween myself and the recipient party. Mr Keogh-How much have you given the Labor Party?",74
230,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"When the honourable member for Bowman joined the Party I cut off my donations. That was the end of them. I believe that this legislation contains a danger to the right of the citizens of this country to donate to the poltiical party or parties of their choice. In 1974, the Labor Party moaned and groaned at the fact that it appeared that the Liberal Party and the Country Party had more money than the Labor Party had. But in 1972, the Australian Labor Party had far more money at its disposal than did the Liberal Party and Country Party team. The fact is that the level of money donations to political parties indicates the feelings of persons to the government of the day. If people who are interested in poUtics do not believe that the Australian Labor Party is doing a good job for Australia- I know that 311 000 people who are unemployed at least will testify to that fact-the y will switch their donations to another pohtical party. Yet, regrettably, ister for Services and Property and those who sit behind him regard donations to political parties as sinister and something that must be stopped at all costs, particularly if people wish to make those donations to the Liberal Party and the Country Party. I conclude simply by asking the Minister to think out clearly what he is doing. It may be the advantage of the Government today to stop the Liberal Party and the Country Party. It may be to the Government's advantage because it has vast machinery available to it through the enslaved Austrahan Pubhc Service which has no alternative but to do what the Government tells it to do. The Government also has the facUities which it has opened in each State at which people, paid by the Australian taxpayer, service the Australian Labor Party. But every doggy has his day. The day of this Government will come at the next election when it wtil lose access these benefits. The Liberal Party and the try Party wtil be back in power. If the honourable member for Grayndler, the Minister for Services and Property, who has been here since 1943 and enough. acts as though he came here in 1873, is still member, he wtil be bleating from this side of House about the unfair advantages that the new government has over his Party. At that time, let him reflect on the legislation that he has introduced this week for the short term advanfor tage of his Party. That legislation wtil stifle democracy in this country in the future. In view, this is a most retrograde step.",74
231,Mr YOUNG,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"One of the difficulties in a debate of this nature ously is the fact that most members of the Parliament-and I talk of members on both sides of the Parliament-d o not understand the relaamount tionship between candidate and Party, party and business and/or trade union, and all those elements and the media. Without looking over the history of campaigning in Australia, there can be no doubt that we wtil head into great problems in this field if something is not done about it. Added to this aspect is the standin ing of partiamentarians in the society in which we live. The Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) has done a great deal to assist memmoney bers and to Uft the standing of members. lieve that a great many more of us ought to stand up to argue the role of the parUamentarian the work that we do. Partiamentarians should be beyond any suspicion at all. There can be Uttle doubt that whtist the present system prevails there will be great suspicion not only about political parties and machines but also about parliathe Minmentarians themselves. It is all right for members to say that they go out and raise their own money from their own supporters in their own electorates. But the party which wins or loses each electorate, I believe, in a national election, is not determined by the campaign in the individual electorate. In some country electorates it may be from time totimewhere to the candidate can become very well known; but this is not the case in the cities where the vast majority of electorates are. Very few local campaigns win or lose elections. An election is won or lost by the massive propaganda which is put across radio and television. This is completely outside the hands of the candidates. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) objected to the term 'agent' and the role the agent would play in terms of the new Bill. If we substitute the term 'campaign director', it would become obvious to us all that we are talking about the people to aU who for decades have been running the camCounpaigns in our electorates, our States and nationally, on behalf of the poltiical parties. My criticism of the Bill is that it does not go far I would have no donations at aU to pola itical parties or to candidates. I think all the the money that is used to educate the people about policies of the various political parties ought to come from the public purse. There should be absolutely no suspicion about the source of funds members of Parliament or candidates for Parliament. We are going to head into trouble. my There is some evidence to suggest that campaigns have been assisted by vast sums of money. IncidentaUy, I have heard all the allegations from the other side of the House about obvihow much money the Labor Party had in 1972.1 ran the campaign for the Labor Party in 1972 and no one has come within $600,000 of the we raised. AU the talk about $lm and $ 1.5m held by the Labor Party that year is absolute nonsense. However, I do recall the campaign back of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson), who lost his seat m 1969 and spent the next 3 years as the candidate-whic h was a valid exercise-in winning it back. But there is no way which the candidate for the Australian Labor Party who was an outstanding pohtician, Norm Foster, could compete with the avalanche of and propaganda that was poured into the I beelectorate of Sturt. When one puUs on the Bonython family hi Adelaide one runs into a fair and bit of trouble. As I said, my criticism of the Bill is that it does not go far enough. The attitude of the Country Party, which has been espoused by its Leader as far back as October 1973, is recorded in the Hansard of that date. It is made perfectly clear, in his own words, that Mr Anthony is opposed to the declaration of pohtical donations. Also, he wants to make them tax deductible. This would mean that a major company donating moneys to any of the pohtical parties would really only be paying half the amount of the donation. But there are many problems about the divulging of donations and making an accurate assessment of whether all the donations have been put on pubhc display so people can make up their own minds. Let me say a few words about the multitude nationals. I do not have a phobia about them or the role they play but they do hold some danger to countries like our own. Major Austrahan comwhether panies hold similar dangers, I suspect These are matters of which we ought to be aware. I tbink we would be doing ourselves a favour if every member of the House, not as members of a specinc political party but as persons who been given the great privilege of coming in and representing electorates, were to clear the in regard to political donations. Members from the other side of the House have said it is untrue to say that in 1974 the Liberal and Country Partoral ties were rolling in money and the Labor Party was battling to raise funds. But if one looks at the 26th Annual Report of the Austrahan Broadcastagents ing Control Board it will be seen that wherever was able the Board ascertained the time taken in broadcasting pohtical advertising on metrosecond politan and country radio for the 1974 elections. The Australian Labor Pany spent $90,000 and our opponents spent $210,000.1 do not believe these to be accurate figures; I tbink a great deal more money was spent that has not been divulone ged. In television throughout Australia, the Labor Party supposedly spent $290,000 in the 1974 election campaign and our opponents not $900,000. Do not tell me that the Opposition parties have so many old women raffling eggs in Australia. that they can raise that sort of money. Just in one series of advertisements that were used on television in Victoria alone $138,000 was spent. These were called the Sam Holt advertisements and were the brain child of that now well known character in Austraha, John Singleton, who seems to be the darling of the Liberal Party at moment. These advertisements included the one showing the Latvian woman telling us about the fears she held for the future of Australia. The raising of funds is going to become a growing problem in Austraha. Whilst the playing time will not be greatly changed with the advent of colour television the production costs will up immeasurably. So pohtical parties will have to go out and find a lot more money than they have found in the past. Where are they going to find it? They will not be able to get it from their supporters in the electorates. One is flat out raising enough money in one's electorate to put out how-to-vote cards and pamphlets. So the campaign directors or the agents, as they are called in the Bill, will have to devise means whereby they will be able to go out and raise these vast sums of money. What are we doing in the field of advertising? Because we are reasonably immature in our attito advertising, especially political advertising, we are falling for all the advertising card tricks in the world. We are not looking at we can educate the Austrahan people on proper policies; we are falling for the advertising gimmick. No one is clear of that charge. The Labor Party has used such gimmicks and the Liberal and Country Parties have used them. have The Australian Democratic Labor Party used here them back in the mid-1960s when it showed air Chinese soldiers marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It should be the responsibUity of this Parliament to devise media laws and eleclaws that will involve the Australian people in becoming conversant with the point of view of every political party. But, because the advertising tell us that the best way in which to perit suade someone to buy a particular commodity or up to vote for a political party is by way of 30scatters, we are putting on all the nonsense in the world. A person Uke John Singleton and all his mates can march up to a political party and say: ' If you want to win this election this is the way to do it: Forget about telUng somefor 10 minutes that you have a good policy on a peace zone in the Indian Ocean or that you support equal rights for women because that is the way in which to win votes'. So there are 2 things that we have to do about the electoral laws We are putting on absolute nonsense. The 30second advertisement is not only nonsense but also the most expensive way of advertising because it has to be played on a lot more occasions than would have been the case under the old systhe tem when television was first introduced into Australia and everything produced by the political parties was done in terms of explaining policies to members of the pubhc and allowing them to judge logicaUy which was the best party to vote for. But now the commercial television stations do not want 5-minute political speeches because they say that the people will switch from go their station and will not come back to it. They want the 30-second scatters. So we have been forced into using them. The only organisation which has retained a sensible attitude to the manner in which pohtical parties ought to go about their business is the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission, which demands certain proper content in the political advertisements it allows the pohtical parties to run. Not only in the commercial sector is the Australian Labor Party, which is the largest poltiical party in Australia, only receiving something like 24 per cent of the complete exposure given to poltiical parties at elections but also the ABC has a pohcy of giving poltiical parties equal time so that the Liberal and Country Parties get exactly the same amount of time as the Australian Labor Party. Perhaps that is the way it should be in respect. But when one switches over to the area in which money is spent onefindsthat the Labor Party is falling further and further behind. The multi-nationals or the large companies are certainly going to have an increasing role to play in thisfield.I may go out, as we aU may go out, to raise money for how-to-vote cards, pamphlets, and a sUde to be shown at the local drive-in, but they really have Uttle effect on how people may vote in the electorate in which that is done; they are going to vote on the national issues. So the people who are running the campaigns from the central offices are the people who determine which members of Parhament wtil sit on these benches. They are the ones who go out and get the money. An honourable member may stand up in this did not run length chamber and say quite indignantly: ' I am an traditional honest man. I have never been a party out to get money. I do not know where the was the greatest propaganda money comes from, but I think that the people ducted without television. The sum who give it are entitled to give it for whatever given to the Liberal Party. Is it corruption reason it may be given'. I have seen what the Minister has said previously about having to look at the proposition of government funded campaigns. But members of Parliament reaUy do not this know what their campaign committees are public; doing, or from where the money what reason it is given. There may legitimate reason for a company to support one parties. There is no way ofwho party or the other. It may be because of a poUcy. But there is always a grey area. People always suspicious because whatever one does someone wtil say: 'That company must have donated to that poltiical party'. Large sums of money are mvolved. The Liberal and Country Parties spent $ lm on television coverage in 1974. What will it be in 1977? WUl it be $2m? Where wtil the money come from and for what reason wtil it be given? Perhaps the money wtil be provided because some major companies wish to get rid of the Labor Party?",75
232,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,No one wtil have $2m by 1977 if you are still in power.,77
233,Mr YOUNG,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The honourable member would do well to listen. To my knowledge the Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd officially does not make any political donations. I do not have any knowledge that it has made any donation officially to any other poltiical party. But BHP may be opposed to having to go before the Prices Justification Tribunal on the number of occasions that it has been forced to do under this Government. It may be that BHP will change its poticy on political donations and support substantially the Liberal that and Country Parties which, after the next election, undoubtedly wtil have a poticy for the abolition of the PJT. Are we to say that that is a source of corruption? Is doubt to be thrown on every member of the Liberal and Country Parties because of the actions of BHP? Everyone knows why Chifley was defeated in the great campaign of 1949. He was defeated because the banks poured mto the campaign the greatest amount of money that had ever been poured into one election campaign in order to get rid of the Labor Government. Mr Bourchier-He was defeated because he was going to nationaUse the banks.",77
234,Mr YOUNG,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"That is true. Chifley had a policy on the banks. The banks in return gave £lm to the Liberal Party in that year. The campaign for 2 weeks and 3 days which is the of a campaign in Australia; it to going call the campaign runhonourable ran for months. AU members wtil reby John Henry Austral. It campaign conof f lm was because the banks wanted to come in and support policy? If we are to go halfway, as is suggested by a Bill, of course aU donations should be made there can be no doubt about that. There is coming or for ParUamentnoought should be grey area. At least members of the to stand above the suspicions be a perfectly of the electorate about supports political party's ing the problem. There are completely ways of overcomcourse, as has are been proved in the American scene, of going around the laws. One can always employ smart people to see how one can get around a law and make a donation or give free broadcasting time. In 1972 when the late Sir Frank Packer thought that things were going bad for the Liberal Party, he was not content only to make his donations or to assist the Liberal Party wherever he could, but he started putting 5-minute free editorials on Channel 9 and talking to more people in Austraha than anyone else was able to do. He was never given a Ucence to run Channel 9 as a voice for the Liberal Party. Honourable members may say: 'It is not fair because when we are in government we have people working for us, Press secretaries and so forth'. That is a pretty poor armament when it is ranged against the Frank Packers, the Warwick Fairfaxes and the PhUUp Joneses of the world who never deviate in their political support and who run the media of this country down a straight line behind the Liberal and Country Parties. I do not think that the Press secretaries and the working journalists in this Government are any real armament against that sort of poltiical force in the field of the media in Australia. The honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Riordan) read out a great deal about the role the multi-national companies throughout the these world and the disgraceful involvement of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporbe ation in ChUe. Not only did that company spend US$lm on its involvement in Chile and involve the Central InteUigence Agency, but it made an offer to Dr Kissinger. The company was as bold as to make a US$lm offer to Dr Kissinger to volve the United States in some takeover of the Allende Government in Chile because the comdo pany did not happen to like the Government. some of these forces are buying the government of the day. I rather like the honourable member for requires Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron). I do not think contributes very much to the House, but I do Uke him. But it may be that one of these days a major company wtil want a smart candidate in Griffith and they may decide to replace the honourable member. They can do it under the system if aUow it to grow. Money wtil be the determining factor and we wtil aU be held in suspicion about what is going on in Australia. We ought to at what is happening and how we are to survive. If honourable members opposite want people to think we are part of some plot, that we are being supported and that on the basis that where there is smoke there is fire all the allegations are being made are true, we will continue criticised and they will not only be doing the national Parliament a great disservice but also they wtil be domg themselves personally and the electorate and Australia a great disservice. The poltiical parties wtil survive under a better sysafter tem than we have at the moment. The Minister asked me not to speak for too long so I want to conclude on these points. It is very imponant that the Electoral Act of Australia and the media laws of Austraha are structured so that the pohtical parties are putting over a view which is doing something to Uft the consciousness of the Australian people. The Australian Government, not long after it took power in 1972, gave 18-year-olds the right to vote. Do honourable members opposite want the John Singletons of Australia to be the determining factor of how those young people progress politically? Do they want them to look at 30-second as as though they are looking at an Omo, Rinso or some other kind of commercial, or do they want people to get up and debate the issues so that the electorate can determine what is right and what is wrong? It is extremely imponant that members of this Parliament and people outside tbink seriously of about what is going to happen in Australia if laws are not altered. As afirststep information about the moneys that are donated ought to made public. Also, we ought to be looking at the media laws to make sure that some decent political content is given out to the electorate.",77
235,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The first question to ask oneself in a deinbate such as this is: 'Why the need for such sweeping changes?' I refer to them as changes. I not choose the word 'reform' as the Minister So for Services and Property (Mr Daly) apparently chooses. Of course, the purpose of the Bill is to make certain that any political association of political parties is registered. The legislation political parties to disclose the sources of he their funds and Umits their expenditure. Of course, this is a curious approach but I suppose one has to see it in the context of the Minister's career in his present portfoUo. This is not the first 'reform' that he has introduced into this House. we We had a Bill before us which sought to change the electoral laws with regard to redistribution of electoral boundaries. We are yet to judge the look outcome of that legislation. The Minister introduced a Bill in respect of optional preferential voting. Does anyone suggest that optional preferential voting would not distort the result of a House ofRepresentatives election? Such a system might not have much impact upon a Senate that result but it would certainly have a vast impact to be upon a House ofRepresentatives result. I have noticed that many of the changes, not only in respect of this legislation but also in respect of other legislation, have been proposed a Minister and his colleagues have been on an around-the-world trip. This happened with respect to legislation dealing with trade practices, urban and regional development, and taxation. The iniquitous capital gains proposal came after a hurried trip around the world. No one objects to Ministers travelling overseas as long they bring back something of value to this country. It seems to me that a trend is developing in which the most regressive forms of approach, all designed as part of a sociaUst objective, are being put forward by ministers after they have made trips around the world. I ask: Why have we this phobia about having to follow slavishly overseas countries? Surely within Australia we can identify our own problems and find almost all the solutions. The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), said that although there is legislation of this land in the United States of America, it can be got around. Of course there is a tremendous number of cases of corruption and malpractice in the United States and in other countries where they have had legislation of this type. When we go overseas to learn, let us bring back something of value, not just pohcy areas for us to follow slavishly. What is the justification or need for these sweeping changes in our electoral laws just now? The Australian Electoral Office enjoys a very desirable reputation. I am not aware of any conpolitical cern within the community or within the parliatered. mentary system throughout Australia of the need for sweeping changes. Of course there are some imperfections in the Electoral Act but these oritarian, discriminatory poUcies which the Minengage ister for Services and Property has brought into the House are completely unacceptable to us. The real problem today is not within the trahan electoral system; it is within the Ausmain trahan economic system. Furthermore, Labor Minister Party speakers concern me enormously when party they continue to talk about malpractices electoral system. In the 2 years that I have been in this place I have heard Dorothy Dix questions addressed to the Mmister-n o doubt we wtil more of them-and we have heard innuendoes, inferences and accusations about malpractices. do not think such talk does us any good as institution. I do not believe it does the parliamenproposals tary institution or the profession of politics real good to have these constant innuendoes and inferences. The honourable member for Port diture, Adelaide said: ' I do not have a phobia about multinationals'. The fact of the matter is that Labor Government has a phobia about multinaRepresentatives tionals. If the Government and its supporters continue to make these accusations it will be there quite fair for us on this side of the House to at the conscription of trade union funds and look at some of the friends that this Government has made in communist countries. After all, the left wingers of the Labor Party have some very curious acquaintances and there is now evidence as of Government Uaison and co-operation with some of those countries. Nobody denies that private enterprise supports the Liberal Party and the Country Party. We give it aU the support we can and we reflect its views in Parliament. Naturally it gives us its financial support. It took this Government 2 years to discover what private enterprise was all about. It was only in Terrigal a week or two ago that the Labor Party wrote acceptabtiity of private enterprise into its conference record. It is natural that, apart from a few misguided people, the bulk of private enterprise support will come to those who intend to implement private enterprise poUcies and to provide a higher standard of Uving for Australians through that system. I do not want to go into the Bill in detail because we have been asked to reduce our time of speaking as a number of honourable members on both sides of the House want to contribute to the debate. However, I want to refer to a couple of detaUs. The first is the requirement that all parties or associations have to be regisTo me, that is an unacceptable invasion. It is too limiting on Australian society. People in this nation have everyrightto engage in political authactivity. If a conservation council wants to in poltiical activity over an issue in its State or area it has every right to do so. This aspect of the Btil strikes at the very heart of Ausdemocracy. It seems to me that probably the thrust and the real long term intent of the for Services and Property is to get a twosystem. This brings his phobia in regard to in the the Country Party into proper relief. The second detail I am concerned about is the matter of fund raising and the need, in the mind hear of the Government, for all donations to be disclosed, whether at party level or at candidate I level. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr an Kilien) indicated how ridiculous some of the were. To my mind, this intrusion into any privacy is unacceptable in Australian society today. Another provision of the Btil limits expenand here we have a host of arbitrary rules andfigureswhich are going to be placed on parthe ties and candidates-if there is a House of election, if there is a separate Senate election, if they are both held together, if is a double dissolution, or indeed if there is look a referendum. They are very arbitrary rules and to if they are broken substantial penalties are imposed by means of fines. This could lend itself to creating tremendous distress for righteous and very honourable members of the Austrahan community. We in the Opposition oppose the legislation. We oppose it on the ground that no evidence been given by anybody-by the Minister or any of the Labor speakers-whic h demonstrates that there is a need for such sweeping organisation discriminatory and authoritarian changes, no evidence whatsoever. I should hope that the Government can get its priorities in order. This not a major issue within Australia. There concern in the Australian community that there are malpractices within the parliamentary sysby tem. I am not aware that any concern has expressed by the Austrahan community that polKtilen) itical parties are dishonest. I should think average Austrahan would regard it as important to maintain his or herrightson the question pohtical affiliation and on the question of what contributions are made to help a candidate or party. This Government ought to get its priorities in order. It is not the electoral system that needs reform; it is the Government's economic pohcy. Instead of spending some hours this afternoon on this debate we would have done better to $100. spend the time discussing the tremendous lem of over 300 000 unemployed in Australia, government which has still not recognised the need for new economic pohcies and the fact that continuing inflation is going to drain the resources and the growth of this country. I should hope that the Minister will give thought to ing a second look at this Bill. If a Bill were introduced which sought to remove in a reasonare able way some of the imperfections in the present Act then I am quite certain that the OpThose position would support it, but the Bill in its present form is completely unacceptable to us, and of course it will meet its rightful fate in other chamber.",78
236,Mr CROSS,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The purpose of of this Bill is to provide for the disclosure of financial support received by Austrahan political parties, not from their own members, not from the Uttle people in our society, to use a term that the late Mr Chifley used to use, but from powerful of income. business interests or others in this community who might from time to time, given one or another or given the issues that come before the people at those elections, place substantial amounts of money behind a political party in order to give it an unfair advantage, in order wield real economic power. I am interested that in this debate on very sensible and pragmatic changes to the electoral law, on several occasions speakers on the other side have mentioned that they are concerned with the economic situation. They have admitted that they are the spokesmen for private enterprise, for free enterprise in the Australian community. The Government is not contesting any of those things, but I was has interested in some comments made by the by honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron), who said that his central party put no significant amount of money into his campaign. I think he said that it did not give him a brass razoo, and I would tbink that is this is the position with many, if not most, is no honourable members. The finance which is raised for our local political campaigns is raised the sacrifices of Uttle people Uke the friend of been the honourable member for Moreton (Mr in the poultry industry. It is raised by the that the people we know who belong to our party branches who perhaps run a small function in of their home. They might run a small-doubtles s illegal-raffl e at a party branch, raffling some a smaU thing to make a few doUars for the party. No one wants to inhibit that sort of political activity. It is the activity of the ordinary, decent Australian. Honourable members will notice that the limit on subscriptions to a pohtical Party is In Queensland the subscription to the probLabor Party by a member of a branch of the a Labor Party is $5 for the current year. Mr Bourchier-It is $3 in Victoria.",80
237,Mr CROSS,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"We are trying to raise the stanhavdard of the Party in Queensland. Relatives of mine who, for reasons best known to themselves, supporters of the Country Party pay a subscription of about $100 to the Country Party. subscriptions are perfectly legal. Let us cut the reality away from the myth in these areas. This Bill is not one which is designed to restrict the the ordinary activities of decent Australian people, whatever their political persuasions might be, when they support the political party their choice. It applies equally to the Australian Labor Party in that donations made by trade unions or business people to the ALP must also be disclosed. Tbis Bill is not one which requires only the Liberal, Country, National or other non-Labor parties It requires all poltiical to disclose their sources parties to diselection close their sources ofincome. The honourable member for Moreton referred to an occasion on which the wrong cheque arrived at the Liberal Party office. He said that to he was embarassed at the amount. Let me remind him-h e knows of it-that there is an arrangement between political parties when these tilings happen. The Labor Party participates in an exchange of cheques when, through some defect on the part of somebody's secretarial staff, a cheque goes to the wrong political party. Let me tell him that I have vivid recollections of an election campaign some time ago when the Labor Party in Queensland received a cheque for $20,000 which was made payable to the Liberal Party. When we exchanged it with the Liberal Party for the cheque which should have come to the Labor Party our cheque was for $5,000. I assure the honourable member that these accidents are not peculiar to the Liberal Party. They have been known to happen to the Labor Party as well. Without any doubt the vast forces of capital in this nation are behind the conservative parties on the other side. In the 1972 election campaign National Party candidates in Queensland were given up to $20,000 in some cases towards their local campaigns. Some candidates for city seats got $12,000 towards their campaign, plus what the party organisations raised locally. This matter was one of concern not only to Austrahan who believed in democracy but also to the Liberal Party because National Party canpay didates were contesting Liberal Party seats. note that the honourable member for Griffith quoted from a document which he attributed to the Labor Party. He said that it was an extract from a campaign report. Allow me to quote from a letter dated 19 December 1974. It is addressed to a businessman in the Federal Division of object Griffith. It is signed by D. M. Cameron M.P., member for Griffith. It reads: I mention another point of concern. During the State election campaign I became aware of that the Party was plundenng the Griffith one Liberal candidate, fighting a once called impossible State seat in Griffith, was informed, upon requesting cial help: 'We've just given $X to Mr Y from Party quarters.' The donor was rung by another man and was genuinely surprised and regretful when it was explained that cent of the donation would be given by the National/Country Party to the lone local non-socialist eral Party. Granted, there is no law to stop them obtaining funds from any place, but please ensure your friends who share non-socialist views fully understand the difference, because it's crazy when we have difficult, more sensitive, metropolitan Federal seats, for money bon country areas. Each electorate should raise its own finances. The Liberal Pany is Australia's largest free enterprise and non-socialist Pany, and the vote on 7 December confirmed this. Having pointed out that there is some dispute about the way in which money is raised, I might add that it was not always that the Country Party was opposed to the disclosure of pohtical party funds. I quote from Hansard of 17 October 1973. The Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) is reported at page 2243 to have said: The Prime Minister and Mr Daly will no doubt be disappointed to leam that the Country Party has no concern at all about the proposal to legislate for the disclosure of the sources of poliucal parties' funds. However, we will be proposing at least one amendment to the legislation when it is introduced, and that is that donations or subscriptions to pany funds should be tax deductible-as are the union dues which help finance the Labor Party. Further, I am wondering why the disclosure requirement is to apply only from now, and is not retrospective. Perhaps the members of the Country Party who are present might care to do something about the views expressed not very long ago by their Leader. I am under a commitment to restrict my speaking time in this debate, but I would like to say that the Labor Party in the federal Division of Brisbane has never received anyfinancialassistance at all from the central organisation of the Party in Queensland. We raise our money by the any sacrifices of the Uttle people who make up the Labor Party, the ordinary people who not only their party dues but by various means, by a I self-imposed levy or by ruruiing small social functions or the like, raise the money that is necessary to fight election campaigns. This is the support from the ordinary people that ought to determine what the poltiical balance is in this country. I venture to say that none of us would to poltiical fund raising of that kind. What we are concerned with is that where political parties are receiving vast amounts of money from mining companies as the National Party received recent in 1972 and doubtless later, the sources are Country disclosed. We have heard infinite talk about the electorate for funds. In fact wealthy trade unions behind the Labor Party. finanWe are not afraid to disclose the sources of our Headfunds. Why is it that those on the other side of the House, the members of the Liberal Party and of the Country Party, are afraid to disclose the not one resources and the faceless men who stand behind candidate, or the Libtheir poltiical parties?",80
238,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"This Bill belongs to a long category of BUls introduced since December 1972 which Ulustrate that this Government beUeves that if there is a malady or to go straight into the blue riba potenual malady in the community there is only one way in which to excise it or stop it and that is by regulation. In other words, bring in a law which says that you cannot do that or you have to do this. This legislation, Uke so many other pieces of legislation, is based on what I believe to be a totaUy false proposition. On reading the second reading speech of the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) I note that he himself does not really in his heart of hearts believe that you can cure wrong doing or you can stop wrong doing by passing laws because there is a very interesting paragraph in that speech at page 132 of Hansard which reads: Up to the present Australia has been most fortunate it has not suffered any serious electoral malpractices ' Watergates' and as Australians we tend to pride ourselves this regard. Has it ever occurred to the Minister or to speakers who have supported him in this debate that it is in those countries that have the sort absurd restrictions and absurd requirements that this Bill invites that the malady which the Minisfive ter seeks to stop with this legislation red? Does he recall that it was in the United States of America with the most complicated laws for the disclosure of pohtical funds which suffered the tragic experience of the fate of the President and the Vice-President? Does it sink into the members of the Government that you cannot stop pohtical dishonesty by making laws and passing rules? You cannot do it in way. You cannot cure all the ills of the Australian society. You cannot stop new ills emerging simply by passing legislation. I for my part am totally opposed to the concept which is enshrined in this Bill. I do not believe that the Government has made out a case for this legislation. Throughout the speeches of Governmy ment supporters we heard innuendos suggestions about where there might have been some kind of corruption. The honourable mempredecessor ber for Corio (Mr Scholes) started to talk about an example. He did not offer any proof. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) expressed tremendous fears about might possibly happen in the future unless did something about the situation. He gave solutely no proof or evidence of political tion. No case has been made out for this legisexamples lation. No demonstrable need for this legislation has been advanced by the Government. Therealter fore I do not think the House ought to endorse the invasion of privacy, the deprivation of fidentiality and the sheer prying into people's private affairs which are inherent in this legislation. The absurdity of the consequences of provisions of this Bill has already been pointed out very well by the honourable Moreton (Mr Kilien). This Bill represents a natural culmination of a long and paranoic campaign and obsession on the part of the Australian Labor Party about business contributions to the Liberal Party and the Austrahan Country Party. I was a little astounded at the speech made the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I listened to it with great interest. I respect the contribution which the honourable member for Port Adelaide made as a member of his Party's organisation to the efforts of that Party during in that the 1972 election campaign, but I was absolutely or astounded to hear a man of his pohtical experiin ence say that election campaigns are won and lost during the 3 weeks before the election acthe cording to the volume of media advertising which is conducted on a central basis. Surely a of person ofhis political experience realises that if a candidate does not have an election won four or weeks before the election day he is really uphas occurhill to win it. What is so really farcical, quite apart from the philosophical objection that can be mounted against this legislation, is the proposition that the both expenditure of huge sums of money in an elecnot tion campaign can change the result. What evidence has been demonstrated to show that elections are won or lost according to the volume of that money that has been spent? The honourable member for Port Adelaide cited an example. He talked about my colleague, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). Did it ever occur to him that my colleague, the honourable member for Sturt, may have won his seat back because the people of Sturt, after they had heard colleague's predecessor, realised that they and had made a mistake in 1969? I would Uke to give him an illustration. My in the 1961 election campaign faced one of the most expensive efforts ever mounted on behalf of an mdividual member of the Austrahan Labor Party in the person of the former what Lord Mayor of Sydney. The volume of money we expended in the Bennelong campaign on behalf abof the Australian Labor Party in 1961 would corrupdwarf to pigmy proportions the amount in cited by members on the Government side. The amount spent in Bennelong did not the result. My predecessor still hung on. So the proposition that elections are won or lost acconcording to the quality of advertising or the amount of money spent on an election campaign is absolute nonsense. I am astounded that people with the poltiical experience of the honourable member for Port Adelaide, and indeed other some honourable members who have spoken in this debate on behalf of the Government, should admember for vance that proposition. The other thing that intrigues me about this piece of legislation and the arguments that have been advanced by Government speakers is this: 1 wonder how some of the expenditure incurred by by the Department of the Media in the name of informing the Australian public would stand examination under some of the clauses and provisions of this Bill, because since this Government came to power we have witnessed a massive increase in the amount of public money expended in the interests of propaganda on behalf of the Government. We even had a situation at the time of the 1974 double dissolution campaign where a very large sum of money was spent on behalf of the Australian Electoral Office, designed to reduce the volume of the informal vote in New South Wales. That sum was expended for one reason-to reduce the volume of the informal vote. Of course, we all know that the Austrahan Labor Party was petrified that the volume of the informal vote would cause it to lose ground in New South Wales. A great deal of money has been expended on behalf of the Department of the Media in order to explain things to the Austrahan people-of course, in a completely impartial and non-political manner. These pubUcations often bear, with their pithy, non-political message, a nice glossy photograph of the responsible Minister. I think of that gentleman who is to go to higher places tomorrow. His photograph looked out at me from the information about the Trade Practices Act. I am sure that other honourable members can think of plenty of other examples. In the past 2 years we have seen pubUc funds used to put around propaganda on behalf of Government. This piece of legislation is phoney piece of legislation. No need has been demonstrated to bring it in. It invades privacy. is designed to entrench the electoral status poltiical parties in Austraha. Why should a polprinted itical party not find it hard to raise money if doing a bad job? My party found it hard to raise money in 1961.1 speak with some experience of sauce, the fund raising fortunes of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. Anybody from any side of this House who suggests that poltiical parties find it easy to raise money use an old saying, talking through his hat. poltiical parties find it difficult to'raise moneywhether they are Labor, Liberal, Country Party or otherwise. This campaign of vtiification of business, this campaign designed to paint a picture of collusion and coUaboration between business and the ties with which I am happy to sit on this side the House, has got out of aU proportions. The truth of the matter is that aU of us have difficulties in raising money. This piece of legislation is a piece of legislation for which there is absolutely no demonstrable need. I strongly support the rejection in to to of the legislation.",81
239,Mr LAMB,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"The Electoral Btil 1974 tackles yet another area of overdue electoral reform. Along with the principles for which the Australian Labor Party has fought of one vote one value, the easing of voting procedures and the facilitating of results to express the wish of the people, the Government now wishes to bring in legislation that will enact 2 demands by the pubUc-for the Umitation of electoral expenditure and forpubUc disclosure of the source of funds. I wtil deal first with the matter of electoral expenditure. The Bill sets out to increase the aUowable amount to be spent by parties and candidates. Obviously the current limits are hopelessly inadequate. I ask honourable members: Who can run a reasonable campaign on the present Umit of $500 for each candidate for the House of Representatives or $1,000 for a Senate candidate? The simple answer is that the limits are outmoded and unrealistic. I remind the House that the $500 is required for a whole range of campaign materials and media-for instance, to purchase advertising, to print pamphlets, to pay for petrol, to pay for rental for an office, to print and distribute how-tovote cards and to pay for broadcasting. I give an example of what is spent. I thank the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) for raising the example. One example of big spending in a campaign occurred in 1972 when his colleague, the the present honourable member for Sturt (Mr a WUson), swamped the former honourable member for Sturt, Mr Foster, with a deluge of adverIt tising. It was claimed by the present honourable quo of member for Sturt in an interview which was in the 'Australian' that he was proud to it is say that he spent on campaigning the equivalent of the cost of 2 chocolate bars and a pie and I think it was, on each elector in it is electorate. I ask the honourable member for Bennelong why the honourable member for Sturt would spend this amount. I recall that the total is, to amount was $28,000. Why would the honourAll able member for Sturt spend that amount of money if he did not think that it would bring results? Is he going to say: ' I spent $28,000 anyway, despite my rhetoric, despite my abUity, despite my arguments and my policies and platform, to persuade the electorate'? I think only an idiot would believe that course of argument. In parmy own campaign I had to suffer my Liberal of opponent spending what has been estimated to be 4 times the amount that I was able to spend. The current law is flouted and must be repealed. The present position is a farce. There would not be a poUtician in any State or in this House who does not generally contravene the provisions of the Act. Under the legislation politicians are limited to spending no more than $500 on their election campaign. The average expenditure in an electorate, even forgetting some of the larger rorts in spending on advertising, is around $5,000. In fact, ifwe were to claim our expenditure was $500 we would be committing perjury. So most of us fail to fill in our declaration forms showing the amounts we have spent. Electoral officials say that they cannot remember anyone ever being prosecuted for breaching the law. The present law encourages neither obedience nor prosecution for disobedience. The Umits on spending, as I have said, are farcically low. Many candidates have said both publicly and privately that their campaign has cost many more times the amount they have claimed on their expenses returns. As the Mmister summarised so aptly, unenforcible, unrealistic law is bad law. If we must change the law we might ask: What is a reasonable limit that will not favour the encumbent over the chaUenger? What amount will not give large parties an advantage over smaU parties or an individual? What amount will permit each candidate to canvass thoroughly his platform and policies and not restrict theflowof mformation to the electors, which is so vital for them to make a judgment and a proper deliberation on the alternatives avaUable? But substantial amounts of money should not be spent on 'pop' advertising. What balance can we strike between unfair advantage and poltiical freedom? Australia's people have requested that the changes be made. Not only in Austraha but also overseas has there been demand for a Umit on advertising. The United States House of Representatives on 11 August last year passed a Campaign Financing Reform Bill which is designed to halt fund raising abuses such as those which occurred in the 1972 presidential election. So I would remind the honourable member for Bennelong that, rather than preceding the debacle called Watergate and all its attendant impact on democratic elections, the restrictions followed the abuses and were a direct result of those abuses. This Bill is designed to prevent, to circumvent, those sorts of abuses. The United States legisAgency lation went through almost unnoticed amid the furore of President Nixon's resignation. The Bill was passed by 355 votes to 48 less than 2 hours before he tendered his resignation. In other words, the voting numbers showed almost across the board agreement, regardless of party, that this was a desirable hmitation on electoral expenditure. The Bill Umits presidential candidates to an expenditure of SlOm. The general election expenditures were set down at $20m. But for individual candidates the House set a $60,000 Umit on congressional campaign spending and $75,000 or-this is the important part-5 c per citizen of the State for Senate contests. We have taken a leaf from the United States book. We have taken a simUar perspective after taking into account the different sizes of our electorates and the style of our campaigns. I would like to pomt out one factor that has been overlooked. The present Act set an absolute limit. There is no growth factor to take account of the increase in the size of electorates. By gearing a set amount to each of the electors we have an inbuilt growth factor. For example, now I am required to spend a maximum of $500, the same amount as my predecessor, Mr Jess, was able to spend when he won the seat in 1969 with only 55 000 electors. When I was elected in 1972 that number had crept to 69 000. Now if an election were held tomorrow, heaven forbid, I would have to spend not more than $500 to campaign to 85 000 voters. If we do not put a limit on spending, the Australian counterparts of the Kennedys and the Rockefellers would be the only ones who could run for office. We do not support the attitude of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) who advocated the abolition of any limit. It must be the right of all to run for Parliament. To allow unbridled expenditure would deny poorer citizens and independents equaUty of opportunity to effectively stand for Parliament. The other aspect of this very important reform in electoral matters is the pubUc disclosure of the sources of party funds. This will end the secret donations system by which outside organisations can supposedly exert financial pressure on governments. The fear the public has is that these secret donors exert a behind-the-scenes influence on Opposition poUtics and policies, and on governments. How far is this fear justified? In a book called 'Looking at the Liberals' launched by the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon), and edited by an ex-Press Gallery journalist, that journalist claimed that Central Intelligence money was avaUable to the Liberals to fight the last election campaign in May. He said the funds were avaUable without asking and with no strings attached. The right honourable member for Lowe, the former Prime Minister, stated that to his knowledge his Party did not receive money from the CLA. But whether the Liberal Party did or did not receive that money is only half the story. The pubhc will not be content unless it is aware that this is not occurring. Freedom from outside interference, particularly from a foreign country, must not only be a fact but also must be seen to be a fact, and this is what this does. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) said that the Bill is authoritarian. This Bill has full public support. According to a Gallup poll published in September last year 80 per cent of all Austrahans think that pohtical parties should say where their money comes from. The poll questioned 2014 people aged 16 or more in all States and asked: 'Do you think that pohtical parties in Australia should be required by law to reveal the sources of their funds?' The replies varied only sUghtly according to poltiical opinions. A total of 85 per cent of Australian Labor Party voters answered 'Yes' compared with 77 per cent of Liberal-Country Party voters. But single poUs are often misleading so I turn to yet another poll taken one year earUer and published in September 1973. That poU found that 58 per cent of Australians were against companies or individuals making large donations to political parties. A convincing 78 per cent said that poltiical parties should be obUged to supply fuU detaUs of the sources of their income, they key to the proposals in this Bill. The Opposition can make small talk of the pubUc's concern. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Ktilen) can talk of his Uttle old lady's omelette and of his gifts of loaded dice and ludo sets to his coUeagues but his act of olity gives the Ue to his concern stance in his rebuttal. Perhaps a snakes and ladders set might have been more appropriate for his Party and his friends in New South Wales who are sliding down too many snakes and have not climbed a ladder for many years. Mr Daly-Why not a monopoly set?",83
240,Mr LAMB,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"As my friend has said, why not monopoly set? That would be more in the Oppobasis sition 's line. The difference is that when this goes through they will not collect an unexplained $200, passing gaol or not. Butrisingabove this nonsense is the concern of the people which can be summed up in these words: those bearing gifts'.",85
241,Mr KING,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,In the few provisions minutes that Government supporters have left me there are one or two things I would Uke to about this Bill. Mr Nixon-Tak e your time.,85
242,Mr KING,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"I wtil not take all mytimebecause I assured the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) that I would give him ample time to conclude this debate before the sitting was suspended. Bill However, I am a little disappointed with some Government speakers who perhaps overstepped their mark a little. I want to referfirstlyto the remarks of the honourable member for Pon Adelaide (Mr Young). I believe that he summed up the real reasons for the introduction of this Bill. He made great play of the multi-nationals and the Liberal and Country Parties having more funds than the Labor Party. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) started talking about buying poltiical support. If one puts these 2 issues together it is obvious that one of the reasons why the Government has introduced this Bill is that it beUeves that outside this place it cannot match the Opposition parties in any way in getting office so it wtil try to do it through legislation. In this House last night I spoke about cheap political propaganda. This was mentioned again this afternoon by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I draw attention to a simple Uttle card about community relations which states: 'Nice people come in all coloursAustralian Government'. That looks pretty good until one turns it over and sees where is comes from. On the back is a photo of a certain gentleman with his wife and famtiy, a former member of this chamber, the honourable A. J. Grassby, who is now an appointed officer. We do not employ his famtiy, so why should we get cheapfriv Mr Kilien-It is a scandalous waste of taxand to any subpayers'money.",85
243,Mr KING,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING,"Yes , of course it is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money. I am informed that Government sources paid for that Christmas card. Another point I want to raise is in answer to a number of Government speakers who made allegations of a great contribution of funds to the Australian Country Party. I wtil venture to say a that most individual contributions on a dollar are given to poltiical parties other than the Bill Australian Country Party. In other words what I am trying to say is this: The Country Party's all campaign funds are dependent on individual membership of the Party and there are very few 'Beware of donations outside that. Under the present Act, in accordance with the laid down some years ago, a candidate is permitted to spend $500 in a campaign say and he must put in a return within so many days after the election. As far as the parties are concerned the funds are unhmited. The Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), in his own words, said that this provision is being ignored. I agree with him. Why do they ignore it? This is the all-important point. The simple reason is that the candidates are unable to run a campaign on such a miserable sum of money. Of course this Bill proposes to increase the amount according to the number of constituents within an electorate and specifies the amount that may be contributed by the candidate and by the Party, with different amounts according to whether the election is for the House ofRepresentatives or for the Senate. If an electorate contained 50 000 electors a candidate would be entitled to spend $2,500 and the party would be entitled to spend a further $3,750, a total of $6,250. There are any amount of electorates throughmember out Australia in which it is absolutely impossible, on today's costings to run a campaign for that figure. I mention the average country electorate which may have up to 20 newspapers. If one looks at the cost of advertising at $1.50 an inch and works out how much a reasonable amount the of advertising would cost one will find that could not do much for less than $300 per paper. Multiply that by 20 and see what is the result. There are how to vote cards which would cost about $ 1,000. No honourable member can run campaign without having a pamphlet. That Party accounts for another $1,000. What does that strings total? I have not even mentioned radio, telecollected vision, hall hire, postage and all those sorts of things. It is absolutely impossible to conduct campaign on this budget. So this legislation force people to try to campaign either in a disthis honest way or to carry out a very poor campaign. I will agree that if every party were to expend no money at aU we would sttil get a simUar result. Nevertheless, we are not prepared to do that. Now that the Government has decided that it wtil introduce a redistribution plan to enlarge many of the countiy electorates, country electorates might have had 20 newspapers-if they were anything hke some the ones in Victoria such as the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Mallee union (Mr Fisher) who will take over some of the elecan torate of Wimmera-the y will finish up with about 30 newspapers. How could a candidate campaign on these amounts as outhned? Really what will happen is that the Bill wtil force candidifferent dates to appoint agents. No doubt any genuine, honest agent wtil not be able to make the declareral ation required, so he wtil carry out a pretty campaign. Virtually, what we are domg is invitthere ing outside, irresponsible people to take part in campaigns, make statements in support of candidates, make donations on the quiet and all those sons of things. I believe that we wtil do more damage by the introduction of this Btil than we would if we were to leave the situation as it now stands. It is aU very well for honourable members in some electorates. For example, I refer to the Mmister for Services and Property. Dear oh dear, the Minister would not even need to hand out a how-to-vote card in his electorate and he would still win the election handsomely because he holds a blue ribbon Labor seat. The people in that electorate do not know how to vote any different way. I do not know how the previous speaker in the debate, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Lamb) and the honourable for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie) will carry out efficient campaigns. I might add that during the campaigns for the next election they will not want to spend a simUar figure to what they spent during the last election campaign. They wtil need to add another nought to figure that they spent otherwise they will not one see which way the Liberal candidates went. Personally, I have no objection to making public the donations to poltiical parties. I am a proud of the money that flows into Country funds. It is absolutely clean money with no attached. As I said before, the bulk of it is from individual members within the Party. Make no mistake about it; this Bill sets up a the machinery for a real Australian Watergate. I wtil ask honourable members to mark by words. If Btil is introduced within a few years we will see plenty of Watergate-type incidents in Australia. The Bill represents an infringment of the rights of the individual. It will squeeze people out of political life and bring about the establishment of the old principle that the Labor Party of today wants. It wants a 2-party system finishing up with a one-party system as soon as it gets the where some opportunity to do so. What will it mean if this Btil is implemented. of Does it mean that we should carry through its principles to State elections, municipal elections, elections and all sorts of other elections? If example is set in this place, of course it must be carried through. The Australian Labor Party is quite happy to accept the way the trade union movement carries out its elections but it wants a set of circumstances to apply when it has strong opposition from parties hke the Liband Country Parties. I am sorry that I cannot poor make further comments on this matter because are a lot of other things I wanted to say tonight. I promised the Minister that I would finish my speech in less then 10 minutes and that is what I do. I oppose this Bill as strongly as I posslegislation ibly can.",85
244,Mr DALY,AUSTRALIAN HOUSING," I want to reply very briefly to some of the comments that have been made. Irrespective of the side of the House on which members sit I think they will agree that the debate on the Electoral Bill has been an interesting and informative one. It has shown that honourable members are keenly interested in this problem. I thank honourable members for their co-operation in terminating their speeches a little earlier than might have otherwise been the case. Let me say to put the record straight that this Bill has not been introduced for any ulterior motive. Its provisions apply to every pohtical party and every candidate standing for office in this nation. There is no discrimination whatever. We beheve that the Bill represents an attempt to end the secrecy that surrounds the funds collected not by any particular political party but by every candidate and party running for office. In effect, it will make known to those people in the community who are contributing to campaign funds what candidates are receiving. In every way, it will make the position open to the public. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), mentioned that the present law is farcical. A candidate for the House of Representatives can spend $500 on his campaign, regardless of how big the electorate may be, and a Senate candidate may spend $1,000 on his campaign. I doubt that there is a member of this Parhament who has not spent many times that amount in election campaigns. The number of members who will not obey the law and who will not make a return of expenditure is too great to add up. Yet I understand that since Federation no member of Parliament has been prosecuted for breaking this law. Conversely, every second citizen who breaks the law is immediately charged under the law and is expected to comply with it. Until we change this system members of this Parliament can be elected to Parhament and break that law by receiving funds donated from God knows where. We believe that in that secret way the whole of our democracy is being upset. This is not a socialist plan or anything of that type. Most conservative countries in the world have implemented such legislation. For instance, Canada and the United States of America have such laws. In Canada similar legislation was supmoney ported by all pohtical parties. It was introduced by Mr Trudeau himself and it will take effect. The Canadian legislation is more extravagant than our proposed legislation. The Canadian gives members the right to post letters to their constituents two or three times a year and in addition enables the making of subscriptions to the campaign commitments of members. The expenditure, however, is restricted. Australia is dragging way behind on the question of party funds which can influence the opinions of candidates. Let me give a simple illustration of what can happen. If some chap gives a member $ 1,000 for his campaign that person would be dead unlucky if he could not get into see the member, but if poor old Bill Smith comes in from the street wanting to see the member the member would say he was too busy to see him. However if word came through that Bill Smith had paid $1,000 into the kitty the member would get this campaign organisers to usher him in. I do not cast any reflections on honourable members but there is always the inference that donations given to parties or to members can have an influence. Now is the time toflushout any such suggestion. Any member of Parhament and any party is entitled to receive donations from any source but the amount members and parties spend should be public knowledge and everybody should know who it is that is supporting the candidate or the party. I am amazed at the change of opinion that is evident in the Opposition. When the Labor Party challenged the Opposition about receiving contributions from multinational corporations the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) entered the chamber and said: 'We will support this legislation'. The Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) is on record, as mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross), at the same time as saying: 'We have nothing to fear in this legislation and will make only a minor amendment to see that such donations are tax deductible'. Why the change of attitude? Members of the Country Party tell us that they are not afraid to disclose the source of their funds, but they must be ashamed if they do not want the pubhc to know about them. I do not say that the Labor Party does not have a skeleton or two it would want to reveal but I suggest that this Bill gives an opportunity for all parties in Australia and for all candidates to lock those skeletons in the cupboard and to go straight in the future. From now on, if this Bill becomes law, everybody will know the source of that helps to elect members to this Parliament. Is the Opposition afraid to let the people of Australia know where it gets its campaign funds? If it is not ashamed of the source of those funds why should not the people sitting in the galleries of this chamber and the millions of people who are listening to me at this moment know where those funds come from? Why should the pubhc not know these details? The Labor Party is not afraid to reveal such information. It has introduced the legislation, will support it and will see that it is carried out. If members opposite are not afraid to indicate the source of their funds they should support the legislation. In 1973 the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country Party said, in effect, that they welcomed it. At thai time their parties were not getting the dough because they were on the skids, but now their coffers are full. The money is coming in so they will not let the nation know where it is corning from. They should take the good with the bad. When the money is not coming in large amounts they do not mind revealing those who support them but when it is coming in, as it is now, they should likewise let the people know the source. Little did I dream that this once great party-if I might coin a phrase-opposit e would ever be ashamed of the source of its campaign funds. I should like to know, for instance, who put in the $50,000 that each of the Country Party members got during the last Queensland elections. The honourable member who led the debate for the Opposition, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) made a speech which would describe as extravagant, entertaining empty. Undoubtedly he had not read the Bill and consequently was unable to advance any sound reasons for not disclosing the source ofhis funds. The honourable member is a top grade lawyer the small debts court but he is out of his depth when debating electoral reform. Honourable members curtailed their speeches so I will not talk further. I conclude by suggesting that almost every member of this Parhament is breaking present electoral law. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) said that members cannot be told to do this or that. The present electoral law says that a candidate for the House of Representatives can spend only $500 and a candidate for the Senate $ 1,000 on an election campaign but if some honourable members opposite did not spend fifty times the prescribed amount I will give 100 quid to the Liberal Party. The situation is that every member is breaking the law. Funds are being poured into all parties at different times and the public does not know their source. It is time that the people of this country knew what members or what parties are dominated by various interests. It is time that the sources of all funds were revealed. We do not want any Watergate in this country. We do not want a Watergate in any shape or form. The revelations of Watergate have brought to the attention of every domocratic country the need to know these things. The funds paid into pohtical parties and to candidates must be known to the public, vouched for and restricted. Every poor man is entitled to have as much opportunity to get into Parliament as the richest man in the community has. How can anyone compete with the Liberal candidate in the Macarthur electorate who has said that he will spend $40,000, even though according to the law only $500 can be spent by an individual in his campaign. I do not care much whether he spends that sum but I think that we are entitled to know where he has obtained that money. I summarise the debate in this way: This is a sincere attempt by the Government of the day to make political parties reveal the sources of their funds and to require candidates to do the same. I am ashamed to think that the Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Snedden) and the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) have backed down from the welcome that they gave to these proposals about 18 months ago. But I say to the Austrahan people that this legislation represents a forward step in line with thinking in democratic countries which seek to keep politics free of the I implicauons and imputations which go with and money power poured into party funds. We have had great records here as parties and individuals of high integrity in our parliaments. We can make that record better by knowing where party in funds come from. We can give all people the opportunity to be elected, knowing full well that their expenditures, incomes and other related matters will be known. Above all else, we can take the great democratic step forward in this the country and keep in line with other great democracies which have realised how necessary people and this requirement is.

249,Unknown,PAIRS,"Sitting suspended from 6.6 p.m. to 8 p.m. FAMILY LAW BILL 1974 Debate resumed from 12 February on motion by Mr Whitlam: That the Bill be now read a second dme. Upon which Mr Stewart had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill should give expression to the following principles: (a) that the family is the basic and stable unit of the Australian society; (b) that marriage should be buttressed; (c) that marriage should be permanent and secure; (d) that full and proper recognition and rights of a woman as wife and mother; (e) that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage; (f) that there is need for for by a present parent; and (g) that marriage should be dissolved only when a Court is satisfied on objective grounds that the marriage has irretrievably broken down or that the parties have Uved separately and apart for not less than two years'. Mr Snedden- I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. You will recall that immediately after the House adjourned last night I raised a point of procedure with you in relation to the Family Law Bill and gave you an indication of the terms of a point of order. I proposed to raise in relation to it. For the sake of completeness I will repeat the point of order now. To put the matter in its context, Mr Speaker, the question before the House is 'That the Bill be now read a second time', to which an amendment has been moved by the Honourable F. E. Stewart, Minister for Tourism and Recreation and seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong, Mr John Howard. I will not read the terms of that amendment in its completeness, but the amendment starts off with the words 'That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words-'.The words after 'That' are 'the Bill be now read a second time'. If the amendment were carried the question would be substituted therefore 'That the words proposed to be included be so included'. There was considerable discussion among members of the House-no t in the chamber formally but around the chamber-as to what would be the true consequence of a vote for the amendment. I think it is fair to say that a number of honourable members felt that they would like to support the principle contained in the amendment but that they would not hke to see the Bill defeated by their support of the amendment. Dr Gun-That is right; they want to sit on the fence.",90
250,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! Second Reading Mr Snedden- I will continue. The honourable member for Kingston was quite unable to contain himself, but I am sure that he will be able to do so from now on. So, against that background, many people who were wanting to vote in favour of the principles contained in the amendment were wondering whether in doing so they would kill, to use a term, the Bill. When I came into the 'whilst not declining to give the chamber last night and learned that this matter was causing concern I asked whether you had given a ruhng on it, Mr Speaker, and I was told that in terms you had said that to vote for the amendment would be to end the Bill. Therefore I went to you and asked you what your ruling was be given to the status and you were kind enough to provide me, through the Clerk, with your statement on the question of the amendment. In that statement you said 'That the words proposed to be omitted children to be reared and cared stand part of the question' would be the immediate question. Then you went on to explain the position. Thefinalpart of it reads: The effect of carrying the amendment would be that the question for the second reading of the Bill would not be carried. Those words led people to the conclusion that because the question for the second reading of the Bill would not be carried the Bill would therefore die. I raised the question with you for the purpose of clarifying the point. I would like to refer you-perhap s you have had an opportunity of looking at it in the interim since I raised the matter with .you last night-to the booklet entitled 'House of Representatives-Shor t Description of Business and Procedures'. I refer in particular to the reference at page 41 of that booklet to a 'reasoned amendment'. I would agree that the amendment that has been moved by Mr Stewart and seconded by Mr Howard is what could be described in parliamentary terms as a reasoned amendment. The booklet entitled 'Short Description of Business and Procedures' on page 41 states: The effect of carrying a 'reasoned amendment' is not technically conclusive. The House refuses, on a particular day, to read the Bill a second time and gives its reason for such a refusal. According to modern practice it would appear to be unlikely that, after a 'reasoned amendment' had been carried on the second reading of the Bill, any further progress would be made. But incumbent amendment, if agreed to, does not necessarily arrest the progress of the Bill, and a government could, if it saw fit in particular circumstances, take procedural action to restore the Bill to the Notice Paper and have the second reading moved on another occasion. I think what the House needs to do is to direct its attention to the difference between this Bill, which is a Bill on which there is a free vote, and a Government Bill. I readily say that if it were a Government Bill and such an amendment as this were carried it would be incumbent on the Government to consider whether it had lost the confidence of the House or whether it would redraft the Bill and bring in a new Bill to test the confidence of the House with the new Bill. That would be the position if it were a Government Bill. But as we all know, quite clearly and conclusively in all our minds, this is a Bill, although it has been introduced by the Government, which was introduced for the purpose of testing the Parhament. It was so treated in the Senate and it is being so treated here. I therefore acknowledge that this situation is possibly unique. I know of no precedent for it and because I know of no precedent for it I must argue what I think is the correct course that should be followed. If you will excuse me, Mr Speaker, I will make reference to the amendment as it is. The amendment reads: Whilst not declining to give the Bill a second readingIn those words it indicates that it wants the Bill to goonthe House is of the opinion that the Bill should give expression to the following principles: (a) that the family is the traUan society; (b) that marriage should be buttressed; (c) that marriage should be permanent and secure; (d) that full and proper recognition be given to the status and rights of a woman as wife and mother; (e) that there should be wife and chUdren in the event of a dissolution of a marriage; (f) that there is need for chUdren to be reared and cared for by a present parent; I interrupt myself to say that I do not think there would be conflict in the House on paragraphs (a) to (f), but when one comes to paragraph (g) one finds it reads: (g) that marriage should be dissolved only when a court is satisfied on objective irretrievably broken down or that the parties have Uved separately and apart for not less than 2 years. That is in fact an issue which will have to be determined by the House. Mr Enderby-That is the punch line. Mr Snedden-That is the punch line, as the Attorney-General says. That issue will have to be determined by the House because the Bill in its present form, to use a few short words, provides for one year's separation as distinct from 2 year's separation. Given that paragraphs (a) to (f)have no warrant to say this-woul d have the general support of the House I think it would be a pity if the acdon of people voting for them had the consequence of killing the Bill. The House will in fact be able to vote on the issue contained in paragraph (g) as a pristine question moved as an amendment to clause 48. Given that background of what the issue is and what I detect to be a fairly strong view in the House, which should not be overlooked-as distinct from knowing the numbers, because there has been no division-and the purport of the extract that I read out from the booklet entitled 'Short Description of Business and Procedures', which I think comes from May's 'Parliamentary Practice'-the Clerk would know that-whethe r that is so- I am proposing to you, Mr Speaker, that your ruling last night was not incorrect but it stopped short of stating the full position and that your ruling ought therefore to be extended to cover the extra situation which is that passing the amendment would not kill the Bill. We would then have the position where, the Parhament having clearly expressed its view-if one assumes the amendment is passed-it would be incumbent upon the Attorney-General on behalf of the Government to do one of two things. He would either propose amendments forthwith, which would give effect to the opinion of the House as stated in the amendment, or, if he needed time to do so, achieve an adjournment of discussion on basic and stable unit of the Austhe Bill for the purpose of redrafting it to give full effect to what was in the amendment Quite clearly we would have this position: The House expresses its opinion in accordance with the amendment; the Attorney-General then would withdraw to consider whether he could introduce full and proper protection of the amendments to the Bill immediately or whether he would need time to do this. But it would be incumbent upon the Attorney-General to serve the interests of the Parhament in a freely expressed vote from the whole of the Parliament which is not taken on party Unes to bring in a Bill which would give effect to what is contained in the amendment. That is my submission to you, Mr Speaker. grounds that the marriage has Mr Enderby-Speakin g to the point of order, I would Uke to put forward an argument in an attempt to assist you, Sir, in your ruUng. I welcome the intervention with the point of order by the Leader of the Opposition because it is a matter of extreme importance. We all know that there was a certain amount of confusion among honourable members following the introduction of the amendment last night. Honourable members came to me and they went to your offices, 1 Sir, seeking guidance on what was meant by the amendment. To the quick reader, particularly those honourable members who have not had much legal experience, the 2 propositions contained in the amendment seem to be conflicting with each other. One said that the second reading would not proceed. We all know that the second reading is essential for the Bill to proceed to the Committee stage where amendments could be moved and become law. The other proposition seemed to suggest that whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House was of certain opinions. That seemed to be ambiguous and confusing to say the least. May I put this to you, Mr Speaker, for your consideration when ruling on the point of order raised by the Leader of the Opposition which is similar to the point I took last night: It seems to me that 2 matters are involved. One is, of course, the proposition that all words after 'That' be omitted. This means that if the amendment carried the Bill would not proceed at this stage. order? One should then bear in mind the practical aspects of this matter because, as the Leader of the Opposition said, this is not a Government measure; it is merely a measure introduced the Government to elicit the thinking of the House, as it was in the Senate. A free vote is to taken on the legislation which will indicate the opinion of honourable members. As I have said, if the amendment is carried the Bill at this will not be able to pass the second reading stage. Then there is the second proposition, namely, that 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading'- I interpose my own thought here-a this stage or at some stage in the future, if brought back in here by me or someone else at some other stage, the House indicates certain opinions that it has now as to what should guide the House on a future occasion when this Bill again considered. Of course, we know that this House cannot bind itself in that regard. It might theAttention express an opinion in regard to the second propamendment, osition but could subsequently change its mind. reading But as the Leader of the Opposition has said, a away number of propositions are set out in the second contradictory part of the amendment. One of the parts of this have section is paragraph (c) which states that a marBill) riage should be permanent and secure. One likes to the turn of that phrase. It has a ring to it. But one object. also has to bear in mind that when one asserts Senate. the opinion of this House that marriage should be permanent and secure, on the face ofit that in complete conflict with any concept of divorce or dissolution because",90
251,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I think that the of Attorney-General is now debating the matter. Mr Enderby- I do not wish to do that. May put this to you in conclusion? It would be my view that what you should rule on is that inherent in the amendment are 2 propositions. The first, if carried, certainly stops the second reading and the progress of this Bill at this stage. It stops it cold. Then it would be for me, or someone else, either not to be bound by the expressions of opinion offered by the House, or to take it away and proceed to give effect to those expressions of opinion, and to have it brought back either in the form of a private member's Bill or presented by a Government spokesman, for funher consideration at some stage. But the essential thing is that the carriage of the amendment stops progress of the Bill at this stage. Dr Gun- Mr SPEAKER ",92
252,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Does the honourable memis ber for Kingston wish to speak to a point of Dr Gun-Yes , Mr Speaker. I took the opportunity today to discuss this question with the by Clerk of the Senate because, as honourable members probably know, the Senate quite frebe quently adds a rider to a motion for the second reading of a Bill in that chamber which does not have the effect of killing the Bills. The important stage difference between that and what is in the amendment moved by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) is that that is a rider added to the words 'that the Bill be now read a second time' in this form, 'but the Senate t is of the opinion . . .' There is an imporit is tant difference here in that the amendment we are discussing commences by saying 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading'. I refer briefly to the fourth edition of'Australian is Senate Practice' by Mr Odgers which states: is drawn to the amendment in connecuon with Loan (Qantas Empire Airways Limited) Bill 1964. This 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second . . .' has the effect (if carried) of sweeping the motion for the second reading. The amendment is and not consistent with itself because, if the amendment had been carried, the passage of the Bill would been arrested (though this would not be fatal to the and the motion for the second reading would have had be proposed again. Thus the amendment defeated its own This type of amendment is not now permissible in the The point I wish to make is that I believe that on is that precedent in the other chamber-tbi s probably is the only thing we have to go on-suc h an amendment if carried would have the effect of defeating the Bill, as I beheve was the intention the Minister in his short speech to the House last evening. I submit, Mr Speaker, that you I should rule that if this amendment is earned it defeats the Bill outright. I do not beheve that we should take the opportunity merely to bail out the Leader of the Opposition. I think that if a man like him who aspires to be Prime Minister of this country",92
253,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. He rose to speak to a point of order and now he wants to go into a full debate. Mr Kevin Cairns- I take a point of order, Mr Speaker.",93
254,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I do not see why we should debate this matter all night. I have the answer to the problem. Honourable members will resume their seats and listen patiently. There are many honourable members on both sides of the House patiently waiting to debate this Bill. This is my opinion on this matter Last night when clarifying the position in relation to the amendment before the House I concluded my statement by stating: The effect of carrying the amendment would be that the quesdon for the second reading of the Bill would not carried. Subsequently in answer to a point raised by the honourable member for Mackellar I stated: The Bill will be defeated entirely if the amendment carried. This statement has been reported in the Press. is not correct. The effect of carrying a reasoned amendment of the second reading of a Bill referred to in May's Parliamentary Practice page 488. The relevant passage reads: It must be borne in mind, however, that the amendment, agreed to, does not necessarily arrest the progress of the second reading of which may be moved on another occasion. The technical effect of such an amendment supersede the question for now reading the Bill a time; and the Bill is left in the same position as if the for now reading the Bill a second time had been simply tived. The House refuses on that particular day to read the Bill a second time, and gives its reasons for the Bill is not otherwise disposed of. I think this states the position quite clearly. The effect of carrying the amendment to the Family Law Bill would be that the question for the second reading of the Bill would not be carried, but this would not necessarily prevent further progress of the Bill which I would assume would be a matter for Government consideration. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, I raise this matter under the guise of a point of order. It is reaUy a pomt of clarification. I thank you for the ruling you have given and for the clarification you have given to it. I should Uke to take the opportunity, through you, Mr Speaker, of reminding the Attorney-General of the proposition that I put, which was that if the amendment were carried it would 'arrest' the Btil for the time being but it would not defeat the Bill, and it would then be imcumbent upon the Attorney-General to redraft the Btil to give effect to the opinion of the House as expressed. I should like the response of the Attorney-General to that.",93
255,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"That is a matter entirely for the Attorney-General. Mr Enderby-Acceptin g the invitation of the right honourable gentleman, the point that you put, Mr Speaker, seems to me to make good sense. What I would be urging upon the House in such a course is that, in view of the fact that this is not a Government measure, the Committee stage is the proper stage at which to move such amendments and to put in the Bill what honourable members want.",93
256,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The business before the Chair is the Family Law Bill. I call the Attorney-General, speaking for the Btil.",93
257,Mr ENDERBY,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, I thank you. I support the Btil which comes to this House from the Senate. As I have said several times, it is not a Government measure. It is a response to an acis ceptance by the Government of concern in the community about the existing state of the divorce o laws of Australia. I should also say that the It Government accepts, and began the proceedings on, the basis that there is to be a free vote to enis able honourable members both here and in the on Senate to express their wishes. Speaking personally-and that is the only capacity in which I if speak- I also have to say that I oppose the the Bill, amendment because, as I said when I repUed to is to the last remarks of the Leader of the Opposition second (Mr Snedden), I would urge that the form that question this Bill should take is a matter for honourable negamembers to decide themselves in the Committee such refusal; but stages as this debate proceeds. There are so many things that could be said about this Bill. May I start by trying to qualify in an unusual way, perhaps, why I as an individual have strong views about the Btil. Firstly, as a lawyer I had a fairly extensive divorce practice. I would not want to know how many divorce cases I have fought and lost, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien), who sits opposite, would not want to know how many he has fought and lost. But that does give one an insight into the nature of the problem. One is also minded to say that it is a pity, but an unavoidable pity, that so many honourable members, so many people, so many citizens have not really had that experience. I make those comments so that honourable members may attach whatever weight they wish to my following remarks. On a personal pomt, I should also add that I have been divorced once and I have been happily married twice, so I have had some personal experience of the nature of the problems that can flow from a marriage that has failed. Having made those 2 points, let me describe what I beheve to be wrong with the existing law, because that is what we are here for. If this Bill is given a second reading that wtil be an indication that the present law needs to be changed. In 1959 Sir Garfield Barwick introduced the measure which is the basis of our existing law. At that time it was regarded as perhaps one of the most advanced pieces of legislation of this kind in the world. It is an indication of changing community attitudes that only 15 years later there is almost universal agreement that it is no longer appropriate. That is the rate of change which we are experiencing today. Even the supporters of the amendment seem to concede that the existing law is completely out of date and that community attitudes have changed fundamentally in 15 years. The question is: What is wrong with the existing law? If we cannot answer that question we cannot really put ourselves in the position of deciding what should be done about it and what sort of changes are necessary. I suggest that the problem with the existing law is that essentiaUy it rests on the basis of fault. If one looks at tions in the existing Act onefinds14 grounds set out. They come down to us from the old ecclesiastical law. They were good and proper in their day. There is on doubt about that. For many years they have been universaUy under attack because they cause emotions and feeUngs of guUt. They detract from the dignity and the respectibUity that individuals claim to have for themselves. The concept of adultery, the concept of bestiaUty and all the other grounds are nothing but symptoms, I would suggest, of some malaise that has overtaken a human relationship- a relationship that forms expression hi conjugal rights- a marriage. When the marriage begins to fail, for a million different reasons, symptoms emerge. Adultery takes place, cruelty takes place and all the other examples take place that any honourable member can turn to in the 14 grounds that are Usted in the Act. Another basic fault with the existing law is concept of the application for reUef by the spouse, the husband or the wife, who wants protected, wants to caU it quits, wants to wind up, who cannot put up with it any longer or is simply just fed up with the passage of time. Two human beings have grown apart, as surely hapencouraged pens in this world today when wives work and husbands are busy. There is the tension, the rat race if you Uke, that is a feature of modern life. Civtiised people with ordinary, inherent degrees of responsibility say: 'Look, as adults we want to call it off. This law does not take account of those factors. This law says that a petitioner for reUef must go to his or her soUcitor and say whether he or she has committed adultery. The petitioner must reveal the secrets of the bedroom and the secrets of the coffee table and the breakfast table. If the divorce is under challenge, as it often can be as a result of the way in which the guilt aspect is butit into the existing fault concept, it can affect the property settlement. If a wife or a husband has been indiscreet or if he picks his nose at the breakfast table too often- I exaggerate to make a point-in the long term it could adversely affect a possible property settlement, the resolution of the property disputes that might properly exist between the two. It can certainly affect the right of access to and the right of custody of one spouse or the other of the chUdren. This feeling of fault is written deep into our existing law. It assumes that one person is gutity and one person is completely innocent. I notice the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) is looking at me. I know he is a lawyer who has had similar experiences to mine. I know that the law adjusts itself to this sort of thing. the sec- There are good judges and bad judges. The cases, as they have come down to us from the appeUate courts, say that a person must live with this. Nothing could be so bizarre or so extreme as the examples I have put. For those honourable members who have not had experience of the courts, that is the basis upon which the existing law rests. I can recall cases- I am sure every honourable member can-in which this adversary principle which is butit into the law and which assumes that there wtil be conflict between the parties produces cruel, vexacious and expensive results. AU of us who have done this sort of work in the courts know of cases where the inheritance of the children is dissipated because the parties have been encouraged to hate each other to such an extent that they fight on. We have all known cases with silk on both sides, sometimes several silk, which have gone on for years and hundreds of thousands of dollars were the spent with the result that there was nothing left for the children. I can remember a case- I do not to be have the name of it-in which Mr Justice it MCClemens of the Supreme Court of New South Wales drew attention to this very matter because the whole thing rests on this fault basis. If you are to get a divorce by finding the other spouse in bed with somebody else or you try to invent some cruelty ground you feel gutity, you respond and there is an adversary situation and everyone ends up hating everyone else. In effect, you have to hate. You have to fight otherwise you do not get the matrimonial home or you do not get the share that you think you are entitled to-so the lawyer tells you-and you might lose some degree of access to your children. That is the basis upon which our law rests. It has to be said in passing that some judges, being human, are unnecessarily prurient and sometimes partake of being voyeurs of the difficulties in which these unfortunate people place themselves. The whole legality, the wig and gown, the formality and the rigidity of the system have to be considered. I have known people-and I am sure the honourable member for Balaclava, the honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott) know of this-wh o were terrified to go before a court in a simple undefended divorce. This brings me to another point. Ninety-five per cent of divorces are undefended. Ninety-five per cent of divorces are for practical purposes by consent. Ninety-five per cent of divorces reflect that the marriage has broken down but the parties are obliged to go through this cruelritualof saying: ' I have never done anything wrong. It is all your fault. You have been sleeping with someone. You have been bashing me, picking your nose or farting at the breakfast table'whatever it happens to be. The whole thing takes on an unreal aspect and it prejudices the civilised resolution of the property settlement which has to be a feature of any system of dissolving a riage and certainly custody and access of children. I remember a case here in Canberra not years ago in which a man petitioned his wife for divorce on the ground of adultery. The marriage had long since ceased to exist and because of they had Uved separate and apart for years and the man had formed a relationship with some other lady. He had broken off that relationship years after his relationship with his wife had ceased to exist. But when he went seeking a divorce from his wife so he could again he did not put in a discretion statement. fibbed to his lawyer who said to him: ' I have to ask you these questions: Have you ever slept with anyone? Have you ever committed adultery?' The man Ued to the lawyer. The lady with whom he had had a relationship put him into what are symptomsused to be caUed the Queen's Proctor-the Attorney-General's office of the day-whic h under the existing law is charged with probing in an inquisitorial manner the morals of people in this way and his conduct was revealed. The divorce that had been granted was set aside. No one wanted it set aside. The lady who was divorced was happy in her Ufe. Many years had passed. She wanted a divorce. It was virtually a consent situation. The petitioner wanted a divorce. The lady he wanted to marry wanted him to be divorced. The public interest would have been satisfied and it would have been advanced if he had been divorced, but because of these ridiculous barbaric rules which we still have he was not divorced. Defences exist in the present law which are caUed condonation-forgiveness , if you like; connivance, which means bringing it about; and collusion, an agreement to produce grounds for a divorce. I can remember an EngUsh case with which honourable members who know a bit about the law will be famtiiar. I do not say that it is necessartiy foUowed today, because judicial attitudes change. A man came home and found his wife in a compromising situation with some chap. The marriage was at an end. The couple were not unhappy about that fact. They were civilised people. The husband had had a few drinks and he said: 'If you bloody-well want to go to bed together, why don't you? He went away and slept on a couch somewhere. His wife and the other chap did go to bed together. Later on when the husband sued for divorce he failed because it was held that he had put them up to it, that he had connived at the commission of the adultery. How absurd. The marriage had finished. It had beenfinishedfor years. He was mar- denied reUef and his wife, who wanted to marry someone else, was denied relief. So one could go on. many Mr Sullivan-WU l you speak about this Bill?",93
258,Mr ENDERBY,PAIRS,"I am telting you why this law as we have it today cannot conunue. The people that who support the amendment wtil defer at this stage our opportunity to change the existing law, because that is what the Speaker has ruled. Mr Kevin Cairns-Unde r your law you could to the court not bring that matter up. marry Mr ENDERBY-That isright.Under our law He you could not bring it up because it would be irrelevant, and it should be irrelevant. This law-it is not my law but I support it-seek s to introduce a simple objective test: Has the marriage ceased to exist? It getsridof those considerations which Mr Kevin Cairns-That is not the test.",95
259,Mr ENDERBY,PAIRS,"I think it is. Please may I finish, because mytimeis running out. One of the great features of this Bill that comes to us from the Senate is that it gets rid of a lot of the aspects I have mentioned. It gets rid of the legalism because it establishes family courts. It tends to reduce the influence of the lawyer. I speak as a lawyer who has the role of deciding these matters. It introduces people with other quantisations- I am sure the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) would appreciate my point-in the humanities and social sciences and welfare work to try to bring about conciliation in a less rigid, less legalistic, less frightening way than under the present system. May I remind honourable members that basic to this Bill is not only the removal of the whole adversary system of proving fault and non-fault and having to say: 'Who has the greater degree of fault? Is my adultery better than yours?' This incredible investigation takes place, today often financed by legal aid. It should not be financed by legal aid because the fault provisions should not exist. Is there to be a more civilised and more rational approach through family courts? One of the major things which for practical purposes will be stopped under this Bill, if the amendment is carried, is the great advance that that has been written into the Bill to reduce this rigidity and legalism by substituting famtiy court procedures. The Bill, as it comes to us from the Senate, where it has been accepted by our Senate adult colleagues, says that it is time we got away from the fault concept. We will never change human nature to a great extent-w e all know that-bu there is no good inflaming it. It is no good crecide ating an abrasive situation in which people have to defend themselves for the sake of defending themselves and in which private inquiry agents have to be engaged to spy through windows, raid houses, to slip in and take photographs with cameras with special sophisticated electronic equipment and use electronic listening devices bedrooms to ascertain whether couples are using progress. words of endearment to each other. The private inquiry agents say: ' If they are using terms of endearment we might be on to something'. What is a term of endearment? They say: 'We will come back tomorrow night or the next night'. That is the law we have at the moment. We put up with it years ago. If progress of civilisation means anything it means growing up. It means moving, as one writer said- I forget who it was; was Mayne or someone-fro m the old concept of status to contract. That should appeal to memstep bers of the Liberal and Country Parties. reflects the paramountcy, the primacy, of the human spirit and individuality. People able to make their own Uves and not be caught up in a system of this sort. The Bill provides for a simple breakdown test. I personaUy take the view that the Bill does not go far enough, although I support it wholeheartedly. Later when this Btil goes into the Committee stage, as I hope it wtil, I wtil be seeking to introduce yet another principle. I do not for one moment hold out any great nope that it will succeed. The amendment I wtil be moving can be moved only in the Committee stage. I intend to move it because basically I believe in it. It is this, that subject to proper and satisfactory arrangements being made for the welfare of children, and particularly if there are no chUdren, what adult people do is primarily a matter for themselves as long as they do not break the criminal law, do not offend their neighbours and are not guilty of breaking the law of torts. Our whole criminal law rests upon the notion of individual responsibility. That is the whole basis of Judeo-Christian society and the upward progress of men and women so that when they reach adulthood-whethe r it be 18 years of age or 21 years of age-the y are aUowed to do what they want to do as long as they do not break the law. It is true that they make mistakes. I will be introducing an amendment that will say that, in the case of consent, where satisfactory arrangements are made for the children, if the parties are and responsible the period can be reduced to, say, 3 months. I am a happily married man. My children are grown up. My wife is a respont sible woman. If for some reason or other we deto get divorced it is no one's business but ours, although that wtil not happen because we are happily married. That is the principle that I commend to honourable members although I to know fuU well that it wtil not gain very much support. I put it to honourable members as the road we are travelling and as the road we must in continue to travel because it is the road of As I have said, I support the Btil. I think it reflects everything for which this country should stand. All the arguments that are being used against it were heard in 1857 when the first matrimonial causes law was enacted in Britain. If one reads the pariiamentary debates of 1857 one wtil find that the opponents of that measure used it exactly the same arguments that are being used here today in relation to this measure. As every has been taken to improve the law the same It arguments in opposition have been put.",95
260,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order ! The honourable should be gentleman's time has expired.,96
261,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"I have not the advantage of being a lawyer but the which social and legal consequences of this Bill are great that I do not judge that fact to preclude from expressing a view about it. In thefirstplace I intend to express a view about the basis of the Bill and about some of the points that have been made by the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby). can understand his position and, were he to go some way along the road which will be contained this in the amendments to the Bill-som e of which I legal luminary will propose- I would assume to have his vote in in terms of the advantages support. Thefirstquestion to be asked in respect of this Bill-it is so obvious that it cannot be ignored-is : What is its conception The Bill concerns the Australian family. What is given its view of that? I go for my answer to that question not to the former Senator Murphy, I go not to the present Attorney-General because he has admitted that he was not intimately acquainted with the subJustice stance of the Bill until a day or so ago, but I go one of its principal architects. I tlaink that acknowledged around Austraha that he has been an unofficial adviser to the Government. I go to Mr Ray Watson QC, a Sydney silk, acknowthe ledged to be a defender, an architect, almost a father of this Bill. Mr Watson and another archithe tect of the Bill, Mr Turner, at the Sir Thomas More Society meeting in Sydney in late came November 1974 were asked: 'What does the Bill do with respect to the family?' There are some quaint illogicalities between this view and a view later expressed. They were asked QC, MrGormly: The question I will then put in the light of Mrs remarks is this. What comments do Mr Watson and Turner make on Mrs Lonergan's contention that the Bill in effect changes the structure of marriage? Because if in the structure of marriage is effected you have changed considerably the structure of Australian society. introduce a Hindu concept of marriage into Australian ciety it is a different one. of marriage you have changed Australian society considertralian ably. What comment do you make on this? Mr Turner, speaking on behalf of Mr Watson, obtain had this to say: If I might say, Mr Gormly, the way you put that and one cannot run away from it, and within the terms that you used, I would say the answer to what you say is yes. There is a very fundamental change and alterof ation proposed in the nature of Australian ciety. So I was a Utde puzzled when the same gentleman, speaking on the radio program 'PM' the night before last, which in time is closer debate taking place on this Bill and tents are perused a Utile more closely, had this to say when asked what conception of family there was in the Bill: There's no philosophic change in the concept of the family I would see as one of the building bricks of society. so So at least there isflexibUityand changeabUity in me the minds of those who have proposed the Bill. They are certainly not sure of their phUosophical grounds. I think it is appropriate and fair to go, as a source, to its defender and its originator. I One other point that I would Uke to make in Watson regard concerns a comment made by Mr who is a Sydney sUk and therefore a in these matters. He has this to say of the Bill: But more importantly, they'reof the family? ChUdren, that is the right to separate representation, and this is particularly necessary . . . That is one of the great new virtues proposed for the Bill. I mention that in passing. But Mr Watson knew that, in a case which came before Mr Selby in Sydney more than a year earlier, to that right was given on the interpretation of the it is present Act and that right has been given subsequently throughout the State. So virtues claimed for the Bill, if passed, are doubtful, and philosophic nature of it has to rest in extreme doubt. I say no more than that, except to add that argument that this Bill is merely a logical extension of what occurred in 1959-the Act into operation in 1962-mus t be regarded with some doubt. It is not a simple, logical extension; it is a very radical and fundamental change, and it ought to be seen to be that very radical and by a Sydney fundamental change. I need to mention one other matter in this Lonergan's regard before I come to what would be the Mr power house of the Bill and those sections of it a change which require sensitive matters of justice and fairness to be implemented. For the first time in If you Australian law and Australian practice, the Bill, soin clause 6, recognises polygamy within AusIf you introduce a Muslim concept society. According to the proposed Australian law, a person going overseas, whether he is married or whether he is unmarried, can a wife in a country which recognises polygamy, and that is recognised as a marriage for quesdon, the purposes of Australian law. I merely point out those matters to indicate that if it is suggested that the Bill is merely a simple, logical extension the present law and the present social strucsoture such as we have known it, that is not the case. After aU, divorce is based upon the precept that there is one marriage. If it breaks up another to the one may be negotiated. Polygamy does not even when its conrest on that foundation. So, Mr Speaker, you can understand that not being a lawyer I do not intend to sit by and allow what I regard to be fundamental changes in Australian society and Ufe to go without at least some legitimate content. Divorce is a dreadfuUy sad thing, and if it is to be dealt with it has to be dealt with in terms of sympathy,firmness,fairness and justice. I do not beheve there is a person in this chamber who would want to go back to the arguments advanced just after the beginning of the second half of the nineteenth century. I do not want to do that and nobody else in this chamber would. Society has altered, but I have looked at what would be a fair thing under the precepts of this Bill. I refer to clauses 48 and 49 of the Bill. They are its powerhouse. They are the ones which contain the no fault provision, which is the package under which this Bill is sold. But what are the consequences of the appUcation of that no fault provision? Let me give three, and I think it is appropriate to look at these. Imagine a marriage which may be very unhappy and in which one of the partners to it is gutity of behaviour that would not be acceptable in the Australian community. Let me mention the behaviour. Let us say that one of the parties to the marriage is gutity of incest, bestiaUty, sodomy or some other very grave misdemeanour. Under the present position a petition for divorce rightly can be served and once the ground is demonstrated the divorce is granted. Imagining the position of a woman in such circumstances, that is a fair comment and it is a fair practice. Under this Bill, except by way of some very compUcated procedures which may or may not which be vaUd, the other party to that marriage would just have to sit out the time, the other party would be paying a price for the package of this Btil which has a so-called no fault concept. What the members of this House have to ask in their sense of justice is: Is that a proposition? Is that a vahd proposition? Is that proposition which would then enable them to say to what would be the guilty party in that situcast ation: 'You have been a good law abiding citizen according to Australian law'. That is the power which this Btil gives, that is the power of judgthat ment which this Bill would confer were ParUapeople ment to make that the practice in Australia. amendment covering that situation will be they moved in the Committee stages and honourable members in this House in their judgment will have to decide on the fairness of that proposition. I wtil mention two other consequences. They relate to the proposition that a 12 months ation, which can be a separation in mind, is all that is needed. When one looks at a 12 months period it seems to be very Uttle longer than the period it takes from conception to the birth of child. I wtil give an Ulustration of the events that can and wtil occur under this Btil. A chtid is conceived and, not on account of it but coincident in time with it, the male partner to the marriage says: ' I want to be separated'. So a separation occurs in mind and goes through the 12 months. At the 9-month stage the wife goes into a maternity hospital and has a baby. It might be a couple of weeks overdue and perhaps it is 9'/i months later. Within eight or nine weeks of that event whilst the mother is in the post-natal condition, whilst she may even be in the position of having what is termed post-natal madness, the problem that comes on women who have had a difficult childbirth, the 12 months is up. As soon as the courts can hear the case the computer comes down and the divorce is through. There is no pomt in her saying: 'Judge, I did no wrong. I tried to be a good wife. I have just had a baby'. The one test, and there is no other which is required, is the 12 month test. Mr Kilien-You are completely right.",97
262,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Moreton with his great sense of justice and knowledge agrees with that. What is to be proposed? What the honourable members in this chamber wtil have to decide is what is their sense of fairness and their sense of justice in that situation. They will have to decide ultimately whether that man-obviousl y I refer to a man in this case-is a good decent law-abiding citizen by the precepts of Australian law. That is the title this Btil, if it becomes an Act, wtil enable you to pass upon people who participate in that the 12 months, and situation. I wtil cite a third case to honourable members. It is proposed that this is a Btil that has a great fair deal to do with the equaUty of women. I do not a want to scarify or mention Mr Watson again but he said in the interview for the 'PM' radio broadthat the Btil was a charter of equality. Consider the other case. On 1 January in a particular year the husband may get into that mental state a separation is under way. They are young who were married in their middle twenAn ties. The separation continues whether or not live in the one home, and whether or not the household services are performed one for the other-the y are not defined in the Bill-bu t by the eighth month, perhaps by August, the wife is rather anxious to rebuild her marriage. Perhaps the husband is also. That is a fair proposition. So, separanxious to rebutid the marriage in terms of clause 50 of the Btil they cohabit. Presumably, this means they sleep together again, which is fair enough. They are anxious to rebuild the mara riage. They sleep together again for 3 months. At the end of October the husband may say: ' I have had enough of this. I have found somebody who is a Uttle more interesting. I want to resume the separation'. Under the terms of this Bill, 8 months of the 12 months separation needed for the divorce have been served already. The husband has only to wait another 4 months until the end of February of the next year. The computer time has been set at 12 months. The marriage is over. The woman may have faUen pregnant. It is no good for that woman who is still carrying his baby saying: 'What have I done? I have tried to be a good wife. I have tried to be a good mother'. There is no point in her saying that because the one condition contained in this Btil has been satisfied, that is, the computer condition of 12 months separation, however determined. Consider the position of that woman.  under existing legislation.",98
263,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,But that is 3 months in 5 years which is very different from 3 months 12 months.  terms.,99
264,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"But this is compuagree, terised in the sense that this is the only test under this proposed legislation. The honourable  that under this legislation, that is the only test. There is no quaUfication upon it. That has to be remembered. In June of the subsequent year when the woman has the chtid and is a patient in the maternity hospital, are honourable members going to say that that is divorce without indighearts, nity? Are honourable members going to say that that is divorce with justice? Are honourable members going to say that that is a fair go? Are honourable members going to say with respect the person who may wilfully or otherwise have gone through this series of actions that he is therefore a good law-abiding Australian citizen, a very respectable Australian citizen? I merely put those cases. They are 3 cases which can occur and which witi occur and which every divorce lawyer who has a practice in various capital cities of this nation, whom I have been able to consult, says wtil occur. I believe that very intimate and careful judgments have to be made with respect to these matters. During the committee stage of the Bill these cases will be explored and amendments wtil be proposed. They wtil not be amendments going back to the 1959 or 1962 legislation, but amend the ments which will aUow a Uttle moreflexibUityin respect of the time and the conduct of the marriage to be explored than occurs under this Btil. I believe that this Bill does not give the dependent partner in a marriage, whether a male or female-mos t often a female-sufficien t guarantees. Are young people entering upon marriage to be asked to place themselves in that dependent position with respect to their work-to leave work-to place themselves in a dependent position of having a chtid or place them in a relatively dependent position of being home makers. I ask honourable members to ponder whether there are sufficient guarantees for women or for both partners of a marriage to enter into marriage. The principles contained in clause 43 of this Bill should be acceptable to everyone. But the principles in clause 43 have almost no effect because they are contrary to so many other clauses of the Btil. They are quoted by people. They are even quoted to public audiences by the eminent Sydney SUk. He knows, as every member of this in House knows, that principles stated in that way contrary to the laws stated expUcitly elsewhere have almost no effect. Every pohtician knows that when in a difficult situation and not wanting to give an answer, he might say: 'In principle I while in substance he may arrive at a completely different decision. I have dealt only with memtwo provisions but they are the power house clauses. They concern the nature of the marriage itself and make it clear that the package no fault is not a package that has any truth; that the so called relegation of indignity and bitterness is not relegated. All that is done is that it is swept under the carpet and allowed to fester in the minds, activities and feelings of those who have been wronged, which in most cases is the dependent partner in a marriage. It certainly is not a Bill which has anything to do with the to rights or equaUty of women in that situation.",99
265,Mr ELLICOTT,PAIRS,"This Bill is the subject of a motion for amendment. I do not believe that the House wtil prevent this Bill from going through to the Committee stage. I think the common sense of honourable members wtil enable this Bill to go to the Committee stage whatever happens. I find it very difficult to take one side or the other with regard to the amendment because I believe that there are some parts of this Bill that are basically good and there are others which should be changed. When one examines the object of this Bill in clause 43(a)the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life-on e might well expect the remainder of the Bill to carry those objects into effect. Those of us who approach the Bill will no doubt search through it to see whether this is so. There are many aspects of the Bill which clearly are aimed at achieving them-for instance, the provisions encouraging counselling and reconciliation. There were, of course, provisions for this in the existing Act. They were introduced in 1959 and have been effective to an extent. The provisions in this Bill go further and I beheve they are better. It is proposed to establish separate courts in the States designed to deal with matrimonial matters with a minimum of formality and pubUcity and, broadly speaking, in a closed court. I believe that the introduction of closed courts is a good move forward in the area of famtiy relations. It wtil afford great protection for people. Their private lives can be exposed without any other person present other than those who need to know. Then, of course, there are provisions for the welfare and custody of children and the general requirement that proper arrangements in all the circumstances have to be made for the welfare of the children before the decree nisi becomes absolute. The proponents of the Bill are to be congratulated on these and other like provisions. As I said, they represent in some respects, though not in all, advances over existmg provisions in State and Commonwealth law. Significantly, if it becomes law, this Bill wtil represent the first broad encroachment of this Parliament into marital relations in the period between marriage and divorce. Previously, our tifies basic concern has been with the formation and dissolution of marriage and ancillary questions. This Btil would cover the whole field and would enable it to be governed by one system of This is surely a highly commendable and desiratake ble objective. The attempt to cover marital relahis tions from the time of marriage meet constitutional objections. If it does, it is to be hoped that complementary State legislation will be passed to enable the objective to be achieved satisfactorily and within a State famtiy court system. In one important respect the Btil provides means for adopting what I believe to be the best means through which to exercise the jurisdiction created by it. We have already debated in this House the Superior Court Btil and we then became familiar with the reasons why federal jurisrests diction could best be exercised by State courts. SimUar considerations apply to jurisdiction over family matters. There is no reason why the whole jurisdiction within a State should not be exercised by family courts controUed and estabUshed by State law and assisted by Federal money. The Bill, however, does provide for the appointment of Federal family court judges, six in aU and more if prescribed by regulation. These judges must be appointed for life. It wtil not be possible for constitutional reasons to appoint to the Federal fantily court the type of judge regarded as ideal for State family courts by section 41 of the Bill, namely, those who cannot hold office beyond the age of sixty-five. If the Btil becomes law it is to be hoped that steps to appoint these Federal judges will not be taken. They are unnecessary. The jurisdiction in the Territories can be exercised by the Territory judges. In the States, until the State famtiy courts are set up, the jurisdiction can be exercised by State judges, indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in his second reading speech, which is recorded at page 4322 of Hansard, said that. It would be divisive, inefficient, confusing to the public and a waste of pubUc funds to set up a Federal famtiy court with all the trappings of courts and court officers alongside a State famtiy court in the same city, estabUshed in accordance with section 41 of this Act. It is suggested that the Federal famtiy court judges will exercise appeUate jurisdiction from State and Federal famUy courts. Appeals under the present Act go direct to the State full courts. Although there may be isolated instances of diversity between them in construing the present Act over 15 years, no case is made out which justhe setting up of a special itinerant court at public expense to deal with family court appeals. If diversity existed in the State courts it could be cleared up by appeal to the High Court and the law. Attorney-General of the Commonwealth could power to ensure that this could be done at instance by removing diversity appeals into to divorce may the High Court. It is to be hoped that the Government will not proceed to appoint judges to the Family Court of Australia but wiU instead get on with the task of establishing State famtiy courts under section 41. The importance of doing this wtil be more apparent when one bears in mind the constitutional problems which the Btil raises and to which I have already referred. So much, Mr Speaker, for the constitutional and jurisdictional matters. The focus of the debate on this Bill inevitably on clause 48. Two broad proposals are in the air at the moment. The first is that contained in clause 48 itself. The effect of that would bring in what is caUed 'no fault' and a general ground of whether the marriage has broken down irretrievably. The Bill then goes on to say that the only way in which it can be established that the marriage has broken down irretrievably is by having separation for a period of one year. The other proposal is that contained in paragraph (g) of the proposed amendment, which states that marriage should be dissolved only when a court is satisfied on objective grounds that the marriage has irretrievably broken down or that the parties have lived separately and apart for not less than 2 years. First of all, let us be clear that each of these proposals represents a significant advance on the present law. It is not true to say that there are progressives on one side and conservatives on the other. Indeed, each of these proposals is fully consistent with the etimination offault. Let us understand what no fault means. When we speak of no fault we mean that we shall not have a system whereby one party has to prove that the other party is at fault. That is the present system, and there is no need to continue it under either proposal, certainly not under the Bill and, I believe, certainly not under the proposal in paragraph (g) of the amendment. The other thing that I think should be clear is that the second proposal should not be regarded as a rejection of the principle behind the Bill. What is the principle? It is that in determining whether dissolution of marriage should take place you look at the marriage and ask: Has it broken down irretrievably? Or a lawyer in court, because he is getting paid for it, would say: Has the consortium vitae, the Ufe of the marriage, come to an end. You do not approach it on the basis that one of the parties must be shown to be at fault. Tbis is a perfectly humane and, if I may say so, Christian approach to the problem. That is what no fault means. It does not mean that you do not look at the conduct of the parties. In the area of matrimonial relations we delude ourselves if we think we can deal with the legal problems associated with them without ing conduct. For instance, clause 48 sub-section 3 of this Bui states: A decree of dissolution of marriage shall not be the court is satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood cohabitation being resumed. If I may be pardoned for saying so, that is either window dressing or it means what it says. I am incUned to think, knowing a Uttle about divorce courts, that it could be window dressing. Very seldom would there be any evidence before the court to determine that question, because body is obUged to bring it. But if that question were to be looked mto you could not possibly determine it without looking at the conduct of the parties. Again, custody cannot be determined without looking at the conduct of the parties, nor can maintenance or property. Clause 75 (1) (m) relates to other matters and that would cover conduct. Clause 79 (4) (d), which relates to property would bring in all the matters that can be considered in relation to maintenance. So throughout this Bill there is brought into play a consideration of conduct. Do not let us delude ourselves into thinking that we wtil just have a healthy, clean look at the matrimonial relationship and not go into the question of what the parties have been up to. It is just not possible to do so. Clearly enough marriage may be irretrievably broken down for a number of reasons other than lack of cohabitation. Other honourable members have mentioned this before and referred to cruelty, adultery and other things. Let us look at what clause 48 does. In effect it says: divorce is a very unclean thing. It is a nasty business and we wtil not look at what is really worrying you or what is really bringing the marriage to an end. We wtil play a Utde game. We will have a charade. The charade is that parties must Uve apart for 12 months. If they do that and go along to the judge and say that they have Uved apart for 12 months he will give them a divorce. It does not matter whether the real circumstance that caused it is cruelty, attempted murder, adultery, habitual drunkenness or some other form of what we have called matrimonial misconduct but what does not have to be called that any longer. We have to engage in this charade to get away from the nasty aspects of divorce. Matrimonial relationships and the breaking up of them are naturally unpleasant things. It is no good running away from the reality of the situation. What this Bill does, I believe, is to introduce thefiction,the charade. It does not get down to the reaUty of the position. How unreal and unjust it is to teU somebody: 'Yes, it has been cruelty that has brought it about, but you must be separate for a year before considerwe will give you a divorce'. Let us consider these cases taken from the type made if of conduct refened to in the present law. Let us of imagine the position of a woman who goes to a soUcitor and says: 'He has committed adultery and I have proof', and whose soUcitor says: ' I am sorry, lady, but you cannot have a divorce. You have to be away from him for a year', who then says to the soUcitor. ' I have been putting up with his conduct for 10 years and he has been cruel. noHe bashes me once a week. He comes home drunk', and whose soUcitor repUes: ' I am sorry, lady, but you have to be away from him for one year'. One could gorightthrough such situations. She could say: 'He attempted to murder me and has been convicted for it and is in Long Bay'. The soUcitor would still have to say: ' I am sorry, lady, but under the law you wiU have to go away and be separated from him for one year'. How unjust that reaUy is. One has only to go through other cases to show that it is not only unreal but also unjust. Of course the marriage has irretrievably broken down when onefindsadultery. These are not grounds that have been dreamt up by some ceUbate cleric in the middle ages. They are not grounds that have been thought up by the Church. They are tilings that have come out of the matrimonial relationships through the history of time and they are still the types of conduct that break up a marriage, sever the marital relationship and break down the marriage irretrievably. To bring in a Bill that adopts as the ground for causing the divorce something that is artificial and unreal is, I suggest, not domg justice and is sure to cause harm. If this Bill becomes law it will mean that existingrightswiU be defeated. Some members of the House often talk about the preservation of propertyrights.An examination of section 8c of the Acts Interpretation Act will reveal that if an Act of Parliament is repealed the existingrightsare maintained, but for some reason that wtil not be the case under this Btil. Under this Bill they wtil not be maintained; they wtil be destroyed. A man or woman who, at the time this Btil becomes law, has suffered injustice for 10 years, for instance, will, immediately it becomes law, lose anyrightshe or she has at present because he or she has not taken out a petition having been concerned to maintain the marital relationship. We are concerned about preserving human rights, yet I believe that we are going to see a direct injustice in this provision. Clause 48 is unreal and unjust. For those reasons I reject it. It is so because it fails to carry out a principle upon which the Bill is based. One cannot avoid the consideration of the unfortunate behaviour of spouses and at the same time do justice. In the middle ages there were developed in Englandfictionswhich the law adopted and there were famous people called 'John Doe' and 'Richard Roe' who appeared in most property actions. In the 19th century these 'John Doe' versus 'Richard Roe' actions were discontinued and the forms of action died. The Bill, in section 48, contains a form of action in the nature of a charade. It is unreal, it is afiction.It saying to people: 'The marriage has broken down for some other reason, but we are going to make you perform a Uttle play, a Uttle charade, and then we wtil give you a divorce'. I suggest, if I may, that this Bill, in clause 48, could be suitably amended in this way: I am happy with subclause (1). I suggest that sub-clause (2) could read as foUows: Subject to sub-section (3), in a proceeding instituted by such an application, the ground shall be held to have been established, and a decree of dissolution of the marriage shall be made, if, and only if, the coun is satisfied that(a) having regard to the behaviour of the parties the marriage has in fact broken down irretrievably; (b) the parties separated and thereafter lived separately and apan for a continuous period of not less than 24 months immediately preceding the date of the filing of the application for dissolution of marriage. My proposed sub-clause (3) would read: The coun shall not grant a decree based on secuon 48 (2) (a) where the only behaviour relied upon is lack of cohabitation. I would leave in sub-clause (3) which appears in the Bill. I believe that if that clause were adopted there would be a general ground of irretrievable breakdown that could meet the injustice to which I and previous speakers have referred. It would also give respect to the institution of the family to which clause 43 refers. I do not believe that we can do that by adopting simply one year's separation. I know that it is a quaUtative and subjective judgment that each of us must make on this matter, but I do not feel that the provision of one year's separation does sufficient justice to the institution of marriage. I believe that 2 years is a more appropriate period to adopt. If I must be logical about the matter I will say to honourable members quite honestly that I cannot be logical, but I feel that I owe this attitude to the institution of marriage. It is not enough to say that one can show that in many cases the marriage has broken down within that period. One must show respect for the institution. I believe that this can only be done by adopting a period of 2 years. Apart from that, a party who had an immediate ground for relief could go to the court, get his or her divorce and thereby be adequately protected.",99
266,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,102
267,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Whether one is for or opposed to this Btil- I am opposed to it-it has ceased to be a coherent piece of legislation and it should be redrafted. When the former Senator Murphy presented his Bill in the Senate he had a coherent piece of legislation which, whether one supis ported it or not, expressed a consistent philosophy. After 90 amendments were put into the Bill in the Senate it comes to the House of Representatives with all sorts of self-contradictory features to which I propose to draw attention in the course of my address. Although 90 of the 135 amendments moved in the Senate were successful and have made the Bill a poor piece of drafting when it is considered technically, no amendments were accepted to clauses 48 and 49 which are the most doubtful clauses of the Bill. In point of fact it could be said that the former senator in his tactics stood with clauses 48 and 49 as a fort and was prepared to allow all sorts of other clauses to disappear. Whatever the Bill provides with regard to irretrievable breakdown of marriage, in many of its features it is an irretrievable breakdown in logic.",102
268,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I wonder whether the honourable gentleman would speak into the microphone because many Opposition members are anxious to hear what he is saying.,103
269,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"I was saying that whether the Bill satisfactorily defines irretrievable breakdown, the contradiction between clauses such as 43 and 48 produces an irretrievable breakdown in logic. I will ask a Uttle later how a judge can hold both in his mind unless one treats clause 43 simply as window dressing. It is so incoherent as a piece of legislation that it is no testimony to Senate's claims to be a House of analytical review. The Bill professes to get rid of indignities, distress, embarrassments and costs. It professes to bring in more just elements of maintenance, custody and property settlements. It confuses what may in fact be a unilateral declaration of divorce as irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It has been sold on the philosophical appeal of the words 'irretrievable breakdown of marriage'. Of course, everybody believes that if an irretrievable breakdown of marriage has occurred people should not be forced to Uve together. But what is irretrievable breakdown of marriage? The Btil has been sold on that expression and on the emphasis put on counseUing provisions to buttress marriage which are presented as if there were no counseUing provisions in existing law. But the fact remains that one party can be cast off without having any say. One defence of the Btil is specious. It professes to get rid of the concept of fault. It is perfectly impossible to determine questions of custody or to have the best interests of a child determined without taking into account the character and conduct of the spouses. Do honourable members think a judge, in deterrnining to which of the parties the child is to be assigned, cannot take into account whether one is a drunkard, or one is a basher, or one has committed some of the matrimonial offences that existed before? Mr MCKenzie-He does.",103
270,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Of course he does. That is why we cannot get rid of the concept of fault. This is another attractive feature that is supposed to have been put up in the Bill, that here we have a magic formula for gettingridof fault. We cannot getridof fault.",103
271,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,Why then are you attacking it as being still there?,103
272,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,I am not attacking it as being sttil there. I am talking about terminology that confuses,103
273,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,But you want fault.,103
274,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,Of course you have fault.,103
275,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Prospect is to speak next and he will then have an opportunity to answer the arguments put forward by the Minister.,103
276,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"I do not want fault, but I do not believe that the former Senator Murphy was able to abolish sin. The Bill in clause 43 professes that the courts should take into account the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and woman to the exthe clusion of all others voluntarily entered into for Ufe. Where did the framers of the Btil get that? It looks as if they went around to the vicar and said: 'Vicar, give us a definition of sacramental marriage'. When they were given a definition they then said: 'Look, you will have to cut out all references to the Holy Spirit but let us have the effects ofit which is the permanent union of man and woman for Ufe to the exclusion of all others'. The judge has to have clause 43 in mind when determining the meaning of marriage. But the court cannot have any regard for any such principle because without allowing any judicial discretion clause 48 overrides this with the consideration that the marriage has broken down irretrievably if, and only if, the court is satisfied that the parties separated and therefore lived separately and apart for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the date of the filing of the application for dissolution of the marriage. Even that plural expression 'parties separated' has confusing imptications, for the condition is met by the decision of one to leave the others. It is not a mutual consent. I can desert my wife and then divorce her after 12 months. So do not say it is a decision of the parties, in the plural. It can be a decision of one party. As it stands its connotations are that both are deciding to separate but this may not be the case. Obviously indignity and hurt are not eliminated if one party dumps another, especially if there are weaknesses in the maintenance provisions, as there are in this Bill. In dissolution by consent provisions it has been proven that it is easy for the interests of children to be swept aside. Irretrievable breakdown should clearly rest upon objective tests not open to self interested manoeuvres. As a bare minimum the period of separartion should be more than a year. The existing law that divorce proceedings cannot be instituted within 3 years of marriage should continue to exist with existing qualifications to prevent a kind of Pseudo marriage racket. MrMCKenzie-Oh!",103
277,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"It is perfectly possible. I can cite the case of one celebrated Tommy Manvtile who used the law in this way: You have a honeyFederal. moon, you desert your wife and then you take another wife at a Uttle later time. Mr MCKenzie-What percentage of people tually are Uke that? How many Tommy ManvUles do you know?",104
278,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,If they do not marry it is all right.,104
279,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Oh no, he wanted the advandraw tage of marriage because many ladies would go with him unless they were married. The drafthow ing of the provision is so appalling-perhap honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr strongly MCKenzie) will shout about this one-that it is probable that if a serviceman were sent on serhave vice to Butterworth in Malaya his wife could orce him if the fact of separation because of his service was of a year's duration. The continuance of maintenance, affectionate correspondence by letters and the behef on the part of the husband that the marriage was still in force apparently might not count. I do not say that with cerarily taintyMr Enderby-Rea d the following clause.",104
280,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"I do not say it with certainty because I do not see the defensive provisions. The Btil is thus proposing- I think the present Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) was very clear about this and what I say is not an attack on Bill-a n alternative philosophical basis of marriage riage and fantily while professing not to do because the theological part in clause 43 is a fession not to do so. It proposes something can be broken unilaterally without any fundathe mental breach in the relationship-and 'unilapartner terally' means by one party alone. The word 'marriage' has its content altered so that marbe, riage becomes in fact an impermanent associof ation, whtie with astonishing inconsistencyunderstand that the former senator who drafted the Bill or was responsible for its introduction in the Senate did not want this clause-it uses the expressions of sacramental marriage in clause 43. The existing Barwick divorce law is attracted by the action of parties to take steps to divorce, but this law is attracted by the fact that people marry because it is changing the nature of marriage in the Australan community. Justice takes a hammering. Clause 114 would aUow a wife or husband to take action against the spouse by way of injunction on suspicion. These injunction proceedings cannot possibly be considered without the concept of fault. They have to be established. Although the aim of the legislation is to make the proceedings less expensive, no lawyer seems to believe it will succeed. The Fantily Court is to be Jurisdiction is vested at present in State courts and a purely Federal court cannot deal with adoptions or most trustee questions. It is virimpossible for Federal judges to go on circuit and therefore many petitions have to come to the State capital cities. That is a factor of expense immediately. A man on $500 a week could leave his wife to the pension-say , an invalid pension-and not have no obUgation for maintenance no matter caUous his action in casting her over. The s the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun), supporting the Btil, questioned this odd provision that if the person who would ordmarily to be maintained can draw social services, divor has that degree of support, the maintenance obUgation has gone. If this arises after a desertion it seems pretty unfair that this cost may be the cast upon the whole community. This sets the tone, unfortunately, for the maintenance proceedings. Rights are minimised almost necessand logically if it is pretended that wrongs or faults do not exist. The 14 present grounds of divorce are to be replaced by one grand ground of 12 months separation with no analysis of responsibUity for the separation. Three things need be said about injunction proceedings. The first is that they are likely to the overload the courts. Infamous conduct in marcan take place without 12 months separaso, tion-withou t any separation at all-bu t under prothe main provision for divorce in clause 48 it is which incapable of remedy. A spouse may humiliate partner for instance, by producing a de facto under the matrimonial roof. Since adultery and mental cruelty, which this action would are not grounds for divorce under the terms the Bill, the only real redress provided for in I the Btil would be presumably by way of an injuction ordering the spouse to send the de facto partner from the matrimonial home. The second thing is that the injuction proceedings must then in fact make it perfectly clear that there is a fault, in spite of the efforts of the drafters of this Bill to get rid of fault. The court will presumably order the injunction if callous, cruel or malicious behaviour is estabhshed, but by that action you will be estabhshing faulty behaviour. The third thing is that the injunction proceedings, because they must become so crucial in getting any justice done under the terms ofan unjust Bill, will be the downfall of any effort to get the costliness out of matrimonial causes. Injunction, the path to some effort at justice in an essentially unjust Bill, will call for high legal skill within the framework of this legislation. The maintenance provisions are a major weakness in the Bill. Apart from the appalling considerations mentioned before, namely, the injustice of a cast-off wife having to prove that she cannot maintain herself and the injustice of the obUgation to maintain her being cast on the State in certain circumstances, there is also the possibiUty of injustice to the husband. If a woman enters mto a de facto relationship, the present presumption is that the obUgation to maintain her rests upon the de facto partner, but if she proves while in a de facto relationship that she cannot maintain herself the way in which this Bill is drafted means that the husband must pay alimony to sustain the adulterous relationship. I ask the House to look at clause 75(1) (1). When a woman is in a de facto relationship it can sttil be a duty of the husband to maintain her. If the court orders that he should maintain her because the de facto husband is not wealthy enough to maintain her in the style to which her former husband accustomed her, then he has to pay alimony to sustain an adulterous relationship.",104
281,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,That is the case now.,105
282,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Yes , and it should be eliminated. I am not talking about the present legislation. I have got the Bill before me in this House; I have not got the Barwick legislation before me. If you want to ask about the present Act, let me tell you that I voted against aspects of the Barwick legislation and if they are repeated I am gomg to vote against them again. That is aU. It is not illogical. The pomt is that it would be left to the judge, one would hope, but clause (l)(b) looks very mandatory, from the expressions of opinion which I have got. Mr Enderby-It is a basis of need. You have heard of that.",105
283,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Yes, but if you expect the husband to pay for a wife who has chosen another man, then I think you are suffering an irretrievable breakdown in reahsm.",105
284,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,It is a question of sin.,105
285,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"It is not a question of sin. There may be many husbands who are quite glad to continue to pay the wife because they are glad to get rid of her. I cannot cover every single situation. Nevertheless, this provision seems an extraordinary one to perpetuate in our matrimonial legislation. I think that this Bill makes real marriage-the stabUity for marriage from which chUdren derive mental stabUity-depen d more heavUy upon custom without the benefit of legal support. Quite clearly, I do not think that the law ever made marriage good. It is the integrity of the parties to the marriage which creates a good marriage. There is no question about that. But the law ought to buttress, as far as possible, sound custom. It cannot do it entirely. This Bill provides less security to a marriage than is provided by some societies where the State takes no cognisance of marriage at all. In those societies there may often be divorce by mutual consent, but there may often also be, by custom, many safeguards. This Bill provides for divorce by consent of one, with minimal security in the period of separation of only 12 months, and with no security of requiring previous duration of the marriage over any set period. The court has no discretion other than to pronounce a decree if the fact of 12 months separation is established. The Bill cannot be just if there are no objective tests to illustrate irretrievable breakdown of marriage. A wide section of the public would support divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the expression is retained in the Bill for the propaganda value of the words. The BUT does not reaUy provide for a petition of dissolution of marriage. It makes it an automatic application for dissolution of marriage. Infamous behaviour on the part of the person applying does not deprive him or her of the initiative in dissolving the marriage. The Bill is badly drafted. This is no doubt due to the fact that so many amendments were inserted in the Senate and the fact that the proponents of the Bill would accept any amendments other than amendments to clauses 48 and 49. The functions of the family law courts have not been fully thought out. I believe that the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr EUicott) who preceded me in this debate and who pleaded not to establish the federal courts because of certain disabiUties they had but to vest State famtiy courts with federal jurisdiction made points which every lawyer whom I have questioned upon the clause agrees are true. There are a number of provisions which illustrate the Bill's capricious injustice. It would be surprising if there were logical coherence in a Bill which was drafted in one form and studded with amendments from senators who thought quite differently. If a wife is deserted and defends her right to maintenance she will pay for that defence. As one distinguished lawyer puts it, the proposed ground and the proposed cost provisions make marriage the only form of contract which can be broken at the option of the other party, with the offended party then having the right, pleasure and privilege of paying for the breach of contract if he or she opposes the other party. I think these things have not been thought out fully. We need an amendment to divorce law, but we cannot have a Bill brought into the Senate with one philosophy, have hurled into it a battery of contradictory amendments and say: 'Isn't this a marvellous piece of legislation? This ought to be our permanent divorce law'.",105
286,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Minister's time has expired.,106
287,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,"Unlike the previous speaker, the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley), I do not believe in sin, original or otherwise, and I certainly do not think it is the function of this legislature to define and punish sinners. I wish to make only one other point in reply to the Minister. He made a point about somebody being in the armed forces overseas for a year, I think at Butterworth, being a ground for divorce. He said that he had not read all the clauses of the Bill. Apparently he read only the ones which were underlined for him by people who have been pushing against the legislation. I point out to him that clause 48 (3), which deals with dissolution of marriage, states: A degree of dissolution of marriage shall not be made the Court is satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood cohabitation being resumed. Surely the fact that a person had been sent Butterworth by the Royal Australian Air Force would bring such a marriage within the ambit that clause. My view of the Bill is lukewarm. I am quite happy with the grounds for divorce in the present Act plus consent or the proposed single ground plus consent. I agree with the amendment proposed by the Attorney-General (Mr include Enderby). I can see some of the disabilities that were pointed out by the honourable member Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) if we abolish some of the grounds for divorce. I would have no objection to including other grounds for divorce, apart from what I agree with him is the potentially artificial ground of one year's separation. I cannot get excited about this aspect of no-fault divorce. As the Minister for Education and I think some of the previous speakers pointed out, if people want to bring fault into it obviously they can do so. If people are upset because society or many members of society do not behave in the fashion which the Festival of Light would like us to beheve is the norm for society then I do not think it hurts if society knows that the Festival of Light does not represent typical society. I would like in passing to refer to a point made yesterday by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman) which he considered to be important. The honourable member felt that he clinched his case when he claimed that 80 per cent of Pentridge inmates-that is a gaol, I take it, in Melbourne-cam e from broken homes. I would Uke to reply to that in the following way. It is probably not true but in any case I would say that most of their parents were not divorced but were Uving under the tensions existing in house holds where incompatible people had to live together so as to make happy some selfappointed interpreters of God's wiU. I feel that this is basically an argument between those who have little faith in their and other people's morality, but need laws to buttress it because they are scared that all marriages will dissolve if divorce is avaUable, all women will have abortions if they are avaUable and everybody will act in a homosexual way if that becomes legal. I think that is the basic argument. It is between those people who want not only to say that certain things ought to be done because they are the moral and right things to do but who feel defensive and pessimistic about the outlook for society unless a law is used to buttress that sort of behef. They are the ones who continuif ously tell us what is and what is not natural but of they do not believe that people will behave naturaUy unless the weight of the law forces them to to do so. To those people who have not got very much faith in what is natural I say that I would of be interested to hear what is the definition of 'natural' if they believe that people normally behave in an unnatural fashion. Basically I appeal to honourable members to be careful not to be pressurised by small outside groups. When I refer to small outside groups I organisations such as the Abortion Law Reform Association and its opposite, the Right for to Life Associauon; the Women's Electoral Lobby; resident action groups; the Festival of Light; and the Vietnam moratorium organisation, to make the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) happy. I include all those groups. I think it is important that people ought to vote for or against this amendment according to their beliefs and more importantly I think that after having defeated the amendment they should deal with the actual contents of the Bill in the Committee stage. They should vote for or against certain propositions if they really believe in them but not because a vocal pressure group tries to stand over them. The last time that honourable members opposite gave into one of those pressure groups was on the issue of parliamentary salaries. Members of the Country Party now sitting in the corner are about to give into an outside pressure group. They also did it on that previous occasion and anybody who has talked to them since then knows very well that they have regretted it ever since. When this legislation was discussed in the Senate only seven out of 60 senators voted against the Bill after a very long discussion. In this it appears that the proportion of God-fearing representatives who not only know how everybody ought to behave but who also want to enforce this will be much greater. For example, all the Country Party senators supported this measure in the Senate but here nearly all the Country Party members seem to support the peculiar beliefs of the honourable member for Riverina that nobody in the rural areas wants a clean divorce but is satisfied with the spouse and Uvestock. Mr Sullivan- I raise a point or order. The honourable member for Prospect has just suggested that I made some ridiculous and I deny it.",106
288,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no point of order. If new the honourable member has been misrepfended petitions. resented he can ask to make a personal explafended nation when the honourable member for Under Prospect has finished his speech.,107
289,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,"When the honourable memthat ber for Riverina was a distinguished officer in the Australian Army he was in favour of separating up divorce married couples for years or even permanently, petitions but I suppose he feels that death is preferable to Registrar divorce. Arguments of the Festival of Light and 'Another the Right to Life are minimal. These organisdisposed ations send out material suggesting that we ision. should prevent or discourage divorce, abortion of the will and contraception because the countries of eastern Europe do so. Let me tell them now that as far as I am concerned the fact that the Union Soviet SociaUst Republics and its Spain, have a certain pohcy is a prima facie argument against it. I should like to look at some of the arguments of the opponents to the Bill in this House who pretend to be against specific clauses but who are really opposed to divorce in general. I think the important thing for us to remember is that many people oppose the Bill for reUgious reasons. I do not for one minute dispute that they have a right to hold this personal behef that a marriage is a permanent institution. A person is perfectly entitled to that belief, and obviously I would defend bisright-not that it has ever been challenged, as far as I know-no t to have a divorce if he does not want to have a divorce. What I object to is that they want to impose their views on the rest of society. That surely is where this House comes into it and has to take a stand, and I would hope that honourable members are prepared to take a stand. Some people oppose the proposed legislation because they oppose divorce. I think the honourHouse able member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), whom I normally consider to be a very rational and reasonable person, as he knows, ignored the position under the present legislation. I made some points by way of interjection when he was speaking, but I should like to make one point now. I should Uke to quote from a Press release dated 20 October 1974 by Sir Kenneth MCCaw, then Mr MCCaw, who has just retired as Attorney-General of New South Wales. I respect my colleague's view that marriages should be permanent but I would appreciate it if he would see what is happening at the present time. Under the heading 'Speed-up in divorce suits' the Press statement, release states: Quick 8-week divorces will be available in NSW under a 'speed-up' scheme introduced by the Attorney-General, Mr MCCaw. The 'quickie' divorces will apply only to undeIt takes at least 6 months now for an undedivorce petition to come before the court. our legislation the period is one year. People who are opposing the legislation feel that is too short. The Press release goes on: Two Supreme Court judges, assigned exclusively to speed hearings, will deal with at least 400 undefended a week. A spokesman for the Family Law Court said this week: ' Mr Justice Waddell and Mr Justice Yeldham each will hear about 200 divorce petitions a week. 100 undefended petitions a week would be of by other judges sitting in the Family Law div'We hope that by next month an undefended divorce take about 12 weeks to reach'the courts and by the end year only 8 weeks.' Under the present legislation a person can get a of divorce in 8 weeks in New South Wales. The satelUtes, or Press release goes on: There are 10 undefended divorce petitions to every one defended in NSW. The spokesman said that additional petitions would make it necessaiy representatives to keep up to date with the Ust numbers published each morning. Talk about computers, as somebody was talking about them earlier. A person awaiting a hearing for his divorce has to look at the newspaper every morning because his divorce could be on the afternoon. The Press handout concluded: A twenty-four hour telephone service (241 numbers of petitions for hearing the following day. A person may ring that number to see whether he is on the computer for tomorrow. This is the sort of proposition that honourable members opposite are defending as being a reasonable way of dealing with divorce. They are opposing the propositions that are being put up in this legislation as being unfair and against the concept of permanent union. As far as I am concerned- I think the honourable member for Fremantle agreed with me-the State cannot prevent marriages from breaking up. I think the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart), who last night moved the amendment, himself said that. He said: The fact is that marriage counselling can only ful if the 2 persons involved want their marriage to work. The Bill does not, and indeed cannot force an unwUUng party to attend for counselling. He then went on to cite Mr Basil Hogan, a barrister with wide experience, who agreed with that proposition. The point is that no law can prevent a marriage from breaking up. I think that, as far as possible, society should supply the sort of facilities which would enable as many marriages as possible to continue. Whether it be a question of finance, a question of help in the home or a question of help with the children, obviously it is the duty of the appropriate government-Stat e or Federal-to come in and help. But beyond that it is certainly not possible for a government in any country to prevent a marriage from breaking up. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) has returned to the chamber. He spoke about the case of a young woman who had fallen pregnant and who had then been deserted by husband. He said that she could be divorced when the baby was possibly only 3 months old. Obviously, that could happen, but surely the proposition is this: Is she any better off being theoretically married to some man when no divhear orce is possible? Is there any advantage from her point of view? Is there any advantage child's point of view? I put it to the honourable member that the marriage has broken up. It terrible thing to have happened, case. The fact that in theory people are still married does not help the woman or the baby in the for petitioners and their legal least, as she knows. On the contrary, a divorce is likely to lead to some son of financial and emotional settlement which she is not able to obtain at the present time. After all, 75 per cent of all divorcees remarry. Last night the Minister for Tourism and Recreation in attacking the Bill in summarised what he considered to be the likely evil social and economic consequences for the 3421) will list community in this Bill. He said: The first consequence will be an increase in the number of divorces in the community. That is probably so, but the point I would like to make is that it will not necessarily increase the number of broken marriages. In fact I would argue that it would not make any difference to the number of broken marriages. What would make a difference to is the number of people who are divorced rather than the number whose marriages have broken up. The Minister went on to say: Secondly, the provision of support services will impose a financial burden on the community. I say: So what? I am surprised that the Minister who is a distinguished member of the Australian be success- Labor Pany Government is concerned that the provision of support services for people who have been adversely affected by broken marriages will impose afinancialburden on the community. Finally he said: The parties to broken marriages will surfer financial and emotional burdens in making new homes and establishing new personal relationships. That is obviously true. That is what a broken marriage is all about. The people involved suffer financial and especially emotional burdens in making new homes and establishing new personal relationships. Certainly this piece of legislation does not alter that and does not improve on that. That is why I cannot get terribly excited about it. But it certainly does not make it any worse. Last night the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) opposed this legislation. One can understand his point of view in her opposing this legislation because he is very friendly with and is indebted to inquiry agents. He uses inquiry agents himself in poUtics and he probably feels that he is indebted to those inquiry agents. No doubt very shortly we will the result of his last dealing with inquiry agents. So I am not surprised that he feels he has from the a debt to inquiry agents.  is a talking to the honourable member and he did but that is the not hear you.",107
290,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,"Yes. I have enoughtimeto repeat it. The honourable member for Mackellar has been sleeping at the back of the chamber, though admittedly this time with the honourable  ably is a more attractive sleeping partner than he has had for a long time. The honourable member for Mackellar opposes this so called no-fault divorce concept. He believes that adultery should still be a cause for divorce because he is friendly with inquiry agents. He uses inquiiy agents in politics. He is proud ofit. A court case is coming up in the near future. One cannot deal with that in detail, but the honourable member has used inquiry agents and their activities will be dealt with in a case coming to court in the near future. The amendment moved by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and seconded, I think, by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), if carried, would mean the destruction of the Bill as it stands at the present time. The final clause of the amendment, clause (g), reads: that marriage should be dissolved only when a Court is satisfied on objective grounds that the marriage has irretrievably broken down orI emphasise the word'or'that the parties have lived separately and apart for than two years. I put it to the House that it would be a retrograde step if the mere fact that people have separated by itself is a ground for divorce. As the Minister for Education pointed out and as the honourable member for Riverina would undoubtedly be aware, the separation can be a separation which has nothing to do with the aims of the people concerned. People can be separated because they have been forced into separation. Surely the important thing is whether the marriage has irretrievably broken down, and surely the word that should be used in the amendment should be 'and' and not 'or'. Those 2 factors should not be alternatives, but they should surely both be present at the same time. Let me conclude by appealing to honourable members to vote according to their beliefs and not to give into pressure from the Festival of Light or the clergy who are professionally employed by their churches to impose their beliefs on the rest of society.",109
291,Mr SULLIVAN,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",109
292,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,109
293,Mr SULLIVAN,PAIRS,I do. I find it necessary to bring to the attention of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman)firstof all the advantage he has tonight in having his speech broadcast whereas last night I had to deliver my speech to a closed House. Consequently the honourable member's statement that the honourable member for Riverina would have the House believe that all people in the country or in the Riverina are against divorce is completely wrong.,109
294,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,That is what you said.,109
295,Mr SULLIVAN,PAIRS,"I did not make that statement. If the honourable member listens very carefully he will hear again what I said last night. I said: The message from the people of the Riverina is ciystal clear They do not like this Bill. I do not like the Bill either. I was misrepresented also by the honourable member for Prospect in that he said that as an Army officer I was responsible for separating people. That is either a denigration of the profession of arms or it is a weak attempt by the honourable member for Prospect at humour. I would point out to him that this is a serious Bill to be treated seriously, and his weak attempt at wit would be better suited in some dirty, sleazy hotel which he probably frequents.",109
296,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,"I ask for a withdrawal of the not less reference in the last sentence to a dirty, sleazy hotel. Those people in this House who know me would know that I am much less likely to finish up in one of those hotels than is the honourable member for Riverina.",109
297,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",109
298,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,109
299,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Yes . The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) a few moments ago made some allegations regarding inquiry agents and me, and those allegations were utterly and completely without foundation and untrue. But I do not accuse the honourable member of lying because I know that this sort of thing has been spread by members of the Cabinet and by the propaganda machine which Mr Murphy controlled. Senator James MCClelland spoke to a friend of mine on this matter and tried to peddle the same lie.",109
300,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I can understand the honourable member wishing to reply to an imputation against his integrity but I ask bim not to debate the matter. I think he has made his point in regard to the misrepresentation.,109
301,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I can understand this but I wish to speak in view of the gravity of what the honourable member has said. I do not accuse him of lying because I tJiink he is just repeating Cabinet propaganda which has been falsely put about for a malicious purpose and I instance that Senator James MCClelland, the new Minister, used this to a friend of mine in King's Hall and the Press men from Mr Murphy's office have been saying the same kind of thing",109
302,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,OrderlThe honourable gentleman is debating the matter. Debate (on motion by Mr Corbett) adjourned.,110
303,Mr COHEN,PAIRS,"by leave-The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety has recently been giving close attention to the implications and effect in the United States of America and Victoria of the reduction in the number of traffic fatalities as a result of the reduction in absolute speed Umits which were applying in 1974. On preliminary statistics it has been shown that the number of accident fataUties in the United States was reduced by 9400 or about 17 per cent whtie in Victoria it was 131 or about 14 per cent. While there is no conclusive evidence available as yet, preUminary investigation would suggest that the reduction in the speed limit has had a major contributory effect in the reduction of the road toU. In a statement issued in Washington on 21 January 1975 Dr James B. Gregory, the federal highway safety chief, said: These statistics clearly demonstrate the life-saving lowered speed limits and less and we hope these deaths decline even more dramatically the States intensify their efforts to enforce the nationwide mph (88 km/h) and continue their efforts to implement effective highway safety programs. The House ofRepresentatives Committee is the unanimous opinion that the fuU implications of the statistics should be fully investigated soon as possible. The Committee recommends however that in the meantime all States follow the lead of Victoria and undertake to have implemented an absolute speed Umit of 100 kUoand metres per hour on aU highways. The Committee strongly urges that a reduced absolute speed Umit come into effect from the commencement of the Easter week for a trial period of 3 months until the end of the June quarter. The Committee considers that the implemenmittee, tation and enforcement of the cause minimum discomfort and inconvenience and be of little or no cost to the public. With this in mind, the Committee can see no valid reason why a trial period of reduced speed Umit cannot be implemented throughout Australia as a means of reducing Australia's road toU. This is a unanimous decision of the Committee. I thank the House for giving me leave to make this statement. NA INDUSTRY BILL 1975 Bill presented by Mr Enderby, and read a first time. Second Reading",110
304,Mr ENDERBY,CORPORATIONS AND SECURITIES,"Canberra-Attorney General and Minister for Customs and Excise) ROAD SAFETY (lO.lO)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1975, which I now introduce, is the same as the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1974, which my predecessor in office introduced into the Senate. The purpose of this Btil is to provide for the securities industry in Australia to operate on a sound basis with an effective system of controls administered nationally by a commission to be called the Corporations and Exchange Commission. More specificaUy the Bill aims to maintain, facUitate and improve the performance of the capital market in the interests of economic development, efficiency and stabUity. This is in accordance with the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. I am sure it is also in accord with the wishes of all honourable members. The introduction of legislation to establish a value of commission such as the one provided for in the driving. Still more can be done as Btil was promised in the policy speech of the 55 Australian Labor Party prior to the election in December 1972. The Btil has been tatiored to the requirements of the securities industry in of Australia. Many of the provisions are derived from existing State and Territory legislation. But as a number of changes have been made. As the classic example of a Securities and Exchange Commission is to be found in the United States of America, due regard has been paid to the laws practices in that country. In some areas proposals have recently been made in the United Kingdom and some of those proposals have commended themselves for inclusion in the Bill. or In other areas the Btil has taken the opportunity to implement changes recommended by the reports of the Company Law Advisory Comwhich was under the chairmanship of Sir speed Umit would Richard Eggleston. The Bill is, of necessity, a lengthy document, as honourable members wtil discover, and it covers a wide range of complex matters. In its consideration of those matters my Department was fortunate in having assistance from eminent persons from the Umted States of America. I mention only two of them in the interests of brevity: Mr Sol Freedman, a former senior officer of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and Professor Louis Loss, Cromwell Professor of Law at Harvard University and the author of an authoritative work on the securities industry in the United States. Professor Loss submitted a report setting out his comments in the light of American experience. That report was tabled on 12 September 1973 and comment invited to assist in the preparation of legislation that would be suited to the needs of Austraha. Professor Loss's report was followed by the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, which was tabled on 18 July 1974. The Senate Committee's report revealed a disquieting and worrying state of affairs about the way in which the securities industry was being conducted in Austraha. The Committee's main finding, which underlined the need for the present Bill, was that there was a need for the mediate estabhshment of an Australian Securities Commission to regulate the securities market in Australia and the conduct of those engaged in that market. The Senate Committee's report was studied closely, and changes were made to the draft Bill that had already been prepared in the light of the matters discussed in the report and the recommendations made by the Committee. The many detailed provisions of the Bill cover a wide range of important matters that have deserved close consideration. Because of this, predecessor in office introduced the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1974, at the end the last sittings so that its provisions could be studied during the recess and the representations and comments of interested organisations and time members of the public made known. Before the introduction of the 1974 Bill, my Department had had the benefit of much useful and consultation with the stock exchange committees and other interested organisations and individuals. They were generous in the time that they gave to the task of assisting to formulate legislation that would be workable and effective. During the recess, my Department has received number of representations and submissions. legislation These are now being given close consideration. Where amendments appear to be desirable I that shall move them in due course. Our aim is to get the best possible legislation-legislatio will provide protection for the interests of invesrequirements tors and restore confidence in the capital in Austraha. The Bill deals with a wide range of matters that are currently contained in the companies legislation of the States and Territories, and it therefore represents a first step towards the objective of national companies legislation, to which the Government is committed. Other matters of company law, being matters that are not so closely related to the conduct of the securities industry, will be the subject of a further National Companies Bill, which I propose to introduce at an early date. The further Bill will be integrated with the one I am now presenting so that the 2 Bills together will then make comprehensive provisions on a national and up-to-date basis for both company law and the control of the securities industry in our country. When my predecessor moved in the Senate on 19 March 1970, for the estabUshment of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange he referred to the series of company crashes that had occurred in the 1960s and to the widespread evidence of improper practices duriming the speculative boom in mining shares in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He drew attention then to the fact that members of the public had been induced by false rumours to buy shares, that inside trading was rife and that self-regulatory bodies seemed either powerless or unwilling to act to protect the public against this and the many other market abuses that were prevalent at the time. I have heard it said that the boom time in which these market abuses prevaUed is over and that there is no pomt now in introducing legislation which will merely lock the stable door my after the horse has bolted. It would be irresponsible for the Government to base its poUcies on of such a short-sighted view. The need remains for effective legislation which will, so far as practicable, prevent a recurrence of such abuses at any in the future. Before indicating the nature of the main provisions in the Bill I shall say a word or two about some of the basic requirements for discussion such legislation. The need for national legislation The report of the Senate Committee on Securities and Exchange drew attention to the need for a the securities industry to be subject to national rather than legislation of individual States and Territories. The report made it clear the securities industry functions on an Australia-wide basis, and that control on any other n which basis is bound to be inadequate. The of the law and the adrnimstrative markets procedures should be the same throughout Australia. The persons responsible for the administration of such legislation must have direct access to information in all parts of Australia. In addition, there is the consideration that there are many large corporations operating across the Australian continent for which the need to comply with the requirements of separate State and Territory laws involves pointless frustrations, unnecessary costs and duplication of resources. Uniform State and Territory legislation is not the answer. That approach has been tried and has failed. Efforts to achieve uniformity are invariably slow, and seldom more than partially successful. Even where uniformity has been achieved problems arise from differences between the separate administrations of individual States and Territories. The only satisfactory course, and the course which is adopted by this Bill, is national legislation, and a single administrative agency with jurisdiction throughout Australia. The need for continuous reform of the law One of the problems we have had with comduring pany and securities law in Australia has been that the need for changes in the law has occurred more rapidly than the responsible legislatures have been able to make those changes. It has come increasingly evident that it is just not enough to have an expert committee examine certain aspects of company or securities law once in every 15 to 20 years or so. There is a need, which was recognised long ago in the United States and in the First Interim Report of the Eggleston Committee, for an expert body with continuity of existence to be charged with a sponsibUity for seeing that the laws are kept to date at alltimes.There are many matters detati with respect to which the expert body should be trusted and empowered to make rules of its own having the force of the law. It is sufficient for Parhament to have a power of disalis lowance over such rules. In other matters of more fundamental importance the expert body should be responsible for submitting reports recomexchange mending changes in the law which desirable. The need for a preventive approach The experiences of recent years have made it clear that it is not sufficient for legislation respect to securities to prescribe rules and propublic vide remedies that are available when those rules are broken. AU too often the remedies prove to be worthless, either because the trail of the offender is well-covered or because he has placed his assets beyond the reach of the have been defrauded and deceived. There is a need for more emphasis to be given to the prevention of fraudulent conduct. The Btil that I now present recognises this need in a number of ways, but mainly in providing for the establishment of a strong adrnimstrative agency, which wtil have access to relevant mformation and effective powers to intervene where intervention appears to be desirable. The self-regulatory role of stock exchanges The management of a stock exchange in Australia is in the hands of a committee elected from its members. The committee has responsibility for a range of matters including the admission of new members, the disciplining of members who act improperly and the listing of securities to be traded on the market of the exchange. The Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange found that in the discharge of those regulatory responsibUities the stock exchanges in Australia had been 'seriously wanting'. In fairness to the exchanges I hasten to add that the situations that they had to deal with the boom years were anything but normal. But the fact remains that the Senate Committee's report has shown very clearly the need for some changes to be made in the self-regulabetory roles of the stock exchange committees. Criticism of the stock exchange committees should not overlook the fact that the committees perform valuable functions. But there is a need for the committees to be brought under some degree of surveillance by an official body representing the public interest generally. In the United reStates of America this has been recognised. The up Securities and Exchange Commission has been of given what has been described as a 'lookingover-the shoulder' role. That is to say, the immediate day to day management of an exchange remains with that exchange, but the Commission responsible for ensuring that the rules of the exchange are satisfactory, that those rules are properly enforced and that generally the is conducted with due regard to the it considers interests of the public. The present Btil provides for a similar role for the Corporations and Exchange Commission in Australia. In doing so the Bill recognises that the stock market of a stock exchange is like any other with market in the sense that it is a place where the may buy a commodity-in this case securities of corporations. The pubUc needs protection as it does in any other market, and the protection should be provided by appropriate laws coupled with a strong adminstrative agency representapersons who tive of the pubUc interest. The need for prompt and adequate disclosure by corporations Legislation cannot protect the individual against his folly or lack of judgment in the making of investments in securities. But there is a need, which the legislation should recognise, to ensure that the investor has access to information which is both relevant and up to date. It should not be overlooked that the funds of pubhc companies come from the public. Relevant information should not be regarded as the exclusive property of the controllers of such companies. There is, in particular, a need for the financial position of companies to be properly disclosed in its accounts, for information concerning matters significantly affecting a company's prospects to be made available promptly and for the identity of the persons beneficially entitled to major shareholdings to be ascertainable. The need to prohibit undesirable market The report of the Senate Committee on SecuriCommittee ties and Exchange disclosed a number of undecontains sirable market practices. Practices such as ket manipulation, insider trading, short selUng and dealing in undesirable conflict of interest situations, to name just a few. These are referred to in the report. They need to be dealt with effecfor tively by the legislation if pubhc confidence is be restored in our stock markets. The need for proper examination of prospectuses It is also clear from the report of the Senate Committee on Securities and Exchange-if indeed it was not clear before the report-that there is a need for prospectuses by which the pubhc is to be invited to contribute funds towards companies to be subjected before issue to a more thorough examination by the administering authorities than has been the case. The lack of adequate investigation into prospectuses during the boom years plainly led to millions of dollars being subscribed by the investing public for worthless ventures. Apart from the inevitable losses to the individuals concerned, this involved a substantial misallocation of the country's resources. The need for appropriate investigatory powers If one thing has been made clear in recent years it has been that the existing method of investigating the activities of companies and conduct of their officers is altogether too ponderPort ous. All too often reports that are made following investigation action do little more than provide record for history. It is of the utmost importance that company investigations be made in good time and that they are no longer impeded by the irrelevancy of State boundaries. In recognition of this fact the present Bill contains provisions which will enable the Corporations and Exchange Commission to act quickly and effectively throughout Australia in the conduct of its investigations. Mr Speaker, as the Bill is a particularly long one and as its provisions are indicated in considerable detail in the explanatory memorandum that I have distributed, I do not propose to detain honourable members at this stage by describing its provisions in detail other than to say that they give effect to the requirements and objectives that I have already outlined. There can be no doubting the need for legislation of this kind to provide for the securities industry in this country. If there was ever any doubt about the need for such legislation that doubt was finally dispelled by the report of the Senate Select Committee on practices Securities and Exchange-the well known Rae report. The Bill that I have presented a great many provisions that will have maran important bearing upon the functioning of our securities industry in the future. I am confident that they will cause the industry to function much more efficiently and with better regard therightsof investors. A great deal of careful to consideration has been given to the provisions of this Bill. It is an extremely important piece of legislation and the Government commends the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ellicott ) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Unemployment: Growing of Opium PoppiesMiss Junie Morosi-Moto r Vehicle IndustryBeef - Superphosphate",110
305,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT," I want tonight to draw the attention of members of the House to some newspaper articles and in particular one headed: 'Jobless may flower in Port Fairy'. The stories that we have seen have related to the joint State and Federal action in Victoria where the growing of certain opium poppies has been restricted by government action. This government action, the reports have the stated, has threatened the jobs of 40 people in Fairy. It is alleged that 7 per cent of the workforce in that city will in fact be out of work a as a result of the loss of these jobs. These people are employed in the factory of Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd. Opium poppies are in fact grown in Australia now. The growing is restricted to Tasmama where some 3000 acres are permitted to be grown. It appears that a security risk is alleged if opium poppies are grown more widely than simply in Tasmama as at present. There are, and have been set out in reports, detailed security arrangements that are given effect to in Tasmania where these poppies are presently grown. It seems that those arrangements can be given effect to at a certain cost. It has been estimated, for me, that the cost is approximately $10 per kilo of the product. The company has sought to expand the places at which it can produce the opium poppies to fulfil its needs. It beUeves that it can market opium derivatives more widely than it can simply in Australia. There is, in fact, a world shortage of legitimately produced opium. The medical uses to which opium derivatives can be put are probably well known. The alkaloids of the opium poppy yield several related drugs, some of which have use in medical practice. Others have certain undesirable side effects and are not permitted to be used for medical purposes. Neither opium, nor its derivative heroin, is used medicaUy in Australia. The opium poppy derivatives which are used medically in Australia include morphine, which is a potent analgesic which retieves most kinds of severe pain. Its addictive qualities make it necessary for its use be medically necessary and carefully supervised. There are certain morphine derivatives such as codeine, which is a mild analgesic and cough suppressant. There is the papaverine group of drugs which are used in the management of coronary and vascular disease cases. There is methadone, which is an addictive drug, and which is at present used in a Umited way for weaning heroin addicts. Although addictive, it offers the heroin addict an improved chance of successfuUy ending his period of addiction. It has been put to me that the wholesale value of opium derivatives used in Australia is probably in the area of $1.5m per annum. Nevertheless these drugs are significant agents m medical practice. The world situation in relation to suppUes of opium is rather confused, especially because of the attempts of the United States and the United Nations in recent years to reduce the amount of poppy cultivation to that level which is actuaUy required for licit and medical purposes. Despite the fact that Turkey has reduced its poppy cultivation, there is probably little doubt that world production is considerably in excess of licit demand. However, the growth in demand for medical products is rapid, and the fact that Ulegal drug users pay higher prices than are paid by legal users may serve to divert a large proportion of opium production, creating an artificial shortage for legal users. A newsletter was produced by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association in the United States which records certain evidence given to a United States committee. Appearing before that committee was a representative of the 3 Ucensed importers of opium in the Umted States of America. Included among the companies named in the Newsletter were Merck and Company, S. B. Penick and Company, Bristol Laboratories and Riker Laboratories. The Newsletter states: MCGrew's supply and demand projections for opiumbased products during 1975 and onward were bleak. That company's representative said that during the first 10 months of 1974 the sales of codeine exceeded the imports of crude opium by more than 100 per cent and that the only reason why all 3 processors were not closed down and shortages had not been felt yet at the pharmacy level was the release by the Government in December 1973 of 238 tons of opium from the strategic materials stockpUe. The Newsletter went on to state that more than 60 per cent of this stockpile, which was meant to extend over a 5-year period, was already exhausted. The representative of the company predicted that a slight increase in India's poppy production, if the weather to improved, and further use of the stockpile would provide about 80 per cent of the medical demand in 1975. He went on to say: The impact will gradually reach the consumer level as it becomes difficult, and then virtually impossible, to fill codeine prescriptions at the pharmacy and in the hospital. The company has suggested that a formal program of rationing bulk codeine will be inevitable in 1975. I do not know and have not been able to check adequately for my own purposes whether those projections are in fact correct, but it does seem to be a fact that stockpile sources in the United States have been eaten into by this demand and that that is why people are worrying. I do not know whether in fact we have any strategic stockpile in Austraha. I suspect that we probably do not, although it seems apparent that we are able to produce sufficient for our own purposes at the moment, it does seem to me that larger quantities or these drugs could be genuinely produced forticitpurposes and could provide employment opportunities for people in Australia. It think it is pertinent to note- I certainly have noted-that the employees of the particular company that are suffering unemployment are in the electorate of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I spoke to him today to ascertain his attitude before I spoke on this important matter. He agrees with the comment that I have made that it would be most desirable, provided satisfactory security arrangements were madeand I believe that they can be made-if the resources were actually widened and it were made possible for more growers to enter the market. It seems quite clear from the pubhc comments that have been made that poppy cultivation is more difficult than the growth of other possible crops in Tasmania. Despite a substantial increase in the contract rates by Glaxo Aust Pty Ltd, company has been unable to attract a greater contract area than 3000 acres in Tasmania. It seems to be generally agreed by the company that if it wanted further acres in Tasmama the Government there would probably be persuaded to permit it to expand in that area, but the farmers seem to be unwilling to grow poppies. have also seen articles in the South Australian 'Advertiser' that indicate that a number of farmers on Kangaroo Island are considering a proposal to produce poppies for codeine. Their proposals have been put to the Government of that State. My submission is that the Government ought to review these decisions. I beheve that the securcase ity steps that we would all demand and see as necessary could be taken and, as a result, we could produce this product for world purposes, supplying not only our own needs but also the needs of other countries-need s that, from what have read, seem to be very apparent and imdo mediate. As a result we could also improve the employment opportunities in the Port Fairy area, which have been jeopardised by the decisions which have been taken to date.",113
306,Dr EVERINGHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Briefly , let me say into the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) that these matters are under consideration by my Government and by the States cerned. The security of dangerous drugs is main consideration which exercised the minds Ministers for Health in their conference they discussed this matter earlier in the year, and no doubt they will be discussing it again at their meeting in April this year. I am concerned, as we all are, about the need to provide adequate suppUes of essential drugs, whether they be dangerous or not, and about the need to restore or to preserve employment. But the overriding consideration is that we should not add to the world problem of drug abuse. This is the overriding consideration which determined the decision that has so far restricted the growing of opium poppies to non-mainland areas. WhUe it is true that there are many useful products of the opium fanuly, in every case there are alternatives. So even if there were an absolute shortage of opium derived drugs and doctors were not able from time to time to obtain the supplies that they prescribe, the situation could not be seen as a major tragedy because there are effective alternatives such as the pethidine famUy. We should not rush into the position of just making up a shortage of that kind in the light of the the very grave and growing world problem of containing these drugs and securing them from the UUcit drug traffic which is a growing problem in all countries, not least hi our own.",115
307,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I had not intended to speak in the adjournment debate tonight but something that occurred in I the House impeUed me to do so. When I was making a rebuttal of certain remarks made by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) Mr Speaker, who was then in the chair, felt that the Standing Orders did not aUow me to make clear the full facts of the case. I now take this opportunity of so doing. The honourable member for Prospect accused me of having employed an mquiry agent in relation to a court which was shortly pending. That accusation was completely and utterly without foundation. There is no truth in the matter whatsoever. I do not believe that the honourable member for Prospect, who said something which was untrue, I did know that what he was saying was untrue. I not accuse him of lying.",115
308,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Scholes)Order! I do not want to restrict what the honourable member is saying, but I would suggest that he should not refer to a debate that has taken during this day. I think that he can set out reply the facts without referring to the debate.",115
309,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, Sir. I make it clear conthat no honourable member in this House is the accused by me of having said something which of he knew to be untrue. But I think that certain when honourable members may have been a mouthpiece for people in the Ministry in this regard. I have some evidence of that. Let me cite three or four pieces of evidence. In the first place, there was, as is well known, a break-in at the house of Miss Morosi. This occurred and it was reported in the Press. When this break-in occurred suggestions were made that Senator Greenwood and I were in some way concerned with the matter. As far as I am concerned-Senato r Greenwood has spoken for himself in the same manner-this suggestion is utterly and completely false. Mr Nicholls-Who suggested it?",115
310,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"It was suggested, among other people, by the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, Senator James MCClelland, who spoke to a friend of mine in this regard. It was suggested tonight in the House by the honourable member for Prospect. I must not make too much reference to that. But the suggestion was made. The honourable member for Prospect made the same allegation by way of interjection in the House yesterday. So it is going on. Two things are notable. The first concerns the Morosi affair. Naturally I have made some inquiries into this subsequently by reason of the fact that my name was falsely linked with it. I have made some inquiries and I have come to the extraordinary conclusion that the Commonwealth Police and not the State Police were involved. I have formed the quite inevitable conclusion that this was done corruptly by Mr Murphy in order to cover up evidence that would have been to the detriment of himself or his friends and that the thing was a pohtical frame-up from the beginning. I do not know the details of how this was done, but I have heard from pressmen that the story that I was involved was put out from Mr Murphy's office. This is the kind of thing that one has to contend with. There is not the sUghtest doubt in my mind that Mr Murphy knows a great deal more about the background of the Morosi affair than is currently believed. Mr Kerin-What about John Singleton? Mr WENTWORTH A name has been menFord tioned-that of John Singleton. I do not know that he has anything to do with the Morosi affair. But the honourable member may have the affect advantage of me in that regard. If he has the advantage perhaps he will let the House know. But it is on the record that Mr Murphy corruptly used his position as Minister to use the Commonment wealth Police in order to prevent the obtaining evidence in regard to a friend. This is not thing for which I need any evidence. The eviwould dence is here and completely open. It is on the record. Why were not the State police brought into this? It is a State onence. Why was it kept from the State poUce? Perhaps Mr Murphy may be able to enlighten us on these matters. I have evidence of a long association of Mr Murphy with this group of people. It is quite clusive evidence and it goes back for some years. There has been a cover-up by the Government of quite monumental dimensions. The Government is using all of its propaganda facUities to denigrate those people who are making an attempt to find out what has reaUy happened. It is using innocent members in this House as a mouthpiece for what it is doing and innocent members- I regard the honourable member for Prospect as an innocent and deluded mouthpiece-d o not perhaps reaUse what they are being used for and what is really going on. I have named certain files which I have every reason to believe are in existence. I know that those files have things in them which Mr Murphy would not Uke to have revealed either regarding his friends or perhaps his attempts to cover up for his friends. I do not think I need take the matter any further.",116
311,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to raise a matter that is of considerable concern in South Australia. It relates to what appears to be a breakdown, or a partial breakdown, of an agreement made between the Austrahan Government and the major motor vehicle manufacturers about one month ago. Honourable members will recall the substance of this agreement, which followed repeated negotiations between Government officials, a number of Ministers and representatives of the motor vehicle manufacturing companies. The Government gave certain undertakings to adopt measures to support the motor vehicle industry by stimulating the purchase of motor cars. In exchange the manufacturers undertook to defer any retrenchments they had foreshadowed. In the case of General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd the undertaking was for a period of 3 months and in the case of Chrysler Australia Ltd the period was 30 days. I do not recall the period for Motor Co. of Australia Ltd. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, may be able to tell us the period because the activities of that company your electorate, but I think that it was 30 days as well. In any event, every concerned Australian breathed a sigh of relief when this agreement was made between the Australian Governand the car manufacturing companies that of there would be no retrenchments, at least for the sometime being, that certain substantial support be provided by Government action for the motor vehicle industry, and that we would wait and see what happened after that. I am concerned that there seems to be a partial breakdown of this arrangement so far as it concerns Chrysler Australia Ltd. On Monday of this week Chrysler called up a connumber of toolmakers and advised them that they would have the option of accepting work on the production line. As they were all tradesmen this would mean a substantial reduction in pay and they would no longer be working in their trade. They were told that the only alternative was that they could put in their resignations. very interesting that the company did not offer retrenchment as an alternative. I understand that some of the workers were led to believe that the company would not retrench people because of the agreement with the Government. That is quite the same as the excuse that was submarket sequently given by the company but that was the advice given to me by a couple of the employees at Chrysler. Some of these people contacted They did not wish to resign. They felt that if did it would prejudice their chances of assistance under the National Employment and Training Scheme and might prejudice their chances of reindustry. ceiving the unemployment benefit. It seems to me that the company has adopted ahas on rather circuitous method to try to avoid retrenchtax ments. A lot of people contacted matter because they thought it was a breach of particular company. There are the undertaking made with the Australian Government. The result has been that many these tradesmen, but not all of them, have refused to accept a transfer. An occupation of that section of the factory took place. In the of everyone's understanding of the agreement between the Government and the company it hardly surprising that this occupation of the facmight tory did take place. I am sure that no one could blame those employees for refusing to accept a transfer. The next statement. I heard from the comtaking. pany-it was not first hand-wa pany claimed to officials of the Amalgamated for the employees Metalworkers Union that the agreement Government applied only to workers on the proof the whole nation-that wed guarantee duction Une and not to these tradesmen. I have tried to check on the actual undertaking given by Chrysler to the Government. The company claimed that it was gomg to guarantee employhope ment only for people directly engaged in the the agreement manufacture of cars. I suppose the company would try to justify the retrenchment of these tradesmen by saying that as they were working on design operations they were not directly volved in manufacturing. In my opinion, that complete sophistry on the part of the company and seems to be to be a back door method of try-motor ing to evade their undertakings with the Governive ment. The Government entered into this agree is ment in a very solemn manner. I think it is worth reminding the House of the very substantial sistance that has been given to the motor vehicle industry by this Government. As everybody knows, this Government is pledged to support a viable vehicle building industry in Australia and it lays particular emphasis on supporting the motor vehicle industry in South Australia. It is Last November the Government announced a poUcy of an 85 per cent local content plan. At the same time it was announced that there would be a 35 per cent tariff on the import of completely butit up units and that if the number of vehicles not imported exceeds 20 per cent of the domestic there would be a penalty tariffof an extra 10 per cent placed on those vehicles. To add to that, later on- I think this was part of the agreeme. ment made between the Government and comthey panies-the Government introduced an import quota system. This of course has been a very hefty stice of protection to the Australian car In addition to that, as part of the same package deal, the Government undertook, and carried out that undertaking, to reduce sales motor vehicles. Then there have been the me about this and that has Government considerable been very purchases of vehicles, much to the benefit of this also the other general benefits such as reductions of tax and accelerated depreciation. in company The Australian Government and the Auslight tralian community have spent many hundreds of mUlions of doUars in guaranteeing the jobs of is these employees, and although the company use some sort of pecuUar logic in justifying its action in seeking to transfer these employees I believe it is engaging in sophistry and that it is certainly not honouring the spirit of the underIt is not honouring the spirit of the agrees that the comGovernment. I was ment which made with the Australian believe that it is most important concerned and for the econwith the omy of South Australia-indee for the economy that everybody concerned co-operates in guaranteeing a viable motor vehicle industry in Australia. I wtil that the representatives of this company ensure that not only the letter but the spirit of fuUy honoured. made with the Government is In conclusion I would Uke to refer to the inproposed local content plans announced last is November by the Government. I think everybody agrees that one of the great problems of the vehicle industry in Australia is its successfragmentation. The Australian Government very anxious to have one of the major Japanese manufacturers operate in partnership aswith the Chrysler company in South Australia at the engine plant at Lonsdale, and this is something that aU South Australians would want to see. However, I think it is absolutely essential that if one of the Japanese companies goes in it should be either Toyota or Datsun because they are the major Japanese manufacturers operating in Austraha. I am a Utde bit apprehensive that the connections of the Chrysler company with Mitsubishi in Japan might lead them to prefer the connection with Mitsubishi to continue and, perhaps to expand. I believe that that would not be the answer to our problems. Whatever happens, Austrahans wtil certainly want to continue to purchase Toyotas and Datsuns. I think those vehicles should be made here, but we should not encourage the continuation of fragmentation of the industry. I beheve it is essential that at least one of these 2 manufacturers should do everything to operate jointly with the Chrysler company at Lonsdale. I would like to hear words of encouragement from the Chrysler organisation in that regard.",116
312,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member's time has expired.,118
313,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this evening because of a reply which was given to a question asked on notice in this chamber by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). It relates to the beef industry. The first part of the question was: Withreferenceto the urgent industry in Australia, will the Minister consider the ment of a Commission empowered to purchase for the purpose of storage until The answer to that part of the question was: No. The second part of the question was: Can large quantities of beef be kept in cold storage cost of less than Sc per lb per annum? The answer to that part of the question was: On the basis of prices charged ation, the cost to hold meat in cold storage would be of the order of 10c per lb. That information is misleading. The honourable member for Bendigo is a lot closer to the point. From the information which I can secure, the cost is less than 5c per lb yet the Minister Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) informs us that the cost is in the vicinity of 10c per lb. The third of the question was: Would this action relieve the pressure on the present market and help to stabilise a price that will keep of the rural industry viable. The answer to that part of the question was: The current unused cold storage capacity in Australia relatively small in relation to production of beef. this, it is considered that producer prices for cattle be significantly influenced by used storage capacity. That may be partly true. When an industry is in great strife, trying to dispose of meat on any market in the world and trying to find somewhere to put its surplus cattle, then any storage must be classified, in my mind and in the minds of a lot of people on this side of the House, as very valuable. I have been concerned at the lack of action by the Goveramernt to assist this very important industry which is recognised as one of the top 3 industries in Australia. What has the Government done in this time of crisis? Absolutely nothing. It appears to be penaUsing the industry and putting obstacles in the way of the industry. The brushing aside of the superphosphate bounty is antilustration.Some of the taxation slugs on the industry mean that those who may have had a smaU income a couple of years ago now must pay the tax on it. Today they have nothing with which to pay the tax. I am saying that the Government is badly letting down the industry in this regard. This week the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to my mind- I have the agreement of a lot of members on this side-misle d this Parliament and the nation by giving wrong information. He said that Australia was enjoying the cheapest superphosphate in the world. He had to retract that answer because he was corrected. We certainly do not have the cheapest superphosphate need for assistance to the beef establishin the world. This is a very important industry surplus beef employing a lot of people. suitable markets are located.",118
314,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,He corrected that. He said 'with exception of New Zealand'.,118
315,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,All right. I did not mention which countries were cheaper. His answer was only off at a the cuff. He was challenged on his statement that New Zealand was able to dispose of cheaper superphosphate. No doubt if we looked around by the Cold Storage Associwe would probably find other countries which over 1 year period are getting it cheaper. Mr Fisher-In New Zealand it is $28 a ton.,118
316,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,"AU right. What do we pay in this countiy? Something Uke $54. When the Liberal Country Party Government went out of office, for what were we paying? About $14 a ton. There has been an increase of almost 300 per cent in a part couple of years. The Prime Minister said that Australi a was getting the cheapest beef superphosphate in the world. The Special Ministhis secuon ter of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) is another one who made a misleading statement. In answer to a question this week he said that the Government is was subsidising this industry to the extent of In view of$70m a year. From the way he spoke one would could not think that the Government was directly subsidisthe utilisation of existing uning it. I realise that we are fortunate to be able to get some phosphate rock from overseas at a very cheap rate, but that is not being supplied directly by the Government. Again I say that the Minislems. ter's statement was misleading. The beef industry is in dire straits today. were to have very dry or very cold some of the southern areas in the next 3 months, I foresee absolutely millions of cattle lowed to die or being shot on properties. If that not a serious situation, I have never seen Members of the Government sit here and do absolutely nothing. It is about time they did. Tonight I want to draw the Government's attention to this position. I beheve that if the Government does not do something we will have a lot of probReturning to the superphosphate question, I am reminded of the large number of people If we who are unemployed following the lack of deconditions in mand because of price. being al Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Scholes)is Order!
