2,Mr DALY,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT," MrSpeaker , I wish to inform the House that I accept the notice of motion given on November by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as a censure motion for the purrefusal poses of standing order 110. I take it that the notice of motion will now be called on.",14
3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT," I move That this House censures the Government and its Ministightens. ters: (1) for their stated intention to continue to govern out the approval of the Parliament to the Appropriation Bills; (2) for concealing from the Parliament the procedures and the practices which it intends to follow event of the Appropriation Bills failing to pass; (3) for the grave threat to the Australian Constitution resulting from the attempt by the Prime Minister to reduce the power of the Australian Senate; and (4) for theriskto democracy in the failure of the ment to call a general election in accordance tom and convention. The evasion and contempt of Parhament and the Constitution have become a critical issue in the attempt of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to hang onto power. He believes that he alone the Constitution; that he alone is the Parhament. The Parhament is very clearly the Queen-in our case the Governor General-the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives. All have a proper part and proper powers under the Constitution. The Prime Minister cannot pre-empt their powers and their prerogatives. The Government is more and more characterised by efforts to throw off constitutional restraints. This was symbolised by the loans affair but is part of a much larger patMinister tern. We know quite well of the avoidance of the Loan Council by saying that $4,000m was to be borrowed for temporary purposes. How false; are, how shallow; how deceitful that was. Charges were made about that, time and time again. the Prime Minister can go around the country and say that no charges, no allegations have been made. That particular technique was fected in another country but this Prime Minister seems able to pursue it and to ignore the facts and the charges which to this day remain unansandfiles.Of wered. The documents also make it quite plain that the parliamentary appropriation of commission was avoided by proposing to pay a higher rate of interest on that loan which would have cost the Australian taxpayers in repayment, an additional $2 bilhon. Under those circumstances what nonsense does that make of the Prime Minister's oft-repeated phrase: 'No commission will Motion of Censure be payable'? He knew commission would an appropriation and that that would not come through the Parhament. Therefore he 6 made the determination to pay a higher rate of interest at a total cost of $2 billion. There is a to answer questions when the going gets tough. He is scared of being tangled in the web of deceit and deception. It is not a coincidence that the refusal to answer questions comes as the net It is not a coincidence that requests to put questions on the notice paper come as the net It is not a coincidence that the questions put on the notice paper are answered with no facts at all or a mimmum of words or in the most withcontradictory manner. One paragraph in a particular answer said that there is no need to go to the Loan Council because the loan was for temin the porary purposes. The last sentence of the same paragraph said that the loan, if and when consummated, would be taken to the Loan Council. Both statements clearly could not have been corGovernrect. The words that the Prime Mmister used in with custhat answer about going to the Loan Council were a clear denial of the terms of the Executive of Council Minute of 13 December last year. is The Prime Minister has himself stated the principles by which he ought to be judged'There is no excuse for not telling the truth and the whole truth to Parliament.' He spoke that of the former Deputy Prime Minister when criticising him on a television program. There should be no place for verbal trickery in this Parliament. The principle for sacking the former Minister for the Minerals and Energy was that 'the Parliament must be able to accept assurances given to it by a and if those assurances prove to be misleading the Minister concerned must be held responsible'. Despite these sentiments, fine as they there is a continual web of evasions and halftruths. When he was asked whether evidence But had been suppressed, when he was asked whether papers had been destroyed, he said that he needed time to think. He said: 'Put it on the pernotice paper.' He could not answer. Then he suggested that this was an imputation against public servants because they held documents course Ministers- I presume even in his Government-hav e occasionally been known to ask for documents and files. The question is unanswered to this day. Have documents in relation to the loans affair been destroyed by the Prime Minister's direction or by the direction of any other Minister? Did he have discussions with Mr Connor after 20 May? He answers: ' I suppose I would have had some conversation with the Minister every day'. That is an equivocation; a half-truth; neither one thing nor the other. That is what willfinishhim in the end. And then there are the more recent charges by his agent, his intermediary, the person who was good enough to pursue $4,000m for this Government for 12 months- Mr Khemlani's charges. He only denied those relating to a Mr Anderson. There was no statement denying the substantial truth of the document which has been tabled in the Senate. There has been a denial of one small and relatively unimportant part of it, but the document stands, so far as the Prime Minister is concerned, virtually unimpaired. He has said something about contacts with Mr Anderson. I would like to see a denial that he has ever spoken to Mr Anderson- a denial in the Prime Minister's own words. We have not had it. On 21 October was he or were his Ministers aware of negotiations after 20 May? He has evaded answering that question. There has never been a straight answer, even though we know quite well that he directed that all the documents be placed over his desk so that he could keep personal charge of the loan letters. How many honourable members sitting behind the Prime Minister beheve that he knew nothing, believe that he was telling the truth? Does the former Deputy Prime Minister believe that he was telling the truth? The honourable gentleman has said that he was in fact not telling the truth. He used the word, I think,' he', even though it was in relation to the Prime Minister. What about what the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Stewart) said when he was asked a simple question the other day? Listen to this for He said: As the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I information that would put the blame on anybody who associated with the loans affair; nor do I have information that would completely exonerate anybody, if there was blame attached to anybody. What does that mean? What he was saying was power. that as Vice-President of the Executive he did not know. He was not saying that he did representatives in this place not know as a man, as a person. He strictly qualified a highly equivocal statement, making quite plain that he knew and could speak if he wished to. Will he take the opportunity to assure the House that he knows nothing? Now we have the refusal of the Prime Minister to answer further questions. There must be a presumption of guilt, contempt of Parhament, of a massive cover-up because he is frightened to face up to the whole truth. Let us look at some critical dates-1 3 December, when the Prime Minister was involved, and then 7 lanuary, when the former Deputy Prime Minister revoked the authority, to his credit, but as soon as the Prime Minister came back from overseas on 27 lanuary he reinstated it. On 20 May he revoked it because the Government was pursuing an American loan. We were not told the reasons at the time. We did not know them until the minute was tabled. What was the conversation with the former Minister for Minerals and Energy at the time? Did Gough say to Rex: 'Go on. We can easily get another authority at a moment's notice', or was it the other way around? Can anyone believe that he did not know, when only 3 days later there were telexes interchanged, when in the same month of May he said that all messages must pass over his desk? In the time since, with the exception of today, there have been the gagging of Opposition motions, the gagging of debates, refusal to debate publicly on 3 major television programs, refusal to answer questions in this House, refusal to face the questioning of the Press over any of these matters-ove r Mr Connor's resignation, over the new loans information, the no confidence motions-and the treatment of this Parliament, with respect to you Mr Speaker, has been contemptible from this Government. There have been 10 gags in 11 days. There has been a refusal to recognise the constitutionalrightand position of the Senate; a refusal to recognise that Australia is a federation and despite the best efforts of this Government will remain a federation. We know quite well his past attitude'abolish the States'. In a Chifley Lecture he said: The role ofLabor State members of Parliament is to bring an answer. about their own dissolution. Is that not an attack on State governments more direct, quite direct? Have not his policies over 3 have no years been designed to put that policy into effect was by making the States merely a post box for the any pohcies of this Government? If he cannot abolish he seeks to dictate to them through the financial Now he says he wants to smash the SenCouncil which he is only to ate unilaterally, a tear up the Constitution of part, this Parliament and the are only a part. it There is a great misinterpretation of the role of the Senate on the part of the Prime Minister. It is not only his own view. He ignores recent High Court judgments. Mr lustice Stephen said: In my view the concept underlying the Commonwealth's submissions disclose a serious misconception of the place of the Senate as a legislative money Bills possesses legislative power in no way inferior to the House. It has full power . . . in the case of money Bills . . . freely to request amendment or to reject outright. Mr Justice Mason said: It cannot be suggested that the Senate has a duty to pass a Bill transmitted to it by the House ofRepresentatives. In the exercise of its powers under secuon S3 the Senate deliberates upon proposed laws initiated by the House. Its power to pass or reject them is unconfined by secuon 53 or any other provision of the Constitution and its power to otherwise deal with them is also unconfined save in so far as contrary provision is made by the exceptions which, as I have said, have no application in this case. Mr Justice Gibbs said: Under the Constitution the Senate does not occupy a subimproper ordinate place in the exercise of legislative power. essential pan of the Parliament in which the legislative power of the Commonwealth is vested. And so it goes on. Afinaljudgment by the Chief Justice: The Senate is not a mere House of review. Rather House which may examine a proposed law from a standpoint different from that which the House of Representatives may have taken. Those judgments are all affirming the power of the Senate; all denying the stand taken by Prime Minister who seeks to destroy the Senate. It is worth noting that even if there were no States in Australia, even if the Prime Minister had his wish in relation to that, we would still need a Senate elected as the Senate is elected with the powers that the Senate has, to protect those areas and those regions which have fewer people in them than Melbourne and Sydney. It is the protector of the 4 small States and it is essenexact tial that that protection remain. The Prime Minister does not understand the nature of Australian society. Other more compact societies see the need for federalism, for centralisation. He sees only the need for a gatherlowed ing in of power into his own hands. His centralist dreams are inappropriate and out of touch with the needs of this time and his refusal to face the truth about Austraha and its Constitution is leadbe ing him deeper and deeper into unconstitutional actions. He is painfully learning the fact that Australia is a federation with a distribution powers appropriate to a federation.",14
4,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Order! The honourable immediately member for Macarthur will remove that, or remove himself from the chamber.",16
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"He has not said between that he would accept the Governor General's decision taken in accordance with his constiConstitution. tutional prerogative. There are circumstances, I have said repeatedly, where a Governor General may have to act as the ultimate chamber. The Senate except as to protector of the Constitution. He ignores that prerogative. He ignores a quotation of the most distinguished Prime Minister this country has had, who said recently: . . . I think it would be a singular piece of impertinence on the part of the Prime Minister to go to the Governor General, whose reputation is high, and who understands these things very well, and ask him for a premature 'half Senate' elecuon, calculated and designed, hopefully, because of the recent legislation about senators from the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, to give the Government control of the Senate for a month or two, in which time, of course, all their legislauon which now has been attacked in the Senate, could be carried, with permanent, (and I think damaging) effects on the Australian political structure. To offer advice to the Governor General on the lines that have been hinted at would, I think, be both and insulting. There is no legal principle that perIt is an mits a wrong doer to profit from his own acuons. Then we have a situation in which Senator Wriedt, in the Senate on 22 October, affirmed support for that statement completely and absolutely. There is no monolithic support for this it is a Prime Minister. His contempt for procedures was symbolised by an attitude to a former Speaker and now his attitude to the Constitution and the powers of the Constitution and the place of this this Parliament is culminated by his proposal to govern without parUamentary approval of funds. This is the last safeguard of democracy. As every Liberal and National Countiy Party Leader, State and Federal, from all over Australia said not so long ago: To try to govern without appropriation of money by Parliament is the first significant step on the path to an Australian dictatorship. That view is not overstated. It is an description of the events. It is an exact description of the attitudes which have been depicted by this present Prime Minister. Is this Parhament allowed to know what matdeters have been proposed to the banks? Is it alto know whether sections 8, 10 and 11 of the Reserve Bank Act, or section 9 of the Commonwealth Banks Act, or sections 62 or 70 of the Audit Act are to be relied upon, or is there just to a request, a worthless piece of paper, asking the banks to put their depositor's funds at risk and to put their assets at risk to meet Comof monwealth debts? Is that device to be used because the Prime Minister knows full well that if there is to be a guarantee the Government would be outside the Constitution and acting illegally? There are some views that there could then be a process of criminal conspiracy the banks and the Government to evade the processes of Parliament and the laws of the This is the depth to which this peras son has sunk in his attempt to stay in power. There is a threat to democracy in Australia but there is only a threat to democracy when a Prime Minister is frightened to face his masters, the electors of Austraha. That is the position of this Prime Minister. He is frightened to face his masters. It is not only the Prime Minister but other ministers who have been affected by this approach-this contempt for normal procedures. The present Treasurer (Mr Hayden) who, before certain events of a week or two ago, had more respect than he has now, has given Budget information to Mr Hawke. He said quite plainly that it does not matter, that it is proper. The Prime ister in his defence said the Premiers get the same informadon, all the information. The Premiers do not and the Prime Minister now knows it. But he misled the Parliament in relation to that matter. The Premiers do get some small advance nodce of States grants legislation-mone y for schools and money for roads-bu t as to the revenue proposals and the excise proposals, these in the past have been held absolute because of the possibility of large and massive nnancial gain. It was that principle that the present Treasurer breached. He claims that he has done a right and that he will do it again for poltiical advantage. The destruction of the ethics and standards of parliamentary government over the last 3 years has brought this Parliament to a lower level than any in the 20 years in which I have been in it. It has been brought to this level by the actions of this Prime Minister and this Government. This Government has not only been bedevUled by massive incompetence and sheer extravagance but also by scandal after scandal because the Prime Minister has been incapable of setting standards of behaviour for his Ministers, their staffs or for himself. The Leader of the House (Mr Daly) has also attempted to coerce the Opposition by producing a Ust of members whom he says have travelled. In this way the Government is trying to stop petent people travelUng around the country to put their case. The Government is frightened to answer questions; it is frightened to face Australia. An attempt to centraUse all power in the tralian Labor Party in Canberra has led to a ossal explosion in government spending. How many people realise that in 72 years of Ausnot traUan federation the Budget reached $ 10,000m but in the next 2Vi years it went to $22,000m. That is the principal source-the main source-o all the economic problems facing Australia at present time. It is the fundamental faUure to provide a decent and stable government fbr Australians. We have seen the results in massive inflation and the highest rate of unemployment since the depression. How many Ministers have said that they would resign if unemployment reached a certain level and now sit on the Treasury bench and say that it does not matter? One Minister said that only another 150 000 people were unemployed, and it is in the records of this ParliaMin- ment for those who wish to look at it. We have the highest interest rates in our history and in spite of the closest of close relationships with that redoubtable President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, massive industrial unrest. There are now more than 300 000 people unemployed. We were told just shortly after the Budget was presented that 400 000 people would be unemployed as a result of the Budget. What kind of Budget, what kind of Government, is that? The Prime Minister is the destroyer not only of the future economic life for many thousands of people throughout Australia but also is the destroyer of the Australian Labor Party, as ultimately he will prove to be. This Government must face the people. It is no point to suggest that that can happen merely by holding a half Senate election. Are we to have a situation in which the loser gains control, in which there will be no Supply and in which the Prime Minister demonstrates his continual evasion of responsibility? What threatens democracy is the Prime Minister's direct refusal to face the electors of Australia. But there is a pattern in his evasions. He evaded responsibility over a former Deputy Prime Minister by saying, 'He is all to blame and I am innocent', though the letter was in his hand for days or weeks. In respect of the former Minister for Minerals and Energy the Prime Minister said: 'He is all to blame and I am innocent.' If the Prime Minister were innocent of knowledge he has to be incomas a Prime Minister. If he wishes to be that incompetent, let him proclaim it, but if he is not incompetent he himself is party to the deceptions the people of of this Parliament. The main charges against this Government are Auscharges of massive incompetence and destruccoltion of the Australian economy and doing harm to many people who have retired and who canrebuild their Uves. The savings of these people have been destroyed and they are dependent until they die on the beneficence of this f man, of this Prime Minister, of this Government. the In the Austrahan tradition they would have wanted to be independent but they cannot because their savings have been destroyed. It is the incompetence, the massive economic misman.gement, which is the principal charge. But when added to that are the scandals, and the incapacity to set standards, this Government deserves the contempt of the Australian people and the contempt of this Parliament.",16
6,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Is the motion seconded?,18
7,Mr ANTHONY,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,18
8,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"This is a notable parliamentary occasion-notabl e at least for its novelty. it has come- a censure motion on the Governalready ment from the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Through the actions of this Leader of the Opposition, this nation been plunged into an unprecedented constisions tutional crisis. Through the actions of this Leader of the Opposition, a Budget passed again and again in this House has been blocked in the ate. Through this Leader of the Opposition, the . right of the elected Government of Australia govern is under challenge. And above all, through the actions of this Leader of the Oppoution. sition, the fundamental right of the House of Representatives is threatened. Yet through all the months during which he was working himself up to take the plunge, through all the weeks of the crisis he has created, he has never before taken the course which would bring on a debate of no confidence in or censure of the Governtimes ment or on any Minister-o n this issue, on Budget itself or on any of the pseudo-issues which were to be used to justify the extraordihave nary conduct of the Opposition and the unconstisaying tutional conduct of the Senate. True, on 23 October, the Leader of the sition made a specious effort when he moved suspension of Standing Orders at the deathsalt-wha knock, 20 minutes before, as he well knew, the House was due to adjourn. He withdrew the motion from the notice paper. It could never debated and it was never intended to be debated. And true, the Leader of the Opposition has been very free outside the Parhament with allegations and smears, not just against the Government, against pubhc servants. But in this House, in one proper place, he has never until today brought forward a serious censure motion. Outthe side the House and by proxy in the Senatedisgracefully by the stolen proxy of a dead tor's vote-h e has been prepared to say that the conduct of the Government justifies any extreme course, justifies tearing up the Constitution, justifies economic disruption and chaos. But in this House, where the real issue is to be decided-n o charges, no censure. It all illustrates perfectly the whole approach of the Leader of the Opposition and it further illustrates the real principle involved in this issue. The issue at stake is the basic constitutionalrightsof this House. The whole tactic of the Leader of the Opposition has been to bypass this House, to undermine its established rights and authority-right s and authority which have never been challenged Federation and would not be challenged in any other country with a comparable system of At last government. The people of Australia have shown how clearly they grasp the basic principle at stake. I am not sure whether they, or indeed all members of this House, yet fully re has alise the inordinate and unprecedented pretennow being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the Senate. It is more than just a claim to equality in money matters Senwith this House. The new preposterous claim is that the Senate-no t even an elected majority but to a mere accidental half of the Senate-ca n dictate to the House of Representatives our own dissolThat is, the Senate claims the right to send this House to the people without itself facing the people. That is the claim made for the Senate in the messages returned to us by the Senate. The Senate cannot be dissolved except at the and in the terms strictly laid down by the the Constitution. This House has no power to dissolve the Senate. Yet the Senate now purports to such power over this House. The Senate is that every 6 months it has the power to require an election for this House, while its own term must remain inviolate under the ConstiOppotution. What member of this House could tolerate such a claim? What government worth its t government, formed in this House and this House alone, responsible to the majority of this House and this House alone-coul d subbe mit to such a claim? Yet it is the Leader of the Opposition in this House-a n office-bearer in this House, an aspirant for the Prime Ministership of Australia which can only be conferred by the but majority in this House and this House alonethe who is spearheading this attack upon this House and orchestrating the actions of the Senate. Not least extraordinary and reprehensible aspect ofhis conduct is that he would sell out the rights Senaof this House. And, of course, in so doing he would sell out the rights of the Austrahan people by the selhng the people's House down the drain. The Leader of the Opposition's motion-hi s first censure motion ever against the Government-talk s about unconstitutional conduct. Sure, that is the issue today-bu t from what source does it spring? I remind the House that Australian Senate cannot originate a taxing Bill or an appropriation Bill. It cannot amend a taxing Bill, or a Bill appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of Government. It cannot amend any Bill so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. On the other hand, the Senate may return to the House any Bill which it cannot amend, with a request for amendment. The Senate has not done that. It has not compUed with the clear procedures of the Constitution. The Senate has gone on strike. But without daring to allow senators to vote the clear rejection or ceptance of the Budget, the Opposition in the Senate claims authority to nullify a Bill which it cannot even amend. This means that, if a Government with a clear majority in the House of Representatives presents its Budget to Parliament, and then brings into the House of Representatives financial measures to give effect to that Budget, and has them passed by the House and sent up to the Senate, a hostile Senate could effectively reject them-withou t even voting on them. This, of course, would create an impossible situation and would make popular government unworkable.",18
9,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order! I suggest that honourable members of the Opposition show the House the courtesy of ceasing their continuous conversation. It almost appears to be a planned operation. (Mr MCLeay interjecting),19
10,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,If the honourable member for Boothby answers me back I will name him. I suggest that the honourable members remain sUent. Mr Ian Robinson-You did not tell that to honourable members on the Government side 10 minutes ago.,19
11,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Honourable members on the Government side were told exactly the same thing.,19
12,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Whoeve r commands a majority in this House forms a government, and has therightto govern for a normal 3-year term. The Senate, as a second chamber, plays no part in the determination of which political party, or group of parties, shall form the government. The Leader of the Opposition asserts that my Government is threatening the Constitution through an attempt to reduce the powers of the Senate. Of course, the exact reverse is true. The Leader of the Opposition is seeking to reduce the powers of the House ofRepresentatives in a way never attempted in Australia. I am not trying to the reduce any legitimate legislative power of the Senate. I am determined to protect this House and to prevent usurpation by the Senate. Next let me turn to another element in the honourable gendeman's motion-hi s complaint that we have concealed the ways in which we intend to help those adversely affected by the Senate's unwiUingness to pass the Budget. The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that he considers that it would be wrong for the Government to take any action which would ease the hardship which he threatens, and wrong ac- for us to try to minimise the harm to the economy. We shall do all in our constitutional and legal power to do that-to prevent hardship, to protect the economy. This Labor Government will not take the same caUous attitude to the welfare of the people of Australia which the Opposition has already demonstrated. The real issue at stake is the right of the majority in the House of Representatives to govern. There can be no abandonment of this principle-and certainly not in the face of blackmaU. The only honourable, the only sensible way for the crisis to be brought to an end is for the Senate today to pass the Appropriation BUls. On the other hand, for as long as the Senate continues its strike, the Government will do all in its power-it s legal and constitutional power-to ease the impact of the Opposition's unprincipled, unprecedented and unconstitutional action. We have seen the spectacle this week of the Leader of the Opposition leaning on the banks; pressuring them against doing their duty; attempting to intimidate them against doing what is right and proper. The Leader of the Opposition only a fortnight ago said: I have already said that we would not want to see any individual government employee hurt or damaged as a result of what is happening. Fine, but he has changed his tune in the last 48 hours, as soon as co-operation from the banks appeared likely. In the face of the reckless course taken by the Opposition, we must do our best to alleviate hardship, to make the best alternative arrangements. That is what we are talking to the banks about. There can be no objection to what we are doing. Throughout its consideration of the action that might be taken the Government has insisted that it must have opinions from the law officers-the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-Generalthat there should be no conflict with the Constitution, the Audit Act, or any other law. Officials have had discussions with representatives of the banks about the steps that might be taken to facilitate access to credit for its employees and supphes for the amounts the Government will owe them but will not be able to pay them if the Budget Bills are not passed this month. But even the best arrangements we can make with the banks will still leave thousands of persons and businesses damaged by what the Opposition has done. Mr Speaker, I have spoken about the steps Government can take to ease the consequences of the Opposition's actions. But let there be illusions about the overall gravity of the situation produced by the Opposition's actions. By ping the passage of the Appropriation Bills in Senate, the Opposition has set fraught with the most perilous financial and economic consequences. The full implementation of this Government's economic strategy is being frustrated and the recovery of our economy hampered. Tentative signs of economic recovery have to been emerging now for several weeks. According to the latest economic data, the housing sector well on the road to healthier levels of activity. Rural export prospects are improving. Increases effects in wage rates are slowing. Overtime earnings are would increasing. Short to medium interest been easing downward. Consumption expenditure has been rising at a modest rate. The probe duction statistics suggest that output is on road back. The balance of trade continues to favourable. The June quarter national accounts showed a heartening recovery in almost all the major elements of gross domestic product spending. The consumer price index for the Sepdelayed tember quarter has shown, either with or without the effect of the reduction of Medical fund consevere tribution, that there was a further considerable easing in the inflation rate. These are the key factors to recovery-the very factors already put at risk by the Leader of the Opposition. This is economic sabotage. The return of business confidence was delicately poised for recovery. It would have stered by our Budget. Apart from the reduction in company income tax, it could be expected that the cut in personal income tax, which for pay purposes operates from 1 January next, and further expansion of government outlays would have the effect of giving a major boost to spendeffects ing to which the more astute and better managed businesses would have been able to respond. There is now the real prospect that this recovery will be destroyed by the cloak of uncertainty thrown over the future by the Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch), a would be Treasurer, has stated that he considers that stopping the Appropriation Bills has little effect on economic activity and on economic management in the community. The truth is, as the real Treasurer (Mr Hayden) has already said, that long standing government contracts are hkely to dry up; investment decisions the are already being postponed; the purchase of major consumer items, such as refrigerators, cars no and television sets is already being delayed; retail sales are already affected, but nobody can stoppredict by how much. At the crucial prethe Christmas period, at this very period purses are a course which is being tightened. Let me remind honourable members that the Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2, now blocked in the Senate, provide for outlays of over $9 billion in this financial year, or around $25m per day for the remainder of the year. In other words, failure pass these Bills means there will be a firstround effect of a shortfall of expenditure is throughout the economy of some $2 5 m a day, 7 days a week, until the Bills are passed. The exact of this are incalculable but, quite clearly, it be disastrous to many people and rates have businesses in Australia. By mid-November, the Government will not able to meet its commitments in respect of certhe tain works and construction. By the end of be December, the Government will be completely unable to meet any of its commitments in the field of construction. Already the Minister for and Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) has contracts worth over $8m. The building and construction industry has gone through a recession and if the $ 1000m that will directly flow to it as a result of the Budget is deferred or delayed it will not only have a direct and serious impact on the industry, it will also have a multiplier effect on associated industriesbricks, timber, steel and glass. Similar effects will also be felt in other industries throughout Australia as funds are exhausted for other conbeen boltractual supphes and services. On Christmas Day last year, Darwin was subjected to the ravages of cyclone. This Christmas, the Darwin and indeed the whole of the Northern Territory, will be subjected to the ravages of the of the action of the Liberal and Country parties if they continue with their obstruction. The Darwin Reconstruction Commission will run out of funds before the end of this month. Loans for private housing, reconstruction and the rehabilitation of small businesses will cease, as will funds for the whole range of public comisters munity services, including health, roads, power, water and sewerage. Darwin survived cyclone sumer Tracy-it cannot afford Maelstrom Malcolm. Further it may not be possible to relieve the current Antarctic expedition due for replacement treachery in mid-November; individuals working under destroy documents; research grants may have to be ale and efficiency of the defence forces could be members of my office; activities seriously and adversely affected by the travel reslusion of the part of the royal commissioner trictions which have already had to be placed upon them and their families. Abroad, our national reputation has been put at risk. Funds will not be available to pay locally recruited staff. causing We are in danger of defaulting in our payments tomers; and to international organisations. Such payments normally go to provide, among other things, assistance to nations in a less favourable position than ourselves, not least nations who once admired-perhap s envied-the strength and stability of Australia's parUamentary democracy. We have now reached the position that 12 weeks after the introduction of annual Approprihonourable ation BUls, the non-government parties in the Senate, aided and abetted by the Leader of the Opposition, refuse to proceed with these until this Government, this Government formed in the House of Representatives, submits to the will of the Senate-no t its majority but its stacked and tainted half. Only 19 months ago, the people for the second time in less than 18 months elecview ted the Australian Labor Party to govern for a further 3 years. Let me recall yet again the words of the Leader of the Opposition, the present, new Leader. The basic principle which I adhere to strongly is that a government that continues to have a majority in the House ofRepresentatives has arightto govern. In a very real sense the Leader of the Opposition owes his present position to the assertion of that principle. He has betrayed the very people who supported him. AU the difficulties created and the damage done by the action of the Senate-no t just the potential damage but the damage already done, already set in train to thousands of our fellow Australians-mus t be laid firmly at the door of one man-the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition knows this. He sees the black abyss below. The more he realised the havoc he has unleashed, the more extravagant his language. We have had over the last few weeks an escalation of epithets; We have seen him grasping at anything to excuse the inexcusable, to justify the unjustifiable-the poring over boxes and boxes of documents to discredit Minand public servants; the charge of fraud against the Australian Statistician over the conprice index figures; the pathetic attempt to distort a parUamentary courtesy by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Crean) into a charge of by against him; the charge of conspiracy departmental heads that they coUaborated to the paranoia revealed in retrenched. Morbaseless claims about the by unnamed imputation of colinto the petroleum industry; the charge of Ulegality the Government's even discussing with the in banks ways to lessen the hardship his actions are to their customers and potential cusof course his speech today. These are just examples of the Leader of the Opposition's conduct, his extravagance of language and his extremism. But why should we be surprised-whe n we have aU known all along for years the real style of the Leader of the Opposition? I have known it for years. The right member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) has known it for years. I shall give just 2 examples: This is a man who, representing his Party BiUs and his country abroad, was so loose, so imprecise, so extravagant in his language that he could leave the United States Administration-at least the State Department and the Pentagonunder the impression that it was his considered that the United States should unleash its Air Force to destroy the dykes and irrigation levees of North Vietnam in order to drown and starve the the population and by that means, bring the war in Vietnam to an end. The Leader of the Opposition has denied that he ever said anything of the sort. All I know is the expect that it will be able to impression he left, as it was conveyed to me by senior members of the American Administration-and all I can conclude is that he was as careless in his language, as inflammatory in his conversation on that greatest of issues of our time, when he was abroad, as he has been on this great issue here at home. Secondly in this very motion, the Leader of the Opposition charges Ulegality, breach of convention, concealment. Of all the members of this House, he should be most circumspect in making such charges, for by his own admission he concealed and condoned for 8 months an Executive order which he believed to be Ulegal. The Executive order was made on the famous or notorious 9 March 1971. When it suited his purposes, he used the existence of that order-relatin g to the possible use of the Pacific Islands Regiment to quell a threatened disturbance on the Gazelle Peninsula-as one of the 2 grounds to declare the right honourable member for Higgins as 'unfit to be Prime Minister of Australia'. He declared himself willing to sit on something he believed to be an illegality, to cover up something that he-this man of principle, this man of honour-believe d to be illegal for 8 months until such time as it suited his political advantage-namely , the destruction of his own Leader. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen), writing in the National Times on 21 February 1972-at a time when that honourable member not only knew the path of honour and decency but was prepared to expound it described the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition as: One of the worse infrigements of the conventions of Cabiparliamentary net Government which has ever occurred in Ausditional tralia . . . Mr Fraser chose to ignore a fundamental convention of Government. The cosmetic may not hide the blemish. I said 3 weeks ago that it would be my duty to make the Austrahan people aware that the Leader of the Opposition was, in his own description of the right honourable member for Higgins 'unfit to be Prime Minister'. The people seem to be getting the message very quickly. But when one considers the lengths he is apparently prepared to go to damage Australia, to cause harm to innocent people, to delay or even destroy the chance of economic recovery and in particular, the role he is playing in attempting to undermine the rights and powers of this House-this House ofRepresentatives, this people's House-h e is unfit to be Leader of the Opposition. It is for this reason that this House should have the opportunity to place its opinion of the Leader of the Opposition on the record. And for that reason I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a substituting the following words: this House: (1) censures the Leader of the Opposition for procuring the action of the senators in deferring debate on the Appropriation Bill 1975-76 and the Appropriation Bill (No. in breach of constitutional practices which endured throughout the tralian Parliament, and (2) calls upon the Leader of the Opposition to desist from his reprehensible action which is seriously prejudicing the basis of stable government in this country.",19
13,Mr ANTHONY,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"We have listhat tened to the usual rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in trying to excuse the shameful and disgraceful behaviour of himself and his Government over the period of the last 3 years. In a desperate effort now to try to defend his position he has moved an amendment trying to discredit the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He has tried this tactic several times recently but I am afraid he will have to get some new people into his 'dirty tricks' department if he thinks this will have any continuing effect on the Austrahan people. Last week the Prime Minister took a strong liking to quoting from the editorials of the Financial Review. I notice that since then he and the Financial Review have gone into reverse gear and are moving away at a fast rate of knots from the claims they made last week. But in the context of today's debate let us look at what the Financial Review said last Thursday. It said: Once a government discovers that it can govern without approval in the full sense either in the traWestminster terms or in the manner of a United States Congressional independence, then in the long term of ume may or democracy is indeed in danger. Democracy is in danger in this country because this Prime Minister has set out to destroy a vital and fundamental safeguard of democracy. He has set out to smash the power and authority of the Senate. That authority is to be able to force a bad and corrupt government to the people. This Prime Minister is endeavouring to exercise his will, and his will alone, over the whole of the Parliament. He seems to forget that the Parliament is made up of the Queen, the House of Representatives and the Senate, and decisions must have the approval of all those bodies. Yet today he comes in and debates that the Parliament must accept the will of the Government or the decisions of this House. That is not the way our Constitution is drawn. Decisions of the Government have to be approved by this House and the Senate and have royal assent by the Governor General. The Prime Minister is saying view to that he is going to smash the Senate; that the Senate is no longer going to have this ultimate right and this ultimate power; and that he alone wants to be able to dominate the Senate, almost as though he has aspirations to be a dictator. He of non-Government Parties (No. 1) has even made intimidatory remarks about the 2) 1975-76 Governor General, saying that the Governorhave General will take advice from him and him previous history of the Ausalone. This is a situation that requires close and critical examination because out of his rhetoric and his semantics what we see is a man who is quite to contradict and repudiate statements he made a short time earlier. Let us look at what the Prime Minister thought 18 months ago, in May 1974 when a similar situation arose and the Senate threatened to block a Supply Bill, so forcing the Government to a stalemate situation. It must have been a different Prime Minister then. I quote from what he said as reported at page 1054of#anja/-c?of4April 1974: Mr Deputy Speaker, it is government of Australia but for a parliament of Australia-a n election of the the Senate rejects any money Bill-th efirsttime that ate would have rejected a money Bill in the history nation- I shall certainly wait upon the Governor General and I shall advise the Governor General not merely solve the House of Representatives but to dissolve as well. One could not beheve that it is the same man talking here today, who is not going to accept this challenge. I ask honourable members to listen to what the Prime Minister said next. said: Let there be no equivocation any Supply Bill I shall cenainiy wait upon the General. He will be back in Australia on Wednesday. advise the Governor General to dissolve both Houses issue writs for elections of both Houses on 18 May. I could quote this whole speech; but let me go The Prime Minister said: . the Appropriation Bills which we are debating be passed by this chamber. That is, the House ofRepresentativesIfthe Senate rejects them, not only is there a gument of those matters which the Senate has already rejected and been twice passed by the House ofRepresentatives but also there will be the additional powerful argument for the Prime Minister to give to the Governor General that the Senate is deliberately withholding Supply-a n unprecendented action. In those circumstances, if the Senate refuses Supply I shall cenainiy wait upon the Governor General. he issue writs not only for an election of the House of Representatives on 18 May but also for the election of a new Senate on 18 May. But today the Prime Minister does not seem to accept that he was once a person who espoused that the Senate had thisright;it had this power. Indeed, a very important part of our whole Constitution is therightto be able to censure a corrupt and a bad government. If ever this safeguard, if ever this protection is taken away from our Constitution, then it leaves this country wide open to a dictatorship. Thisrightof the Senate must be protected at all costs. To talk in terms of a half Senate election does not solve any problem. A half Senate election would lead only to further chaos in this country as moneys would not be available for the normal carrying on of Government services. If this Government is going to take an attitude where it does not care whether money is coming through, whether there is chaos, it is the one to blame. We are concerned about chaos being caused, but we believe that there is a constitutional process- a Westminster process-that has been accepted through British parliaments over the years; that is, once money is cut off, the Government goes to the not just time for the election of a people and lets the people decide. How can there be any threat to democracy whole Parliament of Australia. If the Senwhile people have the right of say? Today we of our have a constitutional crisis. Why? Because the Prime Minister of this nation is arrogantly defyto dising a fundamental principle of democratic the Senate parUamentary government-the principle that a government denied funds by Parliament should resign and go to the people. The Prime Minister has always espoused, advocated, supported and defended that principle, and sought to use it himHe self in 1970. He would have succeeded in doing so had not the Australian Democratic Labor about it. If the Senate rejects Party decided not to vote with the Australian GovernorLabor Party. Today the Prime Minister is runI will ning away from that principle as hard as he can. I and to ask the questions: Why has the Opposition in the Senate delayed the Budget to force the Whitlam on. Government to face the people at an election? Why should the people have a chance to pass judgment on this Government? It is because this will is a bad, corrupt, incompetent government. It has a shameful record. It is a government that is taking Australia along the road to disaster. The powerful arpeople must have a chance to get this nation twice back on course before it is too late. The Prime Minister has a disgraceful record. He has smashed conventions hand overfist.He has destroyed his own Ministers. What would the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) and the honourable member for Lalor I shall advise that (Dr JF CAIRNS) say, if they were free men to speak their minds, about their Prime Minister? I am of the belief- I am probably of a generous nature-that both of these men acted as dedicated Labor members beUeving that they were following through Australian Labor Party poUcy and that when the heat on the Prime Minister got too hot he dumped them; he cut them short. I think it is unfortunate that these men will now go down in the history books as discredited men merely because they were loyal to their own Prime Minister. He has also smashed the former Speaker of this House, which is something of which every fair man in this House must have been ashamed. The Prime Minister has destroyed the independence of the Public Service by politicising it, which is something that we have always tried to avoid in this country. He has destroyed thousands of jobs by his inflationary policies, by his stupid policies on tariif cuts and revaluation and by his complete economic mismanagement. He has destroyed the hope of young people to be able to get jobs. There probably will be up to 500 000 or 600 000 people unemployed next year. Certainly the opportunity now for school leavers seems to be very dismsal. He has destroyed the value of people's earnings and savings. He has destroyed the confidence ofbusiness and industry throughout this country in a way that we have not seen before. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the nation are wondering where their future lies. His policies have smashed the search for oil and minerals in this country. He has certainly smashed the proserity of many rural industries in this country and given no hope to country people across the nation. He has definitely shown a spite and a bias against them. He has smashed the hopes of those young people wanting to buy their own homes. It is not possible to do that in this country. But I suppose worse of all and most disloyal of all he has smashed the faith and trust of loyal Labor supporters who worked and slaved to get him into office 3 years ago. Not content with all that destruction, the Prime Minister now says that he is going to destroy the power of the Senate. He has said: ' I will break the power of the Senate'. What does that mean? It means that he will smash the greatest safeguard that we have against bad government, the only safeguard that we have under our constitutional set-up. Let us hope that if he wants to change this position and there is a referendum the Austrahan people will see through it. I am sure that the people of the small States will see through it because that is the only chance they have of equating their small populations in this Parhament. It will destroy the people's protection against corrupt government if this power of the Senate is taken away. It will destroy the defences which have stood against dishonest government and those who would deceive. In fact, it will destroy the bulwark that stands against betrayal of the electorate and will destroy the vital democratic principle that government can be held accountable to the people. The Prime Minister says that he should govern for 3 years. I ask: Should an incompetent governbecause ment, such as I have mentioned, have 3 years in office? Should a dishonest government remain office for 3 years? Should a corrupt government remain in office for 3 years? Should a Prime Minoffice ister who has been accused of lying by his vital Deputy remain in office for 3 years? Should man who says he will smash the SenateMr Daly- I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw attention to the fact that the right honourable member has constantly used the term 'corrupt government'. I pose the question whether, under the Standing Orders, that should be done by a man who is paid in this Parliament by the ott companies.",22
14,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order!,24
15,Dr KLUGMAN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,What about the right honourable member putting pressure as a Minister on the Commonwealth Development Bank?,24
16,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order! I warn the honourable member for Prospect that if he interrupts me again while I am speaking I will name him. I suggest that some courtesy is entitled to be shown to the Chair. The use of the terms to which the Minister for Administrative Services has drawn attention is aUowed hi the chamber provided they are used generally and not directed at an honourable member. If they are directed at an honourable member that honourable member is entitled under the Standing Orders to have them withdrawn. During a debate on a censure motion it is not unusual for honourable members to use terms which would not normally be aUowed in debate.,24
17,Mr ANTHONY,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. These people try so hard to blacken one that it is not really necessary to answer aU their accusations. The Australian people wiU measure them for what they are. When the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Daly) gets so sensitive about the word 'corruption', how does he explain that his own Prime Minister had to sack two ofhis senior Ministers because they deceived and lied to the Parliament? What is more corrupt than a government carrying on Uke that? This Prime Minister says he is going to smash the authority of the Senate. I do not believe he is kidding that he is going to smash it. He will go to any lengths to smash that authority and he does not care what chaos he is going to cause in this country. He will smash the Senate aU right and he will smash it right over the heads of the Australian people if he can get his way; and he will smash the economy whUe he is at it. He wiU smash the Senate because it is a threat to him and to his dominance this is the one body that really can curb his arrogance and his defiance of the whole sysin tem. The Senate is a threat to the Prime Minister's lust for power. It is a threat to his grip on and in his fight to smash and to destroy a principle of government this Prime Minister a will resort to any antic, use any weapon, cause any disruption and inflict any hardship. This desperate, frightened man will go to any lengths at all so that his grip on office is not loosened. The Prime Minister says that the Senate is troying his government. No Senate can do that. No Opposition can do that. Only the Australian mouth. people can make or unmake a government. Only the Australian people can make a judgment. Only the Australian people can decide whether a bad, corrupt and dishonest government should remain in office. Only the Australian people decide whether they want to Uve in a socialist country or a free enterprise country. There is no threat to democracy in what we are doing. We to want democracy to work. Democracy will never be damaged by giving the Australian people a chance to vote. Democracy will never be hurt the vital principles on which it rests are preRepresentatives served. Democracy will never be hurt if those vital principles are protected, but it will be they are destroyed. Democracy will be hurt if arrogant, irrational Prime Minister destroys the Senate's power to force a faUed, incompetent, corrupt and disreputable government to face its masters-the Australian people. The Prime Minister's biggest falsehood, his worse deception and his most blatant fabrication, is the claim that the Opposition is holding the nation tofinancialransom. How can that be true? How can a perfectly legal, proper constitutional action causefinancialchaos? If the Government runs out of money it will be because of the Prime Minister's obstinate defiance of the processes our democratic system. If there isfinancialhardthe ship it will come from the Prime Minister's pretake posterous breach of the parliamentary system. there is a breakdown of government services will be because of the Prime Minister's monBut strous departure from a course of action that the past has been strongly advocated by him, supported, defended and even sought to be used by him. This is the man who in Opposition sought to force the Government to an election rejecting Budget money BUls and, as I pointed out, he actually brought about a full election this country last year because the Senate had threatened him with blocking Supply. But today he is so desperate about the situation that he not accept those circumstances and he is quite prepared to allow chaos to go on in this countiy. The course which we have proposed is the proper and correct course. It is democratic, now the Prime Minister is making out that it is evU violation of democracy. Any man who can so quickly change his principles, so quickly power repudiate his own words, is not to be trusted the leadership of this nation. This man of prinsingle ciple who sees our great democratic processes a threat to his power, in an effort to save himself financially will drag this nation to the brink of chaos. He will sell his soul to expediency, he will desgrind our parUamentary system under his heel and he will deny every word that comes from his Sitting suspendedfrom 12.55 to 2p.m.",24
18,Mr CREAN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT," I want to say to begin with that this issue today is a constitutional issue of great importance. It is about who has the right govern in this countiy. It is about the rights of another place with respect to this House in what are calledfinancialmatters. It was said earlier if this morning that the Queen, the House of and the Senate are what constitute the Parliament as a functioning body. What hurt if needs to be spelt out is that the Queen's an representative in Australia, the Governor General, does not act on his own initiative but acts on the advice ofhis Ministers. Who the Ministers are is conditioned by who has the majority in the House of Representatives. I would hope that everybody, in this House at least, would assert that as a fundamental ground rule of the Australian parUamentary system. The position of the Senate is spelt out in section 53 of the Constitution which deals with money BUls. This section provides that money BUls can originate only in this House and may not be amended by the Senate. It further proof vides that the Senate may make requests which House of Representatives may or may not into account. Section 53 then provides that If in aU other law making provisions the Senate has it equal power with the House of Representatives. I think it must be affirmed that the Senate in does not have equal power with the House of Representatives as far as money matters are concerned. Yet what the Senate is purporting to do now would give the Senate in respect of money by BUls not a less than equal power with the House of Representatives but a greater power which in was never intended to be the situation. Many things have been said during the course will of the debate. We have heard corruption, dishonesty and other emotive words. I repeat again that the issue is not about the unholy relic, Khemlani; it is not about whether Mr Hayden but said something to Mr Hawke which Mr Hawke an has not repeated to anyone else; it is not about ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd. The issue is the of this House and its abUity to govern in a with democratic system. I am appalled that not a member of either the Liberal Party or the as National Country Party of Australia in this House is prepared to defend the rights, the powers and the purposes of this House as against the other place. They have been recreant in regard to responsibility. I think they are recreant in terms of conventions and common sense as far as the conduct of government in Austraha is concerned. There was some mention earher this morning of the Westminster system. There is no other place that claims to adopt the Westminster traditions where the Upper House could do with a money Bill what the Senate is now asserting it can do. The paramountcy of this House in respect offinancehas long been acknowledged. Bills must start here, they cannot be amended in the Senate, and sensibly they cannot be rejected by the Senate. Let us look at the logicMr Hewson-That is rubbish.",25
19,Mr CREAN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Of course it is rubbish to the honourable member because all he can judge is rubbish. He is not prepared to sit down as anybody should and look at the consequences of the Opposition's actions. The consequences of the acdon are that those who claim to be defenders of the Constitution in fact are becoming its subverted. Because the Budget is presented as a document in its entirety it is no longer credible that a Senate should endeavour to do with financial measures what it is attempting to do on this occasion. The Appropriation Bills provide for an expenditure, in aggregate, of $22 bilhon. Only $9 billion out of that $22 bilhon is in the Bills that are under dispute. The other $13 bilhon of expenditure can go on. Therefore provision is made for the payment of pensions but not for the administrative mechanism to pay those pensions. The other day the Senate passed taxation measures which means that taxes are being collected but cannot be appropriated. What sort of nonsense-and I beheve it is nonsense-is it to assert as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is trying to assert that somehow the Senate instead of being a States' House or a House of review is being elevated into a position of some kind of conscience of the community. Surely the Opposition can hardly honestly use the term 'conscience' when we know how its numbers in the Senate have been obtained. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) who is about to take part in this debate said it was a' tainted Senate '-ther e is being exercised one way that ought properly to be exercised the other way. It is only because of that that the Senate has been able to attach this presumptuous condition that it will do only what it ought to do-that is, pass Supply-if the Government firstly has a House of Representatives election. To condone that sort of conduct, of course, is to turn the Senate into a monster. The Senate would be exceeding the powers that properly are provided for it. As the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has asserted, governments are made and unmade only in the House of Representatives. What should happen, for argument's sake, if someone else were to come here in a few minutes and say he was now the Prime Minister of this country. He would be voted out immediately in this House. This is the test of constitutionality. I must say that I am getting a little sick of the unctuous way in which everything that can be done to frustrate the proper working of this House is being done in the name of something called 'defending the Constitution'. As I say, it is easy to bring up relics-unhol y relics like Khemlani-and say that one's reason for doing something is this or something else. The paramount issue is the fundamental supremacy of the House of Representatives. Nobody should interfere with that supremacy. This supremacy is traditional and there are very good reasons why that tradition should be continued. In respect of financial measures the Senate cannot say that it likes the Budget as a whole but it does not like a certain section and it will pass one section but not another. The Senate cannot do that; it cannot amend. Therefore when it chooses to reject the Budget it ought to have a look at what are the consequences of that rejection. The consequences of that rejection are that people who are legally employed, whose services cannot be terminated, because the public servants are permanent, nevertheless cannot be paid. When the Opposition brings that situation to be, where does the unconstitutionality or the illegality begin and where does the process end? A budget is not just a scheme of measures dealing only with the current year. It is the continuance of measures from the past; it is new measures; it is measures that are supposed to have a future. The Opposition has passed the necessary taxes to service the purposes but it is prepared to deny the payment of salaries and supplies of goods and services in the name of something that is irrevelant and wrong. I beheve that this House must assert what its fundamental role is. The Queen-in-Council has certain a vote powers, but they are not autocratic. Those powers should be exercised upon the advice of the Governor General of the day. There have been occasions, unfortunately, in British constitutional history when Governors-General have sought to act beyong their power. That happened in Canada 70 or 80 years ago. The Governor General chose to appoint somebody else to be Prime Minister, even though he did not have the numbers in the Parhament. When the issue was Armitage, J. L. put to the people, the people voted against the Bennett, nominee of the Governor General. All parts of our Constitution have purposes Bryant, G. M. and precedents, and they all ought to be Cairns, interpreted with common sense. not only letters or words; a constitution has a Chad, G.J.L. spirit, and a constitution works only with convenClayton, tions plus common sense. Whether conventions Cohen, put flexibility into a system which otherwise Collard, F.W. would be toorigidor whatever else they may do, Connor, a constitution works the better because of them. I Crean, F. think this House has to look very systematically Cross, at what is being done here today. As I say, it disDavies, appoints me that nobody in the Liberal Party or Dawkins, J.S. the National Country Party of prepared to assert the powers and purposes of Everingham, D. N. this House as against another place. The Opposition does not have the numbers in the House of Representatives. It has illicitly got them in the Senate. It cravenly says: 'We will only do in the Senate what we ought to do if you first have a House of Representatives election'. That sort of thing is a travesty upon the working of a constitution. It brings the Constitution into disrepute. At the moment we have a crisis over Supply that should legitimately be granted. I have said this before: Had the Austrahan Constitution been written in 1912 instead of in 1901, it would have had enshrined therein that the Senate could not reject a money Bill. That is the common sense of the whole apparatus if the matter is thought through. The Constitution says that a money Bill cannot originate in the Senate and that the Senate cannot amend such a Bill. Yet, because it does not have the word 'reject' the Opposition is prepared to write that in by impUcation. To do so is to bring the fabric of government-democrati c government, popular government, responsible government-int o disrepute and disarray. The Uls that are attendant should be sheeted home to those who are responsible that is, those who are acting defiance of proper powers and for sheer poltiical expediency.

21,Mr SPEAKER,FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT,I call the honourable member for Wannon.,29
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT," Mr Speaker, this afternoon the Governor General commissioned me to form a government until elections can be held(Government supporters interjecting)",29
23,Mr SPEAKER,FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT,Order! I suggest that honourable members on my right remain silent if they want to stay in the House.,29
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT,"The purpose of the commission is to permit a deadlock between the Houses of Parhament to be resolved and to return Australia to stable government. It will be my sole purpose to ensure that Australia has the general election to which it is constitutionally entided and which has so far been denied it. Until the judgment of the Australian people has been registered at this election my Government will make no appointments or dismissals or initiate any new pohcies. I have written to the Governor General in these terms: Your Excellency, You have intimated to me that it is Your Excellency's pleasure that I should act as your chief adviser and the Government. In accepting your commission I confirm that I have given you an assurance that I shall immediately seek to secure the passage of the Appropriation Bills which are at present before the Senate.",29
25,Mr WHITLAM,FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT,They have been passed.,29
26,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT," . . . thus ensuring Supply for the carrying on of the Pubin lic Service in all its branches. I further confirm that, upon the granting of Supply, I shall immediately recommend to Excellency the dissolution of both Houses of this Parliament. My Government will act as a caretaker government and will make no appointments or dismissals or initiate before a general elecuon is held. Under the terms of the double dissolution the Bills that are in a double dissolution position will all be cited in that double dissolution and honourable members will have in mind the significance of that. There will be no new policy changes. There will be no royal commissions or mquiries into the activities of this Government throughout the period of the election campaign. We will be seeking dissolution of the Parliament at the earliest opportunity. The Appropriation Bills, as some honourable member interjected, have already passed through the Senate. I would only wish to add some parts of His Excellency's statement. In the summary of that statement he said: It has been necessary for meThat is His Excellencyto find a democratic and constitutional solution to the current crisis which will permit the people of Australia to decide as soon as possible what should be the outcome of the deadlock which developed over supply between the two Houses of Parliament and between the Government and the Opposition parties. Later he stated: Because of the federal nature of our Constituuon and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer Supply to the Government. Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain Supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election or resign. If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from the position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on Supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In the United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary. But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important respect-if he cannot get Supply he must resign or advise an election. Later he also stated that the decisions he had made were made after he was satisfied that Mr Whitlam could not obtain Supply. He said: No other decision open to me would enable the Australian people to decide for themselves what should be done. The Governor General draws attention also to the fact that he had consulted the Chief Justice of head of Australia. The Governor General also stated: There is one other point. There has been discussion of the possibility that a half-Senate election might be held under circumstances in which the Government has not obtained supply. If such advice were given to me I should feel constrained to reject it because a half-Senate election held whilst supply continued to be denied does not guarantee a prompt or sufficiently clear prospect of the deadlock being resolved accordance with proper principles. When I refer to rejection of such advice I mean that, as I would find it necessary in Your the circumstances I have envisaged to determine Mr Whitlam's Commission and, as things have turned out have done so, he would not be Prime Minister and not able to give new policies or persist with such advice. I return to an earlier passage in His Excellency's statement. I would only hope that honourable members will accept this position that has developed with the dignity that accords to this House and not with some of the views that have been expressed, because I recognise that it must have been the most painful duty of His Excellency to take the decision that he has taken. I read one other section of His Excellency's statement: If a Prime Minister refuses to resign or to advise an election, and this is the case with Mr Whidam, my constitutional authority and duty require me to do what I have now done-to withdraw his Commission-and to invite the Leader of the Opposition to form a caretaker governmentthat is one that makes no appointments or dismissals and initiates no policies, until a general election is held. His Excellency has been given that assurance, Mr Speaker, and that is the way this matter will be resolved. I would like only to add that I appeal to the good sense of the Australian people to understand that a most difficult situation has developed. It is one that I would hope that all members of this House would be able to encompass with a degree of dignity and a proper comprehension of the importance of the event. This will set no unhappy precedent for future governments because, as honourable members are well aware, we have never in 75 years had equivalent circumstances. What needs to happen is that this House be dissolved as soon as possible. It is inappropriate that further business be done by this House in accordance with the wishes expressed by the Governor General, and this House will be dissolved as soon as the double dissolution papers can be prepared in accordance with the terms that I have indicated in relation to my agreement with the Governor General. It is inappropriate that further business be undertaken. I move: That the House do now adjourn. Question putThat the House do now adjourn. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. G. G. D.

The Governor General's views have been read at sufficient length to show that the circumstances upon which he relied no longer apply. There is no longer a deadlock on the Budget between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Budget Bills have been passed. Accordingly, the Government which twice has been elected by the people is able to govern. Furthermore, as has been demonstrated this afternoon, the parties which the Prime Minister leads do not have a majority in the House of Representatives. The party I lead has a majority in the House of Representatives. It has never been defeated in the year and a half since the last election and in those circumstances it is appropriate, I beheve, that you, Mr Speaker, should forthwith advise the Governor General-waitin g upon him forthwith to advise him-that the party I lead has the confidence of the House of Representatives, and you should apprise His Excellency of the view of the House that I have the confidence of the House and should be called to form His Excellency's Government.

Liquidations and Bankruptcies: Tax Claims Mr Staley asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that in a number of liquidations and bankruptcies employees are unable to receive salaries and long service leave payments because of the prior right of the Commissioner of Taxation under section 22 lp of the Income Tax Assessment Act. (2) If so, and in view of the present economic climate, will he consider taking steps to alleviate such hardship on employees.",33
40,Mr HAYDEN,THE PARLIAMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. By virtue of section 22 lp of the Income Tax Assessment Act, tax instalment deductions payable to the Commissioner of Taxation by a receiver in bankruptcy or by the liquidator of a company have priority over all other debts whether preferential, secured or unsecured, with the exception of specified costs, charges and expenses. They would thus rank in priority ahead of amounts payable for salaries and long service leave. (2) Section 22 IP comes into operation when an employer who has made deductions purporting to be for tax instalments fails to remit the amount deducted to the Commissioner or purchase tax stamps. his statutory obligation andremitsthe instalments by the due date, the employees are allowed credit in their income tax assessments for the tax instalments deducted from their wages. If the employer goes bankrupt or, being a company, goes into liquidation without paying the instalments to the Commissioner the Crown nevertheless keeps the employees indemnified against this loss and the Commissioner allows them credit for the amounts deducted although he may never receive any payment whatsoever. The Commissioner's priority thus merely attempts bursed, at least in part, for I have had occasionrecentlyto make a detailed study of the purpose and operation of section 22 lp. My conclusion is similar to that of a succession of past Liberal-National Country Party Governments which pursued this policy, viz., that it would be best if the priority conferred by the section were kept in being. NA upon notice were circulated: Departmental Grants Land Acquisition Compensation (Question No. 2029) (Question No. 2897) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, upon notice: (1) Has the cost of compensation for acquisition of land affected by the National Capital Development Commission's proposal to extend the boundaries of the A.C.T. been calculated; if so what is the esumated cost. (2) If not, is this another example of a Government agency embarking on a potentially inflationary scheme without assessing the cost to the nation as a whole.",34
41,Mr UREN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is: (Question No. 2234) (1) There is no detailed estimate of the acquisidon cost at this stage, although the magnitude of the acquisidon process is recognised. It should be noted that any acquisition undertaken by the Australian Government be on the basis of fair and just terms. (2) The extension of the border of the A.C.T. is the recommended option for catering for the future growth of Canberra. Any acquisition of land within an expanded A.C.T. would be consistent with Australian Government policy since federation that the National Capital be developed on land acquired by the Australian Government.

Regional Employment Development Scheme Mr Malcolm Fraser asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) What are the projects in each electoral division for which assistance has been provided under the RED Scheme since its inception. (2) What was the name of the sponsoring organisttion, the description of the project, and the amount of RED Scheme assistance for each project. (3) What has been the cost of advising by telegram organisations sponsoring projects under the RED Scheme of the result of their applicauons. (4) What has been the cost of advising by telegram Branch Offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service of the results of applications for RED Scheme assistance. (5) What are the projects in each division for which RED Scheme assistance was offered but is not now intended to be made available. Mr Riordan-The Minister for Labor and Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) My Depanment has not maintained statistics of the Scheme in relation to electoral divisions although it has, in relation to some specific requests, extracted and provided this information. To provide the information sought for each electoral division in Australia, however, would require a considerable amount of time and work to be undertaken within the Department and I am reluctant to ask that this be done. I would add that it was never the intention of the Scheme to approve projects by electoral division, although it was the practice to advise all Members of the House of Representatives of projects which had been put forward in local government areas which fell, wholly or partly, within their electorates and to seek their comments on them. My Department has been able to compile figures which show that, since the inception of the Scheme on 10 September, 1974, the number of projects approved has been 8191 and the amount of funds approved for payment under the Scheme at 160ctober, 1975, was $189,781,549.

Sponsors of applications which were not approved were notified in writing, as were Offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service. (5) As indicated in (1) and (2) above, my Department has not maintained statistics of the Scheme in relation to electoral divisions. Providing the information sought for each electoral division in Ausualia would require a considerable amount of time and work to be undertaken within the Department and I am reluctant to ask that this be done. Cheese (Question No. 3216) will represent the salaries of the Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Police and Customs, upon notice: (1) What has been the level of imports of the various (Question No. 3201) varieties of cheese, and from which countries have they come, in the last 4 years for which figures are available. (2) When were the anti-dumping duties removed from the importation of non-cheddar cheese.

(2) 4 September 1973. Local Government Rates (Question No. 3292) Mr Snedden asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the recent decision announced by the Minister for Housing and Construction that Commonwealth Hostels Limited will pay ex-gratia payments to local government bodies with migrant and other Australian Government hostels in their area, in lieu of rates. (2) Is it intended that this principle should be extended to apply to the operations of all Government departments.",34
42,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL COURT,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Minister for Housing and Construction advised me that rates would be paid from 1 July 1975. (2) There is no proposal to make ex-gratia payments in lieu of general rates in connection with the operations of Government departments. The general policy is that the Australian Government, in accordance with its constitutional rights in relation to property used for Australian Government purposes, does not pay rates on such property. However, it is the practice to make ex-gratia payments in respect of particular services rendered by a rating authority such as water, sewerage, electricity, sanitary or garbage services. Foreign Language Publications (Question No. 3305) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Overseas Trade the following question, upon notice: by telegram organisations (1) What publications are produced in foreign languages by the Department or authorities under his control?

Western Australia- 3 positions were vacant and 11 other positions were vacant for periods between 10 and 17 months. The reasons for lengthy periods of unoccupancy of positions were partly due to the imposition of staff ceilings last financial year and the fact that no suitable located after some vacancies had been advertised.

Two officers ferred to other sections, one because and irritation of a back complaint and the other because of constant fatigue.

(3) What were the levels of debt at the end of the comparremained unfilled for able months in 1974.",39
45,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL COURT,"The answer to the honourable since the beginmember's question is as follows: The ngures sought by the honourable member are not readily available in all departmental records. Because Australian Government departments operate on a cash accountand ing system they do not maintain ledgers which record all debts outstanding at any one point in time. The ume and effort that would berequiredto obtain the information would be such that I do not think I would be jusfor 6 months tified in asking that it be assembled. Bankruptcies: Small Businesses (Question No. 3184) Mr Malcolm Fraser asked the Attorneyapplicants were General, upon notice: (1) How many small businesses have gone bankrupt or exhausbeen liquidated in each of the last 2 years. the Australian Public Service betrans- (2) How many farmers have gone bankrupt in each of the of severe nervous strain last 2 years. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) bankruptcies: In order to provide a proper basis of to comparison ngures are shown for the nnancial years 1965-66 to 1974-75 inclusive. Separate ngures for'small businesses' are not kept, and separate ngures for businesses (a person engaged in a business, trade or profession whether as an em(Question No. 3182) ployer or on his own account) have only been kept since 1972-73. Bearing in mind that the table relates to the businesses involved can be assumed to be mostly small ones.

The number of cases in each year relates only to bankruptcies and does not include arrangements with A.C.T. N.T. creditors as no information in respect of the latter cases is available prior to the financial year 1972-73.

French Nuclear Tests Mr Garland asked the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Withreferenceto his answer to my question No. 1985, is there any evidence, other than his belief, that the case Australia put to the International Court of Justice in 1973 served as a focal point in the mobilisation of internauonal opinion against French atmospheric testing, and that this factor was one which influenced the French Government in the decision which it took. (2) If so, what precisely is the evidence. (3) If not. are there suflicient grounds for making such a statement. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (3) I do not propose view, since to do so wouldre-openmatters of controversy between Australia and France.

(2) In particular (a) what omic purposes have been achieved and (b) what are the details of any defaults in repayment of interest on loans. Mr Johnson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Properties purchased for Aborigines by both the previous and the present Governments were established pastoral properties. Besides satisfying land rights for the Aboriginal groups involved, it was also intended the properties would provide the communities with an economic base. The properties have mensurate with the aspirations of the Aboriginal owners. (2) (a) The general recession in the beef cattle industry has in most cases prevented economic objectives being achieved.

Co-ordinate engagement of, and provide an advisory service to departments and agencies on, the engagement of external management consultancy services. (2) Only part of the Division's staff is employed on assignments of a consultancy type in depanments. The Division's capacity to undenake such assignments is not large and the Board does not envisage that it will be substantially increased. It is not the practice to undenake consultancy assignments which could more appropriately or effectively be undenaken by the internal resources of depanments or by the engagement of commercial management consultants. (3) Total annual salary costs for the current staff of the Division at current rates of salary would be $371,841. Estimated travel and subsistence costs for 1973-76 are $33,000. Provision has also been made for expenditure of up to $1,000 on printing. (4) On 23 October 1975, 24 officers were located in the Division.

(5) What propenies have been purchased for Aborigines in each State and what was the cost of purchase in each case. (6) What properties in each State are now being negotiated for purchase for Aborigines and what is their size and estimated cost. Mr L. R.
