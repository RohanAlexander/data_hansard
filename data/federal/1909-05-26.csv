8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to inform the House that, at the summons of His Excellency the Governor General, I attended in the Senate chamber, where His Excellency was pleased to deliver his opening speech, of which for greater accuracy I have obtained a copy, though, I presume, it will not be considered necessary for me to read it (vide page 5). Motion (by Mr FISHER) agreed toThat a Committee, consisting of Mr Roberts, Mr Hall, Mr Frazer, and Mr Catts be appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament. Ordered That the Committee do report this day. The Committee having retired, re-entered the Chamber, and presented the proposed Address-in-Reply, which was read by the Clerk, as follows :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to Our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.",16
9,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [3.1] move- . That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House. I recognise that the Ministry, in doing me the honour of asking me to submit this motion for the consideration and, let us hope, the adoption of the House, followed the ordinary custom of giving that opportunity to the last man to be elected to the Chamber. If , during the course of my remarks, r happen not to follow the custom ordinarily observed in submitting similar motions to the House, I am confident that honourable members will do me the honour of believing, at all events, that the departure is not due to any disrespect for those who have preceded me in discharging a like duty, but is made under the belief that at times a change may be acceptable. The labour movement, if I understand it at all, develops the very highest and best individuality in every man, provided that individuality is compatible with the general good. That is in marked contrast to the form of individuality to which we raise, I hope, reasonable objection-that shown by some persons who acquire wealth by the poverty of their brethren. Consequently, if in submitting this motion. I do not follow the ordinary custom it will be recognised that in my view some slight alteration may be acceptable to honourable members, and the responsibility will attach entirely to myself. I should like to express my regret .that the honourable member for Kooyong is not with us today; for I sincerely hope that his severe illness will be of short duration, and that we may have the pleasure of soon witnessing his return. I can extend my sympathy also in the direction of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. We remember-som e with pleasure, others, perhaps, in no pleasing mood-the ' able and vigorous address with which he last favoured us, and regret sincerely that he should have been laid aside so long as the result of the energy he then displayed in the conscientious, discharge of his public duties. Let me say that I can conscientiously regret the absence through illness of the honourable member for Kooyong, notwithstanding that we have been recently on opposite sides in respect of an industrial trouble. I take this opportunity of expressing my sincere regret that after the decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration the directorate of the Broken Hill Proprietary should have thought fit to victimize certain citizens of Australia for I no other reason than that those citizens, acting in conformity with the laws of their country, had taken office in certain associations of workmen. I should not like at this juncture to say anything severe, but I feel that with few exceptions it will be agreed throughout the Commonwealth that such conduct is reprehensible. I hope that unions and associations of workmen, being legal institutions in Australia-and practically throughout the Empire-and their officers therefore entitled to respect and consideration, it will not long remain in the power of any private individual to say that although the law is conformed to - that although the individual has broken no law or rule of his country-h e can still be so victimized that the bread is taken from his mouth and the mouths of his wife and children. When I remember the Australian Federation of Employers and remember, too, their black list which circulates throughout the Commonwealth, I cannot but repeat that the victimizing of these citizens' is most reprehensible. Honourable members will not expect me to cover the whole length and breadth of the Speech withwhich His Excellency the Governor General has been pleased to open Parliament. I have scarce had time to read it",16
10,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Did not the honourable member obtain an advance copy ?,17
11,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I have scarcely had time to read it in the light of being able to debate it with the honourable member for Corio. It is possible that in other directions honourable members will not be too severe when they remember that the Speech was read but a few moments ago, and that necessarily one of such a lengthy character, embracing as it does many and important subjects, requires serious and careful consideration. There stand out in .it four or five items of marked! importance, to which the attention of honourable members may be briefly directed. I do so, not that I presume that they will follow in my footsteps, but because they appear to me to be of paramount importance. We cannot fail to recognise that the Ministry during the recess have been particularly atten. tive to their duties.",17

14,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I believe that the people of Australia like their public men to tour the Commonwealth; they like to know and see and understand them, and I am confident that it is the duty of public men to know and understand the people. How is that possible if honourable members remain secluded? But perhaps seclusion becomes some honourable members more than publicity. The Ministry have displayed an energy and determination that future Ministries will desire to emulate. At any rate they hrve ftdl confidence in the policy that they have submitted, and they have not been lacking in detail in submitting it to the consideration of the country. I wish here to offer in public my congratulations to them for their energy and determination, and for the confidence they have displayed in their policy, and to express the hope that it will not be long before we see that policy put into operation. There stands out in this speech one prominent feature-that Ministers have recognised the obligations of the Commonwealth, and have expressed their intention, as clearlv as, I think, it can be put in a speech at the opening of Parliament, that those obligations shall be honourably and fully met. They have shown that, particularly with respect to finance, we shall not in the future, as in the past, be prodigal only to find prodigality in return where the money has been going, while unduly restricting expenditure in national directions where it is urgently required. There is also in the speech a recognition of the value and necessity of taking over the control of the States debts. We have had considerable discussion about the subject, the papers have teemed with proposals regarding it, and past Ministries have been prolific in suggestions, but scarce anything of a concrete character has yet been submitted that is likely to find favour with the people of Australia. I welcome the advent of a Ministry which practically says that it is prepared to take over the States debts, and discloses distinctly the fact that that course will result in a saving of very many millions of pounds annually to Australia. It is re'grettable that persons in responsible offices in the various States should, notwithstanding the possible saving, still so persistently refuse the terms offered them, and refuse even to submit proposals of a character likely to be acceptable to the people generally. But if there is one proposal more important than any other, to which we might direct our attention, it is that of immigration, for bound up with it are two other proposals-that of finding land for those who emigrate to our shores, and that of defence. The three questions seem inseparable. Juggle with words, howyou may, decry one proposal how you like, the three are inseparably combined. You cannot with justice to yourselves, or to the immigrants, ask them to come here unless you can give them conditions superior to those they propose to leave-unles s you can reasonably say to them that there are in Australia opportunities of employment, for putting their mental and physical abilities into practical operation, so that they may obtain for themselves Governor-GeneraVs Speech: and those dependent upon them a living a little superior to that to which they have been accustomed in other parts of the world. At this juncture, I regret to note that, while other parties are putting forward prominently the subject of immigration, they are forced at the same time to admit that there is no land available in Australia for immigrants, and that there are thousands of people today-bon d fide farmers, capable men, born in our own country, with some little capital in addition to their practical experience-hungril y seeking land and unable to obtain it.",17
15,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Sen d them to the West.,18
16,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Distan t fields are always green. Singularly enough, despite the fact that Victoria has a population of only a little over 1,300,000, people are leaving this State because they cannot obtain land. Does the honourable member assert that the land in this State is being put to proper use when there is no land available? Do we indulge ih legislation of a national character? Is it just, is it honourable, is it creditable, shall I say to the Parliament of Victoria, for instance, that her sons, her yeomanry-and in this connection I. recall the well-known linesBut a bold peasantry, their country's pride, When once destroy'd can never be suppliedshould be seeking land in other directions, going east or west as the case may be? The honourable member knows as well as I do that there are millions of acres of land in this State monopolized by a few persons, whose superfluous wealth is not always used in the direction in which it might be used. The honourable member is like others who refuse to put into operation anything of a practical character, and who, when spoken to on this particular subject, invariably say, "" Go east, go west, go somewhere else, but touch not the cancer at hand."" That is practically the situation. Fortunately, however, this Parliament, at any rate, is representative of the whole of Australia, and what shall we say to those men? An honourable member representing a portion of Victoria may say, ""Go east,"" or ""Go west,"" but what shall the Federal Parliament say to those who in Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland, or South Australia, are crying out for land? You can name no land of a suitable character upon which there is a reasonable hope of finding even a pittance,, and which is put forward by any State Government for application, for [2]- 2 [26 MAY, 1909.] Address-in-Reply. 35 which the number of applicants does not exceed by scores, by hundreds, the number of available blocks. What shall we in the Federal Parliament say to those men? , Can we send them to any particular spot? Shall we not touch the trouble? Shall we not endeavour to put into force legislation that we may reasonably hope will have the effect, not merely in one particular sandy portion, but over the whole of Australia, of opening up the available lands now monopolized by a few persons, and not out to a truly effective use of opening them, not only to those whom we have .here now, ready and able, to occupy them, but also to the thousands who are willing to come here and put their practical experience into use for the benefit of Australia? It seems to me that when honourable members continue to employ cries of that description, say-, ing, ""Go east,"" or ""Go west,"" refusing to touch the difficulty in their immediate centres, and looking always at the fields and pastures that are far away, they are neglecting a public duty, and that neglect must reflect seriously upon them, if not at the present moment, at any rate, in the immediate future. I , as a Labour man, am indeed anxious to see the population of Australia increased by men of our own colourour own kith and kin, I say emphatically, in preference, but men of our own colour, certainly. I believe-indeed , I knowthere is room for them in Australia, and that there are opportunities, if our .various legislatures but recognise the difficulty and apply the surgeon's knife.. I know that immigrants could .be suitably settled on lands to their own benefit, and to the benefit of the Commonwealth, particularly for defensive purposes. And so I say again that the three subjects, while they may come for the moment under different headings, are inseparably bound up with each other, and that immigration is, I shall not say a practical impossibility, but is approaching a crime until .we are prepared with lands on which to settle the immigrants-until we have brought about the opening up of those lands, I hope by means of a progressive land tax. Following on that will come the establishment of a defence force of a character likely to meet any .attacks that may be made on the Commonwealth. When I look around for anything of a tangible character from the gentlemen who are almost violent in their opposition to a progressive land tax-, I find that for a number of years they have been crying out for immigrants-that this has been one of their leading subjects. The honourable member for Ballarat quite recently deplored what he thought was the absence of prominence given to this subject in the speech of the Prime Minister. On looking back over the records I find that for some seven years the honourable member for Ballarat has held office as a Minister, of the Crown in the Common-, wealth; and the only practical outcome in this direction is a submission of a proposal to' the States Premiers or the States Parliaments that they shall provide the lands while the Commonwealth provides the men.",18
17,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,And the bulk of the States never replied.,19
18,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I do not know whether that be so or not, but they should have had the courtesy to reply, if only in a letter of acknowledgment.",19
19,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I am not talking of mere acknowledgments.,19
20,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Wit h the States Parliaments constituted as they are-eac h subject to. and practically in the grip of, a Legislative Council composed of land monopolists-ther e is no more probability of that proposal being accepted or bearing practical fruit than there is of a man flying from here to England. I venture to suggest that after a trial of some years, and, with a knowledge of how the Legislative Councils are composed-wit h a knowledge of the bitter and strenuous opposition every Legislative Council has shown to the opening up of the lands on a reasonable basis-it is not merely 'futile, but it is knowingly playing with the subject of immigration, and with that of the acquisition of land, to put forth such a proposal. It seems to me that the honourable member for Ballarat has frankly acknowledged that the subject of immigration and the land policy are inseparably bound up together; and that, therefore, it would be neither fair nor honourable to introduce immigrants unless land is available for them. Notwithstanding this, the ears of the public are continually tickled with the same old proposal, which is the only one that those in opposition to the policy of the Labour Party have seen fit to submit; and I repeat that thisis not merely futile, but knowingly playing with the subject. I venture to remind the honourable member for Ballarat that, while there is an admission- a frank admission, shall I call it?-that immigrants should not be brought here unless land is available, and that, while there is an amusing proposal submitted to the States Premiers, nevertheless efforts are being made to attract immigrants. It necessarily follows that the persons responsible for this, while they admit that land is not available, are acting neither creditably to themselves nor justly to the immigrants. We have had some very sad illustrations of persons coming to Australia, and finding that the rosy pictures painted by paid advocates in England and elsewhere are not quite ""up to sample."" They have found that the stories told, and that the advertisements, as is not uncommon with advertisements, are scarcely borne out in realization. Sad to say, some of those immigrants have returned to the old world; and I venture to think that the manner in which they will speak will be an advertisement of a character that this country can ill-afford, and will counteract to a verylarge extent the pictures painted by those who are attracting people here, without considering as to what is likely to be their fate on arrival. The recent agitation in a certain direction for immigrants seems to have started some twelve or eighteen months ago. If I remember correctly, a gentleman of the name of Morgan came here from some, part of England, as representing the Chamber or Association of Manufacturers; and he distinctly stated in his public utterances that for the employing section-wit h whom he was apparently more intimately associated-to be successful, they must have, not merely a sufficiency, but a surplus of labour. Though honourable members may be indifferent to what that means, we ought not to be indifferent to the sufferings of the surplus. If manufactures cannot be carried on unless there be a surplus of labour-whic h means that a section of human beings shall starve continually, knocking at the door, and asking for employment at whatever wages the owner chooses to give-w e are neglecting our duty, and showing an. indifference to suffering which ought not to be countenanced by public men in Australia, at any rate. Only a few days ago I noticed that Dr Arthur was proceeding to England for the purpose of advocating immigration. That gentleman, with his painting of all manner of patriotic pictures, and urging the need for immigrants, failed to rouse any enthusiasm in the minds of his listeners, who were the members of the South Australian Chamber of Commerce, until in his last few words he put the matter to them as a business proposition. Almost immediately his auditors seized on the "" business proposition,"" because it meant that they would have a surplus of labour; and some commercial knowledge seems to start and end with the - consideration of how little can be paid in .wages, and how many hours men can be - employed for the small pay. I repeat that the subject of immigration is inseparably bound up with that of a land - tax. We require such legislation as - will open up millions of acres now monopolized by a few persons, to the - detriment of the many, and to the injury of the country. It is only by that means that we can populate Australia, and it is only with population that we can properly defend our land. I am not yet acquainted with the details of the Ministerial proposals relating to defence; but, in my opinion, every male in Australia should have a knowledge of drill and the use of the a-ifle, and should be disciplined, so that, should the occasion arise, he may be a potential force for the defence of his country. When there is need for defence, a - disciplined army is in every way preferable to a patriotic raSble, which is what our people must be if they remain undisciplined, and without skill in the use of firearms and weapons of warfare. But I am not piepared to compel men to leave their avocations to acquire the rudiments of drill, nor do I know to what extent the leader of the Opposition has modified his views in that direction, though probably we shall soon be enlightened on the subject. I am prepared to commence by drilling our boys. When Australia instituted compulsory education, the Parliaments did not drag men' of twenty-five or thirty from their work to the schools. We regretted that part of the population did not enjoy the advantages of early education, but we thought it sufficient to confine our schooling .to the boys and girls. I suggest a similar commencement in regard to defence. Putting my views into concrete form, I would say that we might start with boys at the age of ten years, and subject them to drill compul-sorilv until they reach the age of nineteen years. This nine-year period I would break up into three equal portions of three years each, devoting the first to preliminary drill, the second to advanced work, with - the use of small or dummy rifles, and the third to training in the handling of real guns, the acquiring of field experience, skill in scouting, and general knowledge of military work, to enable the lads to assist in the defence of the country should any attack be made upon it. There might also be a militia force 'which men over the age of nineteen - could join. Had I the power, I would abolish the present volunteer force; and I know of no man in military service,, with the exception, perhaps, of some of the volunteer officers, with whom I am not in agreement on the subject. A volunteer force and a militia have never worked together satisfactorily. I would suggest the establishment of a militia,, in which men could serve for five years after finishing their period of compulsory training. It would be similar to that in which we now have three years' service. For men who had gone through the militia, there might be a semi-reserve force, which they would join for a period of six years, by which time they would have reached the age of thirty years. Then, while every male in the community might not have gone through the militia and reserve forces, there would be none who had not received compulsory training of a character enabling him to assist in the defence of his country. Though I do not commit myself to agreement with these proposals in detail, I am glad that the Ministry has put forward defence proposals. The cost will be a little more than the estimate of the cost of the proposals put forward by the last Administration. While the Deakin Government found itself unable to finance a militia of 23,000 or 24,000, or, if we include the volunteers, a force of 30,000, on an annual expenditure of ^SoOjOoo, it proposed to create a defence force half-a-million strong on an expenditure of jQx, 100,000. ' But we remember with deep regret that, having expended a few pounds in New South Wales in welcoming the American Fleet, it could not find funds to provide the ordinary Easter Encampment for the forces of the State. Therefore, we may reasonably conclude that its estimate was ill-considered, and put forward merely for the purposes of the moment. Some of us were prevented from speaking on the Defence Bill last year, and I therefore take this opportunity to express my deep regret that the late Minister of Defence, when introducing his Bill, used words insulting to the officers under his control. His remarks were of a character to reflect upon him discreditably, for they applied to officers who could not reply to him, and who were wearing a dress for whose details he was at the moment solely responsible, since matters of dress are controlled by regulations, which a Minister can at all times alter, if he desires. I intended at the time to reply to the remarks which I considered insultthe ing, and I now express my regret that were uttered, suggesting that in future the honourable member should not make such life. references towards men prevented from plying by the rules which govern their sernext vice. I understaad that during the last few days the subject of New Protection has proved a stumbling block to certain persons, and I may presently ask the leader of the Opposition how he has been able to leap the abyss between the position which he at one time adopte'd and the acknowledgment of these principles, even though in his innermost heart he may as think them capable of little or no I practical effect. It is regrettable that when the Tariff was being passed, certain manufacturers puiblicly promised that they would support the benefits of protection to those who working for them, and that, having tained high protective duties, by which they are daily and hourly gainers, they have.turned about, and not merely repupresent diate their promises, but, with a venom which beggars description, seek by divers means to use their influence to strangle party which desires that the bargain to which they were parties shall be carried out in its entirety. It is a matter for deepest regret that these persons hold their honour so lightly that they regard their promises as not binding, and that the commercial men of Australia should repolicy. main under the stigma of the charge that, noted in other directions. having by their promises gained from Legislature protection which is increasing their wealth, they scornfully repudiate part of the agreement, and shamelessly tempt to do everything that would prevent its having effect. Despite the opposition them, I believe that the principles emistry. bodied in the New Protection are acceptthe able to the people of Australia. I note that there is no possibilityof fusion amongst parties opposite without the nition of these principles; that the called great Liberal Party makes them permanent plank. According to a speech given at Hobart, the honourable member Ballarat claims sole, credit for the promulBallarat gation Qf the idea of New Protection; any rate, if we are to believe the statethe ments in the public press, almost every they deserve commendation. honourable member has now acknowledged that its principles are good and just. .

I have doubts as to the obefficacy of the proposals which we are told are to be put forward by others. But whether they succeed or fail at the moment, I have no doubt that as the result of an appeal to the country we shall succeed in placing upon the statutethe book, to the enjoyment and pleasure of scores of thousands of our fellow-citizens, the policv that we know as the New Prothe tection. We have submitted to us in clear, unmistakable terms a definite policy, and during the whole of the recess I have failed to discover any opposition to that I wonder if that fact has been Has it been the noted that while there has been plotting and' counter-plotting, marching and countertheir marching, fusion and confusion, there has atnot appeared in print-so far as I am aware-an y definite and clear objection to to the policy ""put forward by the Fisher MinWhatever may be the outcome of conferences that are taking place, even now, in the dusk of evening, I have not yet seen a definite objection to the leading recogfeatures of the Ministerial programme. soWas there objection to compulsory defence? a If we look at the papers today we find that that objection has been swept away. for The party led by the honourable member for acknowledges through its leader at that the policy of defence put forward by Ministry is a practical one for which It has been accepted, too, I am informed, by other honourable members.

24,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"As a ""madcap scheme ""-is now accepted. Speaking at Bendigo on 31st March last-no t very long ago-the leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Parramatta, is reported to have made a proposal-and as the report appears in a Conservative newspaper I take it that the honourable member will approve of it-as against "" the madcap scheme of the Labour Socialists'' in respect to the New Protection. honourable member now accepted it?",22
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thei r Certainly not.,22
26,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Has the honourable member accepted the principle of the New tion Protection ?,22
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable mem-, ber has never heard me denounce the principle of the New Protection.",22
28,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Then we may take it that the honourable member has accepted the principle. If we all approve of and agree with the principle of New Protection, why slay the Ministry that proposes to introduce that policy ? What a curious situation confronts us. There has been no spoken opposition-o r if there was any opposition it has been swept away-to the Ministerial programme. The leader of the Opposition now admits that he has accepted the principle of New Protection, although less than two months ago it was to him a madcap Socialist scheme. The Ministerial defence policy has also been accepted. What is meant in the compact by the words' "" Federal finance "" I do not know. That statement of principle is charmingly vague, but it has also been accepted. I presume that every honourable member irrespective of party believes in "" Federal finance.'' If that is so, we are again unanimous', and there is no opposition to the Ministerial programme. Then may I ask once more, why all this fusion and confusion? Why all this marching and counter-marching? Why all the plotting that has been going on recently in the dusky twilight? grossed were those at the 'Conference with their proposals that not even the sparks of the process of fusion could give them sufficient light, and they had to adjourn. Returning to the fact that there has been no objection to the Ministerial programme, I should like to point out that the honourable member for Parramatta is reported to have saidHe objected to the Labour Party beine in office at all. He did not know why he did so, but he objected. It was another case of "" I do not love the, Dr Fell."" Despite his many years of Ministerial experience in New South Wales, and his official position in this House as leader of the Opposition, or what was known as the Opposition, the honourable member objects to the Labour Party being in office, but is unable Has the to say why he does so.",22
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I did say sot as scheme? a matter of fact, and very plainly,, too.",22
30,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member is reported to have saidThe very fact of it being in office was a negaof the representative principleWhy ?,22
31,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Because the party numbers only 27 qut of 75 members.,22
32,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The'honorabl e member's party numbers only 20. Shall 27 give place to 20 ? For some years there sat on the Treasury^benches a party numbering 15. Was that a negation of the representative principle?,22
33,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It was.,22
34,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Then I ask the honourable member which section of this House is going to sit on the Treasury benches unless there be a throwing overboard of all principle, unless there be an utter disregard of the pledges _and promises given to constituents, unless there be an exhibition of political spinelessness from which this country ought to be free? Shall it be the party to which the honourable member belongs - a party of 20? Shall it' be a party that sometimes sits in the Op; position corner, but is not at this moment there? Shall it be the party that now sparsely occupies the Ministerial corner? Shall it be the party, numbering at the outside some fourteen or fifteen members,, who have been weighed in the balance and found wanting? Or shall it be the party, numbering 27, now in office? That is a proposition with which the honourable member for Parkes may deal when next he So en- favours us with one of those masterly addresses for which he is famous. To say that it is a negation of the representative principle that the' largest party in the House should hold office, is, to put it mildly, a regrettable juggling with words. One honourable member is, I take it, as representative of the people as is any other. Each has to submit ""himself to a denned teous. constituency, and has to abide by the sult of the voting. To the extent to which the people vote, so he represents them. occasion ? To the extent of the numbers who vote for him, so he is a representative here. vious occasions. Since there happens to be a party numbering 27-the strongest in the House the time being--it seems to me that we proach the truly representative principle as closely as possible in the circumstances by that party holding office. Unless, have said, there is a throwing overboard of principle, no other party in this House is eligible, even on the showing pf my orable friend, to occupy the Treasury bench. He went on to say, speaking of the Labour Party, that "" it did not present the people."" May I ask the honormatta able member how he represents the people any more than does any one man elected as a member of our party? These statecause ments by the honourable member are mere terms that may tickle the ears of an aveof rage audience. They may go down at packed meetings, and may be approved for by the ticket-holders; but I venture to say say as that when dragged into the light of and held uo for debate or refutation, orable members will signally fail to nold them or any similar remarks made at such meetings. I venture to mind the honourable member that each and every member of the House is equally restating presentative with any other. elected by a similar_ method; and if have the largest numbers for the time it is our due that we should hold the tion now occupied by us. In explanation of the statement that Labourmembers do not represent the people, we have the lowing statement by the leader of the OppositionThis had been illustrated twice recently. The first occasion had been at the Premiers' ence when, for the first time in the history Commonwealth, the Prime Minister of Australia declined to discuss matters of finance as himself and the State Premiers. I beg to ask the honourable member again when the Federal electors gave us. a charter to discuss Federal finance with State Premiers. The Prime Minister would have been lacking in dignity had the deplorable example set by his predecessors, who repeatedly at those confermember ences gave expression to opinions, and were as repeatedly turned out on thedoorable mat, sitting there while the States Presimilar Mr Roberts. miers replied in language not too courre Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is there an allegation as to their .discourtesy on the last",22

36,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am referring to for the predecessors of the Prime Minister, apwho went to the various conferences, expressed their opinions, and were, as repeatedly laughed at by the State Preas I miers. It would have shown a lack of dignity for the Prime Minister to follow that example, and the fact that he did honnot so act scarcely constitutes an excuse for the inaccurate statement that the Labour Party do not represent the people. reThen the honourable member for Parrasays that the second reason relates to the attitude of the Prime Minister upon the proposed gift of a Dreadnought. Bethe Prime Minister did not accede to the suddenly raised cry for the giving, a battleship of the latest""type to England, we are told that we do not represent the people. Is the honourable member Parramatta still prepared-shal l I a potential Minister-to make the day, gift of a Dreadnougltt to the United honKingdom out of Federal finance? That upis a reasonable question. The honourable member stood on platform after platform reand flagellated the Labour Party for their refusal, smiting them. hip and thigh, and practically that because of their All are refusal to accede to the cry of the moment we they did not represent the people. I ask being the honourable member now, not in a posipacked meeting, among ticket holders, or in a little corner where he is amongst his friends, but here on the floor of the folHouse, in open debate, and ih the proper place, "" Is he now prepared to give a Dreadnought to England in existing circumstances?"" Failing a reply from the Conferhonorable member, I wish to tell him that of the as a politician he scarcely knows his own mind two weeks on end, for while he then between prominently supported .the proposal, today there is an ominous silence.",23
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not at all ominous.,23
38,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Then the honourable member should do me the honour of replyhe followed ing to my question. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - The honourable will get his reply in good time.,23
39,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Perhaps the honormember is in a position somewhat to that of the right honourable member for Swan. He was another who was prepared to give a Dreadnought, and I think submitted the proposal in his customary flowery language, with several quotations about Nelson, and the Union Jack, .and the dear Old Flag. Yet somehow, when he was hurrying over to the fusion (negotiations a couple of weeks ago, and was interviewed in Adelaide by one of the .gentlemen of the press, his reply was'"" Yes, I was in favour of it a few weeks .ago, but at the present I cannot say what I am prepared to do until I see my ffriends."" Similarly, the honourable memrner for Parramatta is not prepared to say what he can do until he sees his new 'leader. Singularly enough a portion of the interview granted by the right honourable member for Swan in Adelaide took - the form of denouncing the members of - the Labour Party because of their lack of independence, their inability to do anything without consulting each other, and - their working in unison to an extent that he said was inimical to the interests of - the State. Yet in the same interview he had so far left his independent mind 'behind, or perhaps got it so mixed up in the folds of the flag that he was waving, that he was unable to say then what he was prepared to do about giving a Dreadnought. Coming back to the point, on the 31st day of March, according to the 'honourable member for Parramatta, this Ministry did not represent the people be-cause they would not give away a Dreadnought. To-day the honourable memberto use his own language-does not represent the people because he is not prepared to give away a Dreadnought.",23

The real reason was, as a matter of fact, put very plainly in the Age, which today is master of the situation. I offer my sincere con* gratulatiorts to that powerful paper. It has not merely brought the Opposition down to the ring-bolt, but it stands today on top of its local contemporary, and on top, also, of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily Telegraph, the Courier, and the lot of them. The whole of them have been brought down to the ring-bolt, and the Age stands today absolutely master of the situation, dictating terms as never previously David Syme dictated them. I do most sincerely and without adulation or flattery offer my congratulations to that newspaper for the masterly manner in which it has succeeded. A leader in the Age of yesterday or today shows clearly that the Opposition is prepared for anything if only it can put the Labour Party out. I would like to submit the question to the people of Australia on that basis. If the Opposition can find no reasonable objection to the various planks of the Labour Party's platform, if it cannot give publicity to its reasons for seeking to out the present Ministry out other than the fact that it merely wishes to turn them out, that is an attitude which will .scarcely appeal to the people of Australia.",24
42,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Did the Labour Party give any reasons for turning the Deakin Government out ?,24
43,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"We were not asked to give reasons. I am now respectfully asking the honourable member for Parramatta for some explanation of his intentions. We merely said to the Deakin Government, in language that could not be cavilled at, that so far as we were concerned support was withdrawn. The Ministry, with the assistance of the Opposition, seemed to collapse, but I wish to say on their behalf that they t sought an opportunity for discussion by submitting a motion that would have permitted it, but that the Opposition to a man prevented discussion, and so prevented the I am Labour Party from giving expression to the reasons for their action. Probably the Opposition did not desire it. It was not in their tactics at that particular moment. There has been some talk of fusion. If I mav bring "" alliteration's artful aid "" to my as-sistance, I would say that in the preliminary efforts the usually diplomatic Deakin dived desperately down into the dark depths of coalition decline, and came back with despair writ large upon his face. Then the usually cautious Cook .came ""cheerfully across the 500 miles of intervening space to find coalition consolation, and went back with consternation on his face, for he had failed, whereupon the fretful Forrest forced his way into the proposals, and returned foiled. It is a comical position. I scarcely remember, in my political career, extending as it has over a number of years, anything more comical than the desperate desire of the three honourable members not to put a policy before the country, not to find fault with the Labour policy, not to explain in any way how it was inimical to the interests of our country, not to submit anything definite in its place, and not to give a reason for their action, but simply to come together in this particular manner to put the Ministry out. The honourable member can talk round the subject from week end to week end, but there exists no other reason than that. All this business of plot and counterplot is merely to put another Ministry out of office.",24
44,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"Was . there no plotting when the Labour Party, put the Deakin Government out?",25
45,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,No .,25
46,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Were any reasons given?,25
47,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"No . Presumably the reasons were so palpable that even the men then in office did not require them to be uttered. Certainly the Opposition declined by, specific motion to allow us to give our .reasons, in that they-^I will not say , gagged us-bu t prevented a motion Being submitted that would have permitted discussion. Now we have the curious feature of the defeat of Deakin, the consternation of Cook, and the., failure of Forrest - Apparently those honourable members had some qualms of conscience, and were considering their constituents, and had some thought for the principles they had previously professed, for with all their practical knowledge and political experience they were unable to come to a satisfactory understanding. Apparently the whole thing was at an end until other gentlemen came on the scene. Their constituents were not consulted, but one or two manufacturers were brought ---in .to assist the process of fusion. It might almost be said that they were called together over a little Joshua 'spirit, and as they appear to have been under its controlling influence at the particular - moment, I hope that in their interests it will not have the ""Boomerang"" effect'--it is very likely - to have. But not even the spirit was sufficient to do the dark, deed, - and so a little music was brought in. To »*the sweet strains of Beale's music, and under the mellowing influence of Joshua's spirit, this process of fusion was taking place. I can understand very well how the politicians would be listening acutely for fear that any one should be objecting to what they were doing; and that, on hearing a voice through the keyhole saying, perhaps, ""What about our country?"" the right honourable member for Swan, with that customary indifference - of his, would pass it away,' with "" T u t ! tut! let's have another Joshua."" If the mellowing influence of the Joshua was not sufficient, I can understand the leader, who had protected the musical instrument, saying, "" Strike up another tune, Octavius""; and I can imagine what the tune would be- a favourite old tune, and the use of it on such an occasion an insult to it-in the interests primarily of the honourable member for Parramatta, namely, "" Crush them, crush them, one and all . "" That is evidently what was played; and for what purpose? For the purpose of strangling in its infancy the Labour Ministry, which they dare not attack in any other form. It seems to me somewhat discreditable that politicians of their experience, not having succeeded, should allow themselves to be persuaded from the path of rectitude and duty, and from the promises that they gave to their constituents, by the interested statements of two or three citizens.

It seems to me that the tide may turn as honourable members opposite do not expect. I may remind them, without egotism, that, while eighteen years ago there was not a Labour member in any Parliament in Australia, there are now in the various Parliaments 183 or 184 Labour members. During the life of the Labour Party its representation in Parliament has increased, on the average, by about ten members each year, and a similar increase in the representation in this Parliament next year will bring about the result for which J hope-the establishment in power of a Ministry supported by a strong majority, pledged to give effect to national legislation. I wish how to refer to some words spoken last night by the honourable member for Ballarat. in putting forward the Liberal policy which is about to be accepted by the Conservatives. spoke clearly and calmly, but with his customary indefiniteness, so that even the Age says this morning that he might easily have been more explicit. Perhaps these glorious generalities will be more easily disposed of in the future than precise statements. A l - , though a few weeks ago the honourable gentleman soundly rated the Labour Ministry in regard to its programme saying that it was all very well to dress the shop window, but goods must be marked in plain figures, when, in his turn, he makes a statement of policy to the public, he is told by the newspaper which has always been most kind to him that he might have been more explicit, that he should mark his goods in plain figures, proving him to be guilty of that for which he blames us. The statement with which I wish to deal is the denunciation of the Labour Party as governed by a dominating caucus. He said that we in this Parliament do not represent the people, or used similar words calculated to injure our organization. I remember that after he had spoken in like strain on another occasion, he came here and partly apologized for the words he had used.",27
69,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,He made a full apology.,28

He has stated that his party requires not merely organization, but some firm, strong control, so that if candidates are not to be selected according to the critical methods of the Labour Party, at any rate, confusion at elections, by the nomination of two candidates for the one constituency, will be prevented. He desires an organization to control the members of the party, and to dictate to them in a manner in which the Labour organization does not dictate to its members. Every man in the Labour Party is free to, do what he believes to be best in fhte interests of the country. Although I am a Labour member no other member of this Chamber is more independent. The only thing that binds me or any other Labour member-and the honourable member for Ballarat, notwithstanding that he continues to repeat his misrepresentations, is aware of the fact-is the pledge honourably given to the electors.

71,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No . The statement is a w i l f u l and malicious lie, which has been put forward by liars from one end of the country to the other.",28
72,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It is a lie.,28
73,The SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the Minister to withdraw that expression.,28
74,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I withdraw it .,28
75,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I have given a pledge to my electors, just as I would ask the honourable member to sign a promise if I were intrusting him with any employment.",28
76,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"And the honourable member would require a witness to his signature, too.",28
77,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I should have the signature duly witnessed before allowing him to undertake the work which he had engaged to perform. While I regard it as the duty of every man to give full effect to his promises in business and social life, so it is the duty of every man to give full and honourable effect to his political pledges. But neither I nor any otbsr Labour representative is bound to do more. Each and every party has its caucus, and meets secretly and in precisely the same manner as does the Labour Part}'. I presume, too, that each pa#ty abides by the decision of the majority. The caucus of the Labour Party has absolutely no power over any one member, and this is so well known to the honourable member for Ballarat as to justify, not a raking, but a scathing reply, if one felt disposed to give it. When he speaks to the contrary he knows that each and every member of our party is free to do as he thinks fit. If he thinks it is best to abide by the resolution of the majority he does so, and if he does not he suffers no penalty.  ber tell us what the pledge really is?",28
78,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is in print.,29
79,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Her e it is; the honable member may read it for himself. I am afraid that by merely listening to its being read he will scarcely comprehend it. I wish to repeat that the methods of the Labour Party are open to the world, and that if-jus t as was the case when the honourable member for Ballarat, a few days ago, declined to give information for tactical purposes to the press-everythin g that is done is not published at that moment, the party is but acting in conformity with the method of every other section of the Parliament. The caucus has absolutely no power. We simply unite in the interests of our country, and do our best according to our lights to give practical effect to our views.",29
80,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"That will not do. What about the statement that the caucus ""plays the tune"" and Mr Fisher has to dance to it? - Mr FISHER - If such a statement was made it was not true.",29
81,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"There are some 2,000,000 males in Australia, and we are told by the honourable member that one of them has said that the caucus "" plays the tune "" and we have to dance to it.",29
82,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The Age ""plays the tune"" in the case of the honourable memhas ber for Fawkner, and he has to dance it.",29
83,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable >ber for Fawkner will take my assurance that the person to whom he refers has made an incorrect statement. May I restory mind the honourable member that Mr Beale apparently is now "" playing the tune,"" and that the whole of the Opposition, the ner Opposition Party, and the Liberals are dancing to it *",29
84,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"The public know that tune, and they approve of it.",29
85,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That remains to be seen. I do not wish to detain honourable members any longer. Replying to statements respecting the independence of Labour members and their attempts to do their duty, may I say briefly that we have had submitted to us a defined, clear, and definite policy, unmistakable in its national character; and that throughout the last five months-despit e the ability and eloquence of honourable members of the Opposition-ther e has not yet been published a definite objection to any one line of that policy. We have now proposals for bringing together various parties for the one and only purpose of putting out the Ministry. We shall have the knowledge that, if it goes out, it will go out on principle. We shall have the knowledge that if it is made to leave the Treasury bench for the time being it will leave it with the flag flying, and that on the first occasion that there-is an appeal to the country we shall be able tp put to the test which tune is more acceptable to the people-the tune of a clear and a national policy, or the tune of fusion, merely for the sake of - grasping the Ministerial benches. The process, evidently, is not quite over; the leaders are at work and the music is still tingling in their ears. In the circumstances I may - perhaps with greater confidence submit for the consideration of honourable members, in the hope that it will meet with acceptance, the motion that the Address-in-Reply to the opening speech of the Governor General be approved by the House.",29
86,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.52] - It is with pleasure that I rise to second the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to a Speech which I think has in it proposals more calculated to truly affect, the peonle of Australia than has any that has yet been submitted to this Parliament by a representative of His Majesty. It is with pleasure that I note the progress that the Ministry made regarding the Federal Capital, to and in this I thought I should be joined by honourable members opposite. The situamemtion today, however, reminds me of that described in a novel that I read some years ago. Honourable members may recollect the told in Zangwill's great novel, ""The Premier and the Painter,"" of a very simple individual who, becoming Premier, set to. Corwork to carry out the promises that had been given on the. hustings. As soon as he undertook to fulfil those promises the agitators who had been asking for their fulfilment tried to - bring about his death. That seems to be the position in regard to the Federal Capital. number of honourable members who usually sit in Opposition, but who, I am informed, at the present time are engaged in their caucus deliberations, have been agitating for some time, and have lived largely upon the* alleged wrongs that have been done to the Mother State. They have complained continuously, and, I think, with good cause, that year after year the settlement of the Federal Capital question has been deferred, and that New South Wales, instead of having the Capital, as promised, has been steadily cheated out of it. To-day we have in office a Prime Minister who has set himself to the task of giving what they say should have been given years ago, and, like the agitators in the novel, these honourable members are afraid that their stockin-trade will disappear if the promise is fulfilled. That being so, they are seeking as quickly as possible to despatch the Prime Minister who promised, and has so far fulfilled the promise, to give New South Wales the Capital.",29
87,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Does not the Speech set forth that negotiations regarding the Federal Capital are coming to a successful issue ? If that be so, why should we complain ? It is the honourable member who appears to be annoyed.",30
88,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I am not. On the contrary, I am glad that the position has been changed, and that the Capital Site question will soon be settled. On the other hand, the honourable member and his party are dissatisfied. They are anxious to destroy the Prime Minister who has done something to settle it, and to substitute for him one who has done so much to put off its determination.",30
89,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is not the honourable member aware that the honorary Minister-the honourable member for Hindmarsh-sai d that the Government was in no way responsible for the choice of Canberra?,30
90,Mr HALL,Unknown,"That statement does not in the least affect the position. The honourable member and his fellow representatives of New South Wales on the opposite side of the House know that once the Federal Capital question is; settled five-sixths of their stock-inhtra.de will go. It is for that reason that they do not wish it to be settled. They are anxious that the honourable member for Ballarat should once more be installed as Prime Minister, and that there should-be further delay. We have heard a good deal regarding responsible government in this country, and have been told how necessary A it is that it should be re-established. I ven ture to say that we have witnessed during the last three months an exhibition of responsible government the like of which has not occurred in Australia before, and would not have been seen if the present Prime Minister had not been in office. We have heard also a great deal regarding the presentation of a Dreadnought to Great Britain.",30
91,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Opposition are silent about that matter now.,30
92,Mr HALL,Unknown,"They are, indeed; but when the proposal was hot-whe n the hysteria was at its height-ever y member of other parties was demanding that the Prime Minister should at once cable to the British Government the offer of a Dreadnought. For the first time to' my knowledge in the history of Australia a press-organized proposal of this kind has been defeated. In the past, if the Age, the Argus, the Daily Telegraph, and the Sydney Morning Herald decided that something should be done it was straight way done - Fortunately we have now in office an honourable member who has at least allowed Parliament an opportunity to settle the .question. I trust that, whether the life of the Fisher Government be long or short, the precedent which it has established will be followed by those who succeed it-that others will follow the principle adopted by the present Ministry of allowing Parliament to do its own business, and refusing to permit that business to be done by a few newspaper editors. We cannot say now whether or not there is to be submitted to the House a motion regarding the presentation of a Dreadnought to the British. Government. The one question concerning which honourable members who were negotiating for fusion are apparently unable to agree, now that they have had a conference, is whether they will do that which they all said ought to be done. They are prepared to do many things which they all declared ought not to be done, but, although they agreed that a Dreadnought should be presented to the British Government, they are now singularly silent on the subject. The ex-Prime Minister, in the great oration that he delivered last night, was strangely silent in regard to it. Representatives of other States have not the experience that we have had in New So.uth Wales. There we have had in existence a Dreadnought Fupd.",30
93,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,In Queensland £ 1 6 8 has been subscribed by twenty persons.,31
94,Mr HALL,Unknown,"In New South Wales we have had a unique experience. There we have had a fund created for this purpose, and a press agitation has been earnestly engaged in pumping life into it. Public servantsnot Federal but State}-hav e been shamefully dragooned into contributing, having been practically forced on pain, not exactly of dismissal, but of injuring their prospects with their superior officers, to give money to the fund. A number of meetings have been addressed by the right honourable member for East Sydney and by the leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for Wentworth has given £100, while the honourable member for Partes gave a lot of good advice, which I understand was absolutely gratuitous-in fact, it was without money and without price. The movement started off with a number of gentlemen saying that they would give ,£10,000 and .£20,000 each, but not one £10,000 has turned upapparently there is a difference between promises and gifts.",31
95,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,The member is not justified in saying that.,31
96,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I am absolutely justified. Despite all this effort, they have not succeeded in getting sufficient to represent 3d. in the £1 on the cost of a Dreadnought.",31
97,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,I challenge honourable member to prove his statement.,31
98,Mr HALL,Unknown,It is not hard to prove. Let the honourable member - inquire at the bank how much there is in the Dreadnought fund and he will find that what I have stated is correct. The men who made promises apparently have no intention of giving the money.,31
99,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,In the small town of Scone they have a thousand pounds in the bank.,31
100,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I have no doubt that the men who promise these small amounts get into the habit of giving them. I bring the matter up now in order to say that those who have charge of the fund ought to be honest enough to announce that the thing has utterly failed, so as to prevent poor people, who believe that they are serving the Empire by giving, from throwing away their money on the fund. It is time that the promoters of the fund honestly admitted that it has been a failure. The shillings cannot be returned, an.d the £10,000 contributions will not be made.",31
101,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"It has been a great success, and I suppose the. honourable member dislikes it for that reason.",31
102,Mr HALL,Unknown,"If afjer all the eloquencethat has been expended on it the subscription of 3d. in the £ 1 towards the cost of a Dreadnought is a great success, I make the honourable member a present of it.",31
103,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I challenge the honourable member to provethat Mr Dangar has not put up his £10,000.",31
104,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I should like to have the promise that if that £10,000 is still at Mr. Dangar's credit it will be placed to mine.",31
105,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Mr Dangar is one of my constituents, and I know him to be an honourable man.",31
106,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I do not suggest that it is the honourable member's influence that is preventing him from giving the £10,000. But as he has had his photograph in the paper and has obtained the advertisement it is time that he gave the money or announced that he no longer intends to give it. But the movement has failed, and properly failed, and those who are responsible for it ought to have the decency to admit honourable it and close the business up.  speak disrespectfully of the dead?",31
107,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I come not to praise it but to bury it. If there is one thing I have rejoiced over during the life of this Parthe liament it is the refusal of the Fisher Ministry to be led into the gift of a Dreadnought. No more unnecessary proposal has yet been made. Had it come from responsible officers in Britain there mighthave been some necessity for it, but coming - as it did as the inspiration of a few irresponsible newspaper owners who desired to usurp the functions of Parliament and to drive the Ministry into the business, I am very pleased that it has failed.",31
108,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,It has not failed.,31
109,Mr HALL,Unknown,Then upon that the honourable member and I will differ.,31
110,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,The honourable member will have an opportunity of voting on the question.,31
111,Mr HALL,Unknown,Will the honourable member see that his new party gives us an opportunity of voting on it ?,31
112,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,I shall be very disappointed if the honourable member has not the opportunity.,31
113,Mr HALL,Unknown,"If the nonorable member remains with the party that he is now connected with, he will be very disappointed many times before he is much older. I ask honourable members to consider for a moopportunity ment the actual position. I confess that feel some difficulty in speaking of the ter, because, as the honourable member for Maranoa suggests, it isi like speaking - the dead. We were assured a little while ago that a new situation had arisen by .the supremacy of the Empire was threatthe ened. According to press representations - it was made to appear that there was possibility of an attack by Germany, that Germany had taken certain steps that made her growing fleet a menace to Britain's supremacy of the sea. The fact is that, so far from the building of Dreadnoughts taking place, practically nothing of the had occurred, and that there was no fleet in existence, nor even a proposal made by - which a fleet could be brought into existAustralia, ence, in Germany that was likely to .endanger the supremacy of that of Engor land. It is true that the Germans 'built more slips, and prepared more docks for the building of ships, but it is not true that they built more ships,' and because of that we are asked to come forward with, the gift of a Dreadnought. When I look at the position of Britain today, at her wealth, and what she has done in the last five or six years, I but be satisfied' that we are part of Empire possessed of vast resources, and able to take care of its"" heart without assistance from us. I would ask honourable members to note that since the close of the Boer war the British Government mot only reduced the income tax",31
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They have reduced an income tax which was put on specially for the war.,32
115,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I merely ask honourable members to remember that those are sources which are available if necessary. Since the close of that war, the Britishber Government, while building Dreadnoughts out of revenue, have also reduced the national debt by £60,000,000, while German Government in extending their naval policy have gone deeper into debt. In other words, if Britain had been content to allow her indebtedness to remain as it was at the close of the Boer war, she could in the last five years built over thirty Dreadnoughts, and paid spot cash for every one of them. We asked at this stage to borrow a couple millions from Great Britain, and then it back, in order to prop that great up. I need not detain honourable members further on this subject. We'may have of debating it again on some I definite proposal, and I only hope that we matdo. To turn from the hysteria connected with the Dreadnought proposal to the well of thought out policy of the Fisher Ministry on naval defence is like turning from chaos which to order. The proposals put forward by Ministry have not been thought out merely by one or two newspaper editors, but have been the subject of continuous disand cussion by the Ministry and the public. I venture to say that if there is one subject upon which the Ministry stand to be congratulated, one fact which will differentiate them from their predecessors, and probably kind from those who will come after them, it is that during their short term of office they have done something to establish a navy for and not merely talked about it. Whether they go out this week, next week, next year, it will stand to their credit that they did not merely talk, but put their beliefs into reality, and that their proposals are endorsed by the leading naval authorities of the world. I rejoice that the present Ministry have not only prepared to meet foes abroad, but are making ample preparation to meet the foes in our own country. I allude to the land monopolists. cannot The proposals of the Government may be an stolen by other parties. We have already seen labour propositions embodied in the any programmes of rival parties, but we shall not see the proposition for a graduated land tax embodied in the proposals of honhave orable members opposite. This fact, at least, will differentiate us from those who oppose us-that we will, if left in office, strike a blow at the land monopolists of this country. I need not weary the House with arguments to prove that land monopoly reis bad. Almost every man in the country admits it now. The right honourable memfor East Sydney in recent speeches has gone so far as to admit that land monopoly is very bad. A number of other honourable the members on the same side say the same thing; but the land monopolists may well smile when they only hear declarations that, land monopoly is a bad thing, and see no proposals brought forward to end it. The present Ministry stake their existence, I have understand, upon the carrying into effect of a graduated land tax, and surely it is are time that - something was done in this of direction. When one remembers that 729 give people in New South Wales own over 22 Empire million acres ' of land, and that of 23 million acres of wheat land in New an South Wales only 3,000,000 acres are under cultivation today, we realise that it is necessary to do something to throw open the land to landless people. 1 However much honourable members opposite may copy the Labour Party's methods and programme, I venture to say they will not copy us in this particular. I do not wish to detain the House, because I feel that already sufficient attention has been devoted to the moving and seconding of the Address-in-Reply. But I should like to refer briefly to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat last night. In that speech the honourable member is reported as saying :I say that when some of your representatives go into a room, and a division is taken, say, amongst ai members of Parliament, supposing n vote on one side and io on the other-al l voting according to their judgment and conscience - the io come out no longer as representatives of the people. They come out as delegates of delegates. They come out as the representatives of eleven other'representatives. (Cheers.) Where is your freedom ? Where is your independence ? Where is your liberty? I cannot believe that the honourable member for Ballarat did not deliberatelv statewell, I",32
116,Mr FISHER,Unknown,An inaccuracy.,33
117,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I think that "" inaccuracy"" is the right word. The rules of Parliament, I understand, forbid my suggesting a very much smaller word which much better describes what it was the honourable member told.",33
118,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that the statement is not accurate ?,33
119,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I say that "" inaccuracy "" is a very mild word to use.",33
120,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Does it express the meaning ? Let us know what the honourable member means,33
121,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I shall tell the honourable member outside what I mean, if he wishes me to repeat the statement. The ex-Prime Minister knows as well as any man in the country that Labour men are not pledged to sink their .individuality in any way whatever in caucus.",33
122,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,We have heard that before-prov e it,33
123,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I shall read the pledge of the Labour Party, which shows what we undertake to do when we sign it. The pledge is as follows :I hereby pledge myself not to'oppose the candidates selected by the recognised Political Labour organizations, and, if elected, to do my utmost to carry out the principles embodied in the Australian Labour Party's platform, and, on all questions a/Iecting the platform, to vote as a majority of the Parliamentary party may decide at a duly constituted caucus meeting.",33
124,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Do not almost all public questions affect the platform ?,33
125,Mr HALL,Unknown,No . I have the platform in my hand.,33
126,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What of the Dreadnought:?,33
127,Mr HALL,Unknown,The question of a Dreadnought does not affect the platform.,33
128,Mr KELLY,Unknown,But the Labour Party would vote solid on the Dreadnought question.,33
129,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I dare say we should.' The proposal is so obviously absurd that we should all vote against it, though it would be quite open to any of us to vote in its favour if we had the chance. Seeing that the honourable member has put £ 1 00 ""into the business,"" he o.ught to give us a chance to vote on the question. What we pledge ourselves to do is to vote solidly on those questions which we have put to the electors. For instance, we were elected to support a graduated land tax on unimproved values. We went to the country and advocated that tax, and are bound to support it ; and, therefore, we do not ask for liberty to vote against it. We say that to vote against what we were sent to advocate is not "" liberty,"" ""independence,"" or "" freedom,"" but dishonesty. We are not people who at one stage describe New Prolection as a bad thing, and then exercise ""liberty,"" ""freedom,"" and ""independence"" to support it. We do not come here saying that free-trade is good, and then sign a pledge to support high protection. - Mr KELLY - The honourable member is stating what he has himself described as an "" inaccuracy.""",33
130,Mr HALL,Unknown,"We do not know that it is an inaccuracy, because we find it so stated in the honourable member's own newspaper, the Melbourne Age.",33
131,Mr REID,Unknown,"Ough t the Labour Party to be judged by what the newspapers say of them? If so, the members of the Labour Party ought all to be hanged.",33
132,Mr HALL,Unknown,"It is easy for honourable members opposite now to laugh at the Age, but the honourable member for Wentworth will very soon learn that the creator can demand from the creature a good deal of respect.",33
133,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Labou r .members respect their Leagues.,34
134,Mr HALL,Unknown,Not as the honourable member respects the,34
135,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Are Labour members not the creatures of the Leagues?,34
136,Mr HALL,Unknown,"No ; the honourable member knows that we are returned by the votes of the people on a policy we put to the people-the Leagues have no control whatever over that. - Mr HENRY WILLIS - Labou r members told the people they had sunk the fiscal issue, and yet they placed heavy burdens on the working classes, and supported a Protectionist Government.",34
137,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I not only did that, but on a hundred platforms I told the people that if they returned me I should vote for protection; and when I came here I did so. On the pther hand, the honourable member for Robertson told the people be would stand for free-trade, and",34
138,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,And T did so.,34
139,Mr HALL,Unknown,"And now the honourable member is about to put the honourable member for Ballarat into office again. The honourable member for Ballarat, in his speech last night, also saidOnce you take away the individual right and responsibility of the citizen to use the judgment God has given him, and for which he alone is responsible, free from dictation from the outside, you take a step which means the destruction of political liberty and political liglteousnesa: For seven'or eight years the Labour Party supported the honourable member for Ballarat, and I suppose that all that time we were taking steps to do away with ""political liberty"" and righteousness."" It seems, on the honourable member's own showing, that so long as he is at the front we may drive the country to perdition; but if he ceases to be Prime Minister for a little while, the hunger for office returns, and those "" wrongs "" are to be permitted no 'longer.",34
140,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"He was willing to COOK), adjourned. coalesce with us.",34
141,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I believe it would be letting out no secret to say that the honor; able member was willing to coalesce with us a little while back. He went on to shall say last nightI t is not that that step alone will accomplish it ; but once you have taken that step and forfeited your judgment, anything else may f o l low. I confess that when I firstentered this House, while not feeling at all certain, I had hopes that there were principles which differentiated the ex-Prime Minister from honourable members who sit opposite; I thought I should find a sensible difference between the alleged Liberalism on this side on the part of the gentlemen who followedthe honourable member for Ballarat and the Conservatism opposite. But my eyes have been opened. So far as the fusion is concerned, I wish success to those who desire to bring it about.",34
142,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is an "" inaccuracy."" Does the honourable member really wish the fusion success, because, if so, he ought to join?",34
143,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I do wish the fusion success, because I like to see our enemies walking into a trap. When we have only one opponent left, it will be easy to seve'r the head.",34
144,Mr REID,Unknown,That is what the honourable member calls success.',34
145,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Yes . In the efforts at fusion I wish the right honourable member and his friends every success. I ask nothing better than that those who may be opposing me shall be supporting the right honourable member for East Sydney, the honourable member fbr Flinders, the right honourable member for Swan, and the honourable member for Parkes, to say nothing of the present leader of the Opposition. Let us separate the sheep from the goats.",34
146,Mr REID,Unknown,That is just what we are doing.,34
147,Mr HALL,Unknown,"We see to-night that the goats are on the left hand and the sheep ""political on the right. We shall at least have what gentlemen opposite desire, namely, the two-party system of government. Of that we on this - side do not complain, nor do I think we shall have any reason' to complain when the people have been appealed to as to the result of our action here.
