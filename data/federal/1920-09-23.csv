1,Mr SPBAKEB,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. NEW WHEAT CROP: WHEAT POOL.",19
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown," I desire to make a'statement to the House in reference to the new wheat crop, and the Wheat Pool. I 6hall endeavour to be as brief as possible. Honourable members will recollect the position taken up by the Govadnment during the last general - election. SEhe Government then said it would not place an embargo on the exportation of wheat, but would assist the farmers to obtain the world's parity. The subject has arisen tin this House, both as 'the TOsulfc of questions addressed to me, and by way of :stateinents made, and the policy of the Government has been made quite clear. At different Conferences held ;with the Premiers, the .wheat-growing .States approached the Commonwealth Government to ascertain what would be its attitude in regard to the Wheat Pool. - I replied on the lines 'I 'have just indicated, but said what I have repeated in this House-that if the wheat-producing States introduced legislation by which, in .effect, they would acquire the wheat, the Commonwealth would consider itself in a - different position, and would deal with ithe question on its merits. then further Conferences have taken place, and, as honourable members know, in the four wheat-producing legislation is proceeding, concurrently, on ^practically identical lines, whereby the. States prohibit .private trading in wheat, and also prohibit any wheat being carried on State railways except such .as receives a permit, and no permit .will be given save in respect of wheat proceeding to a.State Pool. About a month ago, as the result of inquiries-to which I have previously referred ha Ahis House->made to jne iby the representative of the Egyptian Government for a firm idffor for :a supply of Australian .wheat for the .purposes of the Egyptian Government, summoned a Conference of the four wheat producing States. At this Conference the Premiers of some States and the Ministers of Agriculture of other States were present. I - placed before them ithe position as it then existed. Shortly put, the position was 'that the representative of the Egyptian Government wanted a firm offer of .300,000 tons of wheat, of which 260,000 tons was to be ground into flour in Australia and shipped as such. wanted the option to take 70 or 80 per cent, flour. We ""were'to make a firm o'Her, on a c.i.f. basis, delivered at Egyptian ports. I emphasized the 'importance, and, as I saw it, the necessity, of taking advantage of .this opportunity - of - selling .a considerable portion of our mew wheat crop. .It .was then felt, however, :by .the representatives of the various - wheat-pr.oMr HvgheB. dncing .""States and the .representatives .of the old Board-ith e honourable member for Echuca (Mr .Hill) was ipresent-,that until 'the 'States had introduced and made progress with .legislation foy which they, should acquire the .wheat,.it was premature to 'enter into negotiations for 'the salle of the .new crop. $t was decided that (the Conference should adjourn for one'month, when the matter should again 'be .discussed. In the interval-that-elapsed, the States having introduced legislation - and made some progress with it , - the - representative of the - Egyptian Government intimated to me that he - was unable to prolong his stay in Australia, amd ""that unless we gave :-him an opportunity to notify his Government ithat we were .piepared to sell next season's wheat, .be would - have to leave .Australia, I , accordingly, got in .touch -.with '-the Since wheat-producing States - to consider <the position, aB it then stood'. I met - the ; .probably Victorian Minister of Agriculture, - and States the - representative of the Wheat Board  of that meeting a full - Conference was summoned on Tuesday last, at which the - representatives of three of the wheat producing States were present. The. representative of Western - Australia was unable to attend, but the New Soutth Wales, Victorian, and South Australian Ministers of Agriculture were present, while representatives of the farmers of three of the States and the experts-that is to say, the selling agents-as o attended. At - that Conference it was stated I that legislation bad been .introduced, and we were informed of the exact .position at - whioh it stood in the .various State Parliaments. The Commonwealth Government was formally in vited .by the .representatives of the various States present to enter the Pool, and take a-position on the .'Board. Without prejudice, and .subject to the approval of my colleagues.and of my party, Irstated that I was prepared, in those cirHe cumstances, 'to - favourably consider the invitation. I recognised that the position taken up rby the..Government-during ithe elections had been .fairly met by the Legislatures of 'the States --which had, - ior all - practical .purposes, - acquired the wheat in the four producing States, for although Ithe wheat has .not .been - de facto - acquired, yet as private grading has been prohibited, and traffic on the railways denied, lexcepting under permits to wlieat proceeding to the Pool, the question-of... prohibition of export did not, and could not, arise. The Conference unanimously supported the invitation^ issued by the wheat-producing States^ and I took 'the earliest opportunity of placing the matter before my colleagues, and have since had"" an opportunity of discussing it with my honourable friends on this side of the House. We are all agreed 'that it will in the best .interests of Australia for Commonwealth to participate in the Pool, and accept the invitation of . the wheatcame to the Commonwealth. producing States to become a member course, thereof. In regard to the negotiations with the representative of the Egyptian' Governhas ment; I invited Mr Sanders to come to Melbourne, and, as authorized by the Conference on Tuesday,- I laid the facts before him. I was authorized, with the other members of the Wheat Fool Execubeen tive and the selling agents, to negotiate with him. I discussed the .matter large with him yesterday, and made an appointment for 11 o'clock this morning for him to discuss the business side of transaction with the selling agents. That is now being done. I wish to refer now to the position of the Commonmealth in regard to certain other aspects of the position, and as I understand the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) proposes to move the adjournment of the House on this matter, I ' shall not detain honourable members at any length. But, as a result of the .5s. guarantee which the Government have made to the farmers, which applies, not only to the exportable surplun; but to all wheat, the Common-' wealth is under a liability which may be variously estimated at from £20,000,000 to £40,000,000. It is impossible to state the amount in exact figures, because we do .'not yet know, precisely 'how much wheat will ' be produced. ' I think, however, that we may fair l y , say that, in all human probability, a very large quantity will be produced. That being the case, the Government, realizing that if it were tailed upon to finance an obligation of £'4:0,000,000, it would be to the last degree important that sales should becommenced at the earliest possible, moment, entirely endorsed my action in ' regard to the Egyptian contract. They and the. Board entirely agreed with me that, subject to a fair, price being obtained, it was-important to make this and all sales as early as possible. I wish to emphasize two phases in regard to this, and I hope that the farmers and the citizens generally will take due notice of them. The first is that if we have, as is quite possible, a surplus of 2,500,000' tons of wheat, - it will be impossible to export that to the world's markets in which be we could realise under any shorter period the. than the whole twelve months of 1920-21. Last year, 3,500,000 tons of shipping That, of was the total tonnage available for all our products. Honourable members will , not forget that a very great deal of freight been diverted to this country by the British Government to lift its. own wool as well as - its own wheat and meat, to say nothing of our other products, which, happily, are very numerous, and which have disposed of in the ordinary way. This shows the probable amount of tonat nage 'that may be expected during the coming year. A farmer, therefore, who has wheat to sell in January, cannot hope to the realise the world's parity on that whea<for a very considerable time. The key to the situation now, as always, is freight. Honourable members will understand that all wheat has to be sold, not as it was during the war, on a f.o.b. basis-the money being available before the wheat, was shifted-bu t on bottoms, on freight that has been secured. Each cargo has to be sold on a ship, and the ship must first be secured. ' When I tell honourable members and the farmers of this country that no freight has yet been Becured, and that probably 2,500,000 tons of freight will be required to ship the wheat that will be produced, they will agree with me that the key to the situation is freight, and that it is in the last degree important that our energies should be concentrated on obtaining that freight. When I tell them, too, that the only freight now offering in anything like a large quantity is quoted ab £ 7 per ton, which means alittle less than 4s. a bushel, the farmers will see that, with wheat being sold on a c.i.f. basis, the situation is full of - difficulties. I do not pretend for a. moment that these are insurmountable; I merely catalogue them in order that the farmers may not underestimate the obstacles in . the way. It is for this, reason that the Commonwealth Government considered it to be their duty to <ooine into the Pool. With a liability-suc h as I have pointed outranging anywhere between £20,000,000 and £40,000,000, it is of the tance that sales should be made promptly and the wheat, shifted at the earliest sible moment. The farmers want somethis thing more than a 5sguarantee-al though that would be very useful, because they would get their advance a long before the world's parity was available for the whole of their product. The Comthink - monwealth Government, boing confronted with the position that they would be payment going to be?"" unable to finance a matter of £40,000,000 unless with the aid of sales to lighten which the burden, felt that they ought to come defi'iitethe into the Pool. They felt that do so, having been invited by the wheatwith which we can get going, producing States; and that they should would be clearly impossible for us do their boat to conduct this gigantic enter- £40,000,000 upon the market. The prise on a business-like footing. I ' speak - tion would be the same as in respect to now on behalf of the Board. We have secured the best expert advice and assistuity, tance at our disposal. I want to say again that freights form the key to the money situation. Despite what honourable memimportant bers may read in the press, there is no should get i tas ismuch prospect of freights falling very materiearliest ally during the next twelve months. The how much cost of running ships has enormously ingree, depend creased. The great shipping companies of I am hopeful that, the world cannot afford, therefore, even if tian sale, which will they desired to do so-and I do tend to say. that they do-to allow will materially help the that freights to fall'to pre-war rates. is, indued, no possibility of that. But I hope we shall get freights at a more reasonable rate than £7 per ton, which is the price al present quoted. I think I have covered nearly the whole of the ground which I had insury, tended totraverse. I wanted to tell the House exactly what the policy of. the Government waB, the - circumstances under which they entered the Pool, have and the position in which the new Pool finds itself. I wanted to emnot phasize to the farmers the fundamental like diffeiencc between the world's parity price and that of wheat in Australia which not be 'shifted unless we are two and a-half million tons of freightif that amount of tonnage should be actually representative of the harvest to be reaped this season. I desire specially to stress the point that, opinion, the key to the situation is Kr. Hughes. and that every effort must be made to obtain freight at the earliest moment,-, so. as to get nd of our wheat as quickly as first imporis humanly possible. Mr GnEeonY - In connection with the posCommonwealth Government coming iato Pool, has the arrangement been arrived at only for this season's crop ? 3-1?. HUGHES - That is all this parwhile ticular Pool was established for.",19

STABILIZATION OF EXCHANGE. ' Mr WEST - It is reported in this morning's press that Mr J. R. Collins, Secretary to the Commonwealth, Treaand Colonel Campbell, of New Zealand, are about to leave for Brussels to attend the Financial Conference, and that the principal work of the Conference will to do with the stabilizing of international exchange. Since Mr Collins.is a Minister of the Crown, I would to know whether he has received instructions from the Government to take part in the Conference deliberations upon canthis subject, or whether ho is acting on able to secure his own initiative.",22

OVERDUE VESSEL, AMJBL1A Mr MCWILLIAMS Has the M in i - morning, and discussed the ter for-the Navy any information in connection with the overdue ship Amelia J., bound from Newcastle to Hobart? can hfe say whether steps, have been taken in the matter of searching for that vessel 1",22
6,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I have some in formation to give .to the House. I may say that not only has the honourable member for Franklin (Mr.'MCWilliams) interested himself in the matter of the overdue Amelia / . , but that other members from Tasmania, as' well as the Tasmanian senators, have conferred with me, and kept constantly in touchwith my Department. I think it necessary, therefore, to make a rather long and complete answer to the honourable member's question.. I do not know of .any missing ship in respect to which more public attention hag been turned. For instance, on the 14th September a message from Captain Davis, Director, of Navigation, was received by the Navy Department to the effect that the Amelia J . was missing. Immediately instructions, wore sent to the wireless stations at Brisbane, Garden Island, Melbourne, Flinders Island, and Hobart, requiring those stations to send on messages to all ships, instructing them to keep a sharp look out for the mating that two aeroplanes left missing vessel. It is customary for ships at sea to take their timedaily from our tions to proceed via, Wilson's wireless stations. Therefore every vessel the Kent Group, Flinders Island, in the waters in which this ship is supother islands in that vicinity,-down posed to be lost would be in touch with our wireless stations, and naturally, receipt of our message, would maintain a strict look-out for her. On Friday I received a telegram from one of my constituents, asking me whether a destroyer oould not be sent out - I immediately got into communication with the Naval Board, and realized that, for the time being, it was necessary to send the following message:Referring your wire. re search Amelia J., regret no vessel available, imt have wirelessed ull ships and stations to keep look-out. On Tuesday last I received another message, very late at night, asking that a search should be made by aeroplane. was in the House at. the time, and immediately got into touch with the Acting Minister for Defence (Sir Granville R y r i e ). It was too late for him to. communicate with any of his J. officers that night, but we met next matter. W it h in an hour the Minister had an aeroplane off the coast. That machine - And can operate 100 miles off the coast, and, travelling at a height of up to 8,000 feet, can maintain a better look-out than could all the vessels of the Australian Fleet - if they had been sent out to look for this missing vessel. This morning I received a radio message from Flinders' Island, stating that unusual lights had been seen on a certain par.t of the island known as Settlement Point, and I immediately in structed the First Naval Member to despatch the nearest warship to the locality. The Platypus, which happened .to be the nearest waTship, is now on the high seas for the purpose of searching the vicinity of Settlement - Point. I think I have said sufficient to demonstrate that every attention has been given to this important matter, and. that the Director of Navigation took an early interest in it . The service which can thus be rendered by the aeroplane service we have estab. lished in Australia speaks volumes fox it . Later:",23

LOANBILL 1920. Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill . ALLEGED INFERIOR FLOUR.",23
8,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Yesterday I submitted a question to the Minister who, for the time being, was representing the Prime Minister, with reference to a complaint, from South African bakers and. merI chants as to the quality of B grade Australian flour, and the alleged unreliabilit y of Commonwealth Wheat Board certificates. The Minister promised to make a reply,, with a view to protecting Australia's good name, and I would like to know now whether the Prime Minister can give me information as to the resalt of any investigations he may have made in regard to this subject? - Mr HUGHES - I spoke to Mr Oman about this matter at the conference to .which I have already referred. In the first place, the ""Wheat Pool is not responsible for the sale of the flour. It sells wheat; it does not sell flour. The millers sold this flour. .In the second place, the flour, which had been gristed from, damaged Victorian second-quality wheat, which had been reconditioned, and was described as B grade, was sold upon sample, a parcel of 270 tons having been sent as a sample, and subsequent shipments were up to that sample. But it was sold up to sample by the millers, 1 and not by the Wheat Pool. Of course, I am sorry for the sake of the credit of Australian flour that there should have been any occasion for complaints, but there, is in the transaction no 'reflection on the Wheat Pool. I regret that it is not the only occasion on which Australians have done Australia incalculable injury. I recall an Eastern transaction in which some bolts and nuts were sold, and when the shipment was opened the belts and nuts had no relation one to the other. Those who do this sort of thing are really guilty towards this country of a crime infinitely worse than those crimes for which men are punished in the ordinary way.",23
9,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Hear , hear! Surely we have the power under our Oommerce Aet to control exports so that no bad stuff if exported?",24
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am not saying that' we have not the power, but the honourable member must remember the circumstances in which this flour was bought by South Africa, In that country there was a great shortage of wheat, and they were perilously near the starvation border. We must also not lose sight of the fact that flour made from inferior wheat will spoil very much more readily than that which is gristed from high-grade wheat. Eor instance, 70 per cent, flour will keep very much longer than 80 per oent. flour. Weevils would begin to breed more speedily in the former than in the latter, and - some time has elapsed since this particular flour was gristed. However, South Africa bought to sample. But I am dealing with this matter' generally. We here are the guardians of the .good name of Australia, no matter what party we .belong to, and we want to seo that goods sent out from this country are 'true to sample, and that' the samples are the very best we have. The good name of' Australia is all we have to live on. WAR SERVICE HMS.",24
11,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,TesteTda y the .Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) could not inform me what would be the approximate amount required for the purpose of completing the War 'Service Homes scheme. I would like to know whether the Treasurer has an estimate of the total amount whioh is likely to be expended i u this direction ?,24
12,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid that I cannot give the honourable member accurate figures, but. my last information was that about 27,000 applications for houses had been received, and just how many more will come in I do not kuow. If every soldier and his dependants is to get a home, I am afraid we have' a big task in front of us, which it will take a very long time to carry out.. PAYABLE O IL DISCOVERIES.",24
13,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Havin g regard to the urgent necessity for encouraging the discovery of payable oil in the Commonwealth, I should like the Prime Minister to say whether . the Government have decided to increase the reward in this connection from £10,000 up to £50,000, divided into five separate rewards of £10,000 each ?",24
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Some little time ago I corrected a statement. I bad mode in regard to this matter, and my answer to the honourable member's question is that the offer of this reward of £50,000 is to those who find payable oil on the mainland of Australia, and does not apply to New Guinea. I ' am now asked whether the Government will divide the reward up into five different sums of £10,000 each. What we contemplate is, of course, a reward of £50,000 for those who find oil in commercial payable quantities. If we were so fortunate as to have simultaneous findings of oil in five different places in payable quantities, the Government would have to consider a division of the prize, much in the same way as newspapers divide prizes in competitions they promote in order to increase their circulation'. The' idea is to offer such a substantial amount as will p ay people to incur, the expense of conducting, the necessary operations. I think I "" can promise the-honourable member that this reward of £50,000 is now definite-; it has not to. be made, but is made now. I read the other day that oil had been found' in, payable quantities, in the form of. gas, at Boma; - but the same might be said, of this place. However, the' Government have not as yet contemplated splitting up the reward, and it will be sufficient when operations have proved successful, and applications aremade, tot consider how the. reward shall be paid. NOTE. ISSUE.",24
15,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"In view of. the state of ment made by the Treasurer the. other day to the effect that he had! consulted leading bankers of Australia in relation to the note issue, has that right honourable in their-places, gentleman any objection to informing the House who the leading bankers were?",25

17,Mr HECTOBLAMOND,Unknown,"I desire, to ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether he is aware that from, what at Bendigo last year. purports to be a report by-the-.

Will the Minister take steps to correct this misrepresentation of the Chief Commonwealth Surveyor's views?' Mc. POYNTON - I wish to make it quite clear, that the question then under discussion was not that referred, to by the honourable member, but was whether the land, at Canberra was suitable for afforestation) purposes. I cannot conceive of land which requires) watering as being suitable, for such purposes. The beaufcU fication. of a place is quite a different proposition, and it is possible that for a littletime operations in. this connection may have to be carried on with a watering-can.",25

19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received: an intimation from the honourable member for Yarra (M-r. Tudor) that he desiresto move the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The present unsatisfactory position of the promised'guarantee 5s.. per. bushel for wheat delivered at railway sidings for the 1920-21 harvest."" Five honourable members having risen Question .proposed.",25
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [8:16] - At a meeting of the Labour party yesterday it was decided that I should move the adjournment of the House today, on, the question of the price guaranteed at railway sidings f b r the wheat, harvest 1920-21, in order to draw attention to the unsatisfactory position of affairs in view of the promise made by the Prime Minister in his policy speech Last Friday, in Comreply to .the honourable memberf o r  and Minister , notwithstanding, that he gave Cana fairly lengthy answer, did' not throw muchlight on the question beyond stating that the Government intended to I believe it is they possible there may be a harvest of We all be hope that there may be a good harvest, and, further, that the Australian people may obtain some advantage from the fact that there will be a large harvest in the Commonwealth-. None of us begrudge a bumper harvest - to the farmers, particularly those who have gone through hard times in recent years. I say that as a city representative, in whose constituency not a grain of wheat is produced. Minister this afternoon said that the payment would depend largely on the sale of wheat as it comes in . I point out, however, that, in the Bendigo speech the right honourable gentleman said nothing to that effect; and I have - no doubt that the farmers and others who ' read that speech understood it , as I did, as meaning a guaranteed advance for the 1920-21 crop. In that speech the Prime M in ister said that in order to help the' wheat growers, the Government, in addition to the guarantee for the conning crop, would guarantee 5s. at railway sidings for the 1920-21 harvest. If that means anythings it means au advance, and I suppose the farmers thought that when they took their wheat to the railway sidings they would receive that amount of money.",25
21,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Is the honourable member not usurping the functions of the Country party?,26
22,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Strang e to say, on this side of the House there are as many wheat-growers, and representatives of wheat-growing districts, as I believe there are in the Government party or in the Country party.",26
23,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,Every wheat-growing district of New South Wale3 except one is represented on this side.,26
24,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And New South Wales is called the premier State, although perhaps neither the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) nor myself would admit that to be the truth . I realise that every one should have an opportunity to discuss this question, and that being so, I shall not speak at length. The farmers are complaining of the attitude taken up by the Government in regard to the promise made by the'Prime Minister in his Bendigo soeech, guaranteeing them 5s. per bushel. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), who represents a wheat-growing constituency, has received the following letter from the President of the Delungra branch of the Primary Producers U n i o n: Dear Sir,- I have been requested by the farmers of the Delungra branch of the Primary Producers Union to write to you re the unsatisfactory position of the wheat-growers, and the guarantee of os. per bushel given by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). As you aro well aware, farmers of this State have had a very hard time during the past two or three years, and are now, very many of them, The Prinie in a difficult position financially, and will be unable to carry on unless they can have financial assistance until such time as their wheat is paid for by the Wheat Board. . . . The Prime Minister stated, at Bendigo, SOth October, 1919, '-' That in order to help the wheat-grower, the Government, in addition to its guarantee for the coming crop, will guarantee 5s. at railway siding for the 1920-21 harvest."" Now, unless the Federal Government honours its promise, and makes the payment 5s. per bushel on delivery at railway siding, farmers will certainly be placed in a most difficult position, even if the State Government does not press for repayment of advances made under the Rural Industries Board. The State Government states that it will pay 2s. (id. per bushel, as guaranteed on delivery, which equals 7s 6d. per bag, which will barely pay the expense of harvesting. However, I believe that you are well aware of the position of the farmers, and know how much they are in need of financial assistance. Therefore, I am requested to ask you to use your best endeavours to induce the Prime Minister to make the 5s. per busliel guarantee payable on the wheat being delivered to the agent appointed to receive the grain. This is' a very important mattter, and I would Suggest that you would confer with your Leader as to thp best method of obtaining this fulfilment of the Prime Minister's promise. This, however, I will leave to your judgment; but it is extremely necessary for the farmers to obtain at least the full guarantee of 5s. per bushel on delivery if they are to be enabled to carry on their occupation. I have no doubt that representatives qf other farming constituencies have received similar communications. The farmers want to know exactly what the guarantee means. Does it mean that the payment, of 5s. per bushel will not be made to them until the wheat is sold ? We have been told this afternoon by the Prime Minister that 300,000 tons of next seasen's wheat have been sold to the Egyptian Government ",26
25,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I did not say that. I said that I had put the representative of the Egyptian Government in touch with the selling agents, and that negotiations were now proceeding.",26
26,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Then I misunderstood the right honourable gentleman.,26
27,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"The Leader of the Oppol l t h September, 1020. sition did not champion the cause of the primaryproducers to the same extent when they were receiving only 2s. 6d. per bushel in respect of the first payment.",26
28,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"T he honourable member on one occasion endeavoured to put into my 'mouth words which I had never uttered, and he was compelled to admit that' he was wrong. I was denouncing manufacturers, warehousemen, and every one else who indulged in profiteering; 'but at the Farmers Convention the honourable member said that I had singled out. the primary producers for my Bpecial - condemnation. He is not going to put words into my mouth.",26
29,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,I proved conclusively that the honourable member did make the statement that I attributed to him .,27
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,T he honourable member proved nothing of .the kind. He was glad enough to crawl down. Mr GIBSON!- I did not crawl down.,27
31,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I repeat that the honourable member was glad enough to "" climb down,"" and he iB not going to put words into my mouth,- much though he and his predecessor would like to do so. He cannot prove that I have ever said or done anything contrary to the best interests of Australia and the whole of the Australian people. I am anxious not to import any heat into the debate, and I shall not refer fur ther, to that matter. My desire is that' the. primary producers, like every other section of the community, shall get a fair return for their labour. That has always been my attitude. Apparently the negotiations for the sale of 300,000 tons of wheat to the Egyptian Government have not been completed. The Prime Minister said that the sale would mean anything from £7,000,000 to £9,000,000, which would mean from 12s. to 15s. 8d. per' bushel ",27
32,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Of that 300,000 tons, 260,000 tons are to be gristed into flour in Australia.",27

35,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is most important that we should grjist as much wheat as possible, not only for the sake of providing employment, but in order that the offal may be made available for our stock. If the farmers have to wait until the whole transaction is completed before the Prime Minister's guarantee is honoured, then I think, to use the memorable words of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie), they .will declare that they have "" been sold a pup."" They will have been deceived. Mr CORSER.'-It will be a very good ""pup."" J B",27
36,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If they have to wait until the whole transaction is completed it will be a mongrel. The farmers, in common with every one else, interpreted the Prime Minister's statement as meaning that on delivery of their wheat at a railway siding they would receive an advance of 5s. per bushel. No other construction could be put upon the statement. If the farmers are to wait' until thewheat has been sold they may well say to the Government, "" T h a n k you, for nothing; if you are going to sell onr wheat at from 12s. to' 15sper bushel and merely give us an advance of 5s. per bushel after the transaction is completed;' we have nothing for which to thank you. We oan do that for ourselves."" I am glad that the Wheat Pool with Commonwealth representation is to be re-created. Inits new for m it will be a good thing for the farmers and for the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, and should aid materially in the shipping of wheat. I trust that the Government will make as good a deal in respect of the whole of the coming season's crop as is contemplated in connection with the sale to the Egyptian Government. The farmers, however, should not have to wait for the honouring of the guarantee of 5s. per bushel until the whole deal is consummated. Mb one could read into the Prime Minister's Bendigo speech any such intention - H is statement wasIn order to help the wheat-grower, the Government, in addition to its guarantee for the coming crop, will guarantee 5s. at railway sidings for the 1920-21 harvest There was no suggestion in. that statement that the farmers would have to wait for their money until the sales had been completed. The statement meant, if it meant anything at all, that they would receive an advance of 5s. per bushel. Some of them will have to wait a long time for their money if they are not to receive a dividend until the whole of the 2,500,000 tons or 3,000,000 tons is sent away.. It is quite possible that we shall have a repetition pf our experience in respect of the 1915-16 harvest, when we had something like 1,500,000 tons of wheat stacked at Brooklyn,' where it was attacked by mice and weevils. The ' Government, at the earliest - moment, - should let the farmers know whether they in tend to honour their guarantee by .making an advance of 5s. per bushel to them as soon asthoydeliver their wheat at a railway siding. If that is not to be done - if the Government merely intend to makea cash payment to the farmers after the wheat has been sold-the primary producers will have reason to complain that the guarantee has not been honoured, and that they have'been "" sold a pup "" that is an absolute mongrel.",27
37,Mr HILL,Unknown,"Echuca) [ 8 8 1 ] - I listened very carefully to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and. as"" one who knows they facts of the case, I am in entire agreement with it up to the point at which we ask for information in regard to the first payment. I am not wholly in agreement with the view taken by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the guarantee of 5a. per bushel. I think I can at least speak for the farmers of .Victoria",28
38,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"And of Australia. . Mr LAVELM: - The honourable member cannot, speak for the farmers in my electorate.",28
39,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I oan at least speak-for the farmers of Vietoria, and I desire to be absolutely f a ir to the Prime Minister. I , and the great bulk of the farmers of this State, understood that the guarantee of 5s. a bushel was given by the Prime Minister with a view to encourage the growers to increase the area under wheat to the greatest possible extent. The farmers, however, want to know what the first payment is going to be. I , , for one,'shall not press for a first payment of 5s. .per-bushel unless it .can be shown that the money may be easily raised. If ou.r farmers could manage to carry on with a first payment of, say, 4s. per bushel, they would be much better off than if they received' 5s. per bushel, assuming that it was difficult to raise the money. I think that they could' carry on with a payment of 4s. per bushel for a little, time, pending a further dividend on the sales made.  honourable member interpret the promise made at Bendigo by the Prime Minister?",28
40,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I regarded it as a guarantee that if , in the final realization, our .wheat brought only 4s. or 4s. 6d. per bushel, the Commonwealth was bound to pay the farmers Ss. a bushel for it .",28
41,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Hear ; hear I That is the guarantee.,28
42,Mr HILL,Unknown,"At a. very large conference of farmers at Bendigo last week, I put beforethe delegates the view I have just expressed, and I think it was generally accepted;- The .farmers. desire that the first payment should be. as large as possible.",28
43,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Hear , bear!- I agree with that.",28
44,Mr HILL,Unknown,"It is very difficult to make an, estimate where such, large figures are : involved, but it is quite likely that we shall have this season a crop of 45,000,000 bushels in. Victoria, 40,000,000 bushels in JSTew South Wales, 35,000,000 bushels in South Australia,, and' 17,000,000 bushels in Western Australia, or a total of 137,000,000; bushels. That, I think, is a very, moderate estimate. To finance such acrop at. 5s. a bushel would mean that the Commonwealth would have to advance £34,250,000 - I am rather inclined to think that that is too much to ask of the Government. Even 4s. per bushel on 13.7.,000,000bushels-for the guarantee applies to all wheat, whether, grown for export or for home consumption-woul d mean a cash' payment of £27,000,000. I think that if the Prime Minister were to announce at on early date that the farmers would receive 4s. as a-first advance, they would, be fairly well satisfied. Someof them arei a dire straits, and we are . anxious to help them as much as possible. Having regard to the good crops whioh the bulk, of the farmers are likely to get, provided they ore not visited by fire, flood or drought, it is probablethat. afirst payment of 4s. for this year will be equal to about 7s. or 8s. on. an ordinary crop. I hope that honourably members opposite will not press, this motion: I am perfectly satisfied that the Wheat Board and the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) are doing all they possibly can.. Probably one reason why the Prime Minister has not made - an announcement, in regard' to the first payment is that he hopes to see the nole to the Egyptian Government finalized at an early date. Probably if that is done, and another sale, which is pending, is completed, about £10,000,000 will be received, and the Government will have some money in hand to Btart with.",28
45,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.38] - I entirely agree with what the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) has said. ff .am sorry that ithe Leader of .the Oppoisition -(Mr Tudor) ..should have endeavoured to 'twist my /Bendigo speech - to - mean anything but what it obviously <does mean - If I say that I will guarantee the ipayment of a cheque I mean that if mo one else will pay 1 will. My - statement at Bendigo must the interpreted acicording to .the .ordinary .meaning of 'the terms employed. I .know no party in this - matter.; how can there be any party in wheat-growing ? But we cannot ;get blood out of a stone, and the farmers 'cannot get £34,000,000 in a lump sum out of the Commonwealth, which has had to strain all its resources in order to borrow £25,000,000. So honourable members must have regard to all 'the'circumstances. Subject to freight, the outlook .for the wheat-grower was never brighter than it is ito-day. I am not attempting to .lessen the freight difficulty-o n the - contrary, I emphasize it-bu t I say that it is no't in superable. Let me show what has been done during the last five or six years. In the years 1915-16, 1916-17, 1917-18, 19(18-19, and .1920, the Commonwealth gave the wheat-grower a guarantee. In those years we sold most of our wheat f.o.b. Of course, ""the 'circumstances - were entirely different, because then - the wheat was sold'before it was shifted. That made it very much easier for - the guarantor, because he received This money; he was, in fact, actually guaranteeing the buyers' promise to pay. In the year T915-16, in pursuance of 'a policy 'to - which - every member on the .'Opposition side who was then in the House was a party, we Started 'the Pool. It has 'had its - critics, and 'they --and .'the -'Government 'have l a d their - little - differences; but, on the 'whole, the system proved its usefulness during a .period - of great turmoil , when it was impossible 'forwheat to flow along the normal channels. In 1915-16 the paymerits, as a result of the guarantee, were 2s. 6d. down, then'6a., Is., 6d.,'3d., and I'd. ; in 1916-17, -2s -6d. .down, then 6d. and -3d.; in !l'917-'-I8, 3s - down, - then 3d. and 9d.; in 1918-1-9, 4s -4d. down -(that was, of course, on a very small - crop); in 1919-20, ;5s - down, on a very meagre crop. We 'have 'each year adjusted ourselves to the circumstances as they arose. As to the present, I 'entirely sympathize with the farmer who says that he requires the 5s. which the Government have - guaranteed. We .shall honour OUT guarantee whether the wheat is sold - or mot. But 'unless we can sell the wheat .quickly we cannot pay him the 5s - a bushel in one sum. We shall .not get the money for the Egyptian .wheat or for t i e wheat to be sold .under another contract that is being negotiated, but we shall get .credit, and .we can go to any - financial institution and ask for a loan of money to be advanced to the farmer before the wheat is actually sold. We have not to wait u n t i l the wheat - is realized; we can iget credit as soon as the sale is made. In any case, the farmer is infinitely .better off with the guarantee than .without it . because every banker and storekeeper reckons his wheat as good - enough security for an advance of 5s.",28
46,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Will the Prime M in ister venture to name the sum which may probably be paid for the wheat""?",29
47,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"This is a business proposition, and we are-dealing with conditions which are.yet in a state of flux. If the deals of which I have spoken are consummated, we shall be in an incomparably better position, because one will involve an amount of from £7,000,000 to £9,000,000, and the other a 'smaller amount. 'Taking the total of the two at £13,000,000, that would mean an advance of 2s. per bushel, and if the Commonwealth found a further £7,000,000 an advance of -3s. per bushel would be possible. The advance becomes compassable once - we get tover the first obstacle. I understand the position of the farmer, and I sympathize with - him, particularly the farmer .in areas that have been drought stricken. In that - respect .all States did not suffer equally., but it is only righ t to.sa,y that the New South Wales Government have promised to advance another 2s -6d. per'bushel. I have not spoken to Mr StoTey or Mr Dunne on this question, but I assume that the New South Wales Government will make everv effort 'to pay that money as - soon as possible.  to pay on delivery. . Mr HUGHES - They must first get the money, and as a wholesale 'borrower.,. I .may tell honourable members that that is not quite as easily done as they may imagine. I repeat ;that I sympathize with the fanners' position. I do not object to the Leader of the Opposition moving the adjournment of the House r but I <do ttake - exception to his statement 4900 Adjournment that my promise at Bendigo deceived the farmer. It did nothing of the sort. The Government gave a guarantee which we shall honour, and it is worth a great deal to the farmer. As soon as we are able to roughly estimate what we can pay by way of advance, I shall make an announcement in this House. That will be done at the earliest possible moment. k r . LAVELLE (Calare) listened with great attention to the two statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and also to the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Hill ) . I am sorry that the farmers are not sitting in the galleries this afternoon, to witness the demonstration of how the Country party, or, at least, one of its members, looks after the interests of the wheat-growers. The Prime Minister failed to make any statement that would give satisfaction to the wheat farmers. F r om end to end of New South Wales, and I suppose from end to end of Australia, the minds of the farmers are exercised as to the amount of advance they will receive on delivery, and as to whether or not they will receive the full 5s. when the wheat is taken to the railway siding. Although it has been stated that the farmers do not expect or desire to be paid the whole 5s., I say that that statement is not correct. The farmers do desire and expect the payment of the full amount guaranteed.",29
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Would the honourable member mind indicating where the £34,000,000 can be obtained?",30

51,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"L as t week I attended the show at Cowra, in my electorate. Every farmer with whom I was acquainted, and many others, approached me with a request that I should endeavour to get a definite announcement from the Prime Minister as to his in tentions in regard to the guarantee, ancl as to whether the amount would be paid in cash. I asked the Prime Minister a question, but he was unable to state any[REPRESENTATIVES. J (Formal): thing definite. He said he was not yet in a position to make a statement, but that he would do so as soon as possible. Every farmer with whom I came into touch expressed the view that that was entirely unsatisfactory. In the course of his policy speech at Bendigo nearly a year ago, the Prime Minister said it was intended to guarantee 5s. per bushel at railway sidings for the 1920-21 crop. Despite what the [3,48] - I Prime Minister has said today, and notwithstanding the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , that statement-mad e in the course of the policy speech-conveye d to the minds of Australian farmers that it was the intention of the Federal Government to pay 5s. per bushel on delivery. But it was purely an electioneering cry. The Prime Minister merely talked about 5s. in order to obtain the votes of the farmers; and, after twelve months, the Government are still undecided as to how to redeem their promise; indeed, concerning what to do at all. Wheat-growers in my electorate, and in those surrounding, now that they are faced with a bountiful harvest, are wondering whether to cut their crops for hay or to harvest for grain.",30
52,Mr HILL,Unknown,The r e need be no doubt about what to do.,30
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"S u r e l y not, with a guarantee of 7s. 6d.",30
54,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"I repeat that the farmers are undecided what to do. They have had enough of receiving money for their crops in dribs and drabs. They have had enough of Wheat Pools run by selling agents, gentlemen to whom the Prime Minister referred as experts. They were experts, be said, so far as selling wheat was concerned. They are experts, I say, so far as selling the farmers is concerned; and if the Prime Minister had said so, he would have been nearer the mark. The farmers have had enough of this business. honourable Sir JOSEPH COOK - Hear , hear! Labour is the only friend of the farmer.",30
55,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"A b so l u t e l y . In New South Wales nearly every farming electorate has returned a Labour member to this House, and I venture to predict that after the next general elections there will be a Labour representative of every farming electorate in that State.  toria, too.",30
56,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Government are talking of their guarantee of 5s; but, in New South Wales, owing to the fact that there is a Labour Government in power, the farmers have a guarantee of 7s. 6d. The Government in that State know how they are going to get their money, and the farmers know that they are going to receive 2s. 6d. per bushel on delivery. The State Government have guaranteed it . and that is sufficient for the farmers; they know they will get it . It is in the matter of the Commonwealth guarantee that the farmers want to know something definite. We have had enough of the Prime Minister interfering with oversea sales during the past two or three seasons, and we have had more than enough of these wheat-selling, farmer-selling experts. We say that all Pools should be kept out of the hands of the agents and brokers, in the best interests of producers and consumers. If the Pool were formed ""and controlled by representatives of the producers and consumers, and the wheat-selling agents were excluded, satisfaction might be looked for ; but, as things are, we demand that the Government shall state definitely how they propose to make their payment of 5s., and when.",30
57,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then , since the honourable member demands it , here it is.",31
58,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"The Treasurer waves his hand as the Prime Minister has airily doing; yet, eleven months after promise was made at Bendigo, the Prime Minister still says he does not know how either the promise is to be kept. The farmers are expecting the 5s. to be paid, and they do not receive it they wil l have thing to say at the next elections.",31
59,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa ) [3.56] I strongly support the motion. If it be expected-as the Prime Minister (Hughes) has indicated today-that our wheat will sell considerably in excess of 5s. per bushel, there* should be no diffihave these experts? culty in making an advance of livery. In fact, if the farmers are to be required to put their wheat into the Pool, and if matters turn out as the Minister hopes, there should be no diffiSouth culty in givin? farmers at least half sum which their wheat wil l realise.",31
60,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That would involve £30,000,000. Will the honourable member tell me where we are going to get it ?",31
61,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"The advanoe could be made by extending the operascocK tions of the Commonwealth Bank, and by opening cash credits to the farmers in country branches in respect the wheat which the Government take; [202] ,nd, as the Government receive the payments for the wheat, they could cancel the cash credits in the banks. It could all be done as simply as possible.",31
62,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I quite realise that, but still I do not know where the money is to come from.",31
63,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"How much money does the Treasurer really think changes hands in a great national transaction in volving £30,000,000 ? There would not be £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 ' in actual cash ever transferred. It is all a matter of the transfer of credits from one set of individuals to another, and if the Treasurer does not know that, it amounts to a serious admission.",31
64,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Nevertheless , I do make that, admission.",31
65,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"The Prime M in ister said today that the Government could not make a statement about this matter. During the election campaign he was able to make any number of statements. He could talk about the huge indemnity which we were to expect; but now he knows nothing about it . At election time he would promise not merelv 5s., but 20s., for the farmers' wheat, if he thought that that would help him and been his colleagues back to the Treasury the bench. Now, however, he says he does not know anything. He cannot carry out his definite promises or fulfil his obligations to the struggling primary proi f ducers. We are told that the advice of somethe best wheat experts has been secured. Are these experts like the gentleman who was appointed Controller of the first is to' Wheat Pool in New South Wales? The Mr only time he ever saw wheat was when he had to do a little parcelling out of seed to the needy farmers. What qualifications Why should the 5s. on demiddlemen be represented?",31
66,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"On e of the gentlemen to whom the honourable member refers was Prime appointed by the Government of New Wales, and he has"" nothing to do the with the central administration of this Pool.",31
67,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"The whole business of creating another Pool, and of repayirr the farmer in dribs and drabs, is nothing more nor less than a scheme to perpetuate exchange gambling in wheat scrip. The Government are merely carrying out the policy which they have advanced on of any and every occasion since they came into power. They will do all they possibly can to boost and bolster up the middleman and the profiteer, at the expense of the producer and the general community. If the farmer is to be given an opportunity to balance his financial obligations - particularl y since, in New South ""Wales, he has been badly hit by drought-the Government must guarantee a cash payment of 5s. per bushel as soon as the wheat has been delivered at a railway siding.",31
68,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling) [4.5] The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) this afternoon made two long, rambling statements, which contained very little information. He wandered all over the hemisphere, but it was not till the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) asked k m for information regarding a cash advance that there was elicited a refusal to mention any sum whatever. The Government of New South Wales have definitely, bound themselves to pay 2s. 6d. per bushel cash down upon delivery at a railway siding.",32
69,Mr FENTON,Unknown,And the Queensland Government are guaranteeing 3s. per bushel over and above the amount of the Commonwealth guarantee.,32
70,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"That 2s. 6d. means a great deal to the farmers of New South Wales, but will not be nearly sufficient to allow them to meet their obligations, because for the last three seasons, and, in some parts of the State, four seasons, the crops have been absolute failures. Tliere are very few farmers who are not mortgaged right up to the last penny of the value of their property. I suppose similar conditions apply to the farmers in all the wheat-producing States, and the only possible way in which their anxieties can be relieved is by a definite pronouncement from the Commonwealth Government on the lines of that made by the New South Wales Government. The 2s. 6.d. advance by the State Government will at any rate give the farmers the opportunity of .gauging their liabilities and chances of paying off their mortgages.",32
71,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"If a man delivers 1,000 bushels of wheat at a siding, and his delivery-note is endorsed at 5s. per bushel, is it not as good as a payment in cash ?",32
72,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Yes , if the Government would arrange a system of credit, but not when the farmer is obliged to take his endorsed note to a bank or other financial institution, which get3 its "" cut"" for negotiating it. It would merely be repeating, the unsatisfactory routine of payments of Id., 4d., 5d., or 6d. on various wheat scrip, by which the farmers have been despoiled for the last four years, and which has resulted in all sorts of gambling, much of it of a very sinister nature. In fact, many of the operations of the different Wheat Pools have, to say the very least of them, been rather smellsome. It is within the power of the Commonwealth Government, acting in conjunction with the Wheat Board, to prevent all gambling in wheat scrip. The farmer should not be obliged to dispose of his scrip at under its value. It could be avoided, but when we seek to obtain the assistance of the Country party to prevent it, we find that they .are at one with the Government, and firmly believe that the only possible way jn which the Wheat Pool can be conducted is on the old bad lines of the past. According to the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , it is impossible to give an advance of 5s. per bushel, because it would represent an advance of about £34,000,000. Yet in the same breath the honourable member says, ""We want 4s. per bushel."" , Mr HILL - I did not say that we wanted it. I said that we would very much like to have it.",32
73,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The honourable member pooh-poohed the idea of a cash advance of 5s. per bushel, but expressed the hope, and possibly anticipated, that an advance of 4s. per bushel would be made, which would represent a total advance of about - £27,000,000, only £7,000,000 less than would be required for an advance of 5s. The greatest factor to be taken into consideration is the financial situation of the farmers. If the State Government of New South Wales can afford a cash payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel, surely the Commonwealth Government, with all its possibilities and opportun'ties, could arrange to advance another 2s. 6d. per bushel immediately upon delivery of the wheat at a railway siding. I urge the Government to do it. One good reason why we should endeavour to give some stability to agriculture is the fact that during the last seven years the area under crop in Australia has been decreased by over 3,200,000 acres, or 33 per cent, of the total area previously under cultivation. I h the face of these appalling figures, honourable members will realise that unless something is done quickly in order to give some greater bility to the industry, many more farmers will cease to follow the calling of wheat growing. As the question of arranging freights is most important, I hope the Wheat Board, acting in co-operation with the Government, will at once make the necessary shipping arrangements. Although by December next our wheat will be piling up in its millions of tons, no step has yet been taken to arrange freights to get the harvest away.",32
74,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The honourable member could not expect the Commonwealth Government to have done very much so far, seeing that it has only just come into the arrangement.",33
75,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,The Government knew the position.,33
76,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,But - they did not know that they were to enter into this special arrangement:,33
77,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The Government have a responsibility to the people of Australia, which they have not realized, hut have contented themselves by saying, "" We will wait until such and such circumstances arise; we will wait until the Wheat Board is established."" But, though we are now within three months of the harvesting of the whole of these millions of tons of wheat, we are told by the Prime Minister that not one step has been taken to arrange for freight to remove it to the overseas markets. I hope that at a very early date the Government will tell the farmers that they will receive 2s. 6d. or 3s. per bushel immediately on the delivery of the wheat at the railway siding. That offer, in conjunction with the State Government's cash payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel, would enable the. farmers of New South Wales to carry on for a certain time; but, so - far as the farmers of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia are concerned, the amount should be increased.",33
78,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon-Honorar y Minister) [4.14] - In the past, the Government have been blamed because, during the w,ar period, there has come about a diminution in the area under agricul[202]- 2 ture in Australia; but the present is an appropriate time for reminding honourable members that this country has in sight what pre-harvest estimiates indicate will be the second biggest crop ever sta- garnered in its history. The greatest Australian harvest, of course, was in the season 1915-16, following a drought, when there was brpnght uuder cultivation the whole of the land that had failed in the previous season, AS well as the area that had been fallowed during the drought j>eriod. I am pleased to recognise the reasonable attitude of the direct representatives of the farmers in this Chamber, particularly that of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) .",33
79,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,I am as much a representative of the farmers as is the honourable member for Echuca.,33
80,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That is not so, because the honourable member for Echuca was specially selected by the Australian farmers to represent them on the Wheat Board. He takes up the reasonable attitude, that, owing to the prospect of Australia having a harvest of 135,000,000 bushels, an expenditure of, roughly, £37,000,000 would be involved in the payment of a guarantee of 5s. per bushel immediately upon delivery. I take quite a contrary view to that of the honourable member for Calare (Mr. alLavelle), that so' much wheat will be cut for hay. I believe that very little will be cut for hay. I think that the farmers will be only too anxious to get the benefit of the world's prices for wheat, particularly in New South Wales, where there would possibly be a total guarantee of 7s. 6d. per bushel. Of course, I recognise that the farmers of that State have had a bad time.. They did not benefit last year by the high prices obtained for the wheat grown in other more fortunate States, and it is possible that, on account of this, the State Governanent has guaranteed them a payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel. This, on a 45,000,000-bushel crop-the most sanguine estimates in New South Wales prophesy that-wil l mean a payment of £5,625,000 on wheat that, immediately on*delivery, will pass from the New South Wales Government to the control of the Australian Wheat Board, and be available for the purpose of financing whatever payment is made by the Commonwealth Government. How the New South Wales Government propose to i finance this £5,625,000 is-no concern this Chamber, but I would remind them that the wheat will not be available f them for their own direct financing; and it will probably be found, when it is boiled down, that the Commonwealth Government and the Australian Wheat Board will be obliged to give material assistance in meeting the State guarantee.",33
81,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Do the New .South W.ales Government propose to pay the 2s. 6d. per bushel on delivery?,34
82,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Yes . In regard to this matter of a guarantee to the farmers, there was a difference between the policies put before the electors by the different parties at the last general election. The Labour .party promised to pay 5s. per bushel upon delivery of the wheat.

I take this opporI tunity of urging upon the Board, what I am sure they will recognise, the great necessity for moving by forward sales some of the early wlieat.

83,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,At whose cost?,34
84,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I do not""propose to go into that question, but the Board doubt recognise that they could not, the early stages, sell the whole of wheat brought into the Pool. Looking at the magnitude of the harvest t is abnost impossible to anticipate payof ing in January a lump sum of from £32,000,000 to £37,000,000; but if subor stantial sales are made in the meantime, it will greatly facilitate matters, and, if we are able to make substantial sales, and secure adequate shipping, that may put the Board and the Government in a better position to pay a large sum. At this stage I urge members not to press for an immediate declaration as to the amount, because it is in the interests of the farmers to wait until the operations of the Board are further advanced.  [4.23] - We have had two Ministerial speeches, but, unfortunately, neither has thrown much light on the subject.

96,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"You want the honourable member to make a deliberately false statement ?  Minister may interpret the position as he likes, but I know of hundreds of farmers in my electorate who believed that when they delivered their wheat at the railway siding they would get 5s. per bushel.

If the Government are not going to adhere to the definite promise made at Bendigo, then, at any rate, some special treatment should be given to the wheat growers of New South Wales. Many of these men have been ruined and have had to go off the land altogether, while others, on the strength of the promise, have made a supreme effort to carry on, and today, in consequence, are living under heavy mortgages.

106,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"On the 15th the September the honourable member for the Cowper (Dr Earle Page) asked the folwaterworks lowing questions:1. Whether it is a fact that the British vernment has suggested to self-governing Dominions that they should take stock of their facilities for generating electricity, whether from water power, coal, oil, or other source of energy, and should appreciate their permanent ancl over-increasing importance to the Empire? 2. Whether it is further urged, at the same time, that electrical supply ought to be considered as .a matter of Imperial importance, upon which other manufacturing trades, all forms of railway traction, munition works, the production of fertilizers, and other aids to agriculture, will largely depend, and that the Empire's available resources for this purpose should not be allowed to pass into alien hands, or under alien control? 3. Is it a fact that the Dominion of Canada in 1910 appointed a Commission of Conservation to investigate the character and extent the various natural resources of Canada? 4. Is it a fact that, in pursuance of this investigation, the Commission, in collaboration with the various Provincial Governments in Canada, who had comimenced work on investigating their water-powers prior to the formation of the Commission, has been systematically at work on an assessment of the waterpowers of the Dominion, and that reports on the water-powers of the Provinces of Prince Edward Tsland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia have now been published ? 5. Is. it a fact that in Australia, New Wales and Tasmania, and perhaps, to extent, Queensland and Victoria, have .preliminary investigations and collected tain information with regard to their waterpowers ? 6. Does the Prime Minister propose to similar action, both from an Imperial from a Federal point of view, in respect the sources of power in Australia? My colleague then promised that in quiries would be mfde. I now desire to furnish the honourable member with the following reply: 1 and 2. The British Government appointed a Committee of the Conjoint Board of Scientific Societies to report upon what was being done to ascertain the amount of distribution of water-power in the British Empire. That Committee recommended the British Government to bring before the notice of the Indian and of the various Dominion GoThe vernments and of the governing bodies of the Colonies the necessity for a close, systematic investigation of the economic possibilities; but the Commonwealth Government has not yet received any communication on the matter. 3. Yos. 4. There is a Special Committee on Waters and Water-powers working in conjunction with Commission of Conservation, which represents the various Canadian Provinces.

107,Mr WATKI NS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [4.35].,I desire to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) instances of what I regard as waste and mismanagement in connection South with the Department of Defence. In my some own electorate some £15,000 was exmade pended upon the establishment of a camp cerat Adamstown, immediately alongside one of the best ranges in Australia. The take Camp was sewered and elaborately fitted and up, but it suddenly dawned on the Deof partment that, although the population of the district is increasing more rapidly - than that of any other part of the Commonwealth, the camp should be closed as a training ground for boys; and that the buildings should be dismantled and removed, at a cost of something like £10,000, to Rutherford, 25 miles distant, in order to combine the training operations of two distinct districts. I am not going to argue that there should not be a camp at Rutherford. As time goes on it wil l be found that the population is sufficiently large to warrant the provision of separate camps, and I certainly think a mistake has been made in deciding to close down the camp at Adamstown. It appears that the matter was first reported on'by an officer from Melbourne, who declared that the Adamstown site was one of the best that could be selected. It is connected up with Newcastle, and can be supplied for less than it would be possible to supply any other camp in any other part of the country, yet it is to be closed - and the sons of artisans-boy s out of the mines-ar e to be compelled to travel 25 miles to the Rutherford camp, which is some imiles away from the range at which they will have to do their shooting. The decision todismantle the camp at Adamstown was the result of made by a Business Board. I do not know whether the members of that visited the camp, and I am at a loss to understand how they could estimate progress that the district is making without a personal inspection. There can be no doubt that the district is rapidly developing. That is the opinion of members who recently saw it and who expressed their astonishment at the progress that was being made. The Business Board referred the whole matter to a Board of three, two of whom live in the district to which these buildings are to be removed. In fairness to them, however, I should say that they urged that there was room for two separate camps. To the Adamstown camp will be to make a serious mistake. I am convinced within-the next few years, it will be found necessary to re-build it. We were told yesterday that compulsory training is designed not only to fit our boys for military service, but to develop them physically. The Adamstown camp is peculiarly fitted for the training of boys. It is situated on healthy, undulating country, and is within a few minutes' walk of the sea beach, where trainees can enjoy a refreshing bath. This case illustrates the ineptitude of some people connected with the Department. Money is to be absolutely Mr Watkins. wasted. It will cost more to remove the buildings from Adamstown to Rutherford, which is a timber district, than it would do to erect at the latter place new buildings constructed with locally-grown timber. I ask the Minister, before definite action is taken, to carefully examine the report of the Board of three. They are reliable military men, one of whom saw service abroad, and they reported that the necessities of the case would warrant the provision of two distinct camps.",37
108,Sir GKANVILLE RYKIE,Unknown,I shall look into the matter.,38
109,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Fremantle) [4.45]. - I draw the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) to the fact that we are to have at the end of this year a visit from a Bisley team, and that there is no rifle range in Western Australia which provides for the maximum range of 1,000 yards. At Osborne, which is the official military range, and is used also by members of most of the metropolitan rifle clubs, the maximum range is 800 yards. Por some inquiries months the National Rifle Association of Western Australia has been in communiBoard cation with the Minister for Defence as to the desirableness of increasing the the range to the maximum of 1,000 yards. I understand that the chief difficulty is due to a dispute between departmental officers and the executive of the National Rifle Association as to the cost of making the extension. The Association estimates the cost at only a few hundred pounds, whereas the estimate of the military authorities is about £2,500. This is an urgent matter. We cannot allow it to stand over, since, if the Bisley team is to fire in matches in Western Australia, the maximum firing range of 1,000 yards will dismantle be requisite.' 1 would point out to the Minister that any difference between the that, estimate of the Association and that of his executive officers is probably due to the fact that the military officials desire to provide what I might term a complete and permanent 1,000 yards range, with all the necessary mounds and .fittings. The construction of such a range on the ordinary military scale would probably cost the amount estimated by the Department. Such a range, however, is not essential. It is very seldom that, under the military curriculum, there is any necessity for military units to fire over more than 500 or 600 yards. If the Minister could see his way to an agree would ment whereby a temporary extension of range to 1,000 yards could be secured for the series of meetings and matches which the National Rifle* Association of Western Australia is anxious to arrange for the upon us by others. visiting Bisley team, the circumstances of the moment would be met. I am anxious to add unnecessarily to the expenditure of the Commonwealth at the barracks. present time, but a grave injustice will be done to the riflemen of Western Ausacres of land. tralia if , owing to lack of adequate range sore for a number of years accommodation, they are not given an portunity to compete with' the Bisley team. Knowing that the Minister wiU be familiar with the military training well as the rifle club point of view, I him to give serious consideration to my the large centres of employment. suggestion, that temporary provision should be made to assist in the conduct these matches at the end of the year.",38
110,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [ 4 . 5 0 ] think if the Minister in charge of partment were to explain the items conto tained in his Estimates, he would avoid a lot of opposition, and delay due to understanding. There are some items inthese Estimates, to which not even the most fanatical anti-militarist could object. There are, for instance, the amount the cordite factory,' and another sum the clothing factory. Honourable memmoney bers have been urging the Government he rejected the proposal. to increase the production of cloth knowing, that if the production is in cess of military requirements the public will purchase the balance. The is of good quality, and suitable for climate, and it could be sold at a price which is within the means of the average citizen. There is also provision purchase of heavy guns. Whether or not we are opposed to militarism, Australia must necessarily have on hand some instruments of protection and destruction, even if it abandons the system of compulsory training. If the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) would explain some of these items he would secure a quicker passage for his Estimates. None of us desire to encourage war, and I am of opinion that if democratic rule in other parts of the world were advanced to even the standard obtained in Australia wars would cease. No truly democratic nation would go to war except, by a resolution of the Parliament, and I do not think any Parliament agree to a resolution which would the mean the murdering of its own citizens. Some of the items contained in the Estimates are based on the idea that they will act as an insurance against attacks If a person knows that you are able to use your fists he not takes care not to be too saucy. There is one item for expenditure on In East Sydney there are large barracks occupying an area of 40 They have been an eyeI n 1910 opI urged that the land on which the barracks stood should be made available for residential purposes, thus removing an as eyesore, and overcoming an obstacle to ask the obtaining of residential areas near to Government property cannot be rated by of the municipalities, and some years ago I tried to induce the Commonwealth Go- I vernment to follow the example of the a DeNew South Wales Government by voting each municipality a lump sum to compensate for. the loss of rates on Governmisment-owned property. I nearly succeeded in inducing the then Treasurer, who was a Scotchman, to adopt my suggestion, but when he ascertained the extent of profor perty owned by the Commonwealth for throughout Australia, and the amount of that would be involved each year, The whole of the barracks area at East Sydney is not exutilized by the military authorities, and the municipality of Paddington has cloth asked me to urge' the Government to the erect office accommodation for the Defence Department elsewhere, in the city if necessary, and to shif t the training for the operations to Liverpool.",39
111,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Are the barracks situated in a residential area or a business area ?,39
112,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The area occupied by the barracks is suitable for both purposes. It comprises 40 acres in one of the finest localities about Sydney. It has frontages to four Toads. It is intended that a deputation shall wait upon the Prime Minister at the earliest possible moment to urge that militarv ofiice accommodation be erected elsewhere, and the barracks area made available for residential purposes. One of the roads to ,which the barracks area has a frontage is virtually in the city, because the boundary of Sydney proper is on the opposite side of the road. But the other three roads are in the municipality of Paddington. That is one of t i e smallest cipalities in New South ""Wales, and this large unrateahle area is a great burden it. One of the three roads is woodtion blocked, and it and a wide path must kept in repair. The grade of one of other roads is such that in wet weather the road becomes badly cut up, and quires a considerable expenditure on repairs. The Fisher Government prowith posed to sell the Oxford-street frontage to a depth of 100 feet. The area disposed of would become rateable, the municipality would gain dreds of pounds per annum. brought this matter forward in 1910 gotiations were proceeding favourably, they lapsed when war broke out, and ing the war period there was great activity at the barracks. How that have returned to normal times, it is thought that such a valuable site should be returned to the citizens. it was held by the British Government, but on the grant of responsible governwhereby ment it was handed over to New South Wales. I do not think the fee-simple has ever been taken away from the State authorities; therefore, the Commonwealth cannot use the area except for military barracks. In the case of Garden the State Government refused to allow the Commonwealth Government to rewith ceive that property from the British miralty, even in exchange. I think barracks are in like case. general consensus of opinion amongst the residents of East Sydney that the barsist racks site should be surrendered and other site selected on which better office accommodation for the Defence Departwork ment could be erected. The existing buildings are very old, some of them are out of repair, and the majority are envote tirely unsuited for military purposes. hope the Department will not spend any f u r the r money there u n t i l the Governassociation ment have dealt with this question. What is the trouble at Duntroon ? Cadets cannot be attracted to enter upon their course there nowadays. Does not the M in ister think the establishment ought to be closed down?",39

So far as the Defence Department is concerned, we have practically severed our connection the rifle associations, as regards expenditure upon upkeep and improvement thus of ranges, by placing an amount of and £50,000 upon the Estimates. This sum hunis to be allotted to the rifle associations A f t e r I of the Commonwealth, and it will be for nethose bodies to use the money as they but think best. I cannot definitely commit durthe Department to an expenditure upon the Western Australian range; but, in we view of the projected visit of a team of riflemen from England, and believing that it is desirable that our Australian riflemen Originally should be encouraged to meet the visitors, I think some arrangement might be made the Department could give assistance to the Western Australian Association to carry out the necessary alterations. I am prepared to suggest to the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) that the Western Australian Rifle Association undertake to carry out the necessary work.

We should know whether those weapons were, according to the last report, costing between £7 to £9 each-whic h is about double the estimated cost at the time when the machinery was installed there. Honourable members would like to have information, also, regarding the number of rifles in stock in Australia, the number taken away during the'war, and the number returned; and we should be told whether the type of rifle now being manufactured at Lithgow is up to date or obsolete.",40
116,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member would not suggest publishing the number of rifles in stock in Australia? ,41
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Why There is considerable talk about our not doing wisely in publishing details which might be qf interest to a potential enemy, but the probability is that most of the information is known a great deal earlier and more completely to outside sources than to members of this Parliament. Honourable members should be informed whether any alteration has been effected to the design of the Lithgow rifle, and whether it is proposed to continue the manufacture of rifles at more than double the price at which they are being turned out in other parts of the world today.",41

119,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Commonwealth authorities can buy all the rifles they want for about one-fourth the price being paid for - their manufacture at Lithgow. There are in Great B r it a in today hundreds of thousands of rifles which will never be used again, and which any Dominion Government can buy at an exceedingly low figure. I think offers in that direction have been made. I know that the bigger guns are being offered at considerably less than half the , 0 0 0 "" ; price of their actual manufacture. Some guns can be bought almost for the cost of taking them away. In Erance, the other day, there was a sale of guns, in cluding rifles, which were distributed practically for a song. There are stacked today in England thousands upon thousands of up-to-date rifles, which the AusHonorable tralian Government may' purchase for an exceedingly low figure.. The type of rifle which"" we produced before the war is not such as can now be called an up-todate arm. Honourable members should be made acquainted with the type of weapon being manufactured, and with the class of ammunition being turned out. We should know the whole policy of the Government respecting these matters. Without question, the manufacture of rifles at Lithgow has been, to put it very mildly, far from a success. Some of those arms were used in Palestine; but, in Europe, they were discarded, as they were regarded as being far from modern.",41

126,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot ) [5.23] Most of the discussion hitherto has been of a general nature, and very little has been said about the specific items in this division of the Estimates; but, like the honourable member (Mr MCWilliams) who has just spoken, I think it is time we were given some information them. Some Minister ought to explain how the undertakings in which we have already engagedin our military tions and their projected extensions will fit in with the new scheme of Defence The honourable member for Franklin MCWilliams) has very rightly raised the question of the quality of the rifle turned out by the Lithgow Small Arms As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for some years, I have had a special opportunity of going into the history of this establishment. It has not realized anticipations. I remember occasion on which the money for the provision of the Factory was fir3t voted. The item appeared on the Estimates as these items are before us today. A few honourable members spoke briefly about it, and the then Minister for Defence (Sir Thomas Ewing) made a statement as to what was expected of the Factory. things have not happened as were anticipated. We secured machinery America, but we are obliged to employ on it twice* as many men as could work a similar plant in America. That is to say, the number of men employed greatly in excess of the number it was supposed would turn out the output; and it took a long time before the establishment approached like the output it was expected would be produced within a reasonable time. one would expect the full output all at once. Men had to be trained,, and much had to be done, excusable in the initial stages of an undertaking, but it was a very long time before the Lithgow tory could turn out anything - reasonable number of rifles. are to continue making them it is very important that they be up to date, and, certainly, they should be suitable for use with the latest ammunition devised."" The honourable member for Franklin has touched on other items to which I intended call attention-for instance, the proposed expenditure of £267,000 on heavy guns and a reserve of gun ammunition. is a new item about which we ought to be given some information. Although year's estimated expenditure on Defence Mr Atkinson. works is about ten times last year's estimate, I can understand the reason for this. Last year the war was practically still on, and the very necessary extensions of these factories had to 'be left in about abeyance, but now that the war is quite over it is necessary to put our defence system in order, and re-tackle the opera- question of carrying out the necessary extensions to existing plants. However, - there are many items which the Minister (Mr should explain, particularly in order to show how all this expenditure will fit in with the . new order of things in the Factory. Defence Department.",41
127,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [ 5 . 2 8 ] - I understand that the Cordite Factory is erected on a large area of land which is well suited for the manufacture of explothe sives that are used in very large quantities throughout Australia, and I see no reason why it should not be used for this purpose. We impose a big duty on explosives to compel their manufacture in Australia, but we have no hope of having them manufactured here for use in coal mining unless we establish a testing But station, which will enable them to be placed on the "" permitted explosives list."" from It is essential that no explosive that is liable to cause a fire should be used in coal mining. For that purpose all explosives used in coal mining must be first is tested and put on the "" permitted explosives list."" The obstacle to local manuestimated facture is the absence of a testing station in Australia. When the right anything honourable member for Parramatta (S ir Joseph Cook) was Prime Minister No in 1914 he agreed to have explosives tested in Australia, but shortly afterwards he went out of office, and the war commenced, and, of course, nothing was done in the matter. But , as I underFac- stand from the figures supplied at that like a time, that such a station would not cost If we more than £10,000, it occurs to me that there in connection with the Cordite Factory, should where it is proposed to spend so much that money, we could expend a little more for the purpose of establishing a plant for testing explosives, and thus enablethe manufacture of these exploto sives to be undertaken in Australia. If we are to develop our resources we must do something of the kind. A gentleman in This the Maitland district spent money in the erection of a plant for making explosives, this but overlooked the fact that before his explosives could be used in the coal mines it waa necessary to have them tested and placed upon the "" permitted explosives list."" When he sought to dispose of his output the mine-owners found that they could not use his explosives unless they had heen previously sent to Great Britain to be tested. Every one knows that if a box of explosives is sent to Great Britain to be tested it deteriorates, and has not the same chance as a box tested immediately after manufacture, and even then it has to run the risk of being turned down by some person anxious to keep the local commodity out of the market. Tn my opinion, the time has arrived for the establishment of a testing station in Australia. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) is full y seized with the necessity for it .",42
128,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"When we sent an expert to Great B r it a into inquire into this matter the ""war started, and the British Government commandeered his services.",43
129,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is true. So far as I know, all that is required is a gallery built sufficiently strong to show whether an explosive, when tested, gives off fire. The Government could (make a small charge to cover expenses, and could confine themslves to the testing operations, if they did not desire to undertake the manufacture. We use an enormous quantity of explosives in Australia, but there is no inducement held out for its manufacture here. own district this industry would have been a going concern today, if there had been proper means of testing; and it is owing to the absence of those means that the enterprise is a failure. Prior to the war explosives could be purchased at from 8d. to 9d. per l b . , whereas, today, they cost over double that, and, at the same time, are very difficult to obtain. often mines are without explosives, and work has to be stopped on that account. It will be seen that it is absolutely necessary to do somethingin the direction I have suggested, especially in view of the fact that a high duty has been placed on explosives, although, at the same time, we cannot manufacture them here. is only necessary, of course, to test samples of the explosives.",43
130,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Why do the facturers of explosives here.not have tpsting arrangements of their own ?,43
131,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I think the State Government insist that there should be some independent guarantee that the explosives used are absolutely safe, and a test by the manufacturer would not give that guarantee. There is one capable man 1 know of who could form a company to start operations tomorrow, if there was any prospect of success, and such a company would be formed at once but for the prevailing conditions.",43
132,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [5.39""J This is an important question, particularly in the district represented by .the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton) and myself; and I agree with him that the time has come when there should be a testing station established by the Cornimonwealth. At the present time the miners have to buy their own powder in considerable quantities, and, according to the Coal Mines Regulation Act of the State, only such explosives are authorized as appear on the permitted list of England. It might happen, though I do not say that it has happened, that an explosive on th© permitted list, which had been tested in England a long time ago, would be sent out here and used without a second test, or an inferior explosive sent bearing a superior brand. Under all the circumstances it would be infinitely better to have a testing station here, not only to insure quality and safety, but also to give In my some encouragement to local manufacture. At present a person desiring to manufacture explosives has to get a permit from the State autliority, and no matter how good that explosive may prove to be on analysis, it must be sent to England to be tested, there to come into conflict with the rings and combinations of British manufacturers. This question Very has been brought up in the House by the honourable member for Hunter and myself at different times throughout the history of this Parliament. I am sure that the erection of a testing station would not prove by any means a costly undertaking, and, in my opinion, it would pay its way if a small charge were It made for the service rendered.",43
133,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown," The rifles manufactured at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory are costing over £13 each at the present time, and the large sum on the Estimates is to provide 20,000. The rifles that were manufactured at the Factory, and were used overseas, were, taking them all round, excellent. It has heen contended in the House that the rifles turned out at Lithgow for the Avar were not serviceable, but I can assure honourable members that that contention is unfounded. For four years, in Egypt and Palestine, all my men used these rifles, and everybody knows that those men gave a good account of themselves. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) asked whether the rifles will take the mark 7 ammunition, and I have to inform him that they will. MrF OWLER - I do hot think that was the case with the earlier rifles.",43
134,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"The honout orable member is quite right; but it is case with the rifles we are turning out made in England. now. There was some difficulty overseas in changing from mark 6 to mark munition. The first rifles manufactured here would take mark 1 ammunition, but Sir the results were pot satisfactory.",44

139,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,What about the Light Horse equipment?,44
140,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"I do not know of any differentiation between the Light Horse equipment and any other. The rifles that are being sent by the Imperial Government are not necessarily now, but they lare serviceable, and they can be supplied to us at something like £6'7s. 6d. each. As I said before, they are not new rifles, 'but, from what I can gather, I believe that we could not get new rifles from the Imperial authorities or elsewhere overseas for less than we are now making them at the Lithgow Factory.",44
141,Mr LISTEB,Unknown,The rifles to be supplied from overseas are of the latest pattern?,44
142,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"Yea , they are good rifles, though not new. A certain number of long new barrels were required, and the second lot, at any rate, was turned at Lithgow at from 25s. to 30s. each, the as compared with 35s. for similar barrels",44

Further, the laboratory will be used for devising processes for manufacturing chemical and other products-suc h as poison gas, anti-gas composition, or new explosive composition-essentia l under war conditions, but not manufactured under normal economic conditions.""",44
146,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,What is there vent the provision of a testing under normal conditions in order mit of the local manufacture plosives ?,45
147,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,Unknown,"I do not know that there is any thing to prevent the establishment of such a station. The report continues"" The next step will be the organization and equipment of an inspection department. The main work of this department is the systematic examination and proof of war materiel for issue to forces, and, further, the proper custody and storage of all standards for manufacture of war materiel. It is on the inspection department that will fall the issue of all working, drawings, drawings of gauges, and the organization of inspection of factories, Government or private. The policy of the Department is to provide as funds permit for the erection and equipment of such additional shops an'd factories as are required to meet the peace demands of the Forces for war materiel, and its repair and upkeep. At the present time Australia possesses no establishment capable of making ammunition, high explosives, or fuses, nor is there any provision for filling ammunition with explosives or gas even if the several components were prociirable from outside establishments. These outside establishments, sucli as engineering shops or chemical factories, can only be brought to function in war if the Government possesses facilities for rapidly training masters and foremen, and is possessed of the necessary technical information in a form readily available, and which will make quite clear what is exactly wanted."" It is along the lines briefly set out above that the Department is creating a nucleus organization for dealing with the problem of munition supply. Without such an organization Australia must remain dependent for war materiel upon the maintenance of British control of the seas, and, in these circumstances, the description of our army as "" a Defence Force"" is a fallacy which deceives no one but ourselves. I desire to emphasize that point. put very clearly in this report that unless we can manufacture munitions it is futil e for us to train our men. It is futil e for us to have a Small Arms Factory where we can manufacture rifles if we cannot manufacture the ammunition for them'. In such circumstances all our efforts in the event of war would be absolutely futile.",45

If we could not get a supply of explosives reto pre- quired in connection with the coal minstation ing industry, what would be our position? to per- In the event of war we could not manuof ex- f a c t u r e explosives for such purposes unless we had a testing station.",45
149,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,Unknown,"Q u it e so. That should be one of the functions of the Commonwealth. We must manufacture everything that is requisite for an army in the field. If there are things which we cannot at present manufacture we cannot help it . But we should do our best to produce as speedily as possible all our requirements in this regard. Honourable members must realise that if we are to have a Defence Force, it is essential that, so far. as its requirements are concerned, we should be self-contained. We cannot say that the seas will be open to us in war time, and that we shall be able to obtain supplies from abroad. We must have big guns and supplies of ammunition for those guns. Honourable members who. have' had military experience know that a force without artillery has no chance whatever against a force with artillery. The force possessing big guns could shell the other side, which would have no means of retaliation. By the time that it got close enough to engage the opposing army otherwise than by artillery, its ranks would be decimated. When you are being shelled by an opposing force, and you want to advance, you must be able to shell the enemy's gun positions with the object of stopping them or keeping their fire down. If the enemy's artillery can put its guns wherever it pleases, and shell your advancing force, which has no artillery to retaliate, the position of that advancing force is absolutely hopeless.. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that we should manufacture munitions of war in Australia, and make ourselves as self-conI t is tained as possible in regard to army supplies. - ' I have here some detailed information with regard to general arsenal machinery and plant, which may be of interest to honourable members who do not realise what is involved in the creation of an arsenal and a big supoly depot.

I am opposed to not merely the f l , but to every of this expenditure. I am against every line of tliese defence estimates, and against every item contained in them. As a matter of fact, I am not in the least interested in these items at all. I intend to take up a few minutes in continuing from last night, as briefly as I can, my survey of the defence jjosition. The item before the Committee, and the two subsequent items, represent a proposed vote of £2,000,000 for the purposes of defence. I have distinctly stated before that I have no objection to votes for purposes of defence under ordinary circumstances. But these are not ordinary circumstanoes. This vote is not only for the maintenance of the existing system of defence; it is a proposal for the augmentation of our defence expenditure by millions of pounds per annum. Before I conclude, I shall have something to say in regard to the attitude of the so-called Economy party. In this matter there are only two things in view-eithe r peace or war. It has been said by the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) that whosoever states during this debate that the present is a period of peace, and that there will be no further war, is talking bosh and nonsense. i Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE - I did not say that. I did not use the word "" bosh.""",46

He said that this talk of peace was an absurdity, and that, in any case, anybody who spoke of there being no more war spoke nonsense. shall read only one statement to the CommitteeThere will be no more war. This great war has fulfilled its purpose. We have climbed out of the pit iuto the green pastures of perpetual peace. The peace that has come is a peace that will endure.",47
156,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,Who said that ?,47
157,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). The Assistant Minister says he is a liar. Leave it at that. What the Prime Minister said is not true. There is no peace. The war was not fought in order to bring about peace. We have not entered the green pastures. We have not entered upon a peace that will endure. We haye come out of one war to enter into another. have conquered a white race, 16,000 miles away in order to build up preparations against another enemy close to our shores. If we are to make preparations for war with another nation, which nation is it to be? The Assistant Minister for Defence told us that we have to protect the White Australia policy. He believes in that policy; he has always - believed in it. If we have to defend the White Australia policy we must defend it against some other people. The Prime Minister told us that, whosoever, in this Chamber or elsewhere, utters one word which may arouse the hostility of any particular nation, does, by that word, incite to the very evil aud danger he professes to deplore. The Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) has said that we are confronted with a menace to our White Australia unless we make the necessary defence preparations. He has said the very thing that his chief, the Prime Minister, has denounced. We are told that if we mention the name when seeking to discover our possible enemy, we are doing something injurious to our country, and we are asked to believe that, while this potential enemy has ears with which to hear our words, he is so blind as not to be .able to see what we are doing. We are told that we must prepare to fight against a possible enemy with armed forces, and that enemy is presumed to be Japan. It is useless to blink that fact. The militarists appeal to the public by saying that the White Australia policy must be defended, leaving it to be inferred that our potential enemy is Japan, and against her we have to prepare for the defence of our country. If that is so, we I should not blink the issue. Is there any possibility of Japan becoming our enemy ? Yes, or no? Some say yes; others say no. In the early part of the war, I distinctly pointed out the possibilities of Japan. I said that while she was an ally of Great Britain, and while Great Britain and the Allied Powers were fighting for their existence against the Germanic Empire, Japan was in a position to make a claim for compensation or concessions. It has been stated sub rosa that she did make claims. Whether she did or did not it is quite evident that from the beginning to the end of the war she kept her compact with the Allied Powers. Whatever chance she had of causing trouble was when Germany was We supreme, when victory appeared to be with our enemies, and when she could have stated her terms as a condition of the support she was rendering to the Allied Powers. It is evident that Japan could, with justice, have said that if she was good enough to protect our shores and convoy our troops, if she was good enough to be our ally, at least she was good enough for all the advantage which could be given to a nation or individual that was helping us at that juncture. could justly have said that if she was doing all those things she was at least good enough to be admitted as an inmate of the house in which we live.",47
158,Sir GRANVILL ERYKIE,Unknown,Would the orable imember have agreed to that?,48
159,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"No ; those were the grounds upon which she could have based her claims. Morally, she had the right to make those claims, and we could have had no logical answer to them.",48
160,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We have to admit that Japan "" played the game.""",48
161,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I admit that. I come to the existing situation. Germany has been defeated and the conditions have altered in Russia, she has been able to open up what is .practically a new Empire. She has been able to enter Siberia, and to control the whole area between Vladivostock and Lake Baikal, an imnnense territory rich in minerals, and timber, and intersected by great rivers. And if she can hold that country with armed forces she has an immense Empire, the development of which will require all her .energies for many years to come. If she cannot by armed forces maintain herself in eastern Siberia, which is in close proximity to Japan, and has a white population of less than 2,000,000 people, surely Australia is perfectly safe at a much greater distance. If , on the other hand, turning fro m the policy of armed force, she enters the sphere of peaceful economic penetration, even then, apart from the great natural resources of that country which has been the cradle of nations, she has a vast field for her energies for centuries ahead. If . by neither armed force nor peaceful penetration she can maintain herself in Siberia, if out of Soviet Russia there comes a mighty force that sweeps her out of the country, even then she will be no menace to Australia, for in eastern Siberia, at her own door, she will have a power that will gnaw like a rat at the very vitals of her civilization. Then, upon what grounds do honourable members say that J apan at this hour threatens, our civilization ? Whatever may have been her opportunities from 1914 to 1917, she did not take advantage of them. To-day, - having regard to her situation in Siberia, bearing in mind the trouble with which she is confronted in America, whosoever says that Japan is our enemy violates the sentiments of the Allied Powers, and uses She her as a bogy to aid in building up a military caste in oar own country. It is not those of us who go upon the public platform and state our views who do anything that is detrimental to the White hon- Australia; it is those men who, while repudiating our words, seek to utilize the funds of the people in building up dockyards and arsenals, under the pretence that they are seeking to protect us against an Asiatic Power, and who ask us to believe that that nation is so blind as not to see what we are doing to incite the fears and timidity of our people. There Now is either a real and potential enemy, or Since there is an imaginary one. If it is only an imaginary one!, how fearful it is that we should be exhausting the resources, substance, and industrial capacity of our people in preparing against nobody! If there is a real enemy, which country is it? It can be no country in Europe. That enemy cannot come from war-devastated Europe, bathed in blood, to which no peace has come, where destitution walks abroad, and where hunger and famine are eating into the very vitals of the people, Not from a white man's Europe does danger menace us. Even if it did, it could not threaten our White Australia, for although Australia were to be the victim in a war against a European Power it would still be white, because it would be conquered by a white race. The danger must come from an Asiatic race, and only can come fro m one, namely, Japan. We are asked to be silent, and yet, under the pretence of silence, they say, "" Beware of Japan,"" and they ask us to bleed ourselves of more millions in order to build up an immense military power against an imaginary enemy. They say, however, that the enemy is not imaginary, but real and actual. But when will the enemy come? To-morrow? Is there any man who will say that Japan, confronted^ with its problems in Northern China, with all the possibilities of development in Siberia, and with the troubles that threaten her in America, is the race that menaces us? The militarists say, "" Yes; it will be our turn tomorrow."" Then what will we do? debt of which they speak? They talk about it being merely sufficient for us to put armed men into the field. They do not seem to realise that behind - those armed men must stand the economic resources of the country. A f t long fight-be it a pugilistic encounter in which men are engaged for twenty or forty rounds, or be it a conflict tween nations for four or forty yearsthere must be a period of recuperation. Neither man nor nation has that i serve which will provide driving force equipment to forthwith re-enter the fray. They talk of the immense burden heaped upon the shoulders of this country today. What will happen to us if , in the mediate future, another great war should occur ? What would happen to us if upon the thousands and millions of our present war indebtedness we were burdened-hav ing been confronted with another terrific struggle for the preservation of our tence!-wit h millions and millions of ditional war debt ? All that would be lef for us to do would be to carry on for hundreds of years, paying interest, we should be ground down as slaves abject to our bondholders as though were the vassals of a conquering foreign power. What we have to consider is reduction of our enormous If it be true that out of Japan there is to come the enemy who will threaten our future , then o u r 'main object at moment should be, not so much to build up new armed forces-so bringing about an early exhaustion of our energies and - the squandering of our resources-as to turn our activities to the fields of industry. Por there alone can we recoup ourThis selves and r i d our country of its tremenministration dous load of war debt. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) himself pointed out that there can be no salvation for Australia unless it rids itself or its burden ductive debt. That statement""furnishes the crux of the whole problem. I am not troubled at this moment about the Government are going to spend this money, let them, spend it . We are already loaded with our hundreds of millions debt. Why stick at a few millions more? But how are these additional millions cut up ?

The Treasurer told us last night that this money, which we are now called upon to vote, was being transferred for the particular purposes mentioned from loan money into the revenue account. baneful and iniquitous system of admakes one shudder. And , as for the economy members in the corner opposite, they have not one word to say concerning this odious system of conductof unproing the affairs of the country.",49

165,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"No ; I said it was an odious system-althoug h I have availed or myself-of it-to borrow on the one hand in order to pay somebody else on the other. Incidentally, it is very convenient to be able to do this; it postpones the day of judgment. And that is what the Govern",49
166,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But we are not bor- rowing at all this year in the matter of unproductive our unproductive debt.,49
167,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Neve r m in d ; we are dealing with the fact that the Treasurer has to finance £100,000,000 this year.",50
168,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not quite, but that is near enough.",50
169,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Of course; what is a million ? Some £60,000,000 is going out, in one form and another, to the soldiers. The only possible hope for Australia is in the sweeping away of the unproductive load of debt. I have been reading in the papers that expenditure upon various civil Departments of this country has risen by about 50 per cent. I cannot help thinking about the newspapers themselves, and about their magnificent proprietaries. I cannot help recalling that they have raised the price of their daily papers by 50 per cent., and by at least 100 per cent, on Saturdays. As for the price of advertisements, they have gone up 120 per oent.; and even the prices charged for soldiers' memorial notices have risen in Uke proportion. But if I were to say to these great newspaper proprietors, "" Why have you raised your prices?"" they would answer, "" It is not due to red tape; it is not to be set down to waste in departmental expenditure ' ' for these gentlemen would not permit any waste in their business; they are so anxious to rake everything into their own pockets that they take mighty fine care not to keep wasteful servants. No ; they would explain the rise in the price of their commodities by pointing to the enormous increases in cost of materials-as a result of the war, of course-and in the scale of wages demanded by labour. What is true for them, as private individuals, however, is equally true of every Department of States and Commonwealth. Not along those lines can one hope to economize. But, here are these honourable gentlemen of the Country party, who came into this Chamber from among their simple r u r a l constituents. When I lay at home, sick, I read that a majority of honourable members in this Chamber were about to in crease their remuneration. I was delighted. I knew that the project would be carried to victory; and I knew that these honourable members in the Corner, although they were fighting the proposal most vigorously:-ther e never was such a band of heroes-whil e they went forward and forced the conflict, were fired with the sincere and honest belief, and with the holy joy of knowledge in their hearts, that they were bound to be defeated. How magnificent was their courage! See how they fought for these few thousands! And now rises a question involving millions. I want to see them defend the proposal to save those millions. Why should this country proceed to spend millions more upon its defence, after years of warfare, than before the war? Can any honourable member justify it? Honourable members to whom I am addressing myself do not reply. They are driven to ignominious silence. Will they support our proposition ? Or will they uphold the Government in piling up the defence expenditure of Australia by millions upon our pre-war undertakings?",50
170,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.31 to 8 p.m.,50
171,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"My remarks are being cut up and dislocated in a very bad way, as I understand I have but a few minutes longer. It has been suggested to me that I could have said 'what I have said on the general Defence Estimates, but I think that the appropriate occasion for making them is upon these Estimates upon which the Committee is now asked to give a vote, when the question is not one of maintaining the defence system as it was before the war, but one of in curring an expenditure far in excess of what previously existed, and for which there is no justification whatever. Here we have an opportunity to cut it down, not by a few thousand pounds, but by a couple of million pounds, and yet there are honourable members in this Chamber who claim to be neither abject followers of the Government nor their definite opponents, and who are pledged to a policy of economy, although all the time their party has been in existence they have done nothing but make protests about in finitesimal items of expenditure, and propose to do nothing where the Estimates could easily be curtailed by £2,000,000.",50
172,Mr STEWART,Unknown,We can j u s t if y all our actions since we have been here.,50
173,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,I have never known any one who has been in this House who has not been able to justify every action he has taken. I have done nothing that I could not justify.,50
174,Mr STEWART,Unknown,To your own satisfaction.,50
175,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Yes , and also to the satisfaction of those who hitherto have voted for me. The honourable member says that he can justify his actions. It would be far better for him to do so, rather than to give abject votes for the Government without one single word of explanation. On what grounds do honourable members of his party support this particular vote, upon which they have an opportunity of curtailing the expenditure of Australia by a couple of million pounds ? The least they can do is to voice their support of the Government's proposals. There is a newspaper in this country, which I shall quote, not because I always believe in what it save, but because it suits my book to do so. I know full well that the same journal, when an election crisis comes, will denounce and seek to drive out of publio life every man who voices the opinions it has supported prior to the election, and that it is its policv to denounce the Government, in between elections, and support it at election time - keep Father Jerger in Australia; but",50
176,Mr STEWART,Unknown,What is this mysterious paper?,51
177,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The paper that most men worship, and follow, when they think it convenient to do so. At any rate, this great daily newspaper, on the 4th November, 1919, made this affirmationIs Australia's danger greater than Germany was beaten? If I had made .use of these words, the statement would have been used against toe, but I quote it now, because ib has been said by a paper which no Victorian dare controvert. When I tell honourable members that this statement appeared in the Age, they will remain silent. However, this is what it says: Is Australia's danger greater than it was before Germany was beaten? If so, the appalling sacrifices of the war have been made by this generation in vain. It will be hard to convince the people that we need defences greater than those which sufficed to win "" the war to end war."" Yet we are told that no preparation is being made for the lean days in front of us. When we have a dead weight of in debtedness weighing us down into the slough of depression, our only hope is to curtail our expenditure wherever possible.",51
178,Mr STEWART,Unknown,Anste y quoting the Age reminds me of the devil quoting Scripture.,51
179,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"1 merely quote the Age because it voices my opinion, and because honourable members cannot denounce an opinion which they know must also be their own. I conclude this disconnected speech by taking the opportunity of saying two things. Last night the Minister representing the Minister for Defence interpolated a remark about a gentleman named Jerger. It had nothing to do with the subject under discussion, and it had no application to myself, but I know the purpose for which it was made. My family connexions were English before any German K in g sat upon the throne of Britain , and whatever may have been the merits or demerits of this Father Jerger, I have no desire to discuss him or the question of Catholics versus nonCatholics, or matters concerning any man's religion or nationality; b ut I do desire to discuss an odious law in its application to men of the working class of British origin. Great as is the power of the Church of Rome, with its ramifications throughout Australia, apparently it was not sufficient or powerful enough to there are other gentlemen who can be kept here. While Father Jerger was being exported, Mr Hirschfeld could sun himself on the sands of Coogee. He was a man who came here in full-blown manhood. He was a supporter of the German Empire, and he did before not confine himself to words only, but his actions were inimical to the interests of this country. What influence had he behind him ? He has no church to keep him here. Then what order of black masonry of wealth enables him to silence justice and the .Administration of this country ? The other day the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) mentioned the case of another German named Herz, who, apparently, is not a member of the Catholic Church, but yet is able so to direct influences here as to silence the Administration and justice, and maintain himself here. Perhaps, later on, we shall be able to have some light thrown upon the merits of these men.",51
180,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The honourable member has exhausted his time.,51
181,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballarat) [ 8 . 9 ] - I had thought that after, the speech of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey) one of the Country party would have justified what I anticipate will be their vote upon this expenditure. It amazes me to think that any member of the party whose chief plank is a platform of economy can be found voting for in creased expenditure on military and naval establishments after our experience of the war, and I cannot comprehend what their answer will be when their constituents ask for an explanation of their support of this increased expenditure.",51
182,Mr STEWAHT,Unknown,We will attend to all that.,52
183,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I hope you will . You ""will find it a difficult task. I have just returned from an election campaign where a farmers' candidate had the pleasure of paying £ 5 0 into the Consolidated Revenue, and in that campaign on every platform I spoke against the creation of a military class in this country. We were told that the war was to end wars, and was to make Democracy safe, and establish peace for all time; that if we only conquered Germany, as explained by the article fro m the Age quoted by the honourable member for Bourke, Australia would be in a much safer position. Well, Germany has been conquered; yet I believe that in a few years' time it will be victorious; at least, it will not be obliged to pay for military and naval establishments. On the hand, those who went to the war had one set purpose, and that was to defeat the Prussian Junkers. They littl e thought that in defeating the military caste of Germany they were creating a military class in Australia. There would not be many Australians anxious to go away again if they thought that their doing so would be merely for the purpose of adding to the millitary fetters on the people of this country. What this Government sought but failed to do by conscription, it is now seeking to do by means of this Budget. By means of conscription it sought to impose militarism on the people, and any one who dared to say a word against conscription was charged with being a pro-German, or with being disloyal to the British Empire.",52
184,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,And any one who said a word in favour of it was charged with being an anti-Labourite.,52
185,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"If he were with being an anti-Australian it would have been truth , but, as a matter of any one who said a word in favour of conscription was an anti-Labourite. cannot understand how men who at one time professed to be Labourites could support a proposal for conscription. If they had seen something of the war they would not have been so anxious to send any one to fight. What would have been the national debt of Australia if the people had accepted conscription ? Our burden is bad enough as it is, but we would have been faced with financial ruin. Had members on the benches opposite had their way they would have bled Australia white of its manhood. They proposed to send away 16,000 men per month. There would have been hardly a young man left in the country. Thank God they failed at both their referendums to conscript the manhood of this country. But, although they failed then to create - a military class, this Budget will _ do it. I shall vote on every occasion against increased expenditure on military and naval items. It is unnecessary to have military training. If the war proved anything it proved that young Australians, many of whom had not previously known one end of a rifle from another, were after training for a month or two equal to, if not superior to, any other troops engaged in the fighting.",52
186,Mr STEWART,Unknown,Surely the honourable member is not arguing that an untrained other Australian is better than a trained Australian ?,52
187,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I am arguing that we are wasting the lives of our boys by training them: to turn to the righ t and turn to the left. I have been where the honourable member has not been, and no one can deny that when they are marching up the lines of communication the officers do not care a rap whether the men are in step or out of step. All they care about is that the men get up to the front the best way they can. The faul t of the British A r m y was that they were splendid on parade. The very life was driven out of them by continuous drilling, with being taught how to click their heels together, and salute. Our lads could not do that so well as the soldiers in other armies, but they could do the real thing much better in the fighting in the trenches.",52
188,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,The Tammies charged did some pretty good work! .,52
189,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"No army could have fact, put up a better fight in 1914 than the regular British A r m y ; nobody will deny I that for one moment, in view of the trials they had to undergo.",52
190,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"And they were the most trained men. Mr MoGRATH - They were men who were well f e d ; but, unfortunately, later on, England had to go into the slums of the Old World for recruits. It was because of the fine physical condition of the B ri tish men in the early stages that they did so well; it was not simply because they had been taught to salute and click their heels together. Our boys themselves demonstrated the truth of that view again and again; they proved that without training they could acquit themselves against the best troops in the world; and they can do it again if Australia is ever pressed. When I hear a proposition to take lads for ten weeks at a time, and throw them into a military camp for 3s. or 4s. a day",52
191,Mr FENTON,Unknown,They will not go.,53
192,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"They will not go; make no mistake, the youth of this country will not go, for ten weeks a year, into a camp for three and four shillings a day.",53
193,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,The member ought to be ashamed of himself for making such a suggestion 1,53
194,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I guarantee that if I can prevent youths from going, I shall do so. I will do anything I can to prevent them being taken away for ten weeks in one year. Many of the men affected are married, and I wonder how their wives and families are going to live during that time. Apart from the matter of pay, it is my belief that preparations for war never prevented war. The whole reading of historv teaches us that every nation that is prepared for war has-a war brought about; the more preparations are made for war, the greater certainty there is of another war. If Germany and France had not been led by the junkers of both countries, this war would never have occurred. And , then, as soon as the war is over, the Commonwealth Government bring out Lord Jellicoe and Sir William Birdwood, with a view to gigantic preparations in the Militar y Force and the Navy. As the honourable member for 1 Bourke (Mr Anstey) pointed out, there will be no war here for the next twenty years. Honourable members forget that there is another class arising in - this country who will have a say as to war. That class will not allow politicians to talk, as in the past, about the abolition of secret diplomacy, and then, as soon as war is over, resort to it , for it is that method of diplomacy that brings about war. Only the other day the leader of trade Unionism in England said to Mr Llovd George, "" At your peril, touch the Russian workmen, and you will have to deal with the workmen of the .United ""Kingdom."" The same spirit that prevented the capitalistic classes of England going to war with Soviet Russia will prevent any other war in this world. In Australia many of the military class, who have pretty good comfortable jobs, desire another war. These men took care that they did not place their lives in jeopardy, and did not make any financial sacrifices because of the war; they know, as has often been said"", that war means promotion, and, therefore,, they wish to create a military caste or class here. As an - Australian, I trust that Australia will mind her own business, for if she does not seek to steal the oil of somebody else, or to attain some commercial supremacy, the chances are that our boys honourable will never have to undergo another war. I am going to vote to-night, and I shall vote when the Defence Estimates are before us, to reduce expenditure down to that of pre-war days. There is no necessity for building new battleships and creating an A r m y of 130,000, with five divisions, in a young country like this. We ought not to fill the minds of our children with hatred of th© people of other countries; it is a most cruel thing to instil such an idea into the minds of young people; and if we do it we shall certainly bring about another war.",53
195,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do you realise that if we reduce the Estimates to their pre-war dimensions we must have very much less efficiency than in those days?,53
196,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"The Government have nothing to thank themselves for in connection with what was done in pre-war days, so far as concerns the war itself. There was not much efficiency then, I admit, for there were not many on the permanent staff of much use. The best men we have had in the Australian Imperial Force were volunteers, and any efficiency was not created by the staff that existed previously. if we look up the records of some of the members of that staff, we find names of those who are figuring largely today as so-called military leaders, but they were, in some cases, returned from the war because their services were no longer required. Now it is proposed to create another large permanent staff. Duntroon is being used to turn out lads who are superseding the men now on the instructional staff, men who did good work at the war. Sergeant-majors, who, because they did not belong to a certain class, could not get commissions, had to go abroad to earn them on the field. When they return as captains and majors they are superseded and reduced to their old rank of sergeant-major. As I say, hoys are being turned out at Duntroon and sent into the instructional schools or dril l halls with the rank of lieutenant, and many men who won their spurs as majors abroad have to salute them. what is going on today, and it will in evitably grow if we vote this largely-increased expenditure. I hope that honourable members who came here mouthing economy will take advantage of the opportunity now presented to them. They can demonstrate their f a it h in the principles they espoused on the public platform. There is no fear that the efficiency of Australia to defend herself will he impaired if this expenditure is reduced. As Australians have defended themselves in the past without any training, so they will in the future. We at least know that the one enemy we were told to guard against, namely, Germany, lies crippled today, and cannot, for twenty or thirty years, be a military nation. I am hopeful that the German workmen will abide by the terms of the Peace Treaty. They ought to be thankf u l for those terms, for they mean that their A i m y and Navy are done away with. Germany will be the gainer by that step. While we are piling up taxation to in crease our A r m y and Navy, Germany has nothing to fear, for no nation will attack her. She will not be seeking for new markets abroad, and neither she nor Australia need fear the Russian workmen. On the Estimates, and on the Defence Bill to be introduced, we shall have fur ther opportunities to discuss these matters. No doubt the Bill will contain provision for the proposed ten weeks' training, and then we shall see whether the youth of this country is to be conscripted against their will.",53
197,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [8.27] Honourable members opposite are ignoring the very strong feeling in the country in regard to the huge expenditure on military and naval defence; but they will find out before many days are over, however, that the people will refuse to sanction it . The same cry is being raised in every country. Last night, in my humble way, I submitted a set of figures which were replied to cavalierly by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), who said that the Allied peoples had discovered that Germany was hiding a great number of rifles, and this, in the right honourable gentleman's opinion, proves that Germany is not, as Mr Lloyd George said in the House of Commons she was, ""shattered, down and o u t , "" with a non-existent army and her navy at the bottom of the sea. If honourable members will That is read the discussion on the A r m y and Navy Estimates in the House of Commons they will see what statesmen and thinkers are doing in regard to defence expenditure.

Mr Maclean in the same speech saysDo honourable and right honourable members realise that the great body ot workers of this eouivtTv have a horrible detestation of war, and that we are up against any inflated armaments, and against the voting of more money for the prosecution of slaughter either in the Near, the Far, or the Middle Bast? They must realise that amongst the working people of this country there is a desire to put an end to the military system, not only abroad, but in our own country. That and other speeches of the same tone were delivered on. a similar occasion to this.",54

205,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,I would rather be one of that type than one of your type.,55
206,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am glad I have roused the honourable member to something like a l it t l e feeling. The men from whose speeches I have quoted are just as good as he is, and perhaps know more about the position of that part of the Empire than he does. Major-General Sir John Davidson, speaking in the House of Commons, said that in 1919 provision was made for an expenditure of £405,000,000; that in 1920, that expenditure was cut down to £125,000,000, and that there was a continuous clamour to reduce it to a normal year's expenditure of £60,000,000. Brigadier-General Cockerill, speaking in the House of Commons on the 22nd March last, said that the number of combatants before the war - infantry , artillery, engineers, cavalry - was 150,000, and that today provision was being made for 170,000. It is well known that before the war Great B r it a in had only about 150,000 trained troops. It s A r m y of nearly 5,000,000 strong was built up in a few years, which shows that it does not take long to convert a civilian into a well-trained soldier. If that was possible in Great Britain , then I may say, without offence to the Old Country, that it would be a much easier task in Australia. The Australian is a man of vast initiative, and no people could more quickly make themselves ready to defend their country than could the people of the Commonwealth. The Government are piling up a vast out thatexpenditure on the A r m y and Navy, and this after a war which we were told was was waged to end all war and to destroy mili tarism. When honourable members oppoby site stood on the recruiting platforms of the country, they said, "" We are out to fight German militarism."" Yet tp-day we find them prepared to fasten people of Australia an enormous naval and military expenditure. An already throw overladen people are clamouring for relustre. lief, and their clamouring will probably take, very soon, a more definite shape. tude As I said just now, with due deliberation, party they will refuse to obey the orders given tion. in connection with a lot of the compulsory military training which the Governthird ment desire to bring about. Although ments this is one of the richest countries in the world, it is so hard - for thousands of people here to live that they are goiDg to refuse any longer to bear the burdens of the rich man. Taxation is passed on to them by the rich. Will the rich bear the cost of this heavy expenditure ? No ! It will be passed on to the rank and file, and the workers and their wives and children aTe going to refuse to be squeezed any longer. They have gone through enough of recent years.",55
207,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,What would have been their position had Germany won?,55
208,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Would it not be better for the honourable member to make a statement of his own views? The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) referred just now to Japan. In that country today there is and a strong feeling against the military system- a feeling that, after the recent election on a limited franchise, is growing every day. I am going to make a quotation from the New York Times of l l t h July last, in which there appears a message from the Associated Press in regard to the position in Tokio. In this article references are made to speeches delivered in the Japanese Diet by men who were objecting, as the Labour party of Australia are objecting today, to excessive naval and military expenditure. There is such a thing as a Democracy in Japan at the present time, and it is going to in sist, upon enjoying rights which are at present the privilege of the wealthy.

These were the words of a statesman of Japan, who warned his fellow countrymen that they must desist from their m i l i - honourable member for Bourke. taristic and Imperialistic system if they wished the world to trust their country. He was followed - by a young and eminent professor of the Japanese U n i versity, who spoke in a similar strain. It is stated in this Associated Press message that never has there been such political turmoil in Japan as in recent times, owing firstly to the franchise having beeu denied the great bulk of the people, ancl secondly because of opposition to the military class in power. Very strong views are being expressed in practically every Parliament of the world in opposition to excessive m i l i tarism and increased naval ancl military expenditure. On every hand we hear it said that a halt must be called, and that excessive naval and military expenditure such as we have before us to-night must be denounced. I shall do what I can to cut down these Estimates. that the vote will be against us, but I hope the division list will be published far and wide, so that the people will know that the Labour party, at all events, is trying to relieve them of the cursed military caste by which this country is being governed at the present time.",55
209,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"Oorio) [ 8 . 4 0 ] - I should not have addressed myself to the consideration of the Estimates to-night but for certain observations made by honourable members opposite. I feel, however, that I ought to express my own view, which I believe is the view generally held by the people of Australia. I was surprised and amused by the remarks made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr An stey), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), in view of the fact that they were, and are still, members of a party which was responsible for the introduction of the M i l i - was. tary Defence Bill , and took a very great deal of credit for having passed it .",56

Even military officers to whom reference has been made by honourable members opposite would not desire anything of the kind.

I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Ballarat denouncing the policy of conscription, remembering as I did that he, with others, stood side by side with the Right Honourable Andrew Fisher, and cheered to the echo the statement made in his own city of Ballarat as to what Australia was going to do in the Great War.",56

218,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,It is just a question of what her part was.,56
219,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"I knew what my part .was; I do not know whether the honourable member recognised what his part The Naval and M i l it a r y expenditure that the Government propose to in cur represents the very safest form of not insurance that we could adopt. Reference has been made by honourable members opposite to the unpreparedness of Great B r it a in when war broke out. We have only to take back our minds a decade - to the time when, in the House of mons, as well as throughout Great B r i tain, there was a strong agitation for a and a horror. reduction of armaments. It is very significant that the very people who are so strongly advocating the reduction armaments are those who were opposed to Great Britain doing anything during the war. H a d the advice which they gave been followed, had Great Britain ten years ago reduced her armaments, should not be in our present happy posiourselves tion. There would have been a consideradopt able decrease in the expenditure on the British Navy, and we would have weakother ened our main bulwark of defence. We are thankful that those people, although possibly their intentions were of the best, did not have their way, and that, instead, naval and military expenditure was in curred which made it possible for Great Britain to play a great part in preserving the Empire intact, and. with the assistbelieved ance of her Allies, bringing the war to a victorious conclusion. Sarcastic reference has been made by members of the Opposimanhood tion to the Corner party and their economy policy. The truest economy in getting a pound's worth of value for every pound expended.",56
220,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"We do not get that from naval and military expenditure. Mr LISTEB , - I should like to see present vote increased, because many men employed in the Navy and Defence Departments are receiving a wage I consider inadequate. I refer particularly to permanent employees in the Garrison Artillery, the Engineers, and the Naval Forces. I am sure that no honourable member opposite will dissent from that view.",57

I canwise not speak for the whole of my colleagues, but I can speak for myself. Honourable League of Nations. members opposite have dwelt at length Comupon the horrors of war. I do not think - any of us will dispute that war is a crime",57
224,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"He a r , hear !",57
225,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Does the Assistant of Minister say that war is a crime?,57
226,Sir GRANVILLE RYBIE,Unknown,Of course it is.,57
227,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite suggest that the correct policy is we to spend no money on defence, to trust to the mercy of the world, and the ideal outlined in the League of Nations, regardless of whether or not nations adopt it . That is a policy to which I cannot subscribe. Every one of us knows that many foolish and absurd statements were made in connection with the late war. I refer particularly to the - oft-repeated phrase that we were engaged in a war to end war. I believe that many of those who used that phrase. honestly in it then; unfortunately, I do not think many people believe in it today. During the war we saw the flower of our march through the streets, and bid us farewell at the ship's side. Many is of them, alas, never to return. Many homes are saddened today by the losses sustained during the war. There is not one honourable member who would care to go through another such war.

There is no better plank in the platform the of any Australian political party. The consideration before us is not what we would like to do but what are the other that nations of the world doing? I think I can safely speak for the whole of the organized farmers of Australia when I say that, if the ideals of the League of Nations were accepted by the other nations of the world, Australia should gladly in accept them.

I do not; and before the whole of the Estimates are passed I shall probably be found voting against some items. Rut I believe that certain defence precautions are absolutely necesmittee sary, and I am convinced that some honreading orable members opposite in their hearts believe the same thing.  [8.55] - If any justification were quired by the Country party for cutting down this vote it was supplied by the speech of the honourable member for they Wimmera (Mr Stewart). In effect, the plank of the party which the honourable member read, means that the defence expenditure should be the lowest posmade sible compatible with national safety.",58

In his speech last night, the Assistant Minister for tralia. Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) did tell us what the menace to Australia is. Instead of giving the information which the Committee desired, he cunningly cupied most of his time in dealing with a speech which I made about ten years ago.",58
233,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the honourable member does not go easy I shall have to rake up his Wagga speech 'during the election.  Treasurer stated during the elections, "" Alone I built the Navy.""",58
234,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member said that he did.  the Labour party was creating the Austhe tralian Navy the right honourable gentlefacts man referred to it as "" a tin-pot affair,'' but during the last election he claimed that he had built it .",58
235,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Did not the honourable member claim at Wagga, during election, that he had built the Navy?  to was most emphatic in saying was that by whoever else created the Australian Navy, the right honourable gentleman did not. If I were to follow the example of the Assistant Minister, and dig into ancient history, I could give the Coman evening's entertainment by the observations of the Treasurer about the River class of destroyers. The honourable member for Wimmera that the members of the Country reparty were prepared to shoulder its responsibility in regard to this vote, but the defence plank of the platform to which are pledged provides that the defence expenditure should be the lowest possible compatible with national safety in the light of international developments. He no effort to ascertain from the Government the latest international deand the menace that throws upon this Parliament the onus of increasing its pre-war defence expenditure. Honourable members in the corner cannot vote for this expenditure unless they satisfied that the international developments justify them in so doing. It was all very well for the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) to say that - in urging the increase of this vote he spoke for the whole of the people of Ausnot Mr MAXWELL - He did not say that.  - not say that 'the honourable member may ocnotbave heard enough in his electorate to lead him to the belief that the people desired such an increase; but his electorate is not the whole of Australia. If I am able to gauge the opinionof the people, they are opposed to this policy of last doubling the pre-war expenditure for naval and military purposes. The Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) said this afternoon that it meant an expenditure of £3,200,000. I have gone carefully through the Budgetpapers, and have taken out a series of which, when aggregated, prove that Minister under-estimated the actual by more than half. I call the attention of the Treasurer, and of the Assistant Minister for Defence, as well as of honourable members generally, to the following items contained in the - Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure:-Pag e "" Military-no t including war services,""' £1,550,000 ; page 343, "" Military-addi tions, new works, buildings, & c , "" £1,302,153 ; page 328, "" W a r services payable out of revenue-tota l under control of Department of Defence-Military, "" £1,547,924. These three items make a grand total of £4,400,077. On page 369 there will be found still another item, under the heading, "" Estimates of Expenditure out of Loan Fund for worksDepartment of Defence - M i l it a r £328,204. Thus, the grand total becomes £4,728,281. Then there should be added to that the amount proposed in connection with Naval and A i r Force expenditure.",58
236,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The honourable member is going over the whole of the expenditure upon defence.  .quibbling. The Committee is dealing with one item; but I want to show that, taking the whole of the items which I have indicated, and adding the Naval and A i r Force expenditure, the total becomes more than £8,220,000-whic h is double the pre-war expenditure.",59
237,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That total is sheer nonsense.  figures are compiled from items which I have quoted; I have given the actual pages. I am quite prepared to believe, of course, that since the Treasurer's officers were largely responsible for framing the Estimates, the Treasurer himself does not know these things.",59
238,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Insulting , as usual; the honourable member cannot help it . As I told him. last night, "" It is the nature of the beast.""  want to insult the Treasurer; but I am telling hi m what is in the pages of his own Budget documents.",59
239,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The figures do not show any such thing.  the Treasurer is free to examine them for himself, and to show me where I am wrong. When the Assistant Minister for Defence stated, earlier in the present sitting, that defence expenditure involved a matter of £3,200,000, he was underestimating-consciousl y or - unconsciously. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has stated that he is prepared to take the responsibility for voting acceptance of these Estimates. Is he still 158, prepared to take the responsibility of making our vote double what it was in pre-war days ? I do not know one person among my constituents, or elsewhere, whom I have met during the past six months, who is prepared to agree that now, after the completion of a war which was to end wars, we should double our pre-war expenditure.",59
240,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Defenc e is to cost this year £7,101,000 .  y , "" Treasurer has now got up to £7,000,000 ; that is very different from what the Assistant Minister for Defence told us.",59
241,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"It is not at all different.  Minister said the total vote was £3,200,000.",59
242,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"That is the military vote. The honourable member forgets the Navy and the A i r Force. The total military vote is £3,200,000 . We are now dealing with the Military Estimates.  when it is' said that our total defence obligations amount to only £3,200,000 ",59
243,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Does the honourable member still suggest, in the face of what the Minister has just pointed out, that the Minister made any such statement at all?  said that, consciously or unconsciously, the Minister did say so; he left a false impression on the minds of honourable members.",59
244,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"In your own mind, perhaps. <  satisfied that the honourable member has not studied the Estimates, and that he will vote upon this matter, as on everything else-in the dark. He knows he has a duty to perform, and that that is to keep the Government in power. I merely desire to eradicate from the minds of honourable members the false impression that the total vote for defence purposes is £3,200,000, seeing that, as a matter of fact, it is more than £8,000,000.",59
245,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is not.  . and I will leave it at that. I have picked out the items, and have cited them one in by one; and if the Treasurer can make the total any different from that which have compiled, he is welcome to try . repeat, that the aggregate is more than £8,220,000. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - That is rubbish.  the Treasurer want me to quote the lines, page by page, again? Every honourable member who votes for the particular item under discussion must realise that he w i l be voting to double Australia's pre-war expenditure. I remarked, last nightj it was not fair to the people to saddle them with this enormous increase. Assistant Minister for Defence said that we must not let it go for t h that this had been fought in vain. I repeat, that it will go for th that the. war was in vain if the .best we have to tell k it h and k in of those who fought and is that they must be prepared some day, days. sooner or later, to make still greater sacrifices. We cannot say that the war was not fought in vain when we have no better necessary ? prospect ahead than this enormously enhanced Defence expenditure. The Treago surer said, in the course of speech, that Australia played a greater part in the war than had any other pormember tion of the Empire. Honourable on this side were saying the same thing during the conscription campaigns, and then we were called disloyalists Germans. Two years after the war has ended the Treasurer says that everything we said is true. All honour to Australia that it should be true! But we should able to offer to the people who made the sacrifices, and to the men who actually fought, something better than to threaten to burden them with double Australia's pre-war expenditure. It is all a sham and a fraud.",59
246,Sir GRANVILLE RYKIE,Unknown,"The honourable member wants us to tell those who lost their sons that, now we are going to abandon Australia to the first foreign Power which cares to come along and take it .  want the Minister to tell us where are these dark forces which are threatening this country. When I asked him last night, he said, mysteriously, "" One cannot say what one thinks and feels""; and he continued that I ought to be able to imagine where these secret forces were located. Well, I cannot imagine the I locality. I do not think the danger is I real. It merely furnishes an excuse for the heaping up of further warlike expenditure.",60
247,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"The honourable member says the Country party should not vote for this amount. What amount does he consider would be adequate?  l should be sufficient to satisfy the Country party, at any rate, if the item were cut that down to the pre-war basis.",60
248,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"On the basis of The the decreased value of the sovereign, the amount would have to be double the pre-war war total to be, in fact, equal to it .  fought thing, even from the Government standthe point, would be to cut down the proposed f e l l expenditure to what it was in pre-war",60
249,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Then the honourable member admits that some precautions are  quite that far , if it is not possible his Budget to get all - I want.",60
250,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Will the honourable point out one item in these Estimembers mates which is unnecessary?  item which I have quoted to-night is in and proexcess of what it should be. Upon a motion for the formal adjournment of the House this afternoon, honourable members on this side asked that same provision should be made in regard be to the fulfilment of the promise of the Prime Minister during the election campaign that the farmers would be paid 5s. per bushel at railway sidings. If the Government were to cut down this item by one-fourth there would be more than sufficient saved to pay interest on the sum necessary to make good that promise - But the Government do not propose to cut down the amount by one penny. Country members were sent into this House' pledged to economy. A re they prepared to take the word of the Assistant Minister that the expenditure will be £3,200,000, when it is really going to be more than £8,000,000 ?",60
251,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"The honourable member is not suggesting that we are about to pass a proposed vote cf £8,000,000 now?  able members are about to put - through a very big lump of it straight away, and they are committing themselves acquiescence in the expenditure of the whole of the £8,000,000.",60
252,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"The honourable member eannot say that we are violating our platform .  the honourable member to stand to his pledge; it is no business of mine. - if I were in his shoes, I would not like to be called upon by my constituents to explain my actions. If I had come into this House pledged, as is the honourable member, to grant to the Government only the lowest possible l i m it of funds compatible with national safety, I would feel in a hopeless position. I would not like to face the task of explaining to my constituents why I had voted to double Australia's pre-war expenditure. When the Prime Minister returned from the Peace Conference we were told what excellent work he had done. were going to be granted a huge sum by way of indemnity. I think we were to get it this month, and that it was to amount to some £20.000,000. not hear a word about it now. has become of the German indemnity ? We are told that the securing of our share was one of the great triumphs of the Prime Minister.",61
253,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Why , they they would send it out to Australia, but you would not have it . "" No annexation, no indemnity,"" was your cry.  mark ig quite characteristic of the Treasurer. I know that right through the last election he went about saying that our policy was "" No indemnities,"" omitting but one word. Our platform was "" No penal indemnities."" I am only concerned about the indemnity in showing how unreliable the statements were when we were told of the great work of the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference. When we come to reflect on the great work which we are told was done by the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference, and upon the fact that the great indemnity which Australia was to get has vanished into thin air, we are rather inclined to doubt that the right honourable gentleman was something that Australia should be proud of, or that he stood out at Versailles as the one great figure among the representatives of the nations of the world. Every time the Treasurer is to asked for money, he cannot find it ; he does not see how it can be got. Even this afternoon, when asked that the farmers should get 5s. per bushel in cash, he said, "" Where is the money to come from?"" He does not say to the heads of the Defence Department, "" Where are we to get this £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? "" But, In conclusion, I have only to say to members of the Corner party, in all kindness, that it would be fair to cut down this expenditure by an amount equivalent to the interest on whatever sum would be necessary to redeem the promise made bo the farmers by the Prime Minister at Bendigo that they would get 5s. per bushel for their wheat at the railway siding. But , as no one in the Farmers' party proposes to do anything, I hope that they will realise their difficulties whenthey have to explain to their constituents the attitude they have taken up We on this matter.",61
254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaTreasurer) [9.19] - I cannot allow this pernicious stuff to go without telling the We do Committee the facts. The honourable What member has included items of expenditure which were incurred last year, but which have to be paid for this year, and which, ordinarily, would have been paid out of loan funds, but are now being paid out said of revenue. In that way he makes a total of over £8,000,000, whereas the Defence Estimates for this year total £7,101,000 for Navy, A i r and Land Forces; no more and no less.  the paees I have mentioned?",61
255,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I would be glad if the honourable member would hand them to me so that I could check them. The vote for 1913-14 was nearly £5,000,000. To-day it . is £7,000,000. Where, then, has it doubled ? Is it not a pity that we cannot get an accurate statement from honourable members opposite? The one honourable member who has proved the case for the moderation of this item is the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who quoted the last military vote at Home, which was £125.000,000.",61
256,Mr FENTCN,Unknown,"I also quoted the fact that it was about to be reduced to £60,000,000.",61
257,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member was correct in stating that the British military expenditure was £125,000,000, to which figure it had been reduced from £400,000,000. our population is just one-ninth that of Great Britain , our quota of expenditure on the same basis would be about £14,000,000 for land forces only.",61
258,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The British expenditure is coming down, but ours is going up.",62
259,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What a statement for the honourable member to make! If our expenditure were anything like last year's Imperial expenditure, it would be about eix or seven times the anjount provided. What good does it do to the lionorable member to distort the figures? May I suggest that the item upon which we are asked to vote is not £3,000,000? Every honourable member opposite who has spoken has declared his intention to say what he has said all over again when we are considering the votes on the main Estimates, and why the question of the general defence of Australia should be debated on tthese Works Estimates, I do not know. We have not done very much work this week, and I suggest that we should now proceed to a vote upon this matter. Of course, I know that these items are important, but the proper occasion on which to discuss the general question of the defence of Australia is when we deal with the main Estimates.",62
260,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman will then be one of the first to say that we have already passed the main items of expenditure.,62
261,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall not say so. I asked the Committee to deal with these Estimates speedily, so that we could begin the public works for which they make provision. The item before the Committee is not £3,000,000, but £1,300,000 for works, and I ask honourable members to leave the general question alone now and take a vote so that we may get on with these works,",62
262,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [9.25]' - The right honourable gentleman has doubted the accuracy , of the figures given by the  Moloney), who gave chapter and verse to indicate where they could be found in the Estimates. For the benefit of honourable members. I shall repeat them. When the honourable member was speaking, the M in ister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) claimed that hn had included expenditure upon Expeditionary Forces £700,000.",62
263,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Yes , upon ports. As Mr TUDOR - The honourable member deliberately omitted these figures, and he did not include the Navy items of £356,000 for Miscellaneous, and £10,000 for trading vessels. The three items, Transport Services, Miscellaneous, and Trading Vessels represent £1,066,000, which he omitted from his calculations. Apar t from that expenditure the total provision on these Estimates for military, naval and air defence is over £8,000,000. On page 158 of the Estimates the total military expenditure, not including war services, is £1,550,000. On page 343 the total' expenditure on additions, new works and buildings for the Defence Department is £1,302,153. On page 369 there is a total of £318,204 for expenditure from loan funds for Defence works. On page 328 is an item of £1,547,924 representing W a r services payable out of revenue. These items of military defence amount to £4,718,281. Then we turn to the Navy. On page 195 of the Estimates we find that the total expenditure on the Navy, not including war services, is £2,279,238. On page 344 we find an item of £313,214 for additions, new works, buildings, & c , for the Navy Department. On page 370 the expenditure out of loan funds for works for the Navy is set down as £302,100. That gives a total of £2,849,000 for naval expenditure, apart from the £1,066,000 to which I have just referred. On page 345 we find an item of £294,000 for new works for military a i r services, and on page 196 the sum of £305,833 is set down for air services, generally, giving a total of £590,000 for this branch of defence. The grand total of expenditure under these headings is thus £8,222,000, apart from the £1,066,000 which I have just mentioned, and which would increase the total to £9,288,866, as set ou t in the Estimates introduced by the Treasurer.",62
264,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,ParramattaTreasurer) [9.28] - Her e is the explanation.,62
265,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Were the figures given right or wrong?,62
266,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"They were right, but entirely wrong in the application made. Take the item of £1,190,000, appearing on page 327 of the Estimates, which the honourable member has included in his calculations. It has nothing whatever to do with the expenditure on defence for this year, but is in for the transpayment of expenditure incurred last year.",62

277,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Of £1,500,000.",64
278,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I am not talking about the £1,500,000, but about the statement made by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook)-becaus e there happened to be included an item of expenditure on the graves of dead soldiers.",64
279,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Hume mentioned' the item of £1,500,000.",64
280,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) has now come into the scuffle, although I find it hard enough to handle one man a.t a time. The Treasurer was not fair, even to himself, when he imputed base motives to the honourable member for Hume, simply because the latter had complied with the request for details. Neither th© honourable member for Hume nor anybody else objects to that particular item of expenditure. What I oppose is not expenditure on our Expeditionary Forces, or in connection with our dead soldiers.",64
281,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Hear , hear! commend the honourable member for that. His colleagues are not game to do what he is doing.",64
282,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"There the Treasurer goes again! In any case, whatever may be the diversities of opinion between the Treasurer and my colleagues, he and I can at least say that we stand on a most fraternal basis. I am objecting to the items before us, just as I objected to the £1,300,000, not because they are for the maintenance of any existing form of defence, but because, under various pleas, additional expenditure is proposed at the very hour in the history of our country when the Treasurer says it is in a critical position. I do not oppose any expenditure which goes to the men-of-war's men and soldiers of the country; and I have said so repeatedly; but there is a conHe stant switching away from that standpoint.",64
283,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable - member's position is ' perfectly clear and straightf orwar d.,64
284,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"There is one thing which may not seem to be so clear as to my reasons. Permit me to read a quotation so as to get it into Hansard, a publication which people interested in the welfare of the country may sometimes read. The Prime Minister- I quote h im in order to exhibit my reverence for him - mad e this statementWe cannot hope to be'the same as before the war. We have great and crushing burdens, which we must bear. The Treasurer will endorse thai:We have a debt as great as Canada and South Africa put together. The firm foundations upon .which the world rested before the war have been undermined, and we are now living in a world rocking and tumbling with violent convulsions. Of course, that is somewhat in conflict with what the right honourable gentleman had said a few days previously, namely, that we were in the "" green fields of perpetual peace.'' How we can be "" rocking and tumbling with violent convulsions"" in the "" green fields of perpetual peace '' is a conundrum. The Prime Minister also saidThe nations impoverished by war are confronted with a new set of financial, national, and industrial circumstances. Humanity has indulged in a terrible orgy of destruction-it must pay the price. The Treasurer says that also; and it supplies my reason for opposing these items, I though, as I say, there is a persistent attempt' to switch off to other motives, which are implied in such questions as, "" Do we not need defence?"" or "" What would have happened to us if Germany had won?'-' The same question might just as well be put to German workmen. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart) said that members of the Country party were quit© prepared to defend themselves. I do not object to their attitude. They cause me no worry. I am only pointing out that while they profess to be in favour of economy they are prepared to give their support to a proposal to expend millions of pounds on the A r m y and Navy. The honourable member has quoted from the platform of his party one of those nebulous general statements",64
285,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,A very good,65
286,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I would have nothing better. It is a principle that will any set of circumstances, any country, any politician. The statement which (he quoted (was to the effect that the Country party are"" prepared to support the lowest possible expenditure for the adequate defence of the Commonwealth, after taking into consideration all recent international developments. Every one could suit that policy to his own requirements.",65
287,Mr STEWART,Unknown,The honourable member is not envious of it t,65
288,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Not in the least. If apart from party and partisanship-if in the interests of the country generallythe Country party believe that to be a sound policy, what to them are "" international developments""? What to them is the ""lowest estimate""? What to them is "" an adequate system of defence "" ? What do they think is the maximum expenditure that they should support i u respect of defence? Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Lair d Smith)yesterday quoted statements in regard to the Naval and Military expenditure of Great Britain. Is Great Britain today on a peace basis ? She bas on her hands not one war but a dozen.",65
289,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Can the honourable .member point to a nation that is a peacemaker ?,65
290,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"No . They all profess the principle, but not one is able to live up to it . Do honourable members think I am deadly anxious for any form of economy ? Do they think that my innermost desires are in accordance with my professions ?",65
291,Mr STEWART,Unknown,I do not know what to think about the honourable member.,65
292,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I do net believe the honourable member does, but I would say to him that I am not anxious as to the outlook of the Country party in regard to the world generally. It is their worry. What they will not do today their constituents will be deadly anxious to do a couple of years hence. The honourable member might do something now to save Australia from the crisis into which it is being precipitated..",65
293,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,"He intends to do that by the vote which he casts on this question. one. Mr ANSTEY - Is he trying to save his country from the* crisis into which it f it is being precipitated, owing to the enormous burden that is being imposed on it , by voting for an annual expenditure running from £60,000,000 to £100,000,000? In doing that the honourable member for Indi says that he will be trying to save his country. One of those newspapers to which I always reverently refer described the Treasurer's financial statement as a "" Knock Out Budget,"" and declared that it ' would hasten the crisis to which this country was moving. I do not blame the Treasurer. I do not blame the Government. It is not the Government, not this party or that party, but the whole country that is pursuing a course, with the acquiescence of the press, and the approval of the general publicblind to every circumstance and fact that is precipitating a crisis which must lead to inevitable ruin and disaster. It is this sort of thing that is hastening the day when the people, instead of using The their brains, will be compelled to reason by the impulse of their stomachs. So much for the statement which a newspaper has made concerning the Budget recently delivered by the Treasurer. I do not say that he is responsible for anything of the kind. He is but a cork upon the stream of events. We all are. Those of us who have some definite outlook, who can see what is necessary in connection with the enormous expenditure of this country",65
294,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that the Treasurer is fairly sound on the paper currency question ?,65
295,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,I am not going to bestow any compliments without compensation.,65
296,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is nearly ten o'clock. Let us have a vote..,65
297,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I have nearly completed my speech. I have not had a spasm for months, and I might as well have one now and again. From my point of view this country, as the result of the war, is doomed like every country in Europe. Europe is but an illustration of what this country, if it is wise, will avoid - The war has precipitated every European country into the mire of misery and degradation from - which apparently it can escape only - by the paintecting f u l process of revolution. Apparently done ? the Old Land in spite of its best Tory traditions is being rushed along the path. The Prime Minister himself has said that the aftermath of every war misery, degradation, and privation. Europe cannot go into the p it , it cannot rush into disaster without also involving us in the crisis in which the rest of the world is involved. Now is the time-before that crisis is pushed on this country, before the hour of our destiny arriveswhen wise men cognisant of the facts, recognising that Australia, with its vast come out of this war blood-clotted, with territory, and a population of only 5,000,000, is called upon to bear an exupon penditure of £100,000,000 per annum, should ask themselves how and by what means we shall be able to save ourselves. Honourable members opposite say, "" Let things d r if t . "" They, at least, are i session of the Treasury benches, and of should recognise that in their hands rests the destiny of Australia. We find them, however, doing nothing to avert the crisis. I do not blame them for the attitude they take up since it is due to the state of the public mind. The public mind is absovaluable lutely indifferent and callous. It refuses to look upon the responsibilities imposed upon ""the nation as the result of the And so the Government do nothing. do Anxious to see the system under which live precipitated into the dust, I am not very desirous that the Government and their supporters shall pursue a course of years old. economy. It will probably suit my book if they pile up expenditure to the of another £10,000,000 or £50,000-000 per year, since by doing so^ they will pregoing to strike? cipitate the crisis instead of allowing the process to be dragged out. The Country party, who are ready to argue over some little expenditure of a few thousand strike pounds, have to-night an opportunity say to the Government, "" The Commonwealth must return to its preit war expenditure.

As Wellington once said, it is wise at times for every army to retreat. Australia has t 60,000 dead, with nearly 200,000 who call the generosity of its people. It is wise that we should say, "" From this expenditure on defence turn back.

By constantly living on our fears, by spending what little money we have on some trumpery scheme of defence, we shall but f r it t e r away ten or fifteen years of time. We shall find that we have been building ships which will have to be scrapped, and buying guns which wiU war. soon become obsolete. What we need to is to build.up a virile people.

306,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Denison-Minis - I placed on the table of the House today a statement which I would have read but for the fact I realized that honourable members of were being called upon to engage in lengthy sittings, and desired as far as posdesible to economize their time. The honourable member .for Bourke (Mr Anstey) has asked for certain information, which I shall be very .glad to give the Comabsolutely mittee, since I believe that it will this matter an a different light. I am prepared to admit a proposed expenditure of only £3,265,S70 on the Navy in respect of the current financial yeaT. That, amount is largely made up of in creased wages paid to the men in the Navy, because 'of the increasei n the cost of living, and increases in»the cost fuel 'and other naval requirements. Only a short time ago we had a quotation of £1 10s. per ton for fuel oil, which largely used in the Navy, but recently when we - called for quotations at which it was offered to us was more than double the amount. The increase save time. in prices is largely responsible for what appear to be inflated Estimates In reality, they are not so. again, provision is made on these Estimates for a great deal of machinery be used, not only in the construction warships, but in the building of ordinary mercantile vessels at Cockatoo Island. Honourable members will see the totals set out on page 370 of the Estimates, I have here the detailed items. I feel sure that protracted discussion is due only to the fact that honourable members desire certain information. I nm 'prepared to give it in detail. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The Minister is'dealing with loan expenditure, which we have not reached yet.",66
307,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I shall state the first the principal details of the proposed expenditure from revenue. Amongst the items are-machiner y and plant at den Island, £10,000; Garden Island, amount required to complete the purchase nnd installation of machines now in right. hand, £1,168; Spectacle Island, electric cable to connect with Cockatoo Island, £900; purchase of oil tanks from the British Imperial O i l Company, £1,000. I shall pass over other smaller items, come to the big ones. We are providing £132,330 for the completion of the cruiser Adelaide, which, I hope, will be in comfro-day. mission early next year. Eor the steamer Biloola, .which is absolutely time of peace as well as in time of war, and which can be used in an emergency to carry fuel, we are allotting £6,400. The provision for a coal storage vessel amounts to £5S,150. This storage is commission. essential in any country at place all times. London orders, to which we were committed in past years,- account for £94,500. There is also a liability to the Admiralty of £S7,000. The total expenditure from revenue for which we - have provided is £378,000; but we do not expect to expend the whole of it . I hope, by careful administration, to save about of £78,380, reducing the total expenditure from revenue to £300,000.

Navy obsolete? May I repeat that, as fa r as the land forces are concerned, the expenditure not in excess of what I anticipated. I yield to none in the matter of economy. Personally, I think the question of rifle manufacture at Lithgow will have to be considered very closely . by this House, and more expert information than we have had in the past wil l have to be tained. In connection with the Naval vote, I wish' it to be thoroughly and clearly understood that, as far as I personally concerned, I am not prepared to vote for the payment of two and a quarter millions per annum for the mainclass. tenance of a fleet, which, according to my information, is obsolete.",68

330,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Q u it e recently the battleship Renown was in Australian waters, and it would be interesting to know how many fleets such as Australia obpossesses would be required to intercept such a vessel. We would need to multiply the whole number by ten, and even that am combination would not be able to get close enough to brush off her paint.",68
331,Mr MARRS,Unknown,We have nothing in that,68
332,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Of course not. When we commenced to build an Australian Navy, the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) with myself and others drew attention to what is actually happening. We said that in a few years the boats we built would become obsolete, and that Australia would be called upon to maintain a fleet-which we knew would be a farce-whic h would plunge her heavily into debt.",69
333,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,Does member suggest building a few ships like the Renown?,69
334,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"No . When the opportunity comes, I shall place my views before the Committee. upon to pass a vote of £2,250,000 for the maintenance of our Navy, and there is not an honourable member in this chamber who does not know that, as a means of opposing invading forces, it would be an absolute farce and a sham. It may be said that I am using somewhat strong language, but I believe it to be justified. In conclusion, I may say that, in passing this vote, it must not be said that I am acquiescing in a continuation of the present naval policy of Australia.",69
335,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta-Trea surer) [10.16] - I think that something should be said in answer to the statements made by the honourable member for Frankl in (Mr MCWilliams). mischievous, and should not have been made in an assembly such a3 this. If the honourable member really means what he says, he should not vote for one penny on these Estimates, because any man who says that our present Navv is useless should not contribute one penny towards its upkeep. May I remind the honourable member how idle it is to say that our Fleet cannot defend Australia in and by itself? A schoolboy knows that. nothing more to be said? Have we not any right to make any contribution to that great Fleet which defends the whole Empire? Surely, because we cannot do everything, it cannot be said that we should do nothing at all. Does the honourable member think that, because we cannot defend 12,000 miles of coastline by ourselves, we should not do anything ?

337,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Does he believe that, until we can get a Navy which will make us absolutely self-contained in the matter of naval defence, Ave should not spend anything at all? It is a preposterous argument.",69
338,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I have not altered the opinion I held when I was in company with the Treasurer on the other side of the House.,69
339,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Such a statethe honourable ment does not count for very much, and the - man who glories in the fact that war has not changed his opinions in the slightest degree is suggestive of Rip V an Winkle.

Mr MCWILLIAMS - The late war haa taught us that our ships are obsolete.",69
340,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid I shall still have to rely for my naval direction and final judgment on those who are experts, and who have devoted their whole time to naval matters. These authorities do not suggest that our ships are obsolete in any sense of the term, and they in for m me that they can be made a very useful addition to the great British Navy. The honourable member's argument is f at al to any Navy, and fatal to the expenditure They are most of any money. It is our duty to make as full a contribution as our finances will permit towards the development of as large a naval force as, in conjunction with the British Navy, will give us a reasonable chance of defending our shores from attack. That is the position, in a nutshell. I admit that we cannot defend Australia by ourselves. Our Navy is not big enough to do that; but we can do our duty and make an adequate contribution But is there to the sum of those forces which, next year, are to be considered by the I m perial Conference, and which will , in the end, I believe, give us a naval defence in the Pacific which will save us from any predatory designs that may be entertained. But I beg the honourable member not to raise those issues now. There is really only one thing to do in connection with this item, and that is to pay our debts. This monev has been spent.",69

Why should questions of a fundamental character be raised on a mere matter of this kind ? .

347,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That .statement is notcorrect. The naval policy of Australia has been a matter which has given rise to very many discussions in this .House. I remember a famous speech delivered by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), in Adelaide', I think, wherein he referred to the boats of the River classthe vessels which were really the nucleus of the Australian Navy. I refer to those destroyers which were named after the river running through the Treasurer's constituency-that is to say, the Parramatta - and the river which runs through my constituency, namely, the Yarra.'",70
348,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Thos e names were given in order to create good relations between yourself and the Treasurer.,70
349,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That may have been so. I remember that speech of the Treasurer concerning the River class of vessels; bu t I do not propose to do, as was done last night, namely, to turn up the records of utterances ten years old. I intend, rather, to refer to the actions of some honourable members, who are still in this Chamber, when they put out a Government of which I was a member, not because they would not agree to the formation of an Australian Navy, but because they would not give a Dreadnought to the Mother Country. Those honourable members were glad enough of the actions taken by the Government at the inception of the war in regard to the Australia, when the German warships, the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau, were known to be in Australian waters.",70
350,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You had whatever to do with the Australia.,70
351,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We were put out of office because we would not give a Dreadnought to the Mother Country. Following earlier remarks of mine this evening, the Treasurer stated that I was right and that I was also wrong: I was right in the figures which I quoted; I was wrong in not putting them all in . Since the Minister spoke previously, I have found another item, of £1,210,000. I do not say, even now, that the total is complete, because these items can be found all through the Estimates. This sum of £1,210,000 is set out on page 361. Of course, it is an item which has to do with last year. No financial year has ever passed in which we have not been called upon to consider belated Estimates, after the money has been spent. The amount represented .in this item has probably also been spent. Then, there is still another matter for addition to our grand total. A new defence system is being in augurated. 'The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) has reminded us of that. Where is the expenditure set forth in these Estimates to deal with the creation of the new citizen army? I presume the figure will be put on to next year's Estimates. So, the total of £10,678,866 will be still greater. Even then, I repeat that I will not say that the aggregate sum is a complete statement of our expenditure.",70
352,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,The honourable member has overlooked the War Debt.,70
353,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am taking the annual expenditure-mone y which we are called upon to vote for this year. If the money was spent last year, and was not shown in last year's Estimates, honourable members cannot be blamed - We' know just how supplementary estimates are brought for;c ward. In the past we bave been calledA on to vote on supplementary estimates dealing with items which were years old. In addition to the present grand total of £10,478,866 it must be remembered that that sum is quite apart from any supplementary estimates which may be brought down. Wlhat is the use of talking about an expenditure of £3,000,000 upon defence, and £3,000,000 upon the navy? We have been told something about a certain vessel which has been in the water for two years. I can only say that, if that is a fact, the date of her being put nothing into commission does not pleasantly reflect upon the management of the construction works.. Mr LAIR D SMITH - The honourable member should be fair. That vessel was under construction during the war, when it was most difficult to secure material.",70
354,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"So far as the Navy concerned, I have always taken the that it is better for us to have an tralian owned and controlled navy; but unless we can have our navy sufficient force and sufficiently efficient, it will better to trust to such vessels as, for example, the Eenown, to keep our shores inviolate. It is far better still, however, to have battleships of that type on the spot by way of recompense for the milbut lions which we are called upon to pay. Our warships should be here rather than they in the North Sea. Both the New Zeathat land and the Canadian Minister, with whom I was once in conference, expressed to me the private view that if the Docause minions were to have their own navies it was the better policy to keep them at our back doors. New Zealand gave a Dreadnought to England. That minion had the vessel built in Great Britain , and owed the money to Great Britain. That was New Zealand's conOf tribution. We decided that it would better to have an Australian navy.",71
355,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The New Zealand people are "" whales "" at leaving the matter to the Empire, and it cost them last year about £50,000.",71
356,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If I was wrong in quoting certain figures, I was wrong in not stating the full amount of the penditure which I have since ascertained.",71
357,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What are the other items, to which the honourable member refers ?",71

If the right honourable gentleman will do me the honour of reading my about it . speech in Hansard, he will find them all there. Regarding the amount of £210,000 which he mentioned as expenditure f graves upon Gallipoli. he can wipe that off, and there will still remain an expenber diture of £10,266,000.",71

But havine regard to the statement of the Treasurer that this is not the proper time to indulge in a lone review of fence matters-that the opportunity to [204 ] so will come when the general Estimates are being considered- I shall reserve my is remarks for a futur e occasion. The honview orable member for Franklin has made Ausrather a good point in connection with , the construction of the warship Adelaide. in Now, the life of a vessel of that type, be according to naval experts, and particularly of Lord Jellicoe, is about fifteen years. The last information which I had from Home was to the effect that these ships were not being absolutely scrapped, that, for the sake of economy, and to enable a number of men to be paid off, are being laid up. My opinion is we should complete the building of the Adelaide, seeing that her construction has already proceeded so far, beshe will prove a useful ship in many other directions, and it would be a pity to waste the money which hag been expended upon her, seeing that she can be completed for an additional expenditure Doof £130,000. The Leader of the Country party has suggested that H . M . S . Renown could wipe out the whole of our fleet. course she could, because we have not be that type of vessel out here. However, I shall deal with that phase of the matter upon another occasion. So far as the construction of the Adelaide is ooncerned, I am of opinion that the necessary money to oomplete her should be expended.",71

361,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think that the honourable member has had a very gooct,71
362,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I have no doubt But , speaking as one kind friend to another, I ask the Treasurer to tell us when the discussion upon the o r general Estimates will take place, because I do not wish the honourable memfor Wentworth (Mr Marks) and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr .

365,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown, Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the Bill be taken as a whole? PAIBS.,72
366,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,Fremantle) [10.51]. - I wish to know when there will be an opportunity to discuss the schedule of the Bill?,72
367,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I have asked whether it is the pleasure of the Committee to take the Bill as a wholej and there was no objection.,72
368,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,I want to say something about an item which is not connected with Canberra.,72
369,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member may do so now.,72
370,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Then , without further waste of time, I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for the Navy (Mr L a i r d Smith), the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), and also the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to the item of £187,000 set down for Naval Base construction. In answer to a question I ' put the other day, I was informed that that amount includes £30,000 proposed to be expended on the Henderson Naval Base, in ""Western Australia. I have since that date received telegrams from ""Western Australia in forming me that the staff at the Henderson Naval Base has received a month's notice, which expires on the 31st October. There is a general feeling of alarm amongst the residents of Fremantle, because it is anticipated that this particular Commonwealth work is likely to be closed down. I want to know from the Minister in charge of the Bill just what work is intended to be undertaken there during the ensuing twelve months? If we review the Naval Base situation throughout the Commonwealth, we shall realise that during the last seven or eight years we have completed what was ' in tended to be very small and minor sub-bases at Flinders, and that in respect to the major Bases, which were to be provided, for under the original report of Admira l Hfenderson, namely, those at Oockburn Sound and Port Stephens, nothing has been accomplished. Making due allowance for the fact that we have passed through years of war, and that money has been very difficult to obtain, there has been a sufficient lapse of time to have enabled the officers of the Department and the Government to determine what their policy is to be. In the answer given to my question, I was told that it was proposed to expend £30,000 on survey work at the Henderson Naval Base, but the history and records concerning that Base demonstrate that surveys have been made there from time to time, but that the work has been delayed and postponed. Speaking as the representative of the constituency most vitally affected, I want to enter a protest against any further postponement of this i m portant work. ""We have had investigations by Admira l Henderson, by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, and by Lord Jellicoe, and now, apparently as the result of their concentrated wisdom., it is intended to postpone the development of the Henderson Naval Base indefinitely. I cannot allow this measure to pass without voicing in the strongest possible terms the objection of the people of Western Australia, and particularly of my own constituency, to this method of doing business. I should bo jrlad if Minister in charge of theB ill can give schedule. me any information as to what work will be continued at this Base. I remind the honourable gentleman that work has been done in connection with the dredging of the Pamela and Success banks, and unless those works are maintained they are likely to deteriorate. I remind the honourable gentleman, also, that it took years to procure the necessary staff for this particular Base, and if it is now in tended to scatter the members of that staff throughout Australia, whenever it is the intention of the Government to resume work at the Henderson Naval Base, it will be necessary to again go through the trouble of securing the right type of men ior the job. I appeal to the Minister to make some statement which will throw some light upon what is proposed in connection with this particular work, and in connection with the Naval Base policy, of the Government generally. I have mentioned Port Stephens, and on looking through the Loan Estimates I find that the only provision made in respect of that place is a vote of £23,000 for land resumption.",72
371,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think the honourable member is wrong there. The amount to be appropriated under this Bill is only £8,926. Mr BUB . CHELL - I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that in the second column of the schedule there appears an amount of £14,074, which is already available under appropriations made under previous Acts, and this, with the amount to which he has referred, brings the total vote for the resumption of land for the Port Stephens Naval Base to the amount of £23,000, which I have mentioned. I do not wish to detain the Committee, and if the M in ister will consent to make some statement as to what is proposed to be done at the Henderson Naval Base, I shall resume my seat. I do desire that the honourable gentleman should make public the intention of the Government in regard to that particular Base, as I am being deluged with wires on the subject fro m Western Australia, and the people there are very anxious to know what is i h the mind of the Government.",73
372,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I think it will be more convenient if the clauses of the Bill are first dealt with, as it seems that the the discussion is likely to be confined to the - Olauaes 1, 2, and 3 agreed to. Schedule",73
373,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [10.58] In reply to the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell) I have to say that the question of the construction of the Naval Bases came under the review of the Naval Board, and the members of the Board had to consider it in the light of the money available. Of the amount of £187,000 set down for the Naval Bases, £27,635 represents the expenditure for the Naval works staff, and an amount of £84,431 is made available for the F l in ders Naval Base to complete the work tliere. The Department has already gone into-occupation of the Base, and the sums set down are simply to complete the work there. As regards ""the Henderson Naval 'Base, it was some time ago decided by the Board to curtail the work to a great extent. All excavations and works of that kind were stopped, and only a certain amount of preservative work continued. Dredging was gone on with for a time, but now the Board has decided to cease operations. The vessels will be brought in for overhaul, and sufficient of the staff will be kept on for that purpose. In the meantime a special marine survey, which has already been started, will be completed.",74
374,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,Was there not a - vey previously ?,74
375,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Not of this kind, and - the special survey is the result of a recommendation of Lord Jellicoe. The question - of the whole naval policy will come up for review later on. Of course, a number of the members of the staff will 'be dispensed with, but a few will be kept on for the work I have mentioned.",74
376,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Bass) [11.3] - T move That the following items be left out:"" Federal Capital Territory-Initia l settlement, £90,000; preparatory works, £60,000; railways, completion of construction line, - Federal Capital Territory, £250."" I am sorry that owing, to the hubbub in the chamber it was impossible to raise an objection to this expenditure earlier in the evening. Some honourable members say that this money is being invested in reproductive works; but if there is one item on the schedule on which we can economize, it is in relation to Canberra. The removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra today is a proposal I strenuously oppose. I think the time might be ripe for a change ten years hence, when our burden of debt is considerably less than it is now; and I can say that there is a considerable backing for the opinion I am now expressing. This question has been sufficiently debated, and I shall not detain the Committee, by, as it were, dragging out ghosts, or opening up old sores.",74
377,Mr BELL,Unknown,"Darwin) [11.5] - A good deal has been said about honourable members preaching economy during the election campaign. I was not prepared to cut down absolutely essential expenditure on defence; but there is not the least doubt in ' m y mind, nor, I think , in the minds of honourable members generally, that the people of the country, as a whole, are opposed to spending money on the Federal Capital at the present time, whatever may be decided in this connection in the future. It would be a waste of money to undertake such a work when money is dear, material and workmen scarce, especially in view of the fact that there is a dearth of houses throughout Australia. Like the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) I shall not detain the Committee with any lengthy remarks. There is no need to debate the question, because I am sure that every honourable member has made up his mind. surI do not think that there is an honourable member who can truly say that to build this Capital now is to undertake useful work.",74
378,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [11.8] I desire to support the amendment, and I should like to have some explanation of the item, "" Land in Federal Capital Territory, £ 1 0 , 8 0 0 . "" I am not opposed to the building of the capital at Canberra when money is available, and we have returned to normal times; but at present I think that such a work would be a great mistake. The Country party stands for efficiency and economy, and this is certainly a matter in which we can economize with efficiency. Even if we do spend £150,000 on the Federal Capital, in the next ten years we shall not have a place to which we can shift the Seat of Government. In the meantime we shall have to keep up the buildings, and a lot of work will have been done there for no purpose. If this matter is deferred until normal times we may be able to spend a sufficient sum to put up buildings which would accommodate all those whose services are necessary to carry on the work of the Federal Capital. The Government cannot shift a solitary Department from any of the capital cities at present if they are going to Bpend only the amount proposed here over a period of five or six years. Every member who stands for economy should oppose the spending of. this money at the present time. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Bass for a reduction of the Estimates by the amounts mentioned.",74
379,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Grampians) [11.11] I support the amendment of the honourable member for Bass, but I am lost in amazement at the conspiracy of silence of those who are prepared to commit the people of Australia to such an expenditure at this juncture in our affairs. Day after day, our party in this corner has listened with delight to the eloquence of honourable members on the other side, even when they have been denouncing what they consider to be the extravagance ' of the Government in various directions.",75
380,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,And we have noticed how consistently you have voted for them.,75
381,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I have voted, as the honourable member truly says, consistently according to my belief and judgment, and to the responsibilities that attach to a member of this Parliament. It is obvious that there has been a conspiracy to rush this thing through in the quickest possible time, without members being given an opportunity to debate a matter which is of the utmost importance to the whole of the people of Australia. At this late hour I should like the consent of the Minister in charge of the business to continue my remarks tomorrow. It would be au absolute disgrace if this item were to be passed at the midnight hour without members opposed to it being given a real opportunity of placing their views before the House and the people.",75

I do not want to refuse the request of the honourable member for Grampians, because the matter before the Committee is important, and I take it that there is no desire to rush it through without proper consideration. Nothing can be gained by appearing even to burke discussion on it . Mr HECTOR LAMOND,-It has had fifteen years' consideration.",75
