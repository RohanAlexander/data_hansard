Have theBB claims heen satisfied? 4. If not, will he see that these claims are case liquidated without delay, considering that it is now five years and seven months since the Prize Court dealt with the claims of persons entitled to payment?",19

(for Mr MASK ) asked the Postmaster-General, notice I. Is it a fact that; in connection with the transfer of the officers of the Government Land. Radio Stations from the Department of VILLERYRIE ) the Navy to the Department of the Postmasterorable General, the following injustices have oclow:curred:-(a ) That permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service (previous to their transfer to the Department of the Navy for war service) find themselves transferred back to the Publio Service without their former status, thereby heing reduced from the Professional class of the Service to the Clerical; (6) that increments of salary earned by them under the Department of the Navy, and due from July last, have not been paid by the Navv, and that the Commissioner for tha Public Service has ignored the same masseuses. when assessing their .present salaries: (c) that officers have been reduced in salary ""aa much as £29 per annum, in addition to their £12 annual increment, making their total reduction £41 per annum? 2. Is it a fact that the officers, who arc all members of the Radio Telegraphists Institute of Australasia, instructed their Secretary to ask the Public Service Commissioner to allow them representation when.the details of the transfer were being considered, in order to prevent injustice? 3. If so, why was this request refused? 4. IB it a fact that the Public Service Comupon missioner acknowledged recently, through his representative in the Arbitration Court, that these ^officers were ""professional engineering 5. If so, why have these men been deprived 6. As these officers have received no war bonus, repatriation benefits, or recognition of any sort for their services at a time of great ' national danger, will the Government at this late hour, in recognition of the service and in view of the treatment now meted out to them, appoint a special tribunal to inquire into their at once with their official representative?",19

14,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"It would be of great assistance to honourable members if the M in ister, when moving motions of this kind, were to say briefly what the measures to which they referred propose to cover.",20
15,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"In this case I propose HERZ. to introduce a Bill of one clause to repeal the sections of the Inter-State CommisCUNNINGsion Act which were held by the High Court in the Wheat case to be invalid, and to provide for the Commission making certain declarations. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented, and read a first time. COMMONWE i AL TH OOURT OF COMMERCE BILL .",20
16,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [ i l . S ] I move That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to constitute a Commonwealth Court of conCommerce and for other purposes. I now ask leave to introduce a Bill which has should be read in conjunction with that just presented. The High Court held that Part V . of the Inter-State Commission A ct was invalid, because under section 101 of the Constitution this Parliament could vest judicial power in that body. This Bill is to enable Parliament to create a Commerce Court, which will exercise the judicial powers which were thought to be vested in the Inter-State Commission.",20
17,Mr TTJDOK,Unknown,"If the High Court says that Parliament cannot vest the CommisTAXATION. sion with judicial power, how can that be",20
18,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall be prepared to argue that question at a later stage. The Bill provides for the setting up of a - Court which will consist of the President assisted by two assessors.,20
19,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Is the President of Court to be the President of the Inter-State Commission?,21
20,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes . This Court, as a Court of Commerce, will exercise the judicial power originally thought to be vested in the Interstate Commission.",21
21,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Will the two assessors be the remaining two members of the Interstate Commission?,21
22,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes . They will sit with the President when he requires their assistance. In 1918, a resolution was passed by the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia affirming "" that it is desirable that the Inter-State Commission. Act be amended in such a .way as to give the Inter-State Commission a sphere of greater usefulness more in keeping with its cost to the community."" Generally speaking, that is the object of the Bill which I now desire to introduce.",21
23,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [11.11] - I have previously voiced, both here and elsewhere, my objection to the continuance of the Inter-State Commission. It is the most useless body that was ever created by this Parliament. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) cannot point to one useful act which it has performed since its inception. The first inquiry it conducted was an inquiry into the question of the need which existed for Tariff revision. It made certain recommendations in that connection, but, so far as my memory serves me, not one of those recommendations was endorsed by this House.",21
24,Mr TUBOR,Unknown,The House has never considered the revision of the Tariff since the Commission submitted its report.,21
25,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I am speaking of what took place before the outbreak of war. It is a fact that one of the members of the Commission became so dis-. satisfied with its work and so impressed with its uselessness that he tendered his resignation- I refer to Mr Swinburne. Subsequently other work was given to the Commission in order to keep it. going. For instance, it inquired into the question of the Murray waters. But what did it do there? We knew everything that had been done - in connection with the Murray waters scheme prior to the Inter-State Commission dealing with the the matter. I am. therefore entirely opposed to the continuance of the Commission, and suggest that we ought to repeal the Act under which it was constituted instead of attempting to amend it .",21
26,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yarra) [11.13] - I understand that the Inter-State Commission is not in existence at the present time. The Act under which it was appointed has lapsed.,21
27,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"'It s members were appointed for a period of seven years. That time has expired, and no fresh appointments have been made.",21
28,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not agree with the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) that the whole of the work done by the Commission has been useless. | Mr JAMES PAGE - Will the Minister tell us one good thing that the Commission has ever done?,21
29,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think that the money which has been expended upon the Inter-State Commission has been quite as wisely spent as have other moneys which have been authorized by this Parliament. When the results of the expenditure upon the Commission are compared with the results of our expenditure uoon shipbuilding the 'Commission comes out an easy winner. The Commission was not appointed until about the end of 1913. It began its inquiry into the need for Tariff revision prior to the outbreak of war, and soon after I submitted a Tariff schedule to this House which has never yet been considered.",21
30,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You tyrant! You autocrat!,21
31,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I was anxious, as hourorable members opposite know, that that schedule should be considered.",21
32,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,The honourable member knows the reason why it was not considered.,21
33,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes ; the reason was that the war was in progress, and Japan was one of our Allies.",21
34,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,And the Imperial Government asked the Commonwealth Government of that day not to proceed with it.',21
35,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . The Imperial Government asked us to postpone the consideration of the Navigation Bill. Some persons, however, were afraid of giving offence to Japan.",21
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The only reason why the Tariff was not then considered was that the honourable member, who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, would not allow Parliament to consider it.",22
37,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . In those days the Opposition cry was, "" Postpone the consideration of the Tariff and let us get home."" Had the Tariff been considered in the light of the evidence which was tendered to the Inter-StateCommission, the reports of that body would have been most valuable. But they will not be as valuable today, because seven years have elapsed since then. At that time our manufacturers declared that they would not give certain information to a Labour Minister, but they were prepared to give it to an outside body. In that way they would doubtless be able to conceal a lot of the profits which they had made, and in respect of which they refused to give information to the Minister. I believe that the Inter-State Commission has done good workj and I cannot support the suggestion of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) that it should be wiped out of existence. Regarding the establishment of .the proposed Court of Commerce, I have quite an open mind, and am prepared to consider the matter upon its merits.",22
38,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Kooyong) [11.16] - I do not desire to be so ungracious as to prevent the introduction of this Bill. But I am distinctly opposed tofchecontinuance of the Inter-State Commission and to the creation of a Court of Commerce. I am not prepared to go as far as the honourable member for Herbert in regard to the work of the Commission, and certainly I have no desire to reflect upon its personnel. In my opinion, we were fortunate, when it was constituted, in 'securing the services of capable men upon it . They did excellent work in inquiring into the need for Tariff revision, and they supplied us with much valuable information in that connection. But, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has suggested, that information is now completely out of date, because of the war which has since occurred, and because of the time which has elapsed since it was collated. Speaking generally, however, I think that the time is a most opportune one for us to relieve ourselves of some of the governmental machinery which, to my mind, is unnecessary. No useful function is being discharged at the present time by the Inter-State Commission. Two of its members have resigned, and, therefore, only the Chairman remains to be considered, and properly treated. Consequently the present is a particularly opportune time to abolish the Commission entirely. I am one of those who originally supported its creation, but in view of our past experience, of the requirements of the future, and of the imperative need which exists for the exercise of the strictest economy, I think that the time has now arrived when we should dispense with this particular branch of governmental machinery. No section of the community will suffer by its abolition. Of course, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr G-rooni) has a perfect right to introduce the Bill dealing with this matter, so as to enable honourable members to judge it upon its merits. But if, as I understand, the object of the measure is to confer upon the Inter-State Commission certain judicial powers, I am opposed.to it from beginning to end. I am also entirely opposed to the continuance of the Commission. Furthermore, I protest strongly against the creation of the proposed Court of Commerce.",22
39,Mr RYAN,Unknown,What commerce could it deal with?,22
40,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"That is a perfect mystery to me; but, at most, it could deal only with questions affecting Inter-State trade and commerce. The point I wish to emphasize is that no one has asked for the creation of this Oourt of Commerce, and I defy the Minister (Mr. Groom) to prove any valuable purpose . it can serve. There is no lack of tribunals to fulfil the functions which it has been suggested this proposed Court will undertake. Chambers of Commerce have within their own ambit certain tribunals for the purpose of dealing with matters essentially of a commercial character, which can be settled by resort to arbitration, and where they cannot adjust their differences between themselves in that way they go to the ordinary law Courts. And they will continue to do this - They express no desire to resort to any intermediate Court such as it is now proposed to create. If the purpose be to secure special expert knowledge in commercial matters, I would point out that the Chambers of Commerce have their own expert .tribunals. If this Court is to be created for the purpose of interpreting the law, and for the legal adjustment of differences that may arise in trading and commercial transactions, here again I would point out that trading firms will inevitably refer their differences to the ordinary 'legal tribunals. The Minister has made an unfortunate reference to ' the fact that a little time ago the Chambers of Commerce passed a resolution in favour of . the creation of a Court of the kind suggested, quite overlooking the fact that, in view of their more recent experience, they subsequently passed a resolution protesting strongly against the creation of such a tribunal as is now proposed - When the Minister appeals to Chambers of Commerce for guidance or for an expression of - their views upon the matter, he ought to quote their latest resolution, and not one which is completely out of date. There is no justification for the creation of a Court of Commerce. In any case, if appointed it will be a surplus tribunal for the creation of which no one has asked.",22
41,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,But the Government must do something to keep the House occupied.,23
42,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But the House could be more usefully employed upon other work.,23
43,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Would it not wise for the honourable member to wait to hear what the Government do propose in this direction 1,23
44,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The Minister has already given us sufficient information to enable lis to understand exactly the purpose of these two measures. If the object of the Ministry is to provide the House with work, it would be a very good idea to devote a fortnigh t to the consideration of the Tariff, and thus get rid of the main speeches on the first item. A p a r t from that, however, it is only f a ir to the Government that I should infor m them' that I shall take every opportunity of opposing - these measures. I would go further, and say at once that if possible a Bill should be introduced to repeal the Inter-State Commission Act .",23
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member does not know what are the measures proposed, but he is "" a g in "" them.",23
46,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"If I can rely on the statement made by the Minister (Mr Groom) I know what these measures contain, and as he has informed us that one object is to endow the Inter-State Commission with judicial powers, I am taking this opportunity of telling him that I am opposed to doing so, and, in fact, am quite against allowing the Commission to continue to exist.",23
47,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Would the honourable member be prepared to submit an amendment to abolish the Commission? Sir ROBE RT BEST - No . As I said at the outset of my remarks, it would be ungracious to refuse the Government permission f o introduce these Bills. They ought to be introduced so that honourable members may have the opportunity of dealing with them on their oner its, but now that the fundamental principles underlying these proposals have'been outlined to us, I think it is only fair that I should indicate what my attitude is in regard to them.",23
48,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Maranoa) [11.27]. - Politic s are peculiar.. The whirligig of time has brought, our "" brother's"" chickens home to roost. There was no more ardent advocate of the establishment of the Inter-State Commission than the honourable member for Kooyong (S ir Robert Best). The whirligig of time has also brought us strange bed-fellows in be this Chamber. We have another "" brand from the burning.""",23
49,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"H all e l u j a h ! - Mr JAMES PAGE - Yes ; we have had a great "" hallelujah testimony "" this morning in regard to the Inter-State Commission. I agree with every word the honourable member for Herbert (Mr . Bamford) has said-that it has been one of the most useless creations of this Parliament, and that if abolished today no one would be any the worse off. The present Chairman of the Inter-State Com position on the High Court and is the only man in Australia who would have refused such an' appointment, which he did.",23
50,Mr WISE,Unknown,Why did he refuse it ?,24
51,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"I do not know, but I have no doubt he has since seen the error of his ways. The Government might give him another opportunity. For instance, he might be asked to fill the position of President of the Arbitration Court which Mr Justice Higgins has given up. The Government apparently cannot findany one to take that post. The honourable member for Kooyong has sharpened his lance to have a tilt at the Government, but when he approaches the peg I am sure he will miss it and stick his lance in the ground, unhorsing himself in doing so. That is to say, when a vote is taken on this particular question he will be missing. He will not hurt the Government. He may wound them, but he will not kill them.",24
52,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I certainly would not dislodge them.,24
53,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"What an admission!. Here is another bed-fellow! Here is another ""hallelujah testimony""!",24
54,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,This is not a vital measure.,24
55,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"For the last' quarter of an hour the honourable member has been ranting and raving about what the Inter-State Commission has cost this country. The honourable member says this is not vital. Will he say what is vital? The Age and the Argus have whipped the Victorians, and the honourable gentleman has come to heel."" for he is only using the arguments employed by those great organs of public opinion.",24
56,Mr HYAN,Unknown,Will the honourable member accept my assurance that the Government will not go on with the measure?,24
57,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Yes , I will accept the assurance of the honourable member for West Sydney, and I suppose that tomorrow we shall find this item of business well down to the bottom of the notice-paper like so many others, including the Public Service Bill, under which the Government proposed to create a Board of three Commissioners. We shall, I have no doubt, find this "" brother "" alongside that measure.",24
58,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"-Well , let us get this motion through, and you will see. Mr JAMES PAGE.^Of course, the Minister can do as he likes. The Government have the numbers, and after the testimony by "" Brother"" Best from Kooyong-perhap s ' I should say the honourable member for Kooyong- I am satisfied the Government need have no fear of danger from that quarter. But what I want to know is, who asked for this proposed Court of Oommerce? The Minister informed us that the Chambers of Commerce had asked for, it, but the honourable member for Kooyong, who is a strong supporter of the Government, and a strong advocate of commercialism in this House, has told us that the Chambers of Commerce had seen the error of their ways, and that now they do not want it . If , by means of this Bill, it is proposed to confer a benefit on the commercial community, but if the commercial community do not want it, why give it to them? If there is nothing else behind the Bill than this request from the Chambers of Commerce",24
59,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There is more behind it than that. Mr JAMES PAGE.""-After the Minister's assurance I would like to see what is behind it. I look with a great amount of suspicion upon anything that the honourable member for Kooyong opposes, because he, and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), are the strongest barrackers for the Government in this House, it does not matter how "" tight"" they may be. I am not speaking, of course, in the prohibition sense.",24
60,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Then you mean in the continuance sense? "" Mr JAMES PAGE - Not in that sense either, but I know that there are many prohibitionists on that side of the Chamber - The honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Wakefield are ""prohibitionists"" against our party, but still we are living, and we shall blossom before long and, I have no doubt, bear good fruit. It is a most peculiar thing that every honourable member for Kooyong has been a very rich Conservative. I do not mean in this world's goods, but rich in titles. They would have no commoner to represent them in Kooyong. They must have a titled hero, and now they have one in the person of Sir Robert Best.",24
61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I am afraid' the honourable member is digressing, and I must ask him to address himself to the motion.",24
62,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"I am afraid of the honourable member for Kooyong, just as you, Mr Speaker, seem to be afraid of me, because one day he advocates the appointmen't of this Inter-StateCommission, and now sees no good in it. If this proposed Court of Commerce' is going to be of any good to the Commonwealth, let us have it ; but if , on the other hand, it is not going to be of any use, the House should cast it on one side. If it is not likely to be of any more value than the Inter-State Comunission is, or has been, I hope, the House will reject the motion, whether it is or is not vital to the Government.",25
63,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"Robertson) [11.38] There is just one point in connection with this matter upon which I should like to touch. I cordially agree with those honourable members who doubt the usefulness of the continued existence of the Inter-State Commission. We have never had a body politic in this community which has been ofless real service than that Commission, and if its life can be judiciously ended now, it would be wise to end it. We are always talking about the necessity for economy. Personally, I am not particularly keen on that aspect of the question, but if we can prevent useless expenditure, we should do so. We are all, more or less, in the dark as to what the Bill, motion to introduce which is now before honourable membera, really means. should like to know if this proposed Court of Commerce is to be purely a body for getting over little local grievances, or whether its purpose is to be much wider. This, to my mind, is essential at the present juncture. There are great opportunities for Australia in the Pacific and the East, but so far this House has done nothing to take advantage of these new avenues of trade, which are being opened up as the result of the great struggle through which we have come. Other countries are doing a great deal to advance their interests in the East. Great Britain, of my knowledge, has sent out a large number of men of high character, and, in many cases, of high scholastic attainments, to impress the people of the East with the advantages of further trading with the Mother Country; but Australia, which is producing more than any other country in the world of the very commodities required by these Eastern nations, is letting her chances slip by. America, too, has spent large sums of money in opening up fresh avenues of trade, or in further strengthening those already in existence. On many occasions I have suggested to various people in Australia, and more than once to the Government, that something of a definite character should be done in the way of conserving our interests in the East-at present there is very little to conserve-of extending our trade, and getting into closer touch with the people, sp that we may know what is going on. At present we are in the dark, to a very dangerous degree, and we are losing trade which should be coming our way. If this Bill, by the creation of a - Court of Commerce, will do anything in the direction of furthering our interests, I shall support it, but if it is merely for the creation of a Court to settle minor differences within the Commonwealth,' and if its functions are to be anything like those of the InternState Commission, I shall oppose it.",25
64,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.40] The Government would be well advised to withdraw this motion. It is evident from the remarks of honourable members on both sides that they see very little utility the in the Inter-State Commission. I ' am in complete accord with the views of the honI orable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford). The Inter-State Commission was constituted under an Act passed by a Labour Government, and the personnel of the first Inter-State Commission was appointed in 1913. I take it that the friends of the Constitution had in mind that some difficulty would be experienced in regard to the Tariff, and they thought it advisable that an Inter-State Commission should be constituted to help Parliament in that regard. We have to be guided by experience, and experience has taught us that the Inter-State Commission is of very little use in regard to the Tariff. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has stated that the Commission has done very useful work, and that many of its reports will be of service to Parliament. My view is that those reports will be of very little use to the House when dealing with the Tariff. Most of them were made some years ago, and in the interim the great war has heen fought, and as a result trade conditions are vastly changed. I do not say that the members of the Inter-State Commission have not done excellent work, but although their reports have cost a good deal of money they have no practical value. I recollect that in the initial stages of industrial arbitration a great number of cases were filed, but some of them could not be heard for two years, by which time it was useless to proceed with them, because the industrial position had changed. The same objection applies to the reports of the Interstate - Commission. Their reports are four and five years old, and may not be applicable to the conditions of today. The continuance of the Commission must involve a good deal of expenditure. We must reduce our expenses wherever we legitimately can, and this is one opportunity that is presented to us. Two of the Commissioners have already resigned, and only one is now in office. The term of appointment was for seven years; that period is about to expire, and, therefore, no injustice will be done to any individual if Parliament should decide that the Commission shall cease to exist. The Government would be wise not to persevere with this motion. If the work of the Commission is of no practical utility, why should the time of Parliament be occupied in dealing with a Bill to give greater powers to that body? In regard tp the.creation of a Oourt of Commerce, I do not know exactly what the Government proposal means.",25
65,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why not wait to see what the Bill means?,26
66,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman will admit that I seldom speak at this stage of any measure, and I only do so now because I think we should give an indication to Ministers of whether or not we approve of the continuance of the Inter-State Commission. We should not allow them to bring in a Bill to which the Government will be pledged, and which the Ministerial followers may feel obliged to loyally support. If the House gives an expression . of opinion at this stage it will be a guide to the Government as to whether or not to proceed further with their proposals. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) pointed out the necessity for developing {trade with the Orient. New South Wales has a trade representative in the Orient, and possibly other States also are represented. I think such representation should be sufficient to carry on trade relations. If the proposed Court of Commerce means the creation of another body which will be a permanent cost to the community I shall be very caref u l how I vote. I have no desire to create any unnecessary Boards. I will support any proposal that Ministers can show to be in the best interests of the country, but, otherwise, the time has arrived when we should economize as much as possible, in view of the heavy financial burden' we have to bear.",26
67,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [11.45] Although debate at the introductory stage of a measure is' unusual in this Chamber, it is quite justified in the present instance. As one of those who, during the Budget debate, took exception to the continuance of the Inter-State Commission, I think it right to repeat my views now. It would appear from the remarks of the Minister (Mr. Groom) that the proposal to institute a Court of Commerce means giving to the Inter-State Commission some of the judicial powers which we thought we had conferred upon that body, but which the High Court has ruled it does not possess. This is really an attempt to get round the decision of the High Court. The time has arrived when the Inter-State Commission should be got rid of, but I shall not commit myself entirely until I hear what the Minister has to say on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. At present I cannot see that a Court of_ Commerce is required. There does not seem to be any demand for it from the trading community, and I think it is time we discontinued the policy of appointing so many Commissions and other Government bodies, and economized wherever possible. Against the personnel of the Inter-State Commission I have nothing to say. I have the greatest respect for all the gentlemen who have served upon that body; but, unfortunately, their work seems to have been of no practical use to Parliament or the people. Therefore, I see no necessity for continuing it . Until the High Court decided otherwise, it was thought that the Commission had a sort of semi-judicial power, the exercise of which - would be advantageous to the community. No doubt, when the Constitution was framed it was intended that the Commission should have that power, but I do not know that if it did have such power it would be of great benefit to the community I shall not go as far as s some honourable members have, and declare straight out that the Commission should be abolished, until I hear from the Minister what is involved in the proposed creation of a Court of Commerce. « If I were asked to vote' now I should decide against the continuance of the Inter-State Commission and against the establishment of the proposed Court. Still , the Minister may be able to make 1 out a good case, and convince the House that the Inter-State Commission, if clothed with the additional powers proposed, may become a useful body - If he can do that, well and good. At any rate, he ought to be given. a chance to make out his case, and, therefore, should have leave to introduce the Bill.",26
68,Mr RYAN,Unknown,West Sydney) [11.50] When the Minister (Mr Groom) rose I asked him to be good enough to give some idea of the proposals contained in the measure. It is very desirable that at the introductory stage Ministers should give the House some indication of the proposed scope of a Bill. Such information is helpful to discussion at the later stages.,27
69,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And incidentally it starts a new debate.,27
70,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Ver y often a statement at the introductory stage obviates subsequent debate. At all events, I am very glad that the Minister (Mr Groom) courteously responded to my request that he should give some information to the House, but I regret that he failed to show any necessity for the measure. It appears to be a measure which is intended to constitute a Court of Commerce. It really does not deal with the Inter-State Commission at all. It constitutes an independent Court, which, of course, will be . composed of the members of the Inter-State Commission. The only commercial matters that they would have power to deal with would be Inter-State commerce or commerce overseas. . Sir ROBERT BEST - They could not be anything else.",27
71,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"No . They therefore cannot deal with matters of general commerce. The conclusion I have come to from the introduction of this measure is that the Government are finding themselves short of business. The Minister is now introducing a Bill for which, admittedly, no one has asked. He has shown no necessity for it, and is merely bringing it in to fill in time. In that respect it is like some other measures that have been on the business-sheet. For instance, . we find that the Nationality Bill was put there because of some conference away back in 1911, with the resolutions of  was not acquainted. Now we have measures of a similar type being introduced, so that it is obvious that the Government are finding themselves short of business.",27
72,Mr CORSEK,Unknown,What is wrong with the Tariff?,27
73,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I also ask, "" What about the Tariff?"" Wa ought to be dealing ' with it. We should be dealing with something of serious import to the public of Australia and not with tiddly-winking measures of this sort. I fully understand that every Minister wants to be in charge of some piece of legislation' in order to show his importance, and to prove to the public that he is doing something. Consequently the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Groom) has introduced this measure. At any rate, that is how it strikes me, and I think that is how it will strike the general public. I have not seen one piece of evidence of any request for a Bill of this sort. Has there been anything in the press to indicate it? Where is it moved from? Who has requested it? Nobody. There is only one conclusion to come to. I do not wish to be discourteous to the Minister, or to defeat his motion at this stage, but I hope wiser counsels will prevail and that when this motion is carried that is the last we shall hear of the measure this session.",27
74,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [11.53] - It is highly humorous to hear members of this House '''whipping their joss."" I do not know whether this measure is a sincere attempt to increase or reduce the powers of the Inter-State Commission, or whether it is merely intended to create a Court of Commerce. But it is a fact that today we have heard the Inter-State Commission attacked. Members who were in Parliament when the Inter-State Commission Act was passed, and also members who were not, ought to know the situation exactly. The Inter-State Commission was intended as a Court to deal with the Tariff and other matters under a for m of new Protection. I remember well what happened in the 1913 election, when we asked the people for increased powers, and I know what we intended to do with those powers if we got them. It was understood at that t i m that the present Prime Minister e (Mr Hughes) was' to be the President of the Inter-State Commission, which was to have vast powers. We were to get the powers from the people in order to make this Parliament a real Parliament for Australia, as it ought to be.",27
75,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That is the time you ""missed the 'bus."" Mr .MATHEWS - iTha t is the time the 'bus was missed, when the other side controlled business by a majority of one. That was the occasion which will never be forgotten when the other side looked for a double dissolution, and got it in the solar plexus afterwards. State Commission is a ridiculous body at present, because it never 'received the powers which it was thought would be conferred upon it through this Parliament obtaining further legislative powers itself. Consequently, its members have been handed m the interim other jobs, which they have performed more or less satisfactorily to themselves and to the community in general. I am not saying a word against the ability of the members of the Comimission. They might very well grace some body which would enable them to do a great amount of good for Australia.",28
76,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,There is only one man left.,28
77,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I understand so. do not know whether there is a chance of the High Court reversing its decision regarding the powers of this Parliament in this direction as well as on the tion of State utilities, as happened, this year. The Hig h Court told us we had no power to legislate for utilities, and that it was never intended t h at we should; but now the High tells us that we have - When we attaken tempted to f i x prices the High Court told us that we had no power to do so. [251] It is possible that a differently constituted Hig h Court may say that we-have that ipower; but unless that decision is given it is evident that the .Inter-State Commission will be a useless body, and it is of no avail to go further with it . If this were a civilized Government, or a Government that intended to bring about civilization, they would have looked for further powers in a manner that would warrant the consideration of the whole House. I know, however, that if they do obtain further powers by means of the proposed Convention, they will be useless, because the Government want no further powers. They are too conservative. They want to leave the control in the hands of the sovereign States, as they are called. I hope that when we get the information which the Minister has been asked for, it will not turn out to be anything ridiculous about increased powers for the Inter-State Commission. If it is simply a question of creating a Court of Commerce, I trust that it will not be bludgeoned through by means of the closure. It is getting late in the session, and I hope the House will have a proper opportunity of discussing any Court of Commerce that may be introThe Inter- duced. I hope, also, that there will , be no tinkering with , or attempting to bolster up, the Inter-State Commission, because we cannot give that body the powers for which it was instituted.",28
78,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darlin g Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [11.57] - I do not propose at this stage, nor is it usual, to go into all the reasons for the introduction of the Bill . The House made a request, which was reasonable enough, that I should indicate the reason and purport of the , Bill , and I did so. I was rather amused by the speech of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan). He scarcely ever rises here without giving us an interesting chapter I from his autobiography. We get from him an analysis of his motives in the past, a description of bow he has acted, and how he has conducted parquesliamentary proceedings, and naturally earlier he immediately assumes that everybody that else is actuated by the same motives, State and follows the same methods and the same devious ways. I can assure the Court honourable member that he is quite misso far as this measure is concerned. We can look with satisfaction upon the record of what has already been achieved by this Parliament this year in the way of legislation. If we have been blocked in our legislation, the honourable member knows the hours and the time that he has wasted-or , rather, I should say, expended-by various want-of-confidence motions, blocking-motions, delaying-motions, and dilatory tactics of every description. If there has been any delay in legislation, the honourable member hiuriself must take the responsibility. There is plenty of business to deal with, and we are anxious to press forward with this Bill. When the Inter-State Commission Act was introduced, all parties absolutely agreed on the necessity for the Commission having the judicial powers proposed. Part 5 of the Act, the part which the High Court held invalid, was regarded as most important, as it enabled the Commission to function and exercise its duties properly. Even in the very early stages of Federation the members of the Federal Convention indicated these powers as necessary, and no one even questioned them seriously until the matter came before the High Court, which, of course, acting judicially, took a different view. The Government is anxious to restore the Inter-State Commission to enable it to function as Parliament originally intended it to do. It has not been able to fulfil certain of its functions because it has not the power. If r . MOWH.LL4.MS - How long since they discovered they had not the power ?",28
79,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That was discovered during the war, arising out of the seizure of wheat by the New South Wales Government. The question arose whether the New South Wales Government had the power to apparently flout the provision in. the Constitution regarding freedom of trade between the States. The Inter-State Commission was beginning to function properly when the decision of the High Court was given, and practically took away all the judicial power that the Commission possessed.",29
80,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,Parliamen t cannot give the Commission that power.,29
81,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Government believe that by the exercise of the judicial powers under the Constitution they can in the way proposed restore the power to the Inter-State Commission to be exercised as originally intended.,29
82,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,That is for the High Court to decide.,29
83,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Of course. I shall not argue the matter further at this stage, but simply indicate the intention of the Government. I am circulating a brief statement prepared by the Parliamentary Draftsman, indicating the effect of the legislation we propose to introduce. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented, and read a first time. ELECTORAL (WAR-TIME) REPEAL BILL.  Home and Territories) [12.5] - I move That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to repeal the Commonwealth Electoral (War-time) Act 1917-1919. I see my honourable friend opposite (Mr. Ryan) on the alert for an explanation.",29
84,Mr RYAN,Unknown,It is most unfair to make this attack on me.  not insult the intelligence of the House by attempting to explain at this stage what this Bill is intended to accomplish. Question resolved in the affirmative. - COMMONWEALTH BA NK BILL . SECOND READING.,29
85,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramattaago is it - Treasurer) [12.7] - I move*That this Bill be now read a second time. This little measure is certainly not new, nor. is it unexpected. It is a modest little proposal for transferring the machinery of the note issue to the control of an Issue Department to be created at the Commonwealth Bank. It introduces no new banking principles; it is, as I have indicated, merely a machinery measure. Anything which approaches a new banking principle is in that clause relating to reserves, which I propose, in Committee, to eliminate.",29
86,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,What clause is that?,29
87,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"The clause requiring that banks shall keep a certain proportion of notes in their reserves. Later on, I shall explain to honourable members why I withdraw that clause. In the meantime I repeat that, ever since the institution of the note issue, in 1910, this proposed transfer has been agitated on many an occasion. I have myself always held that the note issue should be a function of the Commonwealth Bank, and should be removed entirely from purely political control, and placed in the hands of a body, of men with no motives whatever, but to operate it in the interests of the community generally. I venture to say that that has been the opinion of this House for many years, but the opportunity has not heretofore occurred to make the transfer. There seems to be an appropriate time and place - a psychological moment, shall I say?when these things come to fruition; and so it has come about, after the lapse of nine or ten years, that we now propose to make this transfer, the advocacy of which, as I say, has always commanded a respectful hearing in this House. There is, therefore, nothing new in the proposal I submit to honourable members. - Mr FLEMING.:-'Before the Treasurer leaves that point, will be explain when clause 60Q will come into operation?",29
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I suggest that the honourable member wait until that matter is before us. This Bill practically repeals the Australian Notes Act, and hands over the control of the issue of notes to a separate Department, to be created under the measure, with the sole right of controlling the issue from time to time, and the conditions on which the issue shall be made. I think there can be no question as to the desirability of this course, or as to the advantages which the Commonwealth Bank possesses over the Treasury in respect of such matters. For instance, the Bank has branches all over Australia,-whereas the Treasury has not. The Bank's interests and facilities are veloping day by day, and there is no such expansion possible in connection with the Treasury. Moreover, as a business concern, the Commonwealth Bank is in closer touch, I venture to say, with the money markets of the world, from time to time, than the Treasury can be. It is in closer touch with the other banks, which are mostly concerned in these issues of notes, and, in addition, is, perhaps, closer to the public generally of Australia than the Treasury Department can claim to be. This matter of the currency is in itself a very vital one to the community. It has been called the life-blood of trade and commerce, and that is not an inapt simile. It is a matter of the utmost [251]- 2 consequence to the community, affecting, as it does so profoundly, its commercial and social existence. The very essence of a successful note issue-perhap s I should make this point hereand now-consist s in its elasticity. Honourable members from time to time criticise the rise and fall of the issue of the paper money of the world, but, really, if the note issue is not to expand and to deflate or contract again, it is of no use whatever to the community. As a banker said the other day, unless the note issue has that quality of elasticity, so as to respond to the needs and financial requirements of the community, it is really of very little use. Here, for instance, is what that banker said.",30
89,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Who is he? - Sir JOSEPH COOK-The gentleman who made the statement is Mr Walter Leaf, President of the County, Westminster, and Parr's Bank, London, who, when discussing this matter when ithe accounts were presented to the shareholders, saidHo was not a believer in proposals for the artificial restriction of the currency. To fix an upper limit would be like trying to cure a fever by plugging .your clinical thermometer at normal, and the only result would be that you would burst your thermometer. The only remedy, he added, was to stop the issue of claims to currency in the form of Government expenditure and Government credits. There is, however, also the partial remedy of raising by means of extra diligence in industry, as expressed in greatly augmented production, the ratio of goods to outstanding currency. Here is one of the foremost bankers of the world declaring that to place an artificial limit on the currency of the country de- was like plugging a clinical thermometer at normal. The very essence of the note issue depends upon its elasticity, because it must rise and fall with the volume of the world's business, and there must be some facile means to adjust it from time to time, according to the requirements of trade and commerce. The proper body to do this must be kept in close touch with the business and commercial life of the community, and all this indicates the advisableness of the transfer to the control of some central banking body possessed of all the requisites which I have enumerated. The Bill provides that there shall be a separate and distinct department of the bank, which will have nothing whatever to .do witli the hanking portion of the institution. It will not necessarily involve a greatly increased expenditure, and very probably the issue will cost less to operate than at. present, because the whole of the staff and the machinery will be transferred. It is intended to create a Board of Directors, but not a costly body, such as one generally associates with Boards of Directors and sub-departments of Government. The Governor of the Bank is to be Chairman of the Board of Directors, and it is provided in the Bill that another director shall be an officer of the Treasury, because, I think it well to keep up the liaison between the Treasury and the Bank. The other two members of the Board will be men of high commercial repute from outside, who will devote their time to this work, but they will not be continuously engaged in their duties as directors of the Note Issue Department. They will be in much the same position as Savings Bank trustees. . Sir ROBERT BEST - Drawin g fees for their attendance.",30
90,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,For their services.,31
91,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But only two actually drawing salaries.,31
92,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . There will be only two drawing salaries, and not necessarily from the fund at all. Honourable members will, I trust, eliminate from their minds the impression that the creation of this new Department is to involve additional expenditure to the Government or to the Note Fund, as the hope is confidently held that the work can be conducted at less expense than at present, and if not at less cost, certainly without any increase. The creation of a distinct sub-department of the Commonwealth Bank does not, therefore, involve any additional expense to the country. It must also be remembered that the notes, although issued by this sub-department of the Commonwealth Bank, will be none the less Australian notes. They are not to be Commonwealth Bank notes, because of the transfer; but will still be national notes, signed by the Governor of the Bank on the one hand and the Secretary to the Treasury, or some other officer appointed for the purpose, on the other. There will be two signatures on the notes, as I have mentioned, thus making them truly Australian national notes. There is a provision in the Bill that in case of emergency we shall be able to do what every other Government in the world has been able to do in time of emergency, and that is to resume control and responsibility, if there should be a war or some other upheaval requiring instantaneous action on the part of the Government. In ordinary times in London the Bank of England, which is the Bank of the nation and of the Government, controls the note issue, but on the outbreak of war the control and responsibility of that Bank is assumed by the Imperial Government. During the last war the Government assumed control, and issued notes-Brad bury's as they are commonly called-to the extent of £362,000,000 sterling. No machinery can stand in the way of a Government financing itself in times of grave emergency, and, therefore, it is provided that we shall have the necessary reserve power to resume control and responsibility should the necessity arise.",31
93,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Eve n in emergencies other than those arising out of war?,31
94,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I cannot conceive of any other emergency apart from war, and if there is such a contingency it is so remote that we need not trouble about it. I hope it may never occur, ,but provision has been made for cases of extreme national crisis. The profits of the Note Issue Department will continue to go back to the Government as at present. The Department will pay for itself, and the 'expenses of running it, and of meeting the cost involved by the Board. This will come out of a small commission, such as is usually charged for the transaction of such business, and the resulting profits will be paid over to the Treasury. The motives of mere profit-making will thus be removed from the Board controlling the issue of notes, and that is as it ought to be. Our one and only object will be to see that the circulation of the currency of the country ds such as is necessary by reason of the trading activities of the country, and when the Board is exercising its functions there will be no motive in issuing notes for the purpose of profit. Profits, of course, will arise incidentally, and those profits, it is provided, shall not redound to the benefit of those who make them, but shall revert to the Consolidated Revenue.",31
95,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Will this Bill give the Board power to issue more notes than we are at present issuing?,32
96,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , or less, if they so desire.",32
97,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,On what conditions?,32
98,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On the same conditions as at present. All the existing safeguards are maintained. This Bill involves no new principles and cuts across no old principles. It simply transfers bodily to the Board the whole note issue. It interferes with practically nothing except the control, which it transfers from the Treasury to a new issue Department. That is really the purpose of the Bill. There are some amendments that I propose to move when we go into Committee. . Sir ROBERT BEST - Is the Treasurer going to deal with the question of reserves ?",32
99,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have already indicated that I propose in Committee to move to eliminate altogether clause 60(o). After discussing the question with the banks and receiving from them satisfactory assurances, I see no reason for persisting in it. It is a provision which relates after all to new banking principles, and,, therefore, should find its propriate place in a new banking measure, and not in a mere machinery Bill such as this purports to be. I am not so sure that the time is not near when a new banking Act, designed to bring some of our methods and customs more into line with the advanced banking of the world, would be a good thing for this country. We are still behind, in some measure, countries like America and Great Britain, which have gone far ahead of the existing position here. My reason just now for not tackling the question of reserves is because it will find its appropriate place in the new banking Bill which may at some time* or other be introduced, rather than in this simple proposal for transferring the machinery of the note issue to a sub-Department of the Commonwealth Bank.",32
100,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Is that the Banks' objection to the clause-that it should be in another Bill?,32
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is one of them. I say quite frankly that this is not a time to get into conflict with the banking institutions of the country. The position of things is far too serious for that. Instead of bringing the matter forward now i't should be left for a more convenient season. It may not be out of place to show how this Bill will stand in relation to what is taking place up and down th© world generally. Things are moving and have moved through the war with regard to many of these questions, but altogether, I think, we have reason to congratulate ourselves on our present financial position in Australia. In my judgment, there is no country today that, notwithstanding all the stress and strain of the war, has its general financial affairs on so sound a basis as Australia. On this question of currency generally, we shall perhaps see the advantage of some of the things we have done if we glance for a few minutes at what is being done elsewhere. I have already spoken of the essential requirement of elasticity in any note issue, so that it may meet the seasonal and other necessities of the country from time to time. Take our present wheat harvest and our wool clip as an illustration of what I mean. In Canada, when her harvests are being gathered in, notes are scatap- tered all over the country. They are not legal tender notes, but notes which are permitted to be issued by the banks themselves. The security for these notes is in the Central Banking Reserve of Canada, and 50 per cent, of that reserve consists of national notes.",32
102,Mr MOWILLIAMS,Unknown,The real security is the wheat.,32
103,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In the lasi analysis the honourable member is perfectly right. However much we may put sovereigns against notes, a pound's worth of production is equal to a sovereign in substantiality, if not in immediate facility. As my honourable friend suggests, in the final .resort the real backing of the bill is the solid - substantial production of the country. And so it comes about that these notes are.issued by the million in Canada during the harvest time; but they aTe all gathered in again as the harvest is sold, and the exchanges are made up and down the world. Let us look, first of all, at what is done in Great Britain. We must always turn our eyes to the Motherland when discussing these questions. She has come through crises like these so often in her history-survivin g them and revivifying herself in the process-that we .cannot do better than look to such an example.",32
104,Mr LAZZARIKT,Unknown,"Sh e has survived them by repealing the Bank Act, which stipulated for a gold reserve every time.",33
105,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have already said that in times of crises that has to be done in every country; but what we have to do in times of crises is no indication of what we ought to do when the crisis is over. The position is then altogether different.,33
106,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Is there any truth in the statement that they want to collar our gold over there?,33
107,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We do not propose to let them take it. As honourable members are aware, the Bank of England itself is the banker of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is in its construction a private bank, yet it has so fulfilled its functions in the past as to make it, to all intents and purposes, a Government institution. That is to say, it has always acted with due regard to Government interests first and foremost, and does so today, making from time to time appropriate profits, which, however one may criticise them, are in their very nature of the most moderate kind, the balance finding its way always into useful channels for the country's interest. It may be well to remember that during the war the Bank of England placed upon itself the self-denying ordinance of refusing to make any profit whatever over that which it made in pre-war days. One should never forget that example of the great Bank of England. In normal times the Bank of England is the sole issuer of the currency of England. When the war broke out, however, different conditions obtained. The Government issued currency notes to the extent of £362,000,000 over and above the £140,000,000 worth of notes issued by the Bank of England. Against the £362,000,000 of currency notes there is very little in the nature of substantial assets. A certain amount of gold is held. It amounts today, I believe, to £28,500,000 in coin and bullion.",33
108,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,B y whom is that held!,33
109,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"B y the Treasury, at Home.",33
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,All modern writers now are agreeing that the gold reserve is very largely a myth.,33
111,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"B y no means. Modern writers agree that, whether you have gold in circulation or not, however much you may load your note issue for the purposes of usefulness in trading activities those notes must bear a definite relation to gold. It must appear strange to the honourable member-hold ing such views as, apparently, he doesthat all the experienced bankers of the world stick to that delusion, if delusion it be; and I cannot believe that it is, since the whole of the banking world hugs it so closely, and has always done so, right down the centuries. Now, I have indicated the conditions existing in England. There is a total of £362,000,000 in currency notes, and there is very little gold or bullion, to back those notes. But the Bank of England has almost a sovereign behind every one of its notes. While behind the currency notes of the British Government very little gold is held, there is, however, the security of the nation, and there are the trading activities of Great Britain behind that again. I emphasize the point that the security is not based upon any gold issue, and that the reason why no effort has been made to put gold behind those notes is that they were issued temporarily, and that it was hoped to get them in again at the earliest possible moment. That is the problem of the British financial authorities, as it is, indeed, of the whole world. The United States of America is, perhaps, further advanced in banking reform than any other country of the world. In this regard I shall quote the late Sir Edward H . Holden, who, prior to his recent demise, was one of the leading British bankers. He was chairman of the London Joint City and Midland Bank Limited. This unquestionable authority saysIt will not be out of place to refer once more to the system under which Federal reserve notes are issued. When it was decided by the American Government, after the crisis of 1907,"" that a new banking system was required in the interests of the country, the framers of the new law kept before them the necessity of adopting a system under which the note issue would be dependent upon the. demand of trade, automatically expanding and contracting according to the real requirements of the country. Their object was to ensure that when trade is brisk the notes will be increased. I trust that our newspaper nnancial critics will not be unduly nervous wben reading that statement. The man who was perhaps the foremost banker in England voices this view: Their object was to ensure that when trade is brisk the notes will be increased. Sir Edward Holden continues: and when trade slackens the notes will be returned to the Bank. To effect this object the Government agreed to issue notes to the Federal Reserve Banks on the security of commercial bills of exchange and gold, Will honourable members please note that point-' ' Bills of exchange and gold "" ; not, "" Bills of exchange or gold "" . Edward Holden proceeds: and these banks put the notes into circulation. The theory was that additional currency could be obtained when trade required it, by the discount of bills of exchange, but that the bills of exchange, being of short date, their payment, when due, would necessarily cause a contraction of the notes issued against them. A large and increasing volume of trade entails an increased use of bills of exchange, and requires an expansion in currency. To provide for the expansion of the currency an issue of notes against bills of exchange seems to be the simplest and safest way or meeting trade requirements, but the total issue should be limited in proportion to the amount of the gold reserve. That is fair. Every banker of repute sticks to the fundamental point that whatever loading of paper, above, there may be, thei'e should be a definite relation to the gold, at the bottom and underneath. Sir Edward adds:When trade diminishes in volume, and the total of bills of exchange outstanding is reduced, the total of notes outstanding must also automatically be reduced. It will be observed that in this system the currency in circulation is not increased unless there has been a previous increase in the volume of goods produced, as the bills of exchange which are discounted for currency must be commercial bills representing goods. Hence there is no similar effect, upon prices consequent on an increase in currency obtained in this way, as would be the case when notes are issued against securities not representing goods, as Treasury bills. The point made here is that there is no necessary inflation when a note issue is merely large. That is to say, when there have been goods produced worth £ 1 , to put a £ 1 note against them is not in flation of such a kind as to affect prices.",33
112,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,Would not that refer particularly to export trade?,34
113,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,To all kinds of trade.,34
114,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"What if we eat the goods which are worth the £ 1 note? The note is still there, but the goods have gone.",34
115,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In those circumstances you will have eaten the note, because it will have been withdrawn. The idea expressed here - is that you shall issue your notes against bills of exchange. When a bill of exchange is cancelled, your note comes in again and is also cancelled. That' is the true use and function of a note, and the parallel with us would be that your paper issue would go out in ' harvest time and come in again when your harvest was over, and Sir sales had taken place overseas, and when your. exchanges had been made all oyer the world. This expert banker pointed out that to have a large issue against a large volume of business, seasonal or otherwise, is not necessarily to inflate the issue i h such a way as to affect prices at all.",34
116,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,In f l at i on occurs when more notes are issued than the demands of business require.,34
117,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is so. When we force notes upon the country which the country does not want, for purposes of circulation, down goes their value. They create a fictitious and mischievous credit, and serve no useful purpose. He continues- ' As I said last year, the experience of most State banks is that commercial bills of exHolden change are the best security on which to issue currency after gold. You can. see the opinion that there must be a gold backing running through every word of this statement. He says in effect, "" M a k e your note-issue as elastic as possible. Y o u need not circulate your gold, but there must always be gold behind the notes, in order to redeem them whenever the public may demand it . "" To continue the quotationAnd it has been on this, basis that the such Americans have worked, and have built up their Federal Reserve Banks. He then proceeds to quote a statement made by Senator Robt. L . Owen, in America, who pioneered the Federal Reserve Bill through the Senate, and summed up the whole purpose as f o l lows :The central idea of the system is elastic currency issued against commercial paper and gold, expanding and contracting according to the needs of commerce. The reserve note is the most powerfully fortified note in the world. There is no probability of any want of confidence arising with regard to this note, and it was intended that there should be none. - Uncler the reserve system a financial panic is impossible. People will not hoard currency, nor hoard gold when they know that they can get currency or get gold when required. This was an important object of those who prepared the Keserve Act. America no longer believes a financial panic possible, and, therefore, the business men, being perfectly assured as to the stability of credits, do not hesitate to enter manufacturing and commercial enterprises from which they would be deterred under old conditions^ of unstable credit. The system has expanded the use of acceptances and of cheques and drafts, has stimulated industry, provided enlarged emplo3'ment of labour, increased output, and greatly enhanced the financial prestige of American banks. It has enabled the United States to place gigantic bond issues arid This is characteristically Americanfinance the world war. 'The Federal Reserve Banks of America are compelled by law to hold a cash reserve of 35 per cent, against their deposit liabilitios and 40 per cent, in gold against > their outstanding notes. The ordinary banks carry little or no gold, the Federal Reserve Banks having practically all the gold in America. The other banks carry simply the notes issued against this gold. There is a requirement in their Act, just as there is in the latest Currency Act of Great Britain, that over a certain amount shall have behind it a national note-in Great Britain a Bank of England note, and in America a note issued by the Federal Bank Reserve. Thus credit has been mobilized in a way that was never possible before, reserves being controlled and concentrated instead of being distributed - all the banks. The dollar has been made to do several times as much work asit did formerly. This arrangement, although a useful one to the country, has nevertheless proved a cause' of the inflation of prices, and even before the war there was a slight increase of prioes in America due to it. And, ing that throughout the war gold poured Sir Joseph Cook. ""into the TJnited States from every other part of the world, prices in that country are today the top prices of the world. In Canada, as I have already said, notes are issued both by the Government and by the banks, the latter being compelled to hold at .least 50 per cent, of their cash reserves in Dominion Government ncites. These private banks are allowed to issue notes, but the notes are not legal tender, and they must keep in their cash reserves 50 per cent, of Dominion notes. Behind the Dominion notes is the gold reserve, which is the basis of the whole currency. Thus they mobilize their credit, and permit the banks to issue notes which are really in their nature similar to the certificates which we propose to give to the farmers for the wheat delivered at the railway sidings. These certificates are not legal tender in any sense of the word, but are redeemable by the banks after the wheat and other produce have been sold.",34
118,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They are simply advance credit notes.,35
119,Sir JOSEP HCOOK,Unknown,"That is really what they are, and in essence they are the same as the certificates which we propose to give to the farmers.",35
120,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,What percentage of gold do the Dominion banks hold?,35
121,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is no legal minimum reserve which must be held against deposit liabilities, but the statements of the chartered banks of Canada for November last show that they then held deposits amounting to 2,104,063,028 dollars, or £420,812,000. against £74,795,000 in gold and Dominion Issue notes. The total gold in the Canadian everything banks, including the central reserve is, if I remember rightly, about 43 per cent, of the total note issue, as against 77 per cent, in Australia. The cash reserves held by the banks against their current and fixed deposits, - together with the note issue, is equal to about 18 per cent, of their deamong posits and note liabilities. Therefore, our proposal that the banks should hold 15 per cent, in cash reserves cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be termed unreasonable or extravagant. In other countries this is provided for in a general banking measure, and that is one of the reasons why I propose to eliminate notwithstand- the provision from this Bill , to incorporate it , perhaps, later in a general 'banking measure when the time is convenient for its introduction. In Australia the banks throughout the Commonwealth, exclusive of the Commonwealth Bank, had on deposit, both by way of current accounts and fixed deposit, during the quarter ended the 30th June last, an average amount of £214,243,000, against which they held in coin, bullion, and Australian notes, £51,126,129, which is equal to 23.86 per cent, of the total deposits actually held, as against 18 per cent, in Canada, again showing that our position is a very strong one. The ordinary Australian banks, including the Commonwealth Bank, held during the June quarter of 1920 an average amount in Australian notes, in round figures, of- £34,500,000, and, in addition to this, held gold and bullion to the extent of about £19,500,000. Of the £34,500,000 worth of Australian notes,, approximately £23,500,000 were in £1,000 notes, and I am informed by the banks that they find these notes very handy for clearing purposes, in place of using gold certificates, which were formerly in use between the banks for this purpose. In order to ascertain the true note circulation of the Commonwealth, the amount of £34,500,000 held by the banks, or most of it , should be deducted from the total issue. The notes actually in the hands of the general public, amounting to £22,000,000, represent the true circulation. In Prance, another country with a highly inflated paper currency, the issue is mad© wholly by the Bank of France, which, although a private corporation, and privately owned, is, like the Bank of England, so intimately connected with Government activities and operations, that it has come to be regarded as the actual Bank of France in fact as well as in name. The Bank of France has no fixed legal reserves of gold, but the total note issue must be covered by gold, silver, securities, and commercial papers. As a matter of fact, it carries very large metallic reserves, composed of both gold and. silver, and, since it may lawfully pay its obligations either in gold or silver, it can always protect its gold holding when necessary. The latest figures of the Bank of France, published under date the Sth January of this year, show that the actual note circulation at that time, converted into pounds sterling, was £1,520,396,000, against which the following reserves were held:Gold in France .. £144,035,000 Gold abroad 79,131,000 Silver 10,582,000 Bills of exchange 64,687,000 Making a grand total of . . £298,435,000 The same conditions apply to other countries. Perhaps the following table of figures, showing the note issues of the world towards the end of 1919, will be interesting to honourable members:WAR COUNTRIES. United Kingdom . . £494,829,000 Bank of France . . 1,495,137,000 Bank of It a l y 478,217,000 Other Italian' 300,000,000 Bank of Germany 1,623,018,000 Austro-Hungarian Bank 2,117^37,000 Bank of Belgium 18S,549,000 Bank of Greece . .

This world-wide inflation, which no doubt has sent prices soaring, has affected prices in Australia in common with the rest of the world; but when we are discussing our own note issue we should never forget that, although we are. susceptible to the effect of the world's issue of notes upon prices generally, our own issue is but a mere drop in the bucket. Now, may I go on to remark that instead of the note issues of the world going down, they are still going up.",35
122,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Not during the last twelve months?,37
123,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"Yes , even since I delivered the Budget speech.",37
124,Mr TDDOE,Unknown,Our own note issue has gone up since then.,37
125,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . It is less today than it was when the Budget speech was made. I have some very instructive figures which I should like honourable members to hear. During the present year the note issues in European countries have increased as follows:-Ital y by £86,000,000, France by £30,000,000, Great Britain by £25,000,000, Germany by £500,000,,000. On the other hand, our note issue has gone down a little. At any rate, it has not gone up above what it was nine months ago, and since the Armistice it has steadily declined until today it shows a 10 per cent, decrease on the amount of the issue at that time. In every other country of the world there has been a sharp increase, and the upward tendency does not appear to have been checked. Of course there are reasons for this. The world is still upside down. Production is still dislocated. ""Wars and rumours of wars still prevail. The time has not yet come whenThe common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe. Unsettlement continues with the resultant adverse effect on trading activities. In the meantime, people must live by getting commodities to keep them alive and by getting capital to establish new industries or revive old ones, and, in order to do so, they must create fictitious paper credits, which can only be deflated subsequently and finally when the production of the world has overtaken consumption. Until that time comes these shifts and expedients, for they are only such, must continue to do duty in order to save and secure the trade and business of the world. The point thafemerges from all this is that nearly every country in the world has some issuing agency, which acts for all the other banking agencies contained in the various States in which they are located, and what we are proposing to do here is only in keeping with the best experience and opinion of the banking world. I believe we are on the right track in transferring the Note Issue Department from the Treasury and placing it in the hands of men of experience and knowledge, who, being outside all intruding political influences, will have no motive whatever but to operate it in keeping with the legitimate trading requirements of the country. It will lead to a great deal more contentment with the note issues to know that they are being operated for no political reason, and that no political consideration whatever enters into the adjustment and manipulation of them, but only considerations of public trading and business activities, which are the final and determining causes of the movements, up or down, of the note issues of the Commonwealth.",37
126,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m.,37
127,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was pointing out that elsewhere the note issues have increased, and that no successful effort has yet been made to reduce the paper currencies of the world. The very latest figures I can find on the subject indicate that since I delivered my Budget speech, at the beginning of September, France ha:s increased her note issue by nearly £1,000,000; Spain, which was not in the war at all, by £3,136,000; Sweden, another neutral country, by £2,000,000; and Norway by £1,000,000. In the six months from 31st December, 1919, to 30th June last, the following increases have taken place: - Germany , £899,000,000, estimating the mark at par value, which, I admit, is fictitious; Austria-Hungary, £319,000,000; the United Kingdom, £20,000,000; and the latest figures show that for this year alone the total increase is over £25,000,000; United States of America, £17,000,000; France, £11,000,000; Belgium, £16,000,000; Roumania, £13,000,000; Portugal, £11,000,000; Australia, £345,956. Since that date our note issue has decreased by about £2,000,000. The outstanding fact is that, notwithstanding the pinching up of credits, as far as the banks could possibly do it, all over the world it has been found necessary to still further increase the note issue.",37
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What has been the result in those countries?,37
129,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Soarin g prices; that is inevitable. The two countries, which, today, are living absolutely on fictitious credits in the shape of papermoney, are the places where paper money is practically valueless. I refer to Germany and Eussia. There is no doubt whatever that inflation of any kind, even of the gold issue, beyond the ordinary requirements of solid stable business must necessarily express itself in disordered prices.",37
130,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In the countries to which the Treasurer has referred is the note issue under absolute Government control, or do the private banks please themselves ?",38
131,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"Nearl y all those note issues are .under Government control. That is certainly the case in Great B r it a in and Germany through the Eeichsbank. The explanation is that the world is hungry for goods, and has no money with which to pay for them. It has, therefore, to create these paper issues, which are really IOU's, and u n t i l the Government can return to a stable, steady, normal basis the increased note issues of the world must express themselves in increased prices. The great pro1 blem of today is the deflation of the currency. It is all summed up in a statement. I read last night, by Senator H a r d ing, the prospective President of the United States of America, that "" w e in flated in haste, and we must deflate in deliberation."" We hear every day demands that the note issue shall be deflated at the earliest possible moment. I admit that that is our problem, but can we deflate the note issue in a night? We inflated it , as we had to do, during the war period for reasons which are quite apparent. Eirst of all, we made up our mind at the beginning of the war that we could not shut down the public works of - the States. Therefore, in order to continue those works, £20,000,000 worth of notes was issued to the State Governments against the public works of the States. Will any one suggest that we can instantly call in those notes?",38
132,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,There is a very solid asset behind them.,38
133,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There may be, but that is not the kind of asset that ought to be behind them. That issue of notes may be said to be due solely to war is not immediately realizable. emergencies; nobody would be justified today in handing £20,000,000 f r o Notes Fund to the States for public works. That is the very thing we snould avoid; we ought not to tie up the assets which are placed behind the notes. AU the banks of the world adopt the policy of putting their notes behind their trading bills, so that as the one cancels, the other also automatically cancels. The note goes out and does its work, and when it comes back it is destroyed. But our note issue is tied up in assets which are not i m mediately realizable, although I have no doubt that as time goes on we shall be able to realise on them. This is how the note issue is invested at the present moment :Commonwealth Government In' scribed Stock £3,830,000 Commonwealth Government Inscribed Stock and Bonds (War Issue) 63,640 Commonwealth Treasury-bills for Works 4,918,263 Commonwealth Treasury-bills for War Purposes 902,629 State Government SecuritiesNew South Wales Treasury bills 7,400,00 0 Victorian Government Debentures (face value, £800,000) . . 784,00 0 Victorian Government Debentures 3,900i000 Victorian Government Securities - 583,000 Queensland Government Securities 1,490,000 South Australian Treasury-bills 2,600,000 Western Australian Stock 590,000 Western Australian Treasury bills 3,100,000 Western Australian Government Securities . . 335,000 Tasmanian Inscribed Stock f 160,000 I 300,000 Tasmanian Treasury-bills 1,000,000 Tasmanian Government Securities 469,000 Advances and Fixed DepositsSundry Banks .'. 5,426,600 £37,852,133 Victorian Government debentures are redeemable five years after the end of the war, but not later than 1925. So it is with most of this debt; it does not mature before 1925. It is that kind of locked up security against which our notes were issued during a period of war and upset. Therefore, the bulk of our note issue today is set against a kind of security which Under normal conditions that is not a sound m the basis on which to issue currency. The note issue increased only because a war was in progress, and it was necessary to take extraordinary measures to continue public works, just in the same way as the currency notes were issued by the I mperial Government. The ordinary banking conditions appertaining to the Bank of England could not meet the extraordinary conditions that had arisen in the Mother Country. So the Imperial Government issued notes of its own to the amount of £362,000,000. The I m perial Parliament recently passed a Bill which provided that the issue, as it then stood, namely, £320,000,000-it has since been increased-shoul d be the standard for the issuing of notes in the subsequent year. If the issue exceeds that amount, for every note issued a corresponding Bank of England note is to be set against it. There is no gold or bullion backing at all, but just the Bank of England note, which, of course, is almost equal to gold, because behind every Bank of England note is about a sovereign.",38
134,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If ihe Bank issues a note against every sovereign, and the I mperial Government issue other notes against the Bank of England notes, there will not be a sovereign to back each note:",39
135,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is what I am pointing out. England today has issued £362,000,000 worth of Treasury bills, which have very little bullion backing at all. There is some parallel between them and our note issue during the war. Therefore, when people outside Parliament ask airily and thoughtlessly why we do not reduce the note issue, the main answer is the reason I have stated, namely, that the note issue has been set against an asset which will not be realizable for some time. Every effort ought to be made to get the paper currency reduced; but I frankly confess that there does not appear to be very much prospect of making any appreciable onslaught on the present bulk of the note issue, having regard to the immediate requirements of our trade and commerce. We propose to issue wheat certificates almost immediately. The banks are going to honour this promise with an immediate cash payment of 2s. 6d. per bushel.",39
136,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Will that be addition to the present circulation?,39
137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . But, in order that the banks may carry on their ordinary customers, and meet these wheat certificates at the moment, they may have to ask the Government for a further temporary issue of notes until the wheat sales can be realized.",39
138,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,It only means that you want a little more credit to enable you to do a bigger business.,39
139,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is exactly the position. Having regard to the tremendous wheat harvest, we may see the note issue even higher than it is today. That, after all, will not mean any inflation of the issue, since behind every note that may be issued there is a solid and almost immediately realizable asset, which will cancel it the moment the realization is made. And, therefore, as Sir Edward Holden points out, as long as you have your note issue set against your tradingbills-the one automatically cancelling the otherno increase in prices results from such an issue. In other words, if your note issue is set against your trading bills and gold - for gold is the basis beneath it all the - time-ther e is no necessary inflation. Inflation does not mean bigness or volume of issue. It occurs only ' when paper money is being forced on a country which does not want it , and, therefore, depreciates accordingly. In addition to the £20,000|000 of which I have spoken, there is another item of £3,500,000', which consists of advances to banks for financing wheat, wool, war loans, gratuities, and such-like things. All that is realizable, and as the money comes back, unless, in the meantime, the banks want more for the purpose of financing the present harvest, it should lead to an automatic reduction of the note issue. It looks, however, as if the banks will want more, and not less, until .the tremendous harvest has been dealt with.",39
140,Mr STEWART,Unknown,What will the Government charge the banks for such advances ?,39
141,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Fiv e and a half per cent. For every note that they may want to finance the harvest, they will pay 5$ per cent., just as we have to pay them 6 per cent, for any accommodation we may require. There is yet another item, "" Issue to banks in exchange for gold, and for the an purchase of gold through the mints."" Most .of that gold is in the Treasury. There is no inflation in respect of that item, since we have a sovereign behind every note. We need not worry about the effect it will have upon prices, because the effect will be practically n i l . We have also issued £6,600,000 to ourselves to provide -.for the construction of our own publio works during th© war. That, again,, honourable members will see, is .tied up, and will be for some time to come. ', Mr JOWETT - That is in addition to the £20,000,000 and the item £3,500,000 to which the Treasurer has referred?",39
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes ; there is as nearly as possible £30,000,000 of these notes set against the publio works of Australia.",40
143,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,A asset.,40
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Non-liquid , and .non-realizable for the present. To deflate this.note issue, one or two things would haye to be done, and when I mention them, honourable members will see that after all the deflation would not really be a deflation. . If we were to attempt it , it would be only a bluff. For instance, we could immediately return to the - banks the £10,000,000 in gold that we got from them at the beginning of the war, and cancel the note issue to the extent of £10,000l000. But would that make any impression on the prices rulin g in this .country? The mere taking of the gold out of the Commonwealth Treasury and putting it into the coffers of the banks would not express itself in any shape or form in the prices of the country. We could also float another loan, and deal with the public works item in that way. Hut if we were to float another loon of £20,000,000 we should Bimply change an inflation of credit for an inflation of currency. The one would immediately cancel any benefit arising from the other. And so the whole process would go on. All that we can do in_ regard to theso war emergency notes is to make a systematic and bond fide effort to appropriate' these moneys, when they are repaid, for the cancellation of the notes. A great consideration to'be looked to always in the issue of this paper money is that it shall be issued in terms of a definite contract, and that that contract cancels itself when the date of maturity comes round. Your note goes out to do the specific kind of work to which it is specifically allotted When that work is done, the work of your note is done, and it is automatically destroyed,. That is one reason why the publio cannot be accommodated at once in the destruction of our large note issue.. For the Bame reason it cannot be done in any other part of the world. We may, on a comparative review, congratulate ourselves that while the issues of every other country, neutral and belof ligerent, during the late war have gone up, our issue has gone down in the same period. That reminds me of another point, which I shall mention in conclusion. We are hearing today of the stress and strain on credits in London. As honourable memnon-liquid bers know, the position there is' very acute, and we are trying to deal with it. I have had several conferences with the bankers, but it is not we so much as the banks themselves who are in trouble in London. They have permitted large purchases to be made by their customers. _ Those large purchases are now being delivered, and temporarily there is a dearth of credit on the part of the banks in London. They are setting up the plea there that we should export our gold for the purpose of establishing these credits there. That would be a very easy way of doing if , but it would not be fair to Australia to perm it it to be done, for the reason that our gold in Australia today is £54,000 less than it was when the war began. Do honourable members realise what that means? It mieans that all ° the current gold that has been won in thiB country during the war has been shipped awayfor the lost two years, of course,' through the Gold Producers Association--so . that there is an export of gold .going on all the time. Lost year gold to the value of £4,500,000 was exported through .this medium. In addition to that, one or two of the banks here, and also the banks in London, want us not only to ship this gold as we are doing, through the Gold Producers Association, but to ship our reserves of gold through the banks. I do not see my way at the moment to permit that to be done. Moreover; the bulk of the bankers of Australia are opposed to it , for the simple and sufficient reason that, although we have at present plenty of gold cover, we have not too much for our expanding requirements. Our deposits in the banks aTe 55 per cent, more than they were at the beginning of the war, and we hav* practically.the same gold reserves against them. That is one reason why we canaot permit the depletion of this gold reserve as suggested; and, having regard .to our immediate commitments in the shape of the harvest eund to the other developments going on in Australia at present, we want the best basis we can get to cover the circulation of trading activities in Australia. Thus, while it would be easy in this way to relieve ourselves in London st the .moment, I am afraid the position will Tesoilve itself into what is taking place in «very country as well as in our own, and that is that we shall have to cut our voat according to our cloth. If we have not the money to pay for abnormal importations we shall have to slacken off importations, and do without that for which we cannot pay in the ordinary normal way. Meantime the position here is absolutely sound, and wo may congratulate - ourselves upon it. In my judgment, - ever, there will be no deflation of prices banks. .in any country until the supplies of. the ' world have overtaken the demands of the - world. pDhat is the real basic cause of the present increase in prices. It is not .much our currency Mr TunoR - r-3f-uch of the increase prices that has taken place can be counted for by the fact that a lot of men banks. 'were diverted from' productive to non-productive industry.",40
145,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The upset of Commonwealth Bank. war has, been the chief reason. The note issues of the world but measure the cessities of the world. The .those necessities have been relieved, but not till then, the noto issues of the world will begin to decrease. That is the cause of the trouble, and i we must seek the remedy. Meanwhile, in .handing over the control of the note to an independent Board in the Commonout wealth Bank, I think woaTe taking step in the right direction. At any rate, when it is taken the critics will not have to criticise the Treasurer",41
146,Mr HECTOR LAMOSD,Unknown,^-That is not sufficient reason for passing the note over to the Board.,41
147,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I admit that, but I have given, I hope, sufficient addiother bank. tional reasons for our proposal. reasons .are that the Bank' is in closer touch than the Treasury could be with the requirements of the community. It has bettor facilities for operating the note issue, for securing the notes, and seeing that they are placed against bills which are self-cancelling in their character. .I am proposing to take out of the Bill the clause whioh provides that the funds of the note issue may be invested in the ordinary business of the Commonwealth Bank, because I do not think the Bank in that regard should be given privileges which other banks do not possess.",41
148,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,iWh y not ? It is our ownbank. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - I am speaking of ordinary business transactions.,41

155,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is not so. issue I hope the honourable member will point the facts whioh he thinks support a that statement. I may say that, at the proper time, I intend t'o insert a provision to the effect that the resulting funds from the note issue shall' be placed a against ordinary trading bills of aot more issue than 120 days. That will be providing, in the case of our own Bank, exactly what may be done with respect to every The . Mr HECTOB LAMOHB - Then, , in a similar - erisis to that through which wo have , just passed, we would be .unable to do what we did for the advantage of Australia dui-ing the war? ' Sir JOSEPH COOK-That would not be so, because the Treasurer in similar circumstances would resume control and responsibility for the whole business. There is provision to that end in the Bill. All I am here suggesting is that, when the Commonwealth Bank goes outside to compete with other banks for ordinary business, it shall do so on the same terms and conditions; which, of course, is the essence of fairness. And even under such provisions the Commonwealth Bank still has many advantages over the other banks.. I want to see the Commonwealth Bank increase and prosper as the years go by, and that in doing so it. shall minister to the financial stability of the country. I want to see our currency and reserves removed from any possible political interference, and to see the whole scheme placed upon a proper banking footing, such as obtains in other parts of the world today. I commend these proposals to the consideration of the House. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. PASSPORTS BILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed from 26th October, vide page 5976): Clause 5(1) Any person entering the Commonwealth, who is required to be in possession of a passport, shall, if required, give up his passport to an officer, before leaving the vessel in he has entered the Commonwealth.",41

This measure makes provision for persons who are about to leave Australia being required to possess themselves of a passport for the reason that without one they will be unable to enter any ""other country.

176,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [3.24] It seems to me that this clause may work hardship when read in conjunction with a previous clause. The crew of a vessel may be discharged in Australia, or have good reasons for leaving the ship here, or may be landed after a shipwreck, but if they have not provided themselves with passports they cannot remain here. It has frequently occurred in Newcastle that crews have been discharged, or have left their ships because of the treatment they had received, and, under the law as it stands, they have been able to get employment ashore, and have probably, proved worthy citizens. But in future that will be prevented should they not have provided themselves with passports. Provision should be made for dealing with the exceptional cases which will arise from time to time.

179,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Do I understand the Minister to give the assurance that this will be done in all cases where it should be done? ,44
180,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Wimmera) [3.30] The Minister's defence of the clause is that we ought not to allow alien seamen to come to Australia without running the gauntlet of the passport system which applies to other aliens, because, if we did, aliens wishing to enter without passports would do so by coming here as seamen. It must be remembered, however, that a crew of alien seamen might be shipwrecked on our coast.  wrecked crew be dealt with considerately by any Minister?",44
181,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"But in other cases men who have signed on for the round voyage from the United Kingdo m or the Continent to Australia and back again may, for some reason or other, wish to break their contract and land here. There is no provision in the Bill to meet such cases, and if these seamen are not possessed of passports they will be compelled to carry out their contracts and return to the ports at which they signed on. These men ought to be placed in the position of being able to appeal to some tribunal which would enable them to escape from the present system, which is certainly not f a ir to the average alien sailor.  striction Act provides that aliens must be of good health, and must comply with certain conditions before they are eligible to land in Australia. Unless some check is provided quite a number of alien seamen, who might not prove to be good citizens, could be dumped down here. The usual practice in the case of alien seamen discharged in an Australian port and permitted to remain here is to in quire whether they are of good character and are in good health and so forth .",44
182,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"If that practice will apply in the case of seamen who, although not possessed of passports, wish to leave their vessels and remain in Australia, I am satisfied.",45
183,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"West Sydney) [3.33] Will the Minister be willing to reduce the penalty for this offence, which does not seem to be a very serious one?

I suggest the omission of the words "" o r being about so to act."" It would be more graceful if the Minister would agree to their omission, but apparently as he does not seem willin g to do so, I move That the words "" or being about so to aet"" be left out. A policeman might be possessed of a suspicious temperament or turn of mind, or might have a grudge against another person, and if that person shows any intention of committing an offence he has power to anticipate that a crime is about to be committed and effect his arrest.

189,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"West Sydney) {3.43] The Minister has taken rather a wrong view of the point put forward by the honourable member ior Kalgoorlie (Mr. Mahon). The offences that can be comThat mitted against the Act are those ing Australia without a passport and, corning into it without a passport. The words'"" reasonably suspected "" can only apply to persons wanting to land from a ship without a passport, because .there is an actual contravention of the Act when a person has landed without a passport, which he is not allowed to do, and if an officer has a reasonable suspicion that an offence is about to be committed there will always be plenty of time for him to get an information signed, and a warrant issued upon - which the arrest can take ment .place. The view of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie might be .met by providing that any person committing the not apply to offence or about to commit it is liable to arreBt without warrant. The legality of the arrest would then depend on whether in fact the person aTrcsted was about to commil an offence, and not on ihe ground that there was mere suspicion that ho was about to do so.

Bill reported with, further amendments; reports adopted. Standing Orders suspended and Bill read a third time. ALIENS REGISTRATION BILL . SECOND BEADING.  Home and Territories) [3.58] - I moveTbat this Bill be now read a second time. - Por a considerable time there has been inquiry as to when the Government proposed to get rid of the regulations under the WaT Precautions Aet. This Bill proposes to repeal a number of them, namely, Statutory Rules Nos. 176, 216, 232, and 281 of 1916, Nos. 7, 97, 107, 125, 156, and 260 of 1917, and Nos. 155 and 270 of 1918. But it substitutes legislation enacting many of the conditions contained in those regulations. The purpose of the Bill is to control the registration of aliens in the Commonwealth. Registration has been in force for some time; as a' matter of fact, 72,000 aliens are now registered, and the Bill will not require them to reregister. According to a statement made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) when in POTWTON) charge of this measure in another place, one of the greatest difficulties experienced by Great Britain in dealing with the foreign element in time of war was the absence of any scheme for the registra- tion of aliens. In America they had a scheme in operation whereby the authorities coMd ascertain the locality in which an alien was residing, and this assisted them very materially on the outbreak of war. In Great. Britain, the Government were at a great disadvantage, as they had no records, and the consequence was that a long time' elapsed. before a complete list of their alien population could be compiled. Our experience was very similar to that of Great Britain; .and, in the absence of registration, great difficulty was experienced in ascertaining the exact locality of the aliens in our midst. The Bill provides that every alien who arrives in the Commonwealth shall immediately register; and ih this connection I may mention that we do not propose to go as far as the English law. In Great Britain, the alien has not only to register, but the keepers of boardinghouses, hotels, and all residential establishments, have to keep a register of the aliens residing therein, and haye also to report to the authorities their arrival and departure. We make provision, however, that all aliens arriving in the' Commonwealth, whether by boat or by other means, shall register, and that masters of vessels shall provide the authorities' with particulars concerning aliens travelling on vessels of which they are in charge. It is also mandatory on the part of an alien to advise the Department of any change of.abode. In the Bill as originally introduced it provided, as in the English Act, that, in addition to registering, the keepers of residential establishments should keep a record of all aliens living in auch establishments; but that provision was deleted by the Senate. The Bill also provides that the master or member of .a crew of a vessel who is an alien, and who enters the Commonwealth, unless he is exempt, shall register. The responsibility is thrown on the captain of a ship, unless it is a public vessel, of granting every facility for the officers of the Customs or Immigration Departments to ascertain who is travelling on a vessel, and their nationality. The Bill does not apply to tourists, and the conditions that obtain today will remain in force. It is not intended to create a new Department. - Sir ROBERT BEST - How do you intend to distinguish a tourist?  make the necessary application to travel in the Commonwealth for a certain period.",46
191,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"'For how long?  but it is usually from six to twelve months. Instances have arisen where an extension of time has been sought and granted. Any extension of time is determined by the Minister; and, since I have been in charge of the Department, there have not been many cases of this character. In the English law, there are some very drastic provisions; and in section 1 of the Statutory Rules and Orders relating to aliens, it is provided that an alien coming from outside the United Kingdom shall not land in the United Kingdom except with the leave of an immigration officer. It also provides that leave shall not be given to an alien to land in the United Kingdom unless he complies with certain conditions set out in the Statutory Rules and Orders. He has, for instance, to be in the position to support himself and his dependants. Section 5 providesThe master of any ship landing or embarking passengers coming from outside the United Kingdom at any port in the United Kingdom, shall furnish to such person, and in such manner as may be prescribed, a return giving the prescribed particulars in respect to any passengers who are aliens, and any passenger shall furnish to the master of the ship any information required by him for the purpose of the return. There is a similar provision in this Bill, and it enables the authorities to record the aliens arriving in Australia. English Statutory Rules and Orders also relate to the registration of aliens, the responsibility of boardinghouse-keepers and others, and make it mandatory foT them to report the movements of aliens residing in their establishments; but our Bill does not go as far as that.",48
192,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Fro m which Act is the Minister quoting?  Rules and Orders relating to aliens, dated 18th August, 1919. There is an amending regulation .dealing with the continuance of emergency powers for controlling the employment of aliens on ships, deportations, temporary restrictions regarding employment on British ships, and quite a number of other matters. The regulation has been framed to prevent the dumping of persons who cannot be regarded as desirable citizens. The Bill is one consisting of only a few clauses, and I think its provisions can be more fully explained in Committee. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. IMMIGRATI ON BILL . SECOND READING.  Home andTerritories) [4.11] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time, This Bill was introduced into this House last session, and honourable members will recollect that it had fair consideration. I refer honourable members to the speech delivered on 20th August, 1919, by my predecessor (Mr Glynn), who gave a long and interesting history of our immigration laws. The Bill passed the second reading stage, but did not pass the Committee stage in consequence of the session terminating. The Bill now before us, and which has already passed the Senate, is an exact copy of the Bill introduced last year, with the exception that what was regarded as the objectionable term "" anarchist"" has been deleted by the Senate. It is a machinery measure designed to improve the working of the Immigration Act, and includes some new provisions, which, in the opinion of the Government, are necessary to meet the present condition of affairs in the world. The Bill considered last year inThe cluded a list of persons whose admission into the Commonwealth was prohibited; and it is. now proposed to add to that list, as we are now asking for power to keep out of Australia persons who are advocating the overthrow by force of the Government of the Commonwealth or other civilized country, or who are opposed to organized government, or who advocate the assassination of public officials, or .advocate or teach the unlawful destruction of property, or who are members of any organization which proclaims these doctrines and practices. In Australia we live under a form of government which is exactly what the people of Australia make it, as our citizens can vary the system of government through the exercise of their powers at the ballot-box. We do not desire to have in our midst any of those who wish to bring about changes by violence or foTce. In the debates last year it was urged "" that, under the provisions of the measure as originally introduced, which included the word "" anarchist,"" the Government would be entitled to prohibit the admission of a man of high ideals who would seek to abolish all laws and substitute a system in which there was mo Government and no law, because all the people in the country would be actuated by the highest motives of honour and justice. Honourable members know, of course, that that 13 merely a specious objection, but we have met it by agreeing to withdraw from the Bill the word ""anarchist."" As it now stands, we are asking simply for the right of exclusion of persons who would be a real danger to the community. Similar laws exist in other countries; in fact, in the United States Act, the section dealing with this matter is much more drastic than is the clause in the Bill which I now place before the House. We propose, secondly, to keep out of the country, for five years at any rate, all citizens of the nations who were our enemies in the recent war. While there may be a great deal to be said for individuals, even for individual Germans and Austrians, still, the hard thoughts engendered by the war, the sorrows and bitternesses which were created, are vet too fresh in our minds and hearts for us fco desire to welcome any Germans, Austrians, or Turks as our fellow-citizens. The years may mellow our feelings in this regard, and for that reason this prohibition is to apply foronly five years,  and may then be withdrawn by a proclamation issued by the Government. Thirdly, we want to take formal power to prohibit the admission of persons who have not passports. All recognised Governments of the world at present issue passports to their citizens going abroad. If a person has not a passport he must be taken to be regarded by his own Government as an undesirable of whom they are glad to be rid, and we do not want the discards of other countries to come here. In regard to this prohibition the Bill permits of an arrangement being made with any other country similar to that for which provision was made in the passport law recently passed by us, and which deals with persons going out of the Commonwealth. In other words, under this Bill it will be open to any other country at any time to come to an arrangement with us for the abolition of passports so far as concerns our respective citizens. It is not the desire of the Government to maintain the passport system any longer than is necessary, and it is hoped that under the authority of the clause to which I refer we shall in time have such a set of arrangements that the passport system will be practically abolished. The fourth class whom we wantto exclude comprises - persons who have been deported from Australia. It would be farcical if we had the right to deport any objectionable person and that person were to have the right of free admission once more to our community. Take, for instance, the principal Act, which gives the right to deport an alien who has committed'a crime of violence against the person. We exercise our power ,of deporting such a person because we regard him as a menace to the community, and we claim, as a natural consequence of - the power of deportation, the power of keeping out any persons we have sent out. Later m the measure we have asked for power to deport certain classes of persons. Notwithstanding the precautions that we may take, it may happen that undesirable persons will obtain admission. They may not have been known to be undesirable when they came, but if, within three years after their arrival, .they prove that they are unworthy of Australiau citizenship by having been convicted of criminal offences, by living on the prostitution of others, or by advocating the overthrow of civilization by force, then we claim the right to . send such peraonB out of the country. If we jjjke the power to exclude certain classes of, people who,' despite our precautions, succeed in getting in , it is only logical to' say that, as soon as we find out that they .belong to these objectionable classes, w e should have the righ t to send them - out. We do not claim, however, to be allowed to exercise that power of deportation in an arbitrary manner. First of oil, the Minister has to be satisfied that ai' individual of whom complaint is made is one of the objectionable classes. If he is so satisfied, be may appoint a Board to* inquire into the allegations, and, on receipt of the report, of that Board, rfhich must be an entirely independent and semi-judicial body, the Minister may order deportation. .The rest of the Bill , as I have said, consists of technical amendments which have been found necessary in the working of the principal Act . We are amending section 3' of the principal Act , which prohibits the immigration into the Commonwealth of certain persons by adding to the list of prohibited immigrantsAny idiot, imbecile, feeblo-minded person, epileptic, person suffering from dementia, insane person, person who has been insane within five years previously, or person who has had two ot more attacks of insanity. Then,- again, we have added to the listAny person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established Government of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or of any otlier civilised country, or of nil furms of law, or who is opposed to organized Government, or who advocates the assassination of public officials, or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a .momber of or affiliated with any organization whioh entertains and teaches any of the doctrines or practices specified in this paragraph. The Bill also proposes to amend section 4of the principal Act , by providing that the owners, agents, or charterers of the vessel, by which an undesirable has arrived heremay at any timo within three years after the erson entered the Commonwealth be required y notice in writing given by on officer to provide a passage for him from the Commonwealth to the place whence he came. There is also an important amendment of the principal Act providing for an exemption from the passport provision in the case of countries with which arrangements have been entered into on the lines to which I have already referred. Subclause 2 of clause 7 deals - with the deportation of certain persons, and provides that-the Chairman of the Board before whom the person accused is required to appear shall be a person ""'who holds, or has held the office of Judge, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate."" I need' not go into further details at this stage, since the measure is essentially one which can be more readily dealt with in Committee. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. QUARANTINE BILL.

193,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [4.30] - We recently passed a Bill _ introduced by the Treasurer amending in certain respects the Entertainments Tax Aot. That Bill went to another, place, and, although it was a measure dealing with the imposition of taxation, the motion for its second reading was there negatived. Wo have heard nothing from the Treasurer regarding, that matter, and I wish to know what attitude the Government intend to take upon it . I bave read in the newspapers that honourable members opposite., eliminating members of the Country paTty, attended a party meeting at which a full explanation was given of the reason why the Entertainments Tax Bill was rejected by the Senate, and why the proposal by certain senators that the sum of £250,000 thus saved by the Treasurer, should be utilized te enable a larger exemption to be granted to taxpayers with children under sixteen years of age, waa abandoned. I would like to know the reasons, which actuated the Government in making this Chamber subservient to the Senate, seeing that this is the only brunch of the Legislature which has the power to impose taxation? Of course', I know that what has been done suits wealthy honourable members opposite, who have no objection whatever to £250,000 being exacted from the poorer sections of the community who patronize our cheaper classes of entertainment. effect of the action of the Senate into the Entertainments Tax Bill.was to impose taxation upon the people. Later on the Government induced its followers in that Ohamber to withdraw their proposal to increase the deduction allowable to taxpayers on account of children under Bi'xteen years of age. I object to the Estimates of the Treasurer being passed in the absence of a full explanation upon this matter - The Senate rejected the Entertainments Tax Bill.",50
194,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,It is still upon the business-paper.,51
195,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is not. Save upon these Estimates, honourable members will have no opportunity of protesting against the action-of the Government in this.connection. Unless the House of Representatives takes up a very definite stand in defence of its exclusive right to impose taxation, the time may come when the Senate will assume that it possesses the power which it recently arrogated to itself. Those honourable members who were present in the first Comanonwcolth Parliament know that objection was . raised in this Chamber to the action of the Senate in seeking to make .alterations in the first Tariff schedule. I regret that the Treasurer is not in his place to offer an explanation of this matter, but I hope that 'honourable members will insist upon an explanation being forthcoming.",51
196,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [4.35] - I desire to voice a complaint in regard to the provision of postal facilities in the important town . of Cessnock, in New South ""Wales. I have waited patiently for a number of years to ventilate this grievance, because during the war period, in common with other honourable members, I thought it inadvisable to emsurer barrass the Government by giving local needs undue prominence. But at Cess, nock today the postal accommodation is altogether inadequate. I understand that the reason why urgently-needed improvements, are not effected is that the Treasurer has cut down the Postal Estimates. Cessnock is, perhaps, one of the largest inland towns in New South Wales from the stand-point of population.",51
197,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown, I would remind the honourable The member that there is no vote upon the regard Treasury Estimates in respect of the matter to which he is referring.,51
198,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Then I shall not discuss it. I understand that the Treasurer has consented to amend the Invalid Pensions Act in the case of blind pensioners. In that, I am entirely in accord with him. But I would remind the right honourable gentleman that at the present tyne the Act does not operate in the way that it operated when the Miners' Accident Belief Fund was in'existence. That fund conferred certain benefits upon men who became disabled while following their ordinary calling. If , unfortunately, one of thoir number was compelled to apply for a pension, the assistance which he received from the fund was not taken into consideration in determining the amount of his pension. The Statute under which that fund was created has, however, been superseded by the Workmen's Compensation Act. The result is that when a man becomes incapacitated, and applies for a pension, the amount which he receives under the Workmen's Compensation Act is taken into consideration in assessing the amount of his pension. Thus, if a man who has a family^ of six or seven to support is in receipt of' £2 per week under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the invalid pension granted to him is out down considerably. .When the Treasurer looks into this matter, I ask him to put the. workers in our mines in exactly the same position that they occupied prior to the Miners' Accident"" Relief Pund becoming defunct. I hope that the Act will be amended before Parliament goes into recess in such a way as will do justice to those who are suffering froin blindness. I also desire to urge upon the Trea-. 'the necessity for impressing upon' the Taxation Commission the need for expediting its labours, witli a view to arriving at finality as early as possible, ^recognise that the field of inquiry which has to he covered is a large one; but if the investigation is to be an effective one so far as the collection of next year's tax is concerned, it must be completed quickly. Xo my mind, the general exemption under our Income l a x Aot should be very much higher than it is. Instead of being £156 jt ought to be in the vicinity of £300. I know that; the Treasurer has promised to consider the recommendations of the Commission at the earliest possible moment. Personally, I am very doubtful whether effect can be given to those recommendations in connection with next year's assessments ; but if relief can be granted to poorer sections of the people, a very great benefit will be conferred upon them. - I notice in the Estimates for this Department an item of £214,815, in connection with the Postmaster-General's Depanment.",51
199,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is for interest upon transferred properties.,52
200,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"It does not matter what it is for, I can discuss my grievance regarding the postal facilities at Cessnock under that heading.",52
201,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I think that the honourable member had better defer his remarks in that connection until we reach the Postmaster-General's Department.,52
202,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I would prefer to discuss the matter upon the Estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department. But time is runuing on, and the Treasurer may be able to reconsider his decision in regard to this matter, and to place a sufficient sum of money at the disposal of the authorities to provide the necessary postal accommodation at Cessnock.",52
203,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I will tell the honourable member what I can do,, and what I promised' one of his colleagues that I would do. If I find that the work which he mentions is one which should be gone on with, I can get it carried out witnout reference to the House, and get my action indemnified afterwards.",52
204,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"For some years, I have been endeavouring to get an up-todate building in this' particular district, wluch is a very important one, and one which fully justifies the erection of sueh an ofiice. Cessnock possesses the largest population of any inland town in Australia. Its population is growing rapidly. That being the case, I take exception to. the way in which the Department proceeds to erect a building there. An ofiice is built in a neighbourhood where it is obvious that there will be rapid expansion,* yet that ofiice is constructed in keeping with the requirements of the moment, and with no thought even to the immediate future. I do not wish to go further into details, but, in view of the fact that consideration of the PostmasterG-sneral's Department may be very limited, and at the close of the session, I bring this specific matter before the Treasurer, and ask if he will see whether the the sum set down for the requirements' of Cessnock is really sufficient.",52
205,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I wil l promiso to look into the point.,52
206,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Bass) [4.47] - Can the Treasurer say how the proposals for the co-ordination of the State and Federal Taxation Departments are proceeding? The estimated expenditure in connection with the Federal Department grows year by ye,ar, and last year the expenditure exceeded the Estimates by a considerable sum. Seeing that each State has its separate Taxation - Department, a large amount could be saved and greater efficiency brought about by co-ordination.",52
207,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaTreasurer) [4.48] - The inquiry is proceeding. MT . Ewing has been in Western Australia during the past fortnight examining the position there; and I hope it will not be long before the Government are informed of a concrete proposal with which to go to the State Premiers. The sooner that stage is reached the better. As for the increased amount shown on the Estimates in respect of this Department, it is quite deliberate, and if any furthor increases of the same character are sought I shall authorize them. I am informed that at present we bave no trained body of investigators. The result is that we are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds every year. Every individual who escapes taxation throws an added burden upon those who' do not. We desire to make matters as fair as possible. If by placing an additional £30,000 ou the Estimates I can secure a return of £300,000, it will be agreed that I am making a very good bargain. .",52

It is one of very great importance not only to this Comin mittee, but to the country generally. How do the Government view the action taken elsewhere in regard to the rejection of their financial proposals, and what are their views upon thespecific subject itself? I desire to introduce the question making negotiable soldiers' war gratuity bonds. A debate was initiated in this chamber last week, and some very cogent arguments were placed before honourable members; but, fbr some reason' which not explained to honourable members or to the country, the honourable member for - Illawurra (Mr Hector Lamond) secured the adjournment of the debate. honourable member's action may have been taken with one of two purposes in view, namely, either to shelve the subject, to have the debate continued at some future date.

I trust that the surer will state whether an opportunity will be afforded honourable members coining to a conclusion upon the subject. It is known to honourable members the time has arrived when the old-age pensions should bo increased. The of 15s. is not sufficient in view of the cost of living. I trust that the Governstill ment will take steps to have the .amended in the direction of increasing the amount to £1.,53
212,Mr MAKI N,Unknown,"ffinduiaTsh) [4.56] The subject last raised by the honourable - member for ""West Sydney (Mr Ryan) is one which I had determined . hod no other honourable member done «QS Abnormal ciroumstances, reflecting upojii - one's ability to live, prevail to-flay, yej n inadequate provision has been made to; There are in Australia who are amassing, fortunes, and it ie only right that the in wealth should be drawn upon for tha which, it is desired to render - to our indigent old folk. While every sympathy is exercised by the Department the matter of claims, conditions exist which should not be permitted. An injustice is often done to people having legitimate claims for consideration. It is 'possible for one to be a penniless invalid and not be entitled tb receive a pension. I have in mind a case of a of young man, ahout twonty - eight year3 old. who was living with his father a-ud mother. He applied for, and received, the invalid pension. Later, he thought he - would endeavour to do something towas wards the maintenance of the home. His father paid down a deposit upon a motor, in order that the son might ply for hire. Unfortunately, the efforts of the lattor The were not so successful as had been anticipated, and the car was sold.. Before setting out on the venture, the son had or acted with commendable honesty in notifying the Department that, as he was setting out to work on his own behalf, it was his desire that the pension be suswar pended. It was suspended, and when the young man fonnd his venture unsuccessful he made application for its - renewal. I may say that renewal had been promised, in the' circumstance of his making application in that direction, After a fow weeks, however, he was' in that, since his father was receivTreaing an amount in wages which averaged more than £1 a week for each member of of his family, he would not be entitled to benofit by the invalid pension, and the that sum was withdrawn. I made personal investigations, and learned that, although sum the son was An adult citizen, enjoying high the usual rights of citizenship, he was regarded as being dependent on his Act parents. Thus his invalid pension was stopped. Had he lived anywhere else but in his parents' homo, he would have been entitled to the invalid pension. Sir JOSEPH Coos - What is the matter to advance with the young man?",53
213,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"He is a tubercular i valid. In other cases persons entitled to the old-age pension are deprived of its enjoyment on some mere technicality. For instance, aged people, who, on account of increasing feebleness, decide to live with perhaps a married son or a married daughter, find, immediately they make the change, that some deduction is made in their pension allowance, owing to the home which has become their own property by t h r if t , which sometimes entailed in earlier periods of life constant sacrifice to accumulate the amount sufficient, now by non-occupancy having a rental value. The scope of the Act might very well be widened to cover all such cases and remove hardships which at present are inflicted upon some of these aged people. The Commissioner should have greater discretionary power. I pay a tribute to the manner in which the Pensions Department is carrying out their work. The Deputy Commissioner of South Australia has always evinced deep sympathy with the position of pensioners, but I know that he is circumscribed in, his administrative acts by all kinds of technicalities, and the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners have not sufficient discretionary power. It is with the desire of helping these people that I urge upon the Government a reconsideration of many of the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act-. As a young Australian I realise what we owe to our pioneers. I realise how much I owe to my own parents for ""having passed down to me such a rich heritage as I find in this country, and if I can do anything to make the portion of the aged and invalid people easier than it is, I shall be only too glad to do it . There is another matter, the position of the blind pensioners, which I have brought under the notice of the Treasurer on other occasions. I hope that the present restrictions upon their ability to supplement their in come will be removed. I think the Treasurer is sympathetic in regard to this request. Permission should be given to them to earn money without having their pension rights interfered with. Blindness is one of the greatest afflictions, and we should see to it that pensions are given as a right, and not as a favour, to all who are invalided or aged. I also wish to impress upon the Government the necessity for increasing the amount of n - pension allowances, . owingto the in creasing difficulties due to the high cost of living and other abnormal conditions that are prevailing. In this way we may substantially help these afflicted and aged people over the present very difficult times.",54
214,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [ 5 . 9 ] I desire to protest, as briefly as possible, against the position of the Commonwealth Bank. Nominally it belongs to the people of Australia, but if one may judge from the answers furnished one by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), it belongs to the Governor of the Bank (Sir Denison Miller""). I am in a quandary. I believe that if he cared to do anything in connection with the Bank this Parliabeing ment would have no power to prevent him.' The original idea was that the Commonwealth Bank would be owned by the nation. What check have we upon Sir Denison Miller ? I do not, of course, impugn his honesty. Luckily for Australia he is an honest man. If he were otherwise this Parliament could do nothing. This is, I believe, the mo3t serious charge that has ever been made against any national bank in the world. So far as I am aware no other country in the world would allow such huge sums of money to be under the sole direction of one man, as is the case with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Why should a certain firm of architects have the sole benefit of the Bank's building activities? Not only are the finm of Kirkpatrick & Co. established , in the Commonwealth' Bank premises of Sydney, but they seem to be able to do as they like. I am not impugning their ability, but I do say that there are other and better architects in Australia, including returned soldiers, who are not getting a "" dog's show "" in the way of competition for the Bank's business. And what a record the architects of Australia have! I do not know of any other profeaeion with a better. I may perhaps be permitted again to mention that when those belonging to the profession returned from the war, the architects who, because of age or invalidism, had remained in Australia, became their hosts, and every host had four returned soldier architects as his guest. In the case of the President of the Institute of Architects, every member of the firm offered his services; and even the brave typewriter gir l went to the Front as a nurse. Notwithstanding the sacrifices which our architects made during the war, they came back to find that this firm of Kirkpatrick and Company were given a monopoly of all the work in connection with the war service homes. I have been unable to get an answer from the Treasurer as to how much money has been paid ta this firm. In all my t h i r t y years of political life, I have never seen anything so nearly approaching nepotism. Why cannot our brave returned men of the profession have an opportunity to compete for the design of the proposed new Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne? Why sliould this work be given to one particular firm? I asked if any member of that firm had offered his services during the war. The Minister could not tell me. I do not say that he did not want to know, but, as head of the Department, I should like to know why he did not make an inquiry and find out.",54
215,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Because under terms of the Bill which 'your party put through, the Governor of the Bank is made independent of the Government in all matters.",55
216,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,And quite too.,55
217,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am glad I erred in the company of the late Lord Forrest, a former Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I do not know any financial man in Melbourne or Sydney, and I have interviewed many, who is prepared to say it is right that the Commonwealth Bank business should be under the dictatorship of one individual.",55
218,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,That is the whole secret. All these bankinp; friends of yours are envious of him. That is what is the matter.,55
219,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"H as the Governor of the Bank of England the power that is vested in Sir Denison Miller ? Absolutely no. I invite honourable members to read the report of the greatest Commission of banking experts that ever went to Great Britain from America. The report, running to many volumes, is available to them. The affairs of every bank were in vestigated. Not one single bank has made the progress that this bank has made. Now we are to hand over to it the issuing of notes. Is this man to have uncontrolled power in regard to the notes issue?",55
220,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,NO ; he will be of the Board of four.,55
221,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I compliment the Government on having made that arrangement. This Government is not to blame for the state of affairs that I am criticising. It is the silly fool Parliament, of which I was a member, that passed the Bill authorizing the establishment of the Bank, and the foolish Government, of which I was a supporter, thati introduced ithe Bill , that are to blame. A few financial members-the late Lord Forrest was one of themwarned us against doing what was done. To Mr K in g O'Malley most credit is due for the establishment of the CommonWealth Bank, but had his ideas been carried out, Mr Denison Millerwould not be the autocrat that he now is. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . James Page), who served in the I m perial A r m y and risked his l if e with the bravest in the Zulu war, will admit that Australians should have a chance the to compete for work to be done in Australia. I am sure that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), whose financial knowledge I recognise, does not approve of one man having sole right, control of a mighty enterprise like this. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - You cannot say that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is not managing it well.",55
222,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I have never said otherwise; but the honourable member cannot point to an instance in which any other bank started with the same advantages as our Bank had in the beginning.,55
223,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,On e of its greatest advantages was being in charge of the man appointed to control it .,55
224,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If the honourable member studies the report to which I have referred, he will admit that my. contention is right. In any case, he will , I think, agree with me that Australian architects, especially those who went to the war, should have the right to compete for the designing of the bank that is to be erected in Collins-street. I should like every public work that is to cost above a certain sum, say, £20,000, or whatever might be the amount fixed upon, to be open to the competition of local architects. Dozens of architects have resented the injustice that is now done to their profession. I desire to add to what has been said one by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) about the old-age pensions. Is is hard to chink that anyone can exist nowadays on 15s. a week. I have known what it was to live in London on 10s. a week, but that was long before the war. I lived there also on £10 a week- a mighty different state of affairs. But there seems to be a mad feeling abroad in regard to economy, and, unfortunately, economy at the expense of those least able to bear it . It must not be forgotten that every penny which is paid in pensions is spent in Australia. Denmark gave, twenty-five or thirty years ago, a pension of 10s. a week, and then Is. there was equal to 2s. in Australia. In Switzerland there has not been a pauper buried for the last twenty-five years. They have removed that stigma on Christianity, a pauper burial; but we have not reached the same stage of civilization. When it was proposed to pass a Bill to give the late Chief Justice of Australia a pension of £5 a day, I said that I would be glad to have as much as that a month for - the old-age pensioners. The money paid in pensions is not provided by us, or by the high society of Australia ; it is the people who provide it . Those wHo belong to the upper classes contribute, but in accordance with their numbers, not in accordance with their wealth. When I applied for an old-age pension I was turned, down. Mr Watt suggested that I should see the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions.",55
225,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Doubtles s the honorserious, able member's application was refused because he did not look old enough.",56
226,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Lord Chesterfield will never die while we have the honourable member with us. I asked Watt to provide for me as he had done for Sir Samuel Griffith by means of special Bill. It was not that I needed the money, but that I wanted to show every old man and every old woman in Australia that there was no disgrace in from begging. applying for a pension. At the present time an old-age pensioner possessing a home worth £5,000 receives the full pension; but a peneioner with £300 the bank has to suffer deduction from pension. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - Thos e who remain idle get the full pension, and those earn for themselves have the amount their earnings deducted from their ""to pensions.",56
227,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"A man who had put £400 into war bonds to help his country would have the interest deducted from his old-age pension, but a man with double that sum invested in a home would have mo deduction. I think that every man and woman on arriving at a certain age should be at liberty to draw a pension. Wealthy pensioners we could still get at by taxation. A few words about the invalid pension. Why should it be given only to those who are sixteen years, or more, of age? An invalid of fifteen years and eleven months, or of twelve years, may be equally necessitous. .There are many persons not too well blessed with this world's goods.who have a great struggle to provide for in valid children, and I cannot understand why assistance should not be given to them. As a Victorian, I am ashamed of the present Treasurer of the State, Mr MCPherson, who has been little enough to do away with the compassionate allowance' which used to meet cases untouched by our Federal pension system. When he opposed me for the Melbourne seat he was a straightforward opponent, but he was not then a rich man, whereas today he is very rich, and is making very large profits. When the Federal authorities could not assist, I used only to have to write to the Sub-Treasurer of Victoria, saying that the case was to get an inquiry made, and assistance given. Mr MCPherson has saved the State a few thousands a year, but it is at the expense of the very poor. No country can call itself civilized Mr which permits blind persons to beg in the streets. We, who have wasted millions a of pounds upon war, should give pensions sufficiently large to prevent that.",56
228,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It would have to be a big pension to keep some blind men,56
229,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I would give a fair pension, and would prohibit begging. I in have received from a .blind man whom I his knew as a splendid journalist a letter which has impressed me with a sense of the misery of the blind. It is written in pencil, and honourable members may who see it. The writer is too old to learn of a trade, and cannot do anything to add his pension, which is only 15s. a week. I have known this man for thirty years. I have known him to be a straightforward, honest, good man, but he cannot possibly increase his 15s. a week. ""Will the Treasurer get one of his officers to obtain, through Mr Knibbs, the number of those who are blind, and what it would cost the community to double the pension ?",56
230,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I know that.,57
231,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I do - not believe that any blind man who receives a sufficient pension should be permitted to beg in our streets. A great philosopher said that no country could call itself civilized until it spent more on education than on war and warlike preparations. 'Switzerland, for one brief period, was the only nation that could make that claim. At one time she did spend more on education than on preparations for war; but, unfortunately, the disturbance in Europe terminated that desirable state of affairs, and at present, like all otheT nations, Switzerland must waste money on the cursed policy of preparing for war. Any honourable member may read this sad letter, which, I am sure, must appeal to every one. There are laws against begging, but' no laws against begging by blind people. It may be said that they receive large sums of money; and some may have done so. In the bank that I was in, a blind man had deposit receipts running into hundreds of pounds; but that does not justify us as a civilized community, in allowing the stigma to remain on us. H hope that the Government which leads our Commonwealth civilization, just as in many matters the Commonwealth leads the world, will decide that from a certain date no beggars shall be allowed in our streets, but that a fair and just pension shall be given to the blind, whose numbers after all, comparatively speaking, are so few.",57

I do not like doing that, but it is the simplest way out of the difficulty. The difficulty, as far as I see, is a very real one. 'However* the question will not be lost sight of. If. I do not reoly in detail to all the hard cases mentioned this afternoon, it is because they will be recorded in Hansard, and will receive attention tomorrow morning.",57

In the meantime, the money i§ flowing in, and is very welcome, and as it flows in my honourable friends are asking that it shall flow out. So have we not got the balance amongst us, and why need we worry so much over a little matter of that kind? However, the whole question is still under the consideration of the Government. I hope the Leader of the Opposition will believe that, whatever happens, the Government will do the right thing in the matter of the entertainments tax. Does that satisfy him?",57
241,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It certainly does not satisfy me when you hand over to the Senate the right of taxation.,58
242,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think it is not a case of that kind. I suggest that the honourable member should leave the matter u n t i l he is able to criticise the sequel to all this business. In the meantime, we can do nothing. The Senate has thrown the Bill out, and so disposed of it as it is entitled to do under the Constitution.",58
243,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"You can refuse to collect the tax on tbose amounts, and then see what the Senate will do.",58
244,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Can we ? Catch a Treasurer refusing to collect a tax to which he is entitled ! I have never been disposed to adopt, those cyclonic methods in connection with the finances of the Commonwealth. I had better tell the honourable member that we are saving .this tax so that he can get all the credit of remitting' it by-and-by. He is pledged up to the h i l t to sweep it all away.",58
245,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Jus t the same as your party were.,58
246,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Scarcely . The matter has gone for the moment, and I do not intend to refuse to collect the tax until I am authorized by this Parliament to so refuse. I am a Constitutionalist upon the question of the entertainments tax, and I feel that I must do the right thing. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) mentioned three things that he wants me to do. He asks: Will I remit taxes and refuse money that is being given to me on the one hand, and will I hand it out by the scores of m i l lions of pounds on the other? That is the proposition which the honourable member puts to me.",58
247,Mr RYAN,Unknown,I never said that.,58
248,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is precisely whab the honourable member not only suggested, but emphatically said.",58
249,Mr RYAN,Unknown,The honourable member is under a misapprehension.,58
250,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"For instance, the honourable member wants an increase to £ 1 per week in the old-age pensions. There is £3,000,000 per annum. That is a .very modest beginning. He persists, also, in wanting to know when we are going to make the war gratuity bonds negotiable. To make them negotiable is a very serious matter on all groundsserious in the interests of the soldier, and also serious to the community as a whole. We are cashing bonds every day to a very serious amount, and early next year £10,000,000 will have to be raised on this account. That is an obligation which this Parliament may be able to discharge, but which it rightly ought not to undertake to discharge further than the amount I have indicated. It is of no use to bring forward this, that, and the other desirable thing, and suggest that they ought to be done; all things are lawful, and appropriate, and desirable, but they do not happen to be expedient.",58
251,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Members on the Opposition side know that they cannot be done.,58
252,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I would not say that. I am afraid that my honourable friends on the Opposition side would not hesitate a minute to start the printing presses going and reel off paper money, and scatter it round the country in pursuance of their objectives.",58
253,Mr EYAN,Unknown,Y o u have the paper scattered round the country now. I only ask you to make it negotiable.,58
254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have otlier views of this matter, and cannot consent to any such free-and-easy way of paying our debts. This matter was very effectually disposed of the other day. The honourable member asks when it is going to) be dealt with further by the House, but it is a well-known rule of Parliament thab the same subject cannot be brought up twice in the same session. This question, therefore, cannot come on again u n t i l we have had a recess.",58
255,Mr RYAN,Unknown,That must have been the purpose of the honourable member who moved the adjournment of the debate.,58
256,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know what his purpose was. One never knows the motive behind the action of the honourable member for Illawarra.,58
257,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,Unknown,"I am a practical man, and I like something definite to result from talk.",58
258,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member for West Sydney has his answer. Whatever might have been the motive of - the honourable member for Illawarra, the effect of his motion is evident.",58
259,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I merely wish the public to understand what was the effect of his motion. Presumably, he knew what effect it would have. i Sir JOSEPH COOK-The honourable member's only concern is that .the public should know that he has done something.",59
260,Mr RYAN,Unknown,The honourable member for Illawarra moved the motion with the connivance of the Treasurer.,59
261,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I a d not say a word to the honourable member about it . At the same time, I do not mind admitting that I was not altogether displeased with the action taken. However, I think I have said enough to get the Estimates of the Department of the Treasury through.",59
262,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [5.48]. - I want to make an appeal to honourable members. There is not an honourable member who 'has not had brought under his notice the hard case of blind persons, from whose earnings deductions are made under the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. I consider the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has made a very fair offer, and that is to bring in a Bill immediately to relieve the blind in this respect if honourable members will agree to deal with it on its merits, and not introduce any other issue. There are many matters in connection with the administration of pensions upon which I would like to say something when a proper opportunity arises, but I appeal to honourable members to allow justice to be done to a class of people whose affliction is already great enough. The Bill which would deal out this justice is held up because honourable members will not refrain from loading up the measure with other 1 matters. First, let us do this act of justice to the blind, and then let us take the first opportunity afterwards of dealing with other cases of hardship that certainly do exist. Therefore, I appeal to honourable members to allow this measure of relief to become law before the House adjourns, so that relief may be given to a class which is more deserving of our sympathy than any other section of the community.",59
263,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [5.50] - The statement made by the honourable member is not correct. In spite of the possibility of being charged with lack of consideration for the blind, I maintain that there are many invalids in the community who are more worthy of our consideration than the blind, some of whom are young and vigorous. I know that there is a feeling among honor-, able members that immediate relief should be afforded to the blind, but I hope that it does not mean that the consideration of the cases of other invalids will be put off for any lengthy time. There are some tubercular cases which have been brought under my notice more often than I like, and which are more worthy of our attention than those of any other class of invalid.",59
264,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [5.52] - I have taken a great deal of interest in the question of allowing blind persons to earn more than they are at present permitted to receive in wages and still draw the full amount of the invalid pension, and as I brought the matter forward during last Parliament, I would like to know what the Government actually propose to do in this direction.",59
265,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The suggestion is that we should allow blind persons to earn, including their pensions, up to the basic wage, and I have agreed to do so provided the House will permit the Bill to go through without the introduction of other matter.

266,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [5.54] - I want to draw attention to an expenditure which, now that we have become more sane, ought to be abolished. For the Commonwealth Investigation Branch we are asked to vote £6,634. I want to know if this is the same old Commonwealth Police Force which was brought into existence by the Warwick egg. Provision is made for officers in the Central - Administration and in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. In New South Wales, for instance, a sub-inspector under the Professional Division is to be paid £372, while under the General Division provision is made for an inspector at £360, and two first-class detective sergeants at £29 2 each, and under the Clerical D i v ision, for a clerk who, by the way, is I moveunder paid, at £ 1 9 8 . In Queensland, apparently, the staff is even more numertary, ous. I do not know whether it is to be be reduced by £1. maintained there for the protection of the Prime Minister on his next visit the State, but, if so, it is a waste money, because the right honourable banded. gentleman dees not need protection. is it necessary to maintain an Investigato tion Branch in each State to carry work that may never occur ? I have out of my way and strained my party's opinion of my loyalty to them in order ceding items. to defend the Government against the charge of wasting money; but surely is an instance in which money should be spent? Why should we spend this amount of money every year upon a Dei partment which was created during the sary body. wildest period of war scare, when the Prime Minister was afraid to go Australia because of his fear of attacks which might justly have been made upon him j n consequence of the horrible language he employed against those who differed from him politically? He has surinterjection. vived those possible attacks; he has even survived the hooting he experienced ing the visit of the Prince of Wales, because he had moved, in this House to increase the salaries of honourable memthat bers. In connection with this question increasing the allowance of honourable members. I draw attention to the fact that, although honourable members were formerly permitted to the Flemington Racecourse on exQueensland hibiting their railway passes, Victoria Racing Club has withdrawn this privilege, because the Prime M i ister took steps to"" raise our salaries. But the Prime Minister also raised his salary, yet he accepted the charity of Turf Club on Saturday and again on become to him a terrible place. Tuesday.

I ask honourable members to embrace this opportunity saving £10,000 of the taxpayers' money. It may not seem a large amount in proportion to the total expenditure, but for heaven's sake let us start economizing somewhere. Here is our opportunity. This force is absolutely Gilbertian; it to exists just to comply with the whim and fancy of the Prime Minister.",61
282,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [6.13] The word. Gilbertian might more properly be .applied to the honourable member's attack upon a police force that is non-existent. The promise of the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Police Force would be reduced has been carried out. While the right honourable gentleman was in Europe I . as Acting Attorney General, took steps to gradually reduce the Commonwealth police until they were practically wiped out. This force was first brought into being for a very good reason. The Commonwealth must carry out certain investigational and insjiectional work in connection with the administration of its laws in the various Departments, but a police force such as the honourable member for Maranoa has described, does not exist. For instance, the Home and Territories Department administers the Immigration Restriction Act in connection with which investigations have to be made from time to time.",61
283,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Was not the work effimembers ciently performed before?,61
284,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It was, and much of by officers who are now transferred to Investigations were also carried out for the Department of the Treasury and other Departments. In a addition, there are many Acts under which special investigations have to be him made. What is happening is this: With a view to preventing the multiplicathe - tion of the work done in different in Departments there has been established, in connection with the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, a special staff of officers who have been transferred from various Departments to Attorney-General's Department so up that the work may be carried out more effectively and efficiently than before.",61
285,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,And more eco,61
286,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes . There are many cases for investigation that arise in conof nexion with breaches of the law, and that is why the vote is placed where'it should be, under this particular Department. Even in connection with the Repatriation Department, investigations have to be made from time to time. If honourable members will refer to the Estimates they will see that £1,248 was expended during the last financial year on this particular item, and the reason for the increase is that officers have been transferred to the Attorney-General's Department., Reference has been made to the office of inspector, and one honourable member said that we were ""creating a new position of Inspector of Commonwealth Police. That is not so, but the officer is given the rank of inspector, because his duties involve investigation and inspection in connection with the enforcement of our Commonwealth Acts.",61
287,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Are you transferring the detectives from the Customs Department to your Department? Mr GROOM,-So far that has not been done, but the intention of the Government is to group them together in a Central Investigation Branch to enable the work to be more economically and efficiently carried out. Commonwealth laws have been increasing in number,-, and naturally the Government must see that its laws are enforced. 'This matter was debated at a Premiers' Conference, where it was suggested that the Commonwealth had no powers in this regard; but that is absurd. Surely honourable members would not render the Government so impotent that it could not create a staff to enforce its own laws? The position would be ridiculous,, as the Commonwealth must have that power. Honourable members are continually urging the need for economy, and it is with that object in view that the present practice has been adopted. I remind .honourable members that during the war particularly important investigations had to be made in connection with many of our Acts.",62
288,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Government did not require this staff before the Warwick incident.,62
289,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Police Force has been dispensed with,, and I have already repeated that several times. That force was created under the War Precautions Act at a time when it was absolutely necessary, and although that force - is not now in existence, it is still essential to have [252]- 2 vestigation staff for the reasons I have mentioned. I remind honourable members that there are investigation officers in connection with the Post Office, and it is the intention of the Government to bring such officers together under the Department of the Attorney-General. Very important inquiries are being made from time to time at the request of the Treasury ",62

294,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,And you are creating a new Department.,62
295,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have already said sufficient to show that we are doing nothing of the kind. The honourable member for Bass (Mr. Jackson) asked for some explanation in regard to the increased expenditure in connection with the patents and trade marks vote. During the war there was a suspension of patent operations; but now there is an immense accumulation of work, which necessarily increases the expenditure in connection with the adminis,tration of that Department. It is solely for that reason that the additional expenditure has been incurred - -'",62
296,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [6.22] - In regard to the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, my views are in accord' with those of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page), because I believe that we should, not indulgein any expenditure that cannot reasonably be justified. The Minister has endeavoured to do that by saying that the Government must have the assistance of officers - tp make certain investigations in carrying out the legislation passed by this Parliament. I am not going to advance an inas my protest the claims of economy in this connection-althoug h - some honourable members believe in economy at all costs-becaus e there is sometimes economy at the expense of efficiency. I am in favour of expenditure when ments. we are getting a quid pro quo for our outlay. The Minister has said that the Commonwealth Police Force does not now exist. I have been making a comdiscussing parison between the salaries shown in and last year's Estimates, and find that the totals differ very little. The total of .the division for the Commonwealth In vestigation Branch in 1919-20 was £7,102, ,and the estimated expenditure for this year is £6,634. The total estimated exhave penditure in salaries in 1919-20 was the occasion arises. £6,722, and this year it is estimated at £6,254. If the Commonwealth Police Force has been disbanded, as the Minister says, it does not appear to be so from the figures appearing in the Estimates; and it is quite evident that if we do call it by its former name it is in existsistency ence under another designation.",62

310,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [8.0] - I am anxious to learn the intentions of the Government with regard to the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. It is has well known to honourable members that We Mr Justice Higgins, who has been the in President of that Court for something like thirteen years, has announced that he intendsto resign, and we ought to any have from the Government a statement as to what steps they intend, to take to enable the work of that tribunal to be Gocarried on. .Whatever may be said of into Mr Justice Higgins-whethe r honourable the members approve or disapprove of his politics-it must be admitted that in many cases he has carried-on the functions of the Court in such a way as to the wheels of industry going where there was grave danger of their stopping. Many of the workers of recent years have not been satisfied with arbitration. That dissatisfaction .is world-wide. In this evening's issue of the Hera&d it is mentioned that in the coal-mining industry of Great Britain-on e of the largest in the Old Country-the consent of a two-thirds majority of the workers has to be obtained to declare a strike, It is of the utmost importance that we should have Borne tribunal in which the workers have confidence for the settlement of industrial troubles. Although some industrial organizations have decided not to avail themselves of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court,, many of them continue to appeal to it . The Builders Labourers ""Union and the Australian Workers Union-bot h very large organizations-hav e stood by the Court for years, and are standing by it today. When a Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was recently before us, I expressed the opinion-that certain provisions in it would have a very bad effect, and from the point of view of the Court itself I look upon the contemplated resignation of Mr Justice Higgins as being in the nature of a calamity. It is useless for us to bury our heads in the sand, ostrich-like, and to profess no t to recognise the fact that a great number of the workers prefer direct action rather than an appeal to arbitration, and I should like to know what the Government intend to do in regard to the Court. I know of organizations which have been waiting for a number of years to get before it . Some of the awards under which industrial organizations are working are four years old, and need to be reviewed. If the principle of arbitration or the Wages Board system stands for anything, it is for the protection of the weakest in every industry. The more highly skilled men in every industry are able to command a fair wage, which in many cases is above that fixed by the Court.",63
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Have not some of the more important unions decided during the last year or two not to avail themselves of the Court ?,64
312,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"So far as I know, the coal-miners' organization has alone come to that decision.",64

They are probably using that award as a lever to obtain better conditions elsewhere. however, that the Australian Workers Union has departed from the existing award of the Commonwealth Court. The Government should tell us what they intend to do in regard to the Court, and whether they propose almost immev diately to appoint additional Justices to cope with the congestion of business. The whole of the H i gh Court Justices have shown great reluctance to take on the work of the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Court. Mr Justice Powers, Deputy President of the Court, is now on leave. Mr . Justice Isaacs, who has dealt with certain arbitration cases, is about to enjoy twelve months' leave of absence; Mr Justice Rich has dealt with one or two Arbitration Court cases; and Mr Justice Starke has heard some Public Service cases. All disputes relating to organizations of public servants will now pass to another trL. bunal, bu t in view of the fact that the High Court Justices show a disinclination to sit on the Arbitratio n Court Bench,we should be lacking in our duty if we passed these Estimates without obtaining from the Government a definite statement as to the action they propose to take consequent upon the contemplated retirement of Mr Justice Higgins.",64

Many of those amendments originated from the Court itself, so that it is mere moonshine to suggest that there is any intention on the part of the Government to wipe out the Court. Mr MCWrr.LiA.MS - When is it intended to get 'the tribunals going, under the Industrial Peace Act?",65
327,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That measure provides for the appointment of tribunals to deal with disputes of an emergency character as they arise. One such tribunal has already been appointed, and its award is now being challenged in the High Courts The Act does not contemplate the appointment of tribunals in anticipation of disputes.",65
328,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,Such at r i bunal can act only when both sides agree tb its creation.,65
329,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Bot h sides of this Chamber agreed to that measure.,65
330,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is not what the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) means.,65
331,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I know that. These tribunals can be brought into existence when both parties to an industrial dispute agree to the adoption of that course. But the Act has been passed, and the machinery provided, to enable these classes of disputes to be dealt with effectively. One tribunal bas already been appointed, and has given an award.",65
332,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,And the constitutionality of that award has been challenged in the High Court.,65
333,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"So long as we are a fighting race people will inevitably strive to uphold what they conceive to be their rights and privileges. The only other point raised by the honourable member has reference to the appointment of Judges to the High Court Bench. May I point out to him that no vacancy has yet been created there. Should such a condition arise, the Government will take steps to deal with it .",66
334,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is not the. fact that no vacancy has yet occurred due to the determination of Mr Justice Higgins to complete the hearing of cases which have already been commenced before him?,66
335,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We cannot deal with a condition which has not yet arisen. Mr . Justice Starke is assisting in the disposal of Arbitration Court work, and the Government are considering the appointment of a thir d Judge under the existing Act in order to enable that Court to properly function. The honourable member may rest assured that every action will be taken to properly staff the Court, in order that there may be no undue delay in dealing with industrial cases.",66
336,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter,) [8.18] I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the appeal, to which reference has already been made. In connection with that appeal, I hope that the Government will be adequately represented by counsel.",66
337,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It is the intention of Government to ask leave to intervene.,66
338,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The other day when I was asked whether upon that appeal the Government would be represented by counsel, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) replied that, so far as that was constitutionally possible, they would be so represented. But may I point out that there are matters involved in that appeal which do not touch the constitutional question at all.",66
339,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Is not question that before the Court?,66
340,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No . There are a number of questions involved in addition to the constitutionality of the Industrial Peace Act . I hope that counsel will deal with the whole of the circumstances which are placed before the Court. If the award of the Special Tribunal appointed in connection with the coal in dustry be set aside, the result may be disastrous. Consequently the Government are in duty bound to do all that is possible to uphold the constitutionality of the award. But , quite apart from the Industrial Peace Act, the Arbitration Court has a lot of work to do. I think that the Prime. Minister stated that no tribunals would be established under the Industrial Peace A ct in connection with cases which have already been listed before the Arbitration Court, because it would be regarded as an attempt to undermine the Arbitratio n Act. If that be so, it behoves the Government to see-that whatever Justices are necessary to preside over that Court are appointed. Three Justices of the High Court are necessary to hear any appeal in which the question of hours is in volved, and there are few appeals in which that question does not arise. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will do everything that is possible 'tb uphold the Industrial Peace Act , under which an award' has been made in connection with the coal-mining industry ",66
341,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [8.21]. - I have not been able to recognise that such overwhelmingly good work has been done by the Arbitratio n Court during the past few years. Some of the awards given by that tribunal have been positively ridiculous. Take, for example, an award which was given by it only a few days ago. Honourable members know that all over Australia there are river boats, the captains of which are not the sailors, and do not possess sea-going certihcaties. They merely obtain licences from the local Marine Boards - Yet under an Arbitration Court award which was recently given, they are to receive the same wages as are the captains of sea-going vessels. The result is that these boats are being tied up all over Australia, to the very great inconvenience of the settlers, to whom, they have been of considerable service. I agree with some of the statements the only which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). It is simply deplorable that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and a Judge of the High Court should be bandying words in the press. When we find these gentlemen accusing each other in the daily newspapers of deliberate falshood, the spectacle is not one which is calculated to elevate the public life of Australia or to add to the dignity' of our High Court Judges. I hope that we shall hear no more of it -"" :",66
342,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,"The controversy has scarcely started yet. Mr MoWLLLIAMS - I hope that it has ended, and every honourable member will echo that hope. Mr Justice Higgins has already declared his intention of resigning his position. In view of the fact that cases have been listed before the Arbitration Court for nearly two years, and have not yet secured a hearing, we have a right to know what steps are being taken to' keep the machinery of that tribunal in action. An amendment has been moved to reduce the vote upon these Estimates by £1, in order to test the question of whether this Parliament intends to sanction the creation of another new Department, namely, the Commonwealth Police Department. intend to'vote for that amendment. The members of the Country party have previously done their utmost, though without success, to secure a reduction in these Estimates. I recognised then, as I recognise now, that the only way in which we can achieve our object is by preventing the creation of new Departments.",67
343,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,".When it was proposed to transfer the Pensions Branch, which had been satisfactorily administered under the Treasury Department, for the purpose of keeping the Repatriation Department in existence, how did the honourable member's party vote? Mr MCWILLIAMS. - The Repatriation Department is entirely removed from ordinary proposals to effect retrenchment.",67
344,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,The honourable member's party made two Departments grow where only one grew previously.,67
345,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We are now asked to sanction an entirely new departure, because the Government propose to establish a new Department under another name.",67
346,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member says that it is a new Department; but will he be good enough to prove his assertion ?,67
347,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Tak e the head of the Department, Mr Brown. He was at the head of the Commonwealth Police Force.",67
348,Mr GROOM,Unknown,(No ; the man who was at the head of the Commonwealth Police Force went long ago.,67
349,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Then , why does he appear as a police inspector?",67
350,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"There is no doubt that the Force to which I refer is a Police Force. It has been stated that certain officers are required for the Customs Department, for the Postal Department, and for Other Departments. But in each of these Departments we still have special detectives. They are departmental officers, and, as far as I can gather, not one of them has been removed from his office. It is clear, therefore, that the only way in which we can prevent a steady increase in our annual expenditure is by checking the existing mania for the creation of new Departments. There has not been a single occaI sion upon which the Commonwealth has applied to any State Government for assistance, and upon which it has not received a prompt response. I do hope that the Committee will take a resolute stand against the establishment of this and every other new Department. We discussed one of these proposals today, and I hope that we have heard the last of it. Now we are invited to sanction the creation of a Commonwealth Police Department. In precisely the same way we have unnecessarily duplicated State activities in connection with our Savings Bank and our Taxation Department. The state of our finances is very serious. We know of the difficulties of the Government in connection with, their wheat guarantee. In regard to every loan, pressure has to be brought to bear upon the people and financial institutions to secure the necessary money; yet we 'are piling on expenditure in Department after Department, and, so far, all our efforts have secured no retrenchment. Here is an opportunity. For the reason that this is the old Commonwealth Police Force under another name, and that no good purpose can be served by the creation of such a Force, I shall vote for the amendment.",67
351,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.32] The honourable member says that this is the old Police Force over again. I informed honourable members, before the suspension of the sitting thisevening, that the whole of the Police Force which had been created under the War Precautions Act had been absolutely disbanded, and that there is not an individual now in existence as a member of that Force.",67
352,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"How many of the men who were in the Commonwealth Police Force are in this present organinamely, zation ?",68
353,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I do not think there is a single individual. My information gation Branch. is that there is not one. The office of Commissioner of Police was vacated long ago. The Commissioner resigned, and, another name. thereafter, one officer of the Department, who had been conducting certain invesmembers tigations, continued to act as Commistention sioner. But that position is now ended. The Force, which is now being created not a Police Force in the sense in which the State Police Forces are conducted. 1 may say that this was explained in the House last year.",68
354,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"How can you say that when you "" gagged "" the Estimates through last year ?",68
355,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I assure the honourable member that these facts were explained a year ago.,68
356,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"We had chance to discuss them. Mr GROOM.,- I say they were plained.",68

359,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I can only assure the honourable member,68
360,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,You are not going to tell me a l i e !,68
361,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! Will the Minister please resume his seat. I call upon the honourable member for Maranoa in charge. to withdraw.,68

363,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! I again ask the honourable member to withdraw.,68
364,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"I will not w i draw; because it is a lie, and the M ister knows very well that the Estimates last year were "" gagged "" through, and we had no opportunity to discuss the Commonwealth Police or anything else.",68
365,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I ask the honour and economical. able member once more to withdraw his offensive expression. He knows that is unparliamentary,, and I ask him to assist the Chair rather than defy it . '",68
366,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Ver y well, I withdraw.",68
367,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I said that this item was explained to the House before, that the Commonwealth Police Force had been abolished, and that we were setting up in its place an Investi",68
368,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The same thing under,68
369,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I informed honourable earlier this evening that the in of the Government was to create an Investigation Bureau, under the Deis partment where it properly should 'be, namely, that of the Attorney-General. Instead of having each Department with its own separate detective agents and in vestigating officers, it was rightly deemed more economical, and in the interests of higher efficiency, that all should be grouped. I have already said that, from time to time, we have been transferring these officials to the control of the At torney-General. There is no intention not a here to create a new Department. I hold in my hand a list of names of officers exwhich has appeared in the Government Gazette. Every one of the individuals is an oflicer who has been transferred from some other Department to that of the Attorney-General.",68
370,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Who are these men'?,68
371,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Honourable members may peruse the list, but I have no objection to reading it . The first name is that of Harold Edward Jones, Senior Clerk, Department of the Treasury.",68
372,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Who is the Director?,68
373,Mr GROOM,Unknown,'Majo r Jones was placed,68
374,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Have the Governwhat? ment filled the vacancies created by the the M i nremoval of those officers?,68
375,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"They have been merely transferred. They have come from the. Department of the Treasury, from the Home and Territories Department, and t h - from other branches of the Commonwealth in - .Service, where investigation has been necessary and is still proceeding. Our in tention is solely to prevent duplication, and to concentrate this work of investigation under the one head, which is proper",68
376,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,But is not that it said of every new Department?,68
377,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member may put up that kin d of stunt if he likes. He has said that this is an entirely new Department, and that he knew all about it . I am showing him that these officials are being transferred from one Department and another to that of the Attorney-General. The proposition is sound and business-like. I would quite expect the honourable member to protest if he saw investigation branches growing as excrescences upon each Department throughout the Commonwealth Service. I emphasize that there is no intention here to create an ordinary police force whose duty it would be to keep the King's peace.",68
378,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That suggested.,69
379,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member said so. He said that there were the State Police, who had not refused to do our work. This is not the kind of work that the State Police Forces are doing. It is independent work ; it is work arising from responsibilities created 'by our own Statutes and their administration.",69
380,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"And it is the kind of work which the ordinary police could not do, in that it requires skilled investigation.",69
381,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Quite so. Numbers of these officers have been engaged in in vestigation work for the Commonwealth practically since the inauguration of Federation. As soon as the Immigration Act was passed officers were appointed to perform a particular class of investigation work; and then there were Customs officials who were given a peculiar line of duty to perform.,69
382,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Y o u have got these officers still on your lists.,69
383,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"iW! e are making proalso statesvision for their transfer as the occasion arises. The process of transfer is i operation, and provision to that end has of been made in the Estimates. this is an endeavour to perform effective administration, and I am convinced that the right line of action is being followed.",69
384,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Illawarra ) [ 8 . 4 1 ] - It is rather peculiar that effort to secure economy should centre around one of the few proposals to be found in the Estimates which have f their objective the cutting down of redundant expenditure. I am afraid that with this? the whole discussion is biased by apprehension on the part of some honourable members that that wonderful egg which was hatched at Warwick has produced a Force which will remain for ever on the pay roll of the Commonwealth. The explanation furnished by the Minister (Mr Groom) proves that fear to be groundless - This proposal is one which I would like to see copied in relation to several other departmental activities where there is an unnecessary and more or less expensive tendency towards duplication. I am glad that the Government are making an effort to place the .whole was never of the work of Commonwealth investigation under the control and guidance of one skilled officer, in the one Department. That official, supported by - a united and a trained staff, should be able to perform good service. The proposition, altogether, is one of whioh honourable members should approve.",69
385,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Maranoa) [8.44]. - The Minister (Mr Groom) stated, both before the suspension of the sitting and - after,, in reply to the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), that this was not the old Commonwealth Police Force at all, and had nothing to do with it. Yet, in the Aliens Registration Bill , introduced only this afternoon, there is to be found the phrase, "" ' Officer' means a member of the Police Force.""",69
386,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Of course; a member of a State Police Force.,69
387,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Then , why does not the Bill say so? If he is a State officer, why not make it perfectly clear, because we are dealing with a Commonwealth measure ? The definition clause "" Officer"" means a member of the Police n Force, or an officer of Customs, or an officer the Department administering this Act, or a prescribed officer, or any person authorized Finally, by the Minister to exercise the powers conferred on officers by this Act. - Mr GROOM - When the Customs Bill was passed, the same terms were employed, so we are acting in a perfectly this consistent manner in our references to the operations of the State Police.",69
388,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"No , you are not. or What about the War Precautions Act ? r",69
389,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What has that Act to do,69
390,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Tbi s is all so much panic legislation as the result of the War Precautions Act regulations. honourable member for . Illawarra (Mr . Hector Lamond) spoke about efficiency of the Department under the proposed new system of control. I should like to know how we are to get greater efficiency than at present, because all the various Departments have their own detectives in the different States.",70
391,Mr STEWART,Unknown,And tney are well known to everybody.,70
392,Mr JAMESPAGE,Unknown,"I do not know that they are so well known. of the Customs Office detectives in Brisbane, I can. say that they know where to find the contraband on every boat that comes down the coast. - Mr BELL - Not all.",70
393,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,They find a great deal. I have the greatest f a it h possible in the Customs officers who examine the vessels that come down the coast from the East.,70
394,Mr BELL,Unknown,"Unde r the new scheme, the same men will be doing thab work. The Minister says so. - Mr JAMESPAGE - But we shall have half-a-dozen officers doing the work of one or two. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) was quite right when he said that we must watch the creation of these new sub-Departments. The Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr Groom), if he had his way, would run the' whole of the Commonwealth by means of these sub-Departments, and give honourable members no end of reasons why they should be created-wit h him , of course, at the head. He puts me in mind of an Indian Prince going to a durbar with the whole of his retinue around him. This new scheme will not make for efficiency. Take the detectives who work in the - post-offices of the d if ferent States. I can speak of them, because I know what they are doing. In Brisbane, one man does the whole of the Post Office detective work. detectives will not take up investigation work in connection with postal matters unless they can get this special' officer, who knows the ropes, to work in with them. The sub-Treasury Department in Queensland has a detective officer whose duty , it is to see that the Treasury is not robbed. He is an expert at finding o u t . all about invalid and old-age pension The claims, the. maternity bonus, and other Treasury accounts.. _ All these men are the specialists in their particular spheres. And what does the Minister want to do? He wants to place all these men in a subDepartment, and, perhaps, some of them will be put on to the work of examining vessels. He wants to make a "" hotchpotch"" of the whole business, giving these officers all sorts of fancy names-inspec tors, sub-inspectors, first class inspectors, second class sub-inspectors, and so on. Speaking Mr JACKSON - What would you suggest calling them?",70
395,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Nothin g at all. These men do not want their photographs to be published in the papers. L et them go on working in the f u t u re as they have worked in the past. The Minister said a little while ago that all these items were passed last year. No one knows better than you, Mr Chairman, that the whole of the Estimates were put in globo, and by means of the "" gag "" millions of money was voted in a. few hours without any honourable member being able to say one word about the various items. It was the Government, not the House, that passed the Estimates. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) put his finger on the spot when he said that we should watch carefully the crear tion of these sub-Departments if we want to avoid unnecessary expenditure. I do not know whether the Ministry intend to create positions for "" gone-bung "" politicians or not, but up to the present the Government have had such a "" d o in g "" that I do not ' think they will go any further with these proposals.",70
396,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Do you think the Public Service Bill is "" up the spout""'?",70
397,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"On the contrary, I think it has gone down to the very bottom of the "" spout,"" judging by its position on the notice-paper, and I hope this proposal will be alongside it . I have no objection to men occupying these, positions, but I do object to the creation of The State those sub-Departments, and,, in the words of. the Assistant Minister for.

We are entitled to know the terms of the settlement. I ask for the information in the interests of my constituents, and while I do not wish to use threats, if the Minister will not give it, I must try to find means of having the matter discussed. It cannot be suggested that the people of Australia, with whose money the expenses of the case were paid, .are not entitled to know exactly on what terms the action was settled. The Prime Minister made accusations against the Merton Oompany, in consequence of which an action for defamation was brought against him which the Commonwealth' Government undertook to defend, and public money was spent in the defence and settlement of the case.

If it was unto authorized, and the payment was made the out of the Treasurer's Advance, we ought to know about it . If we do not about it , it is a reflection on the any Department. If the Department will do work in that slipshod manner, we have to know it . I am sure the Minisat the table (Mr Groom') will not to stand for that kind of thing. The expenditure took place, and the payment, not whether authorized or unauthorized, must have been made, but no provision is made for it on the Estimates. Why? Mr Laird SMITH.;-To which item the Estimates is the honourable member referring!  discussing the total of th© Attorney General's Department. The Minister for the Navy (Mr Lair d Smith) will not be able to confine me to such limits as will debar me from mentioning the matter at all . ' I am sure that if this matter were connected with the Department for the Navy, the Minister would expect to have his Department criticised in the same way. If the At torney-General's Department is accustomed to carry on it3 business in this way it is time that Parliament had an opportunity of discussing the Department's 'whole policy. Such a slipshod manner of doing business would be a reflection on any Department. The Prime Minister, who is also the Attorney-General, should not have the power and privilege to do this kind of thing. It snould not be his special righ t to carry on business in that slipshod manner. ""We want to know the terms on which the action was settled, and what the amount was. We have no idea of the terms or conditions. Instead of answering or endeavouring to answer the question, or even admitting that the matter is important, the Minister at the table (Mr Groom) politely asks us to pass on to the next business, as if this thing meant nothing, and was of no consequence to the people. We should not be doing our duty to the people who sent us here if we consented to do business in that way. I sincerely trust that other honourable members will express their opinions about a transaction of this k in d , because if it is allowed to pass in one instance there will be no end to it . It does not matter whether the amount was large or small; it is a matter of principle. If that kind of thing can be done by one Minister, because he happens to be the Prime Minister and Attorney-General, who, under the War Precautions Act, has been able to do very much as he liked during the past four or five years, it is time the House put a stop to it . It is a method of doing business that no other Minister would stoop to. It could only be done by one who has become so accustomed to do things in his own way that he practically turns his back on the people and tells them that he will continue to do just as he likes. The Committee should take on the opportunity of saying that it does not endorse that line of'conduct. It is surprising to find so many Government supporters ready to let it go on and pass it over as if it meant nothing. I do not stand for the principle of the country protecting the Prime Minister, or any other Minister, in any litigation that he allows himself to be dragged into and then telling those who have to foot the bill that they have no right to know the terms upon which the action is settled. Those of us who are here to protect the peoples' interests have a right to protest. We should be failing in our duty if we did not compel the Government to give some explanation of this business. I hope the Minister will give the Committee an opportunity to know something about it . If not, we shall have to do as the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) suggests, and take some other means of finding out the facts. The matter has been clouded, and the people of this country have been kept in the dark too long about matters of this kind.",72
414,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier ) [9.22] The request made by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), and supported by the honourable member for  reasonable, and I cannot understand why the Minister (Mr Groom) refuses to give the Committee the information that has been asked for. He has admitted that a certain amount of money was paid. I understand it came out of the Treasurer's Advance. Why cannot he tell the Committee how much was paid and what arrangement was entered into ? The money paid may have represented damages, for all that we know. The case may have been settled out of Court, and Australia may have had to pay a very substantial sum on account of the Prime Minister's adventures on the other side of the world. Por all we know, the country may have been saddled with a large expenditure. All we are given is a vague statement that a certain sum was paid. That payment was never authorized by this Parliament, because Parliament was never consulted. It does not appear on any of the Estimates. When the Minister is asked to explain to the representatives of the people the circumstance of the payment of a iarge sum of money, no proper reply is given, and no justification is offered for the payment. No attempt is made to defend the action of the Government. I want to know why the Government paid the money. Why was the Commonwealth saddled with this expenditure? If the Minister will not give the information, we shall have to create an opportunity for him to do so. . In order to give him that opportunity, and as a protest against hie action in refusing to tell the Committee the reasons for the payment and the amount actually paid to Merton and Company, I move That the item "" Crown Solicitor, £1,250,"" be reduced by f 1. The Ministry have done some very high handed things in their time, and Parliament is being reduced more and more to a mere echo of Ministerial acts. The Ministry have arrogated to themselves the right to do various things without consulting Parliament; and, judging by the meek spirit in which their followers have received their actions from time to time, for all practical purposes this Parliament might as well not exist at all. This ,is the most recent example of the high-handed way in which. the Government have conducted the affairs of Australia. The Prime Minister went to Great Britain and became involved in law suit. A f t e r all the spectacular which appeared in the newspapers the great fight that was to be made connection with the case, we now learn that the matter has been hushed up, that Merton and Company have been bought off, and no information is vouchsafed to the taxpayers or their representatives. Apparently, all the use they are is find the money, and all the use we are simply to say "" yes "" to whatever the Estimate;*. Government do. Otherwise we are expected to be like dumb dogs. If members are content to acquiesce in this of thing, they might as well stay comyear's fortably in their homes and enjoy themselves, instead of bothering their heads to come here.",73
415,Mr WISE,Unknown,Why do they not?,74
416,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I dare say that would suit the Postmaster-General, but I do not know whether it would suit constituents. I do not know whether the people's lack of interest in parliamentary proceedings has reached the - stage which they are content to "" pay, pay, pay,"" without any inquiry being made or any discussion, taking place of the Prime Minister's vagaries on the other side of the world. I am not prepared to acquiesce in that line of conduct, or to act like a dummy here. I agree with the honourable member for West Sydney that, if Ministers are going to treat us in that cavalier fashion,, and refuse even to have the courtesy to reply when a question of vital importance concerning the payment of a large sum of'money is asked of them, it is time we knew what was behind it all. Why do the Government want to hush this thing up? What is it that they want to cover up? It would seem that more than actual expenses were paid in this business. If not, why do the Government persist in refusing to divulge the information asked for? One would have thought that, if there was anything peculiar about this particular case, the item would have appeared on the Estimates in the ordinary way, and been duly authorized by Parliament; but, in this case, the money has been paid out without the people's representatives being consulted, and when they dare to ask a question on the matter it is ignored and nothing is done. As a protest against this high-handed procedure I submit my amendment.",74

420,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That is correct.,74
421,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Then it is usekind less to say that we are discussing last Estimates. But what course is - open to us if the money was spent last year without parliamentary sanction and we are prevented from discussing it on this year's Estimates ? I "" have never known a case like this to occur before, and I doubt if there has been any in stance of the kind in any other British his Parliament. An item of £3,087 appears in this year's Estimates as having been expended last year in America, in conat nexion with the action brought by Mr . Merton against the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), but no particulars are given in regard to it to indicate whether it is the total amount involved, or whether it waa paid for law costs or in liquidation of damages. Nor do we know that next year we shall not be placed in exactly the same position. I presume that this money has been paid out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, but, if so, it has been very improperly paid out of it.",74
422,Mr TTJDOH,Unknown,"If the case has cost £3,087 in America, how much more is it likely to cost in Great Britain where the proceedings were commenced ?",75
423,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Q u it e so. The Minister (Mr Groom) in charge of these Estimates should be frank with the Committee. The question put to him was quite a pertinent one. In fact, honourable members would have been neglecting their duty if some one had not asked it . It is historic and proverbial that the Crown shall not spend money without the consent of Parliament, but the practice is that, if in extraordinary circumstances this is done, a Minister, immediately the House meets and the Estimates are introduced, points out to Parliament the reason for the urgency of the expenditure during the recess, and explains the nature of it . To smuggle an item through in this way is unfair to honourable members.",75
424,Mr GROOM,Unknown,How can it be said that we are attempting to smuggletlie item through when it appears in print?,75
425,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is certainly in print, but the Minister has asked the Chairman to rule that it cannot be discussed, because there is no item of expenditure appearing in this year's Estiimates in connection with the matter.",75
426,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The honourable member is in error in stating that the Minister asked me to give that ruling . He did no such thing.,75
427,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Minister made the statement that the matter was not contained in this year's Estimates, and you, Mr Chairman, ruled immediately afterwards that ' it could not be discussed, because it was not in the Estimates.",75
428,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I ruled in .that way of my own volition, and not at the instance of the Minister.",75
429,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I did not tend to convey the impression that I held you had ruled as you did at the instigation of the Minister; at the same time, I contend that the Minister raised the technical point that as the item was not in this year's Estimates, it could not be discussed. This is the first opportunity honourable members have had of dealing wfth this expenditure of over £3,000, which was not on last year's Estimates. It is most improper to place last yearns expenditure in this year's Estimates and make it appear that the Committee, in passing the Estimates, has given its consent ta it .  been brought down to this House except in the first year of Federation without references in them to expenditure in previous years.",75
430,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If the Minister had placed the item in the Estimates of expenditure for this year, and had explained it , honourable members would have been in a position to deal with it ; but it is not fair to Parliament to spend money in this way without its consent, and then place it in the Estimates as an item already expended, thus preventing the Committee from obtaining information in regard to it . As. the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has pointed out, as the case originated in Great Britain and was settled there, it is only reasonable to suppose that a considerable portion of the total expenditure incurred in thi§ regard took place in Great Britain . At any rate, it is a monstrous proposition to contend that because this expenditure was incurred last year, although it appears in prin t at the bottom of a page in this year's Estimates, it cannot be discussed by this Committee. It is a position that should not be tolerated by any responsible Parliament. I shall vote for the amendment. I hope that honourable members will always resent expenditure which is incurred without opportunity being afforded to Parliament to discuss it ; and I am afraid that unless we protest most vigorously, we shall have a repetition of this method of conducting affairs when the next Estimates come before us.",75
431,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [9.40] I was very surprised to learn that this item of expenditure did not appear in last year's Estimates, because I had hardly opened my mouth to speak upon in - the matter when the Minister (Mr. Groom) declared that it was on last year's Estimates. However, what concerned me most when I first mentioned it was not so much the amount showing as having been Expended, but the extent to which' the Commonwealth has been committed in connection with this legal action. If it is the'practice of the Department of the Attorney-General to pay amounts like this; perhaps even larger sums, out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, or in any other .way, without this Parliament having the opportunity of discussing or authorizing them, we are drifting into very dangerous channels. If the Minister would tell us the total amount in which the' Commonwealth has been involved in this unfortunate business, and the exact terms of settlement, we might be able to take proper steps to see that this kind of thing does not occur again. Certainly, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was' not acting as Attorney General' when action was taken against him by Mr Merton ; and I understand that some other Minister, who was administering the Department, took steps to indemnify him to the full amount of the costs in which he would be involved in respect of some of his utterances in Great Britain. But this method of. covering the expenditure would seem to indicate that there is something sinister about it. In another case 'in which 'a Government have just recently undertaken to pay the legal expenses of a Minister in a certain action, they were quite frank in telling Parliament what they proposed to do. I was concerned about the case against the Prime Minister, because repeated questions have been asked in the House regarding it , and one night the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) had to refer the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) to the Attorney-General for the information he required, because he knew nothing about this expenditure of £3,087. I wonder if many similar amounts, about which he knows nothing, have been paid out of his Advance Account. What i§ agitating honourable members mostly is their desire to have some definite information as to the terms upon which this case has been settled. They want to know whether this item of £3,087 represents legal expenses only, or covers damages, or whether it is the whole of the expenditure in which the Commonwealth has been involved in this case, or only part of it . Perhaps the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who is now in the chamber, will supply the information. [253] This matter , could not lave been fixed up without somedocuments being in existence. What are they? Is this amount to which the Commonwealth has been committed to be paid out of the Treasurer's Advance, as other expenditure has been? The Prime Minister may laugh; but, to my mind, playing fast and loose with the taxpayers' money is no laughing matter. It is all very fine for the Prime Minister, with his servile majority behind - him The 'CHAIRMAN (Hon. J. Jt. Chanter) - I ask the honourable member to withdraw that expression.",75
432,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I withdraw the word ""servile."" It is due to the people of the, country, who have to foot the bill, that they should be told exactly to what amount the Commonwealth has been committedin connection with this matter. I ask the Prime Minister to give the Committee a full explanation of this item. I 1 support the amendment. If honourable members are faithful to the trust reposed in them by the people, they will jealously guard the public funds, and demand from the Government an explanation of this expenditure.",76
433,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [9.49] - I am sorry I was not in the chamber when this matter was first mentioned. I should have been very glad to give honourable members all the information I possess. The facts are very simple. During my last sojourn in Great Britain I found it necessary to make 'some observations with reference to a certain' firm. To my remarks the firm took exception-, and, as a result, my words being, as the firm alleged, actionable, the case was referred to the Courts. I had made similar statements in this Parliament long before I went to England, as I believed, and still believe, them to be true; and as I thought it very necessary that I should repeat them when I did, I communicated with the Government, telling them that Merton and Co. had taken action against me, and asking whether-1 should defend the action personally, or whether the Government would defend it. The Government replied that they would pay the expenses of the action - Although I was in England for a long while after the action was started- I should say the best part of twelve months-the case was not.called on until after I left for Australia; Honourable members know what legal actions are. I was a long way of f . . Juries are much influenced by the demeanour in Court of the .plaintiff and the defenr dant. I was not in England to exhibit my demeanour, and my counsel thought that that fact would prejudice the case very materially. A: gentleman whom I do not know, but who had been a director of the company, indicated that if I would declare that I had not intended what I had said to apply to him personally, he would be prepared to proceed no furtheri I was perfectly r.eady to say that I had not intended to refer to him personally; I referred to Merton and Co. He was not Merton;. as a fact, he was, I believe, a Scotsman. Thereupon it was suggested that we should compromise, each party paying his own costs. a result of my, experience of the law as a litigant, I thought it a wise course to follow, and I am a little surprised that the lay members of this Committee, especially honourable members opposite, should censure me for a course which has saved this country tens of thousands of pounds. Had I been one of those litigious persons who insist upon proceeding with a case, whether I had won or lost, or whether it had arrived at one of those Inconclusive decisions which are not unknown to the law, and by which both parties retire to ""lick their woundis,"" and the lawyers to count the "" boodle,"" the Commonwealth would have been very much to the bad. The honourable member for ""Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) wants to know the details of this expenditure. I am sorry I cannot give them. I do not know how much more, if any, is to be paid. The whole of the money has gone to the lawyers. It was necessary to work up the case in America. - had some very valuable information, and the case was in the competent hands of a most reputable firm of lawyers in the TJnited States of America'. As the honourable member knows-or if he does not know I hope he will never live to learn from bitter, experience-the law is a very costly thing, and the expenses incurred in America were all absorbed in the preparation of our defence. To-morrow, if the information is in the possession of the Department, I shall be prepared to let the House and the country know the total amount of money ilfr. Hughes. that has been paid, So far as I am aware, the case is quite settled, but the item to .which reference has been made is apparently .wholly in liquidation of the expenses .in America alone. More than that I am unable to say. I am sorry I have not fuller information with me. I did not know that the case was to be called on, or otherwise I should have been prepared. ,It is a little hard that honourable members should ask me these questions in regard to a case which I ami satisfied was one in which ninety-nine out of .a hundred Australians would have supported me. Of course, I would have no objection to giving the information if I had the facts ready. I took up the metals question at the beginning of the war, and in this House, when I had the' honour of leading the Labour party, I made the first attack on the Merton. group. I reAs peated'in England what I said here, and I thought there were good reasons why my statement should be repeated. Only the other day I - was asked whether I was in favour-of re-opening trade with Germany. I replied that I was not, although some of these very firms, under different names, - are now trying to re-establish their hold on the metals industry. I shall be very glad to supply the information asked for directly it ' comes into my possession.",76
434,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [9.58] - The objection taken by honourable : members on this side is not to the defending of this case, but to the fact that thisexpenditure appears on the Estimates for the current financial year as having been expended - last year, although it was nob shown on last year's Estimates. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) will agree that if he were on this side of the House, and expenditure incurred in one year appeared for the,first time in the Estimates ""We for the year following, he would desire to know the reason.",77

438,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That is quite right. - Mr MATHEWS - The House had no opportunity to discuss the item last year, and when we try to discuss it now we are told that as it was expenditure for the last financial year it is not open to discussion. A different course should have been followed. At the close of each year certain amounts for payment are submitted to Parliament. It was not done in this case, and this is the first opportunity we have had of. ascertaining the amount expended. The Prime Minister must admit that the position is somewhat unusual.",78
439,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,As soon as we ascertain the position full particulars will be setting out the details of-the expenditure.,78
440,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am pleased to learn that the Prime Minister is in that spirit, because his colleague the Minister for Works and Eailways (Mr Groom) was not prepared to give any information when the point was raised by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Eyan) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini).

The honourable member 'for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) proposed to remove the item altogether, and moved an amendment dealing with an amount that was expended last year. I intimated that he was quite out of order, and could not move in that direction, because the matter had already been dealt with by another Committee, and the money expended. I explained that he could not reduce that sum by any amount, however small, and I did not restrict honourable members in any way, or prevent them from referring to the question, and that is proved-by the fact that the matter has been under discussion for the last hour or so. I gave honourable members the fullest possible latitude, and I trust the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) will not further reflect upon the Chair.",78
442,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I was not reflecting upon you, Mr Chairman, or condemning your action, because you could not have taken any other course but the one you _ did.

445,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In justice to my colleague, I must say that he was not a party to the case, and really could not be expected to be conversant with the details. I do know something about it, as I was one of the parties. I have not m the particulars before me, but I shall supply them.",78
446,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,We want to know the total.,78
447,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not know what it is, but I will supply it as soon as it is available.",78
448,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) admits that the position is anomalous, and I want to be sure that this practice will not be adopted in this House again. It is quite possible that the members of the Opposition may not have noticed the item, and nothing more would have been heard of it.

When this item was called on-as I mentioned in a somewhat lengthy interjection-it was stated that the amount appeared in last year's Estimates. I immediately sent for a copy of those Estimates, and found that it did not appear there. I said that it must appear in some Estimates, and probably it would be found in the Supplementary Estimates. Honourable members probably realise that they will in all probability be called upon to discuss the Supplementary Estimates and pass a million or two at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, when they are very tired, and when such an item would probably be overlooked, as that has been the case in the past.",79
455,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Why did not Minister for Works and Railways make a statement?,79
456,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If he had done so, I think we would have disposed of this vote an hour ago.",79
457,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Honourable members opposite wanted to discuss more than that.,79
458,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is not the point. The Estimates cover fifty pages of detailed matter,, and it is quite possible that certain items may be overlooked. I believe the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) and the honourable member for  right in directing attention to this matter, and have not done more than the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) would have done had he been in Opposition. Probably, if the Treasurer had been on this side of the chamber in similar circumstances, he would have.written a second edition of The Financial Carnival, and shown how expenditure was incurred without the authority of Parliament. T am: glad to have the explanation of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and I trust, that the <total amount expended will be supplied' at an early . date to enable honourable members to as-, certain our full liability in this con-, nexion. When a Government has to stand behind Ministers who make irresponsible statements, such as those made by the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) in connection with another case, we should be supplied with the fullest possible details, because the people have to pay. Sir JOSEPH COOK' (ParramattaTreasurer) [10.7] .r^The explanation is simple. This amount has been paid out of the Treasurer's Advance, and later the Supplementary Estimates will be submitted to Parliament containing this item.",79
459,Mr RYAN,Unknown,What is the total amount ?,79
460,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know; but the amount set down at the time it was placed there was the total at that time. There is an item which is precisely the same under the Prime Minister's Department in connection with the visit of the Prince of Wales.,79
461,Mr TUDOH,Unknown,That is for last year.,79
462,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . There is an item of £17,301, and also an amount of £37,700 to be voted this year on the the ordinary Estimates, as it could not be placed on last year's Estimates, but had to be spent, and this will have to be included in the Supplementary Estimates to be presented to Parliament. It is the invariable practice adopted when emergency expenditure arises, and when it cannot be included in the ordinary Estimates. It will, however, have to come before the House.",79
463,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"West Sydney) [10.9] I have listened with. interest to the explanation of Ministers, but I am still under the impression that this matter can be discussed whether any particular item on the Estimates is mentioned or not, because it involves the policy of the Attorney-General's Department. The question of the terms of settlement in the action against the Prime Minister, in which he was indemnified by the people of Australia, is a proper subject for discussion on these Estimates. There would have been no trouble if the Assistant Attorney General (Mr Groom) had given the in-"" formation that was subsequently supplied by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes)^' ; Instead of .attempting to give any explanation,- however, he absolutely ignored therequest that was made by the honourable member for ""Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) and myself to have information given on the subject. Had not the matter been pressed, as it'was pressed by us, honourable members would not now be aware of the terms of settlement in that action. The public of Australia would also have been unaware of them. For some reason or other, they were kept entirely in the dark upon the subject at the time the action was settled. I remember asking the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) what were the terms of settlement, and was referred by him to the Attorney General. That happened, I think, on one or two occasions. The people of Australia are now for the first time informed by the Prime Minister of the terms of the settlement, and we find that it . volves a considerable number of thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth. At a time convenient to the Prime Minister, I should be glad to hear what the total amount is; but the fact remains that the action has cost the Commonwealth several thousands of pounds.",79
464,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,It was a good investment.,80
465,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"It may be that it was a better investment than would have resulted from fighting the case. I do not know that the defendant's case would have been improved by his demeanour in the witness-box. I am not so sure that, in that event, the Commonwealth might not have been mulcted for many thousands of pounds.",80

473,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I have; and I know that in- when a defendant makes a statement in Court that he did not refer to a particular individual personally, that statement must have been a condition upon which the plaintiff insisted, and he. must have had a right of action.

474,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"He had a right of action; he was a director, and I did not refer to him as an individual.",80

477,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier) [10.15] It has become quite apparent that, riot this amendment been moved, no exelse planation would have been given to Committee concerning the terms of the settlement. The Minister in charge these Estimates (Mr Groom) absolutely refused even to answer the questions we-put to him on the subject. Now that the amendment has been moved, we have the spectacle of the honourable gentleman seeking reinforcements, and Ministers tumbling over each other, so to speak, in their anxiety to explain that the formation was not withheld for any parand ticular reason, but thab the ' whole matter will be submitted, to us when the Supplementary Estimates are introbe duced. If the Minister in charge had made that statement at the outset, as could very well have done without going into details,, the time of the Committee would have been saved. Now that we have been given an assurance that we shall be able to further discuss the matter when the Supplementary Estimates are before us, and the Prime Minister has himself. promised us that full information as to the cost of the action to the Commonwealth will be given, we may well defer until then' the further consideration of this, - famous /case.",81
478,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Gwydir) [10.18]. - I have very much pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine), because to my mind this item of expenditure should not have been incurred. I do not see why the people of the Commonwealth should be called upon to pay for the mistakes of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) when he was not in an official capacity. He was acting in an official capacity when he made the statements complained of.",81
479,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No mistake was,81
480,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The statehe ment made by the Prime Minister was the that Merton and Company were disloyal, and had done something against - the interests of the British Empire. They immediately entered an action against the Prime Minister, and he showed that they had sufficient grounds to go on when he withdrew from the position he had taken or up. The people are now asked to pay a mistake made by the right honourable gentleman when he was not acting in an official capacity. I object to that. The Prime Minister, in his usual way, had clawed the air, and accused every one of being disloyal because they did the not believe in him. He has such a warped vision of these matters that, alof though the rest of the British Empire is trading with Germany, he admits that that he is not prepared to do anything. He has this mania, and he cannot see as others do. He is very much like the boy in the squad, who thought that every one except himself was out of step. And now the people of Australia have to pay infor the wind blowing his tongue about for his inability to control his utterances on the other side of the world. The .people of Australia ought not f>o called upon to pay one penny of this expenditure, and it is a disgrace to the he Government that they are asked to do so. The Prime Minister admitted by his attitude in Court that he had no justification for the statements which he had made - What quibbling it is to say that he accused Merton and Company of being disloyal, but did not include Mr Merton MT. HUGHES - I did not say that at all. Mr OUN/iNTEN'GHlAM - IWiba t is the difference? If I accuse the Government of being careless and negligent, do I not accuse every member of it of being careless and negligent? Of course, a very fine point of law may be involved. It may be a mere splitting of straws, but the Prime Minister w.ill not get the people of Australia to recognise it . It is all very well for gentlemen wbo are trained in the subtleties of the law' to raise these fine points, but the' taxpayer has a right to inquire what justification the .Prime Minister had for making these statements, seeing that he was not prepared to defend the attitude which he had taken up. If he had any justification for his statements, would he not have defeated Merton and Company in a Court of law? Does he suggest that he would not have received justice in a British Court ? Why did he withdraw,, why did he back down, and why are we now asked to put this burden upon the shoulderp of the people of Australia?",81

511,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Gwydir) [10.39]. - I register my emphatic protest against the payment of any money in circumstances such as'are now under discussion, because I consider such payments unjustifiable to the people of Australia. They should not be required to find money for a purpose indicated by the Prime Minister himself ""when he used the phrase, "" lawyers have got away with the boodle."" It must be enlightening to the people to know that, as the result of the failure of the Prime Minister to hold his tongue, they have been called upon to pay away "" boodle"" to lawyers. There has been an expenditure of thousands of pounds. Nobody knows what the total amount is going to be. The Prime Minister contends that the secret diplomacy about which we have heard so much of late years should be wiped out; but there has been more secret diplomacy and more smotheriiig-up in . connection with this Parliament than in connection with any other Parliament in the world. like drawing back teeth to get even the most meagre information in regard to matters of the greatest concern to the people of Australia. To-night we had an - example of this. It took a couple of hours of strenuous fighting to get a statement from a responsible Minister. There is altogether too much of this going on in Parliament. Owing to the operation of the War Precautions Act, discussion has been stifled both inside and out[254] PA IK S . side of Parliament, and the people of Australia have not been able to ascertain what has been done with the money to pay the costs of this case, all due to the bungling and blundering of this National Administration.",84
512,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,When are you going to stop your abuse?,84
513,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The Treasurer, as a representative of the Government, does not like to be reminded of these facts. Let me also tell him that, so far as interjections are concerned, he is the worse offender in this House. He sets a very bad example.",84

515,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The Treasurer does not like to be reminded of the fact that the people of Australia have been ""bull-dozed,"" because he has not exercised proper control over his Department.",84
516,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,More abuse!,84
517,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"It is because of this smothering-up that honourable members on this side of the House have to fight, in order to see that justice is done, and in order that the people may ascertain what is the real position. Nobody knows what IB the state of our finances today, because of the keep-itdark policy of this Government, backed up by the great majority of members who are not prepared to give a fair deal in regard to many matters that come before this Parliament. Nobody can say what this Merton versus Hughes case has cost the people of Australia. Nobody knows what it is going to cost. I feel very strongly in regard to this matter, because there has been a continual smothering-up of public expenditure, and we have never been allowed to know what is going on. We have never been able to' It is find out how this expenditure has been incurred, and who benefits from it. This is altogether wrong.

529,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,Illawarra) [10.45] - I can understand the . disappointment of honourable members opposite at the discovery of this mare's nest on last year's Estimates.  last year's Estimates at all.,85
530,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,Thei r suggestion that there has been an attempt io conceal and cover up certain expenditure is entirely spoiled by the admission of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) that when some time ago he asked a question of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) with regard to this matter he was told that it was in the Attorney General's Department. He then allowed the matter to drop.,85
531,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"No , he did not.",85
532,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"There is no record, at aU events, of his having asked the question of the Attorney-General, and that only involved the writing out of the question and handing it to the Clerk.",85
533,Mr RYAN,Unknown,That is quite incorrect.,85
534,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"So that the first statement that all this has been discovered because of some action which had occupied a couple of hours of the time the of the House to-night is entirely misleading, on the statement of the honourable member for West Sydney himself. If he had pursued his question he would probably have got then as much information as we shall get tomorrow as the result of what has happened to-night. The debate to-night is reminiscent of a good deal we heard in the last Parliament in connection with the War Precautions Act, which has nothing to do with the case. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote agreed tQ. Motion that progress be reported, agreed to.",85
535,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown," Before reporting progress I should like to appeal, as calmly as possible, to honourable members  an apology?",85
536,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member for Hume has immediately become offensive again.  what you said.,85
537,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I am asking honourable members of the Committee on both sides of the House, and particularly the leaders and ex-leaders of parties, to assist the Chair in the conduct of business. on They may believe that they are in a position to judge as well as the occupant of the chair what is taking place, but that is not so. The Chairman is in an altogether different position. It is his duty to preserve order in debate on both sides, but it is impossible for the Chairman to do that and preserve the dignity of the Committee if he is to be treated as the Chairman has been treated tonight. I have had thirty-five years of parliamentary experience, and never before have I heard language used, unrebuked by the leaders of parties, - such as that which I had to listen to to-night. I therefore make an appeal to honourable members that, when we resume our Committee work on the next day of sitting, they refrain from interjections and personalities, which always lead to disorder. I hope that we shall have no more such scenes as that we have witnessed tonight, and for which one honourable member suffered the penalty. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. DEPORTATION or SHBOEDER. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",85
538,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [10.52] - I wish to hear from the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) a statement regarding a case about which I have spoken to him, the person concerned being, 1 understand, a constituent of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. West), who is absent with the Finance Committee. A man named Shroeder was interned in 1915, and because of his internment his wife is taking proceedings against him for divorce on the ground of desertion. He is being deported, and thus being prevented from defending the case. I ask the Minister whether, in view of this fact, his deportation may be suspended for a time to allow of him making a defence.",86
539,Sir GRAFVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"North Sydney-Honorar y Minister) [10.53] - There is no chance of the deportation decision being reversed. Shroeder's case has hung on so long, because he has made excuses from time to time for remaining in Australia. He has been on parole to report himself, and has broken his word. Now, at the last minute, he asks to be permitted to remain longer in Australia, because of the proceedings taken against him in the Divorce Court by his wife. I know some of the facts, which I shall not discuss here, and I assure the honourable member that there is nothing to warrant us in allowing Shroeder to remain in the country any longer. It would not be to any one's benefit for him to stay here, and he will be deported within the next few days. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.54 p.m. ' [254]- 2",86
