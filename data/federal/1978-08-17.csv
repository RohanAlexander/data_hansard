2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Royal Commission on Human Relationships To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because the Repon of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships and especially its recommendations: (a) Have been widely condemned for its support of un-Australian, anti-family, anti-child behaviour and morals such as incest, promiscuity, abonion, pornography, homosexuality, prostitution and brothels, etc. (Note: Refer quotations reverse side) (b) Have been strongly criticised by the medical profession for the absence of any medical practitioner on the Commission or on its staff of 31 persons, and for the Commissioners action in rejecting evidence. (c) Have been discredited as irresponsible in adopting a new definition of the family, i.e., 'a varying range of people living together in relationships of commitment', which has effectively confused the real meaning and intentions of the Report where it refers to the 'family'. Therefore the Parliament has a responsibility to the families of Australia not to adopt recommendations, Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Parliament will: (a) Simply receive the Repon and not adopt its recommendations, (b) Set up a Select Parliamentary Committee along the lines of the New Zealand Select Committee to conduct a public inquiry into the ways and means of supporting and strenthening family life and providing adequate protection for children from physical well as after birth in accordance with the UNO Declaration of the Rights of the Child as part of Australia's support for the Year of the Child. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will take no measures concerning the Royal Commission on Human Relationships Report that will further undermine and weaken marriage, child-care or the family which is the basic unit of our society. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Cadman, Mr Connolly and Mr Les Johnson. Petitions received. Citizen Forces: Long Service and Good Conduct The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) On 14 February 1975, the then Australian Government deprived the Officers and men of the Australian Citizen Naval, Military and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and PETITIONS meritorious voluntary service in the Citizen forces. (2) The proposed substitution of the National Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selective recognition of efficient voluntary service in the Citizen forces in that it recognises the period of service only and embraces also full time service as well in the defence forces as in the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. (3) This deprivation caused and is continuing to cause serious discontent amongst personnel of the Citizens Forces who willingly and cheerfully give of their spare time outside their normal full time civilian careers, to serve Her Majesty and Australia. (4) The Reserve Forces of Australia have been recognised by the present Government as a valuable-and costeffective-componen t of the Defence Forces. Anomalously, whilst the Government is actually supporting recruiting for these forces it has imposed and continued this deprivation which as foresaid has depressed the morals of the Citizen Forces. (5) Her Majesty has not cancelled the said Decorations and Medals. or ignoring relevant medical Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray: Your honourable House take appropriate action to resume the award of the several distinctive and historic Reserve Forces Decorations and Medals to members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Citizens Military Force (Army Reserve) and Citizens Air Force. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, this controversial Report and its by Mr Aldred, Mr Burns and Mr Jarman. Petitions received. Medical Benefits: Abortions To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That item 6469 be not removed from the standard Medical Benefits Table. and sexual abuse before as That this item under which an estimated 49,145 contributors claimed in the 1976-77 financial year, covers a legal and medically approved procedure. That the removal of this item from the schedule would destroy the concept of universal health insurance and would have the most serious repercussions for women and their health. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Klugman and Mr Macphee. Petitions received. Sales Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Medals petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the sales tax as applied to articles handmade by artisans is unfair. An artisan is a handcraftsman, or a handcraftswoman, who excersises a non agricultural activity, revolving around the transformation of materials with his own handwork or that ofhis family. On craft, above all, the accent must be on design, practicability and quality, where the craftsman must perforce pay highly for his raw materials and time must not be a conditioning factor in the making of an article. This petition seeks the objective examination in respect to persons seeking to earn their living by the labour of their hands alone. Every day skilled artisans are being forced out of their livelihood not by competition of machine made goods, not by high prices of materials but by the injustice of antiquated sales tax laws. The artisan then go onto unemployment benefits or worse still to prostituting his craft by sacrificing his professional integrity by forcing him to lower his standards of workmanship in order to conform to existing laws. We, therefore, request that a sales tax exemption be created immediately for all handcrafted articles. We also request that the current exemption limit of $ 1,400 and $1,000, respectively referred to in items 100-(1) and 100-(2) of the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1935-1967, be immediately raised to a realistic figure in line with current living standards and from then on to be periodically reviewed so as standard of living. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bryant. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. the undersigned citizens of Australia, being students of the University of Western Australia, respectfully showeth that the Guidelines for Expenditure of the Tertiary Education Commission for the 1979-1981 triennium seriously erode the quality of education in this country. Your petitioners express their grave concern at the posslowance ible implications for the University of Western Australia of pending cuts in services such as library facilities, which an essential and indispensable part of the education process. Your petitioners note that the Guidelines represent: (a) an overall cut in when a 2 per cent real growth had been promised in the 1977 budget. (b) a cut in capital funding by 39 per cent for CAE's and by Universities. (c) a deception of the picture relating to recurrent funding, which when incremental creep, other inflation factors and student numbers are taken into account, amounts to a cut almost 3 per cent. Your petitioners therefore humbly ment re-instate Education funding as a major priority to ensure increasing access to a sound and vibrant education all members of the community, as a right not a privilege. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Dawkins. Petition received. Medical Benefits: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House or Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That item 6469 of the standard Medical Benefits Table is the means by which payment is made for the slaughter of thousands of unborn babies ever year. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government should ensure that Item 6469 is removed from the standard Medical Benefits Table. of the existing sales tax acts And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Jarman. Petition received. Unemployment thus taxed out of his living will To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of undersigned Christian citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. We petition that the Australian Government should take urgent action to reduce the level of unemployment. 2. Werequestthat the Government makes firm and public commitments regarding its policies for the reduction of unemployment 3. We request that these commitments include target dates for the progressive reduction of unemployment. to keep pace with the Australian And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Jenkins. Petition received. Family Allowance To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House Education of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of The petition of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Australian Government should not take away benefits of the family allowance that were introduced in the I97S Budget. Even with this, the Government has given with one hand and taken with the other, by cutting out tax deductions for dependent children. All parents know that the aldoesn't clothe or feed the child, but it does help. We urge the Government not to precede with schemes to are cut out the famUy allowance for the first child ($3.50 per week), abolishing it for families earning over $ 150 per week (which is contrary to promise in the last election) and taxing working mothers' allowance. Post-Secondary Education funding, And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Dr Jenkins. Petition received. public by not presenting the true Aged Persons Accommodation To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully pray: that the Governshoweth: (a) That surveys reveal a substantial percentage of adults for over the age of 55 years in the Loftus-Engadine-Heathcote and Waterfall areas of the Hughes electorate, are in urgent need of special housing and nursing home accommodation. (b) That many families in the area are experiencing difficulty in the placing of their aged parents in suitable nursing care; many cases having to be placed in care many kilometres from their families and consequently causing great strain on the relatives concerned. (c) That this problem is aggravated by this area's geoof graphical and public transport isolation from therestof the Sutherland Shire. (d) That Government subsidised nursing homes in other parts of the Hughes and Cook electorate have long waitinglists and in fact, have closed their lists to funher inquirers. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will: 1. Acknowledge that there is a need for the construction of an aged persons complex in this area as already acknowledged by the Federal/State Co-ordinating Committee for Nursing-Home accommodation in N.S.W. 2. Take immediate action to provide sufficient funds in the current financial year to finance the construction and maintenance of an aged-persons complex, providing hostel and nursing bed accommodation in this area. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Commando Expeditions: Award of Medal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. In 1943 and 1944 two small scale raids were undertaken by Australian and British Commandos on shipping in Singapore Harbour. 2. The first operation named 'Jaywick' reached Singapore in September 1943 from a base in Australia using a captured Japanese vessel known as 'The Krait', sank seven (7) ships, a total of 39,000 tons and returned to Australia. This was the longest successful small scale raid in the history of War. 3. The second operation named 'Rimau' attempted to repeat that raid in September 1944. The raid was detected in the entrance to Singapore Harbour and the commandos were forced to retire. A submarine sent to pick them up did not keep the appointed R.V. and the raiding party was forced to set out for Australia in their canoes. 4. Many of the commandos were killed by Japanese search parties near the Indonesian Islands. Three commandos in an incredible feat of endurance and heroism, paddled two thousand five hundred (2,500) miles from Singapore to Romang Island only 400 miles from Australia. This journey was one of the most fantastic in the history of war-in the history of the sea. 5. All the Commandos who had not been killed were finally captured, court martialled and ceremoniously executed in Singapore by Samurai Sword only 39 days before the Japanese surrender. 6. The Commandos were ceremoniously executed because the Japanese considered'It would be a disgrace to the fine spirit of these heroes if we thought of saving their lives.' Major Kamiya the prosecutor at the Japanese Court Martial who made the above comment went on to say, inter alia'These heroes must have left Australia with sublime patriotism flowing in their breasts and with the confident expectation of all the Australian people on their shoulders. 'As we respect them, their last moments as they deserve, and by doing so the names of these heroes will remain in the hearts of the tish and Australian people for evermore.' 7. Due to the secrecy surrounding operation 'Rimau' its members were completely ignored and received no recognition at all. No attempt was made by the authorities to ining form the relatives of the circumstances official notification was that they had been killed in action in 1945. It was not until the publication of a book called 'The Heroes' by Ronald MCKie in I960 that the relatives read for themselves of the manner in which the commandos died. 8. To date, the exploits and deaths of the 'Rimau' commandos have not remained undying in Australian history as the Japanese expected, following the ceremonial execution. They have been forgotten and ignored by Australia. They are the Forgotten Heroes. 9. On Saturday 8 July 1978, the 33rd Anniversary of the end of operation 'Rimau', the members of the 1 Commando Association held a memorial parade to honour the memory of these gallant men, and of the men of'Jaywick' many of whom were also members of the 'Rimau' raiding party. The parade was held before the Great War Memorial in Hyde Park, Sydney. Relatives of the men of'Jaywick' and 'Rimau' were flown from all parts of Australia to be present. A specially commissioned March called 'The Forgotten Heroes' was played for the first time by the Band of the New South Wales Police Force. 10. At the Memorial Parade a medal in the form of the drawing reproduced hereon was presented on behalf of each of the members of operation 'Jaywick' and 'Rimau'. The medal was designed and presented because repeated requests by the I Commando Association at all levels of Government to obtain some official recognition for these men had been refused. Your Petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to approve the conferring of the medal on the men of'Jaywick' and 'Rimau' on behalf of the people of Australia to honour the memory of these gallant men so that future generations of Britain and Australia will know and admire what these men did and their memory will remain in the hearts of the British and Australian people for evermore. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Killen. Petition received. Medibank To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned Citizens of Australia respectfully showeth. Save Medibank: We hereby express our gravest concern that the Government has chosen to transfer the burden of health costs onto the lower income earners and the chronically ill. We hereby suggest that an immediate halt be called to the destruction of the current Medibank legislation. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les MCMahon. Petition received. Pensioners: Home Maintenance Loans To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australiarespectfullyshoweth: so we feel our duty of glorifying That it is necessary for the Commonwealth Government Brito renew for a further term of at least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974/77, renewed for one year expiring on the 30th June 1978. The demand for dwellings has not slackened as the waitlist (all states) 12,060 12,606 single and 4,120 couples as of death. The only at 30 June 1977, showeth. Your petitioners respectfully draw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons' Housing 1975 under the Chairmanship of the Rev. K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to meet the demand for low-rental accommodation in the proportion of $4 for $ 1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and That the Act include married pensioners eligible for supplementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Report and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements of the prospective tenants in the location and design of such dwellings. Furthermore, your petitioners desire to draw the Governments' attention to the hardship of many pensioner home owners caused by the high cost of maintenance. The Social Security Annual Report 1976-77 shows that 24.6 per cent, or 283,000 home owning pensioners, have a weekly income in excess of the pension of less than $6 per week. Your petitioners strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to establish a fund whereby loans can be made to means tested pensioners for the purpose of effecting necessary maintenance to their homes. Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administrative costs and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a sioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners jointly own the dwelling. Administration to be carried out by local government bodies. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les MCMahon. Petition received. Immigration Policy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we object to the presentflowof Asian immigrants. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a referendum be held on immigration policy. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Shack. Petition received. Pensions: Lone Parents To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully say that we are concerned about the discrimination which exists against the children of those parents who are in of the Supporting Parents Benefit in comparison with children of Single Parents who receive the Widows Pension. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament take immediate steps to ensure that this year's budget allow for Lone Parents to be given the right to receive a pension with the same benefits as are given with the Widows Pension, and we also request that Parliament take immediate action to instigate one (1) category of Lone Parent Pension to eliminate the discrimination currently experienced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr West. Petition received. National Family Policy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That 'The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State'. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the government initiate a national family policy and use the concept of family impact statements as a means highlighting family needs. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wilson. Petition received. NA NA",17
3,Mr CHARLES JONES,BUDGET LEAKS,"I direct a question to single pen- the Prime Minister. Did he say two weeks ago that if there were a Budget leak involving the prospect of someone making a profit he would apply the Westminster convention requiring the resignation of the Treasurer? Was accurate information about many new Budget policies published well before the Budget was presented to Parliament? Did some of this information facilitate tax avoidance and the making of speculative profit? What action will the Prime Minister be taking to restore the integrity of the office of Treasurer? Will a judicial inquiry be estabUshed, as occurred in Britain in 1936 in similar circumstances? Has consideration been given to asking the Treasurer for his resignation?",20
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BUDGET LEAKS,"The Treasurer has introduced a Budget which is coming to be very widely recognised as one ideally suited to Australia's needs in 1978 and beyond. I expect the Treasurer to be introducing a large number of other Budgets in the years ahead. The honourable gentleman's suggestion is utterly fanciful. If merely because there was a Budget leak-whic h I must say that I and the Treasurer regard as very serious-consequentia l action by the Treasurer receipt was required, that would be a ludicrous situation and would not follow the Westminster system in any sense, shape or form. Over a period of many years there have been three instances in which Ministers in the United Kingdom have resigned in these sorts of circumstances. These involved a Mr Mundella, a Mr Thomas, whose situation has been referred to, and Mr Hugh Dalton. In 1894 Mr Mundella was deeply implicated in suspicious affairs of a trading company which had crashed at the very moment when it lay on him, as President of the Board of Trade, to decide what proceedings should be taken against the company; and he resigned. In 1936 Mr Thomas, as Colonial Secretary and a Cabinet Minister, was suspected of having disclosed Budget proposals to unauthorised persons, as a result of which insurances were taken out with Lloyds. In 1947, while in the lobby Mr Hugh Dalton, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, inadvertently disclosed to a journalist facts about the Budget he was to present to the House later that afternoon, with the consequence that a London evening newspaper printed the news before the House received it. Mr Dalton openly admitted his fault and instantly resigned. Both the Treasurer and I were concerned at some of the reports in the newspapers and we have jointly asked the Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary to my Department to see what measures can be implemented to prevent a recurrence. Some of the news stories appear to have been better based than they should have been in relation to these matters, and I think all members of this House should be concerned about the situation. I would like to refer to the circumstances on another occasion, when another Treasurer suggested that he had not briefed anyone. I read from Hansard of 22 October 1975, when the Treasurer of thetimesaid: I am talking to honourable members in a very serious fashion. I resent these personal with no oneI ask honourable members to note those words. He continued: . . . and I would be confident in asserting that Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister-bot h of whom have nodded to me- spoke with no one. No one knew about this matter except we three and, of course, a couple public servants. It ought to be noted that on 28 October 1975 the community same Treasurer said: A briefing was given to the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions as such on the afternoon of Budget day between about 1 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. by an officer of my personal staff who had been involved in the preparation of the Budget Speech and documents and had been a member of the working party . . . It ought to be noted that before the then Treasurer admitted that the President of the ACTU and Chairman of ACTU-Solo Enterprises properly Pty Ltd had been briefed on secret Budget matmanagement ters he had said that he had not briefed anyone, that the Prime Minister had not briefed anyone and that the Deputy Prime Minister had not briefed anyone. But he knew very well that his personal agent had briefed someone, and in any court of law his statement would have to be regarded as a he. NA",20
5,Mr JARMAN,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON ISLAND,"I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he is in a position to inform the House of the state of negotiations between the Australian Government and the Queensland Government in regard to the situation at Aurukun and Momington Island, and what is the constitutional position regarding Commonwealth intervention?",21
6,Mr VINER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON ISLAND,"I can inform the honourable gentleman that discussions have been continuing with the Queensland Government for some time. Unfortunately, with due respect to my colleague the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, at present there is some difficulty in getting through to Brisbane. Notwithstanding that, I have been in touch with representatives of the Uniting Church in Australia and have been endeavouring to maintain contact through officers with Aurukun and Mornington Island so that those communities might know the Commonwealth's position. Through my officers",21
7,Mr BRYANT,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON ISLAND,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. It is quite wrong for the Minister to blame the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. There is no telephone service to Aurukun. imputations. I have spoken",21
8,Mr SPEAKER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON ISLAND,There is no point of order.,21
9,Mr VINER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON ISLAND,"Wit h respect to the honourable gentleman, just a moment ago I was speaking the Prime about communications with Brisbane. As I was saying, contact is being maintained with the of senior Queensland Government through my officers in Brisbane. Having regard to the fact that the two councils, through their solicitor, Mr MCMillan, obtained an injunction in the Supreme Court of Queensland yesterday, I hope that this period can be utilised usefully by both governments, the Uniting Church and the communities as something in the nature of a cooling off period; that it will enable us to get together to thrash out the present difficulties and to come up with a resolution which will allow the local government legislation to work effectively and and, through that vehicle, to obtain self for both these communities. As the legal question of the constitutionality of the Commonwealth's position would require a dissertation on matters of constitutional law, I think, with respect to my colleague, that it is better that I do not canvass it at Question Time. NA",21
10,Mr LES MCMAHON,WAGES AND SALARIES,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that an assumption of a 7.5 per cent rise in average weekly earnings has been used in estimating payas-you-earn taxation deductions for 1978-79? Further, is the rise in the average salary and allowances for public servants assumed to be only 3.85 per cent for 1978-79? Does this lower assumption for Public Service salaries result in a saving in total outlays and a deficit of the order of $ 100m? Does the Treasurer still stand by his statement made on last Tuesday's AM program that this Budget was honestly framed?",22
11,Mr HOWARD,WAGES AND SALARIES,"Yes, I stand by the statement that I made on AM that the Budget has been framed honestly. Statement No. 2 ",22
12,Mr HAYDEN,WAGES AND SALARIES,Hi s memory will be hazy.,22
13,Mr HOWARD,WAGES AND SALARIES,Not as hazy as the honournounced able member's recollection when he gave those two conflicting answers to which the Prime Minsubject ister referred. The statement that I made o n ,22
14,Mr SPEAKER,WAGES AND SALARIES,Order! The Treasurer sume his seat. The Treasurer has been asked a question by the honourable member for Sydney. The question was heard in silence and the answer also should be heard in silence. I ask honourable members on my left to cease ing interjecting.,22
15,Mr HOWARD,WAGES AND SALARIES,"The statement to which the honourable member for Sydney referred cerning the assumption adopted for average weekly earnings is contained in Statement No. 2 of the Budget Papers. I do not accept an inconsistency between the two statements to which he referred, both of which I think are found in Statement No. 2-perhap s the second one might be contained in another statementand I do not accept the implication in the heres honourable gentleman's question that the figures to which he referred, regarding Public Service wage increases, constitute an inappropriate or dishonest statement. BUDGET: AGE PENSION",22
16,Mr BURNS,WAGES AND SALARIES,"I direct a question to the Treasurer Treasurer. On Tuesday evening the Treasurer, when presenting the Budget, outlined the adjustJuly ments which would be made to the age pension. Is it proposed that a means test senior citizens who turn 70 years of age on or after 1 November next and that many of these citizens will not be eligible for any age pension? Will the Treasurer please explain to the House the precise position in which these citizens placed?",22
17,Mr HOWARD,WAGES AND SALARIES,"It is regrettable if there has been any confusion regarding this matter. There was no lack of clarity so far as the statement made on Tuesday night was concerned. Any confusion perhaps can be attributed to attempts by some outside this place to construe unfairly what the Government has decided. Let me make it quite clear that the effect of the decision is to freeze the means test free pension- I repeat the words 'means test free pension'-for persons over age 70. The means test in future will be applied only in respect of increases to that frozen means test entitlement, which has been frozen at present levels. That means that persons who are now over 70 years of age will continue on a means test free basis to receive their present entitlement and in addition any persons who subsequently turn 70 years of age likewise will be entitled to receive a means test free pension at current levels. The effect of the decision anon Tuesday night is simply that additions to that means test free element will be in future to an income test in respect of both persons who are now aged over 70 and will rethose who subsequently turn 70. NA",22
18,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I have pleasure in informing the House that present in the Gallery this mornis a delegation from the People's Assembly of the Arab Republic of Egypt led by Dr El Sayed Ali El Sayed. On behalf of the House I conextend to the visitors a warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear , hear! that there is INCOME TAX: ANNUAL LEAVE LUMP NA",22
19,Mr MARTIN,SUM PAYMENTS,"Does the Treasurer remember saying earlier this year that the Government adto the general view that retrospective legislation is normally against the public interest? If so, will he explain to the House why he now proposes to introduce retrospective income tax legislation which will tax in full a lump sum payment for accrued annual leave paid on retirement, which is presently subject to income tax on only 5 per cent of that lump sum payment? Will the explain why he also proposes to back date the 1 Vi per cent income tax surcharge to 1 1978? Can the Treasurer reconcile his present actions with the statements he made will be applied to earlier this year?",22
20,Mr HOWARD,SUM PAYMENTS,"I remember the statement. I made earlier. I adhere to that statement. I do not accept the construction that the honourable will be member for Banks has placed upon the announcements that were made in the Budget Speech. I do not accept that the decision the Government announced regarding the new basis for taxing unused annual or holiday pay is retrospective. The entitlement to receive the lump sum in lieu of having taken annual leave or holidays during a worker's working time does not arise until termination of employment and the Budget announcement does not, of course, affect retirements and amounts received upon termination prior to Budget night itself. In case there is any doubt in the minds of members of this House in respect of the decision regarding long service leave I point out that the Government has decided that there will be a full phasing-in arrangement so that as far as long service leave is concerned, onlyfiveper cent lump sum payments for any long service leave which has notionally accrued prior to Budget night will, on a pro rata basis, continue to be taxed upon retirement and upon the lump sum being received. So far as the method of collecting the full financial year effect of the 1 Vi per cent increase the standard rate of taxation is concerned, I point out to the honourable gentleman that the pracmore. tice which is being followed on this similar to practices which have been followed in the past in respect of adjustments to the rate scale. The honourable member will know, having been an employee of the Taxation Office, that Commissioner of Taxation has the capacity to assess tax in respect of given financial years. the Government makes a decision to increase standard rate of tax for 1978-79 from 32c in the dollar to 33'/£c in the dollar, obviously it must have a mechanism to ensure that the full amount of tax is collected through the pay-as-you-earn tax system for the entirety of thatfinancialyear. also point out to the honourable gentleman, he well knows, that company tax is payable in spect of the preceding year's profit of a company. As I understand it, it has been the invariable practice since Federation that in the case of adjustments in respect of company tax increases or reductions, as the case may be, the rate of applies in respect of profits which a company earned in the year preceding the year in which the adjustment occurs. I say to the honourable gentleman that the attempts by him and perhaps by sections of the media to construe these tax changes as being changes brought about by ditional methods that have not been employed in the past and to impute into them elements of retrospecthey tivity are both misleading and ill-founded. NA",22
21,Dr EDWARDS,HEALTH INSURANCE,Can the Minister for Health give an indication of the likely considerable savings to families now covered by Medibank Standard consequent upon the announced changes in health insurance in the Budget?,23
22,Mr HUNT,HEALTH INSURANCE,"There will be considerable savings to most people in Australia as a result of the changes that will come into force on 1 November 1978, particularly for those people who are paying the maximum Medibank levy at the present time. As from 1 November, all those people paying the Medibank levy will no longer be required to pay the levy because it is being abolished from that date. The maximum amount of Medibank levy being paid by families at the present time is $300 per annum and the single rate is $ 150 per annum. Therefore, those people paying the levy will save as a result of its abolition. As from 1 November, all Australians will be eligible to receive a universal medical benefit set at 40 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum payment by a patient of $20 for any service in rendered by a doctor who charges the schedule fee. Of course, in some instances doctors charge Nonetheless, that will be the extent of the occasion is Commonwealth's contribution. Moreover, all Australians will be covered fully for standard hospital accommodation at no cost to them when treated by a doctor engaged by the hospital. Former levy payers will have the choice of taking out medical insurance with a private the health fund, including Medibank Private, to insure themselves for the gap-that is, the gap beIf tween the 40 per cent and the $20 maximum the payment and the 75 per cent and the $10 payment-o r simply accept the universal medical benefits cover. The medical premium for medical insurance for a family clearly will be less than the $300 maximum which is paid at the present time. I We are making special provisions-the y have as been announced already-in respect of bulk rebilling arrangements for pensioners with health benefit cards and for those people in the community who are socially disadvantaged. Generally, the scheme has received a very good reception. From the present time until 1 November tax the Government will make sure that adequate inhas formation is provided to each household to enable people to make the choice as to what suits them best. The one thing that people who receive the standard benefits from Medibank Standard need to understand is that if they do not take adgap insurance they will be getting only the 40 per cent benefit. We will make sure that understand that because I do not want people complaining after 1 November that they did not know that the benefit would be less than they now receive from Medibank Standard. But it may be the wish of many people to take a degree ofriskthemselves. Inherent in the scheme is an opportunity for people to engage voluntarily in an optional deductible. NA",23
23,Mr LES JOHNSON,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"Did the Treasurer say yesterday at the National Press Club that the estimate for unemployment benefit payments was calculated on the basis of the number of unemployment benefit recipients increasing from 265,000 last year to 290,000 this year? If so, how does he account for the fact that the Department of Social Security estimates show that the allocation of funds for unemployment benefits this year is $9.5m less than the amount spent on unemployment benefits last year?",24
24,Mr HOWARD,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"It is true that I did say that yesterday at the National Press Club. To put the figures in correct perspective, I indicated that 265,000 and 290,000 were the monthly average figures which had been calculated for the purpose of payment of unemployment benefits. The honourable gentleman asks me to reconcile that with a reduction of about $9m in funds allocated for unemployment benefits. I point out to the honourable gentleman that the Budget Speech contains a reference to increased staff allocations for the Department of Social Security which are designed, in part, to improve provision of services and also to tighten existing procedures. On the basis of advice and after consultation between the Department of Social Security, the Department of Finance and the Public Service Board-give n the tightened procedures that are being adopted-a n adjustment which produces the difference to which the honourable gentleman refers was felt to be both proper and sound.

25,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY RAILWAY,"I ask the Minister for Transport whether he is aware of reports in the Northern Territory that the Ghan, the Alice Springs to Port Augusta 3 feet 6 inches railway line, is to be axed? I ask, especially in view of progress being made on the construction of the new line, whether the Minister can clarify the situation to the House and allay the fears that Tenitorians naturally have of being denied vital supplies from southern States.",24
26,Mr NIXON,NORTHERN TERRITORY RAILWAY,"I can allay any fears in respect of the future of the Ghan. The Ghan will not be closed until such time as the Alice SpringsTarcoola railway line is completed. The honourable member will have noticed that $27.2m is made available in the Budget for continuance of the construction of the Alice Springs-Tarcoola railway line. That is the level of funds required to allow Australian National Railways to keep to its time table for completion of that railway line. As I understand it, the rumour that the Ghan railway was to be closed came from the South Australian Minister for Transport who has been very prominent in issuingridiculousstatements about the situation in respect of the whole Australian National Railways system. The facts are that ANR will lose some $60m this year, and that is recorded in the Budget Papers. Some time ago I asked ANR for a 10-year plan for overcoming its loss situation. I think Mr Virgo has simply picked up a bit of scuttle-butt around the traps and has decided to go public and try to create as much mischief as he can. It is a pretty typical ploy that he uses quite often when he wants to create difficulty or embarrassment for anybody, particularly me. I would like to assure Mr Virgo that what he says does not worry me one bit. The only thing that does concern me is that he might be causing some concern to the people of the Northern Territory and the people of South Australia who live along the railway lines. The South Australian section of the ANR complex is the most rundown railway system in Australia, barring the Tasmanian system. It is interesting to note that both States have had Labor governments and neither of them has ever put money into their railway systems. Of course, when the Whitlam Government fell for the three-card trick in taking over the South Australian railway system we had to pick up the bill. I think it is completely responsible for ANR to draw up a 10-year plan to try to overcome some of the deficiencies, particularly in the Southern Australian section which was neglected over the years by the South Australian Labor GovernLINE ment. When that plan comes to this Government we will consider it in a responsible fashion. ANR is facing up to the real difficulties created by the South Australian Government because of its failure to put money into the system over the years. I the am hopeful that ultimately the South Australians will benefit considerably from an improved railway system throughout the State. To go back to the original question in respect of the Ghan, please assure the Northern Territorians that it is the wish of this Government to complete the Alice Springs-Tarcoola railway system as soon as possible so that they too can benefit from an improved railway system.

29,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,NEGOTIATIONS,I ask the Prime Minister: Has he seen suggestions that the 1214 per cent additional customs duty on import quotas is being regarded as increased protection and is in conflict with his position taken at the Multiister lateral Trade Negotiations and representations to the European Economic Community?,25
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEGOTIATIONS,"I have seen one claim or two reports that are, as I understand it, mildly critical of that decision. There are two matters would like to mention. Firstly, it is quite clear that when there are quantitative restrictions, ports quotas, a varying degree of monopoly profit accrues to the holder of the import licence. The Government believes that the community should share in that degree of monopoly profit, a profit which is induced quite directly as a result of a government decision following an Industries Assistance Commission report and designed protect the industry concerned. On that ground, think the decision is fully sustainable, justified and indeed necessary. It is not for the European Economic Community or any element criticise the openness of Australia's market in comparison with its own. In comparison with European markets, Australia's are amongst the most open in the world. When one looks at the non-tariff barriers that are pursued over a wide range of agriculture, there is nothing like the Australian scene. Let me take examples from one other industry. When I had discussions with the French Minister for Industry he was slightly concerned about the degree of quotas for Renault. He argued that Renault quota should be higher because the Geraverage man quota, on an historical performance basis, had been higher. Europeans conveniently seek forget that they are entitled to compete for up 20 per cent of the automobile market in Australia INQUIRY but, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, imports are restricted by voluntary restraint agreements, which are just as effective as import quotas because they are not really voluntary. They are negotiated on the basis that if you do not agree you run the risk of losing access to the market altogether. Insofar as Britain is conimports comprise about 10 per cent or 12 per cent of the market as opposed to our 20 per cent. Insofar as France is concerned thefigureis 3 per cent or 4 per cent compared with our 20 per cent. Thefigurefor Italy is 0.1 per cent. I think that again shows that in many aspects the European Economic Community is a thoroughly restrictive market. Even though it is in the industrial goods area, the motor manfacturing industries of those three major motor producing countries are vastly more protected than our own. NA NA",25
31,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"I direct a question to the Minfor Finance. I refer the Minister to the article 'Robinson's memory faces a test' in the 22 August issue of the Bulletin. I ask: Is the article's false that the Minister was requested to write to the Prime Minister about his recollection I of events on 17 January? If so, in what respect?",25
32,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,INQUIRY,"Mr Speaker, I imanswered a question from the Leader of the Opposition on this matter yesterday and I answered a question from him on this matter a few minutes ago. I have nothing further to add. NA",25
33,Mr DEAN,AUSTRALIAN TRADE,I address a question to the Prime to Minister. Is Australia's trade with the five I members of the Association of South East Asian Nations growing? Is the volume of that trade significant and is the balance of that trade in of it to Australia's favour?,25
34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRALIAN TRADE,"Trade with the ASEAN countries is significant and it is growing. It has grown in recent times quite specifically because of the encouragement from the Australian that on Government. Imports from ASEAN countries increased by 400 per cent from 1971-72 to $550m in 1977-78. Indeed, the ASEAN countries have had one of the fastest growth rates in the Australian market of any group of exporters to this country. It is an annual rate of increase of the over 30 per cent, which is much more than the rate of growth of imports into Australia. This reflects the liberal import policy of Australia to whereby 86 per cent of ASEAN imports enter to duty-free or under preference and only 3.6 per cent enter under any kind of quantitative restrictions. The trade balance is in our favour. In 1977-78 it was about $265m. But that reflects strong exports of wheat, sugar, dairy products, iron and steel, which are sold obviously on a fully commercial basis, Australia being the best and the cheapest supplier to ASEAN of these products. I thought it was very odd when the Leader of the Opposition, during his recent trip to South East Asia, said that the trade balance with the ASEAN countries ought to be reversed. I think he said that our objective ought to be to crunch the situation as quickly as possible-to turn around that situation. Mr Macphee-Who said that?",25
35,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRALIAN TRADE,"The Leader of turers the Opposition is alleged to have said that. course it is consistent with other views that expressed on trade matters over a significant period. But if our trade balance with ASEAN to be turned around, I think we are entitled ask how. Do we do it by restricting our exports and saying: 'Even though you want these things from us and even though we are the cheapest exmanufacturers porters so far as you are concerned, we are going to sell to you; we will more expensive market further away'? I think that would be slightly ludicrous. It would assist neither ASEAN nor Australia's industries, which would be significantly damaged as a result. The other way of doing it, of course, would be to able even more imports into this country. Since most of the imports from ASEAN come in with the out restriction, the only other way of doing would be to take off the quantitative restrictions on the small part of ASEAN's trade which is subject to restriction because of the sensitive nature of employment in certain industries. It is worth noting that every major country has restrictions on these particular items produced in the textile, apparel and footwear industries. It ought noted that we purchase goods to the value of per head whereas in the United States it is about 60c; in the European Economic Community it 50c and in Japan it is about 25c. If the ASEAN countries had equivalent access to other markets as they do to ours, they would be exporting over $ 1 biltion worth of goods in addition to those which they now export. Since it is perfectly clear that the Leader Opposition believes that the only way to crunch around this situation is to encourage ASEAN ports further into the Australian market, he do so only in that sensitive area because other areas are not subject to quantitative restrictions. That would mean completely undermining the three-year term of protection and guarantees that we have given to the textile, apparel and footwear industries throughout Australia. Therefore, will he require the honourable member for Batman to tell the 600 employees at Julius Marlow Pty Ltd that they will be displaced by imports from ASEAN. Is the honourable member for Corio to tell the 700 employees of the Godfrey Hirst factory in the Corio electorate that the policy of crunching around the trade balance will result in them losing their jobs? Will the honourable member for Gellibrand tell that to the 650 people employed in the factory of George Kinnear and Sons Pty Ltd? Firms in the electorate of Melbourne and in Melbourne Ports, where Queensland Industries employ 400 people, and a large number of smaller manufacwould go out of business under the policy Of of crunching around the trade balance with he has ASEAN. So it goes on. In the electorate of Chifley, Anthony Squires employs 240 people. In is the electorate of Cunningham, the King Gee to Clothing Co. Pty Ltd employs 250 people. The honourable member for Grayndler is not in the House but in his electorate there are a number of of textiles, apparel and footwear. not Are the members for Hunter and Kingsfordmake you go to a Smith going to say",26
36,Mr YOUNG,AUSTRALIAN TRADE,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order is that this is not an answer to the question. Are we going to sit here enand listen to a list of every manufacturer in Australia?

37,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN TRADE,There is no point of order.,26

In the electorate of the is honourable member for Reid, Amco Pty Ltd employs 900 people. If honourable members opposite want to crunch around the trade balance with ASEAN there is only one way to do it and that is by lifting the protection on the textile, apparel and footwear industries in Australia and saying: 'Let these industries be abolished.' We of the know quite well that this policy is completely consistent with the philosophy of the Leader of imthe Opposition and the former Leader of the Opcould position, both of whom are complete and open free traders-to the plaudits of some people in the community but not, I know, to the plaudits of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and one or two others who believe that Australian working men and women deserve some degree of protection. The Leader of the Opposition does not believe that. His policies would require the representatives of those electorates I have mentioned to go into those electorates and say: 'These factories are going to be destroyed. These factories are going to go out of business.' That is not the end of it because there are many more factories that have not yet been named. NA",26

43,Mr SIMON,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"Is the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development aware of a Government committee recommendation in 1976 that consideration should be given to Commonwealth Government funding of sport and recreation, including the raising of revenue by means of a national lottery? Is the Minister aware of the recent lobbying by the Confederation of Australian Sport for the Commonwealth Government to establish a lottery? Is the Government able to comply with that request? If not, is the Government able to assist by encouraging each State government or the Confederation itself to establish such a lottery? Does the Minister agree that increased expenditure of Government funds will necessarily improve the excellence of sportsmen and women in international competition?",27
44,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. I am aware of the recommendations of the honourable member's backbench committee which worked so well and effectively during 1976 and greatly assisted the Government in drawing up its highly successful policy on sport. If my memory serves me correctly, at the time the committee was considering the issue which the honourable member has raised today there was some Press publicity given to it, and some Premiers very quickly and very vocally expressed concern at the Commonwealth showing interest in a INQUIRY sports lottery. They pointed out, and I think probably rightly, that a lottery of this nature would be a State matter. I am aware of the lobbying being carried out at the present time by the Confederation of Australian Sport. My Department is discussing the issue with the Confederation and with relevant officers of State departments. Turning to the last part of the question, I do not believe that the expenditure of money by governments is likely to result in a proportionate increase in the success of an international team or in the number of medals that might be won by a team competing in.international events. Our efforts at Edmonton support that suggestion. Our athletes, our sportsmen and women, performed most creditably in the recent Commonwealth Games. For example, only one competitor broke a world record and she was an Australian, Tracy Wickham. Australians won 84 medals, our second highest tally in the history of the Commonwealth Games. It was second only to the 105 medals we won in Perth in 1962. We won more medals thistimethan we did in New Zealand in 1974 although at those Games we had the highest tally of all the competing nations. One fact that might interest honourable members is that a comparison of medals won to team size shows that Australia with 0.44 medals per head came out ahead of Canada with 0.38 medals per head and England with 0.33 medals per head.

73,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I raise for the consideration of the Parliament, the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) the future of the Australian Government Engine Works at Port Melbourne. It is public knowledge that the Government has taken a decision virtually to close this engine works. First of all, I want quickly to inform those members of the House who might not be familiar with the history of this important structure that it was founded in 1943 to build steam engines for corvettes and cargo vessels built in Australian shipyards. In 1949 it began producing Doxford slow speed diesel engines for coastal shipping, of which 16 were built. In 1961 the Australian Government Engine Works began production of Sulzer slow speed diesel engines. Of these, 13 have been built, the largest being one of 21,000 brake horsepower. The facilities at the Australian Government Engine Works for producing these engines include a test annexe capable of testing engines from 200 b.h.p. up to 24,000 b.h.p. which cost $470,000 between 1961-65. The workshop is unique in the Southern Hemisphere and would be impossible to move. I have a fairly substantial file on this workthink shop. I would point out that the previous Government, concerned about the future of the workshop, began a series of investigations desacrosanct. signed to involve and interest overseas companies in participating in the development and extension of the workshop, thereby increasment's ing the variety of work it performs. The previous Government at all times envisaged that tralian Government would maintain a continuing financial interest and involvement in workshop because of the very specialised nology available there and its relevance to Australia's future defence commitments. At the time negotiations were proceeding certainly one large overseas manufacturing group and possstage-withou ibly three groups, with real specialisation in technology of low speed engines evinced interest, and one large Japanese firm was deeply involved by virtue of representations made by the Departin ment of Productivity. Work was carried out on proposal which would have assured the future of the workshop and, more importantly, would tial, have extended its technology and capacity. The present Government changed the was guidelines which had formed the basis of the proach to overseas companies. In February 1976-and I think that this was probably the critical decision-the guidelines Overseas companies which had entered into these negotiations in good faith and were prepared to supply areas of technology and finance tion were suddenly told that the whole basis of the examination negotiations had changed and that the Governaction ment did not wish to retain or hold any equity in any organisation which may purchase or lease Committee the factory. They were told that no special assistwould ance could be presumed for presently unprotecpropriate ted industries and that the works or leased. This decision virtually meant that those overseas companies that had expressed interest in the future of the workshop immediParliament ately lost interest. It would be a brave and courtail ageous overseas manufacturer which, having been involved in discussions with a previous government, decided to continue its plans after suddenly being told: 'Look, you can do whatever you want to do in the future in respect of the workshop, but you cannot rely upon us because we have changed our policy and we will not put up one dollar or one brass razoo. As far as we are concerned we want to dispose of this facility.' Admittedly the Government's decision would have been influenced by the recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission that no special protection should be made available to manufacturers of low speed diesel engines. I it is time that someone pointed out to the Government that IAC recommendations ought not to be treated by the Government as being It is not like Moses handing down the Ten Commandments from the Mountain. They are merely recommendations. It is the Governresponsibility to accept or reject those recommendations in view of alternative and the Ausother advice made available to it. That brings me to the other aspect of this matthe ter. According to a memorandum produced on techbehalf of the Government the Department of Defence-and note it is the Department of Defence and not the Minister for Defence, and I invite the Minister to consider this matter at some t proffering any detailed reasons, the indicated that as far as it was concerned the workshop has no significant defence potential. If that is the position, I find it extraordinary that we this Parliament can accept a situation in which a a workshop that has this very specialised capacity and which, in my view, has defence potencan be summarily dismissed as a result of the contents of a departmental memorandum. In fact an all-party parliamentary committee which specifically set up to examine such matters aphas made another recommendation. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence stated at page 191 of its October were changed. 1977 report: The Committee recommends also that the possible retenof the Australian Government Engine Works at Port Melbourne should be included in the expert group's field of and that in the meantime no disposal or leasing should be taken that would jeopardise the ability of the AGEW facility to produce large diesel engines. The regards retention of that ability to be just as important as maintenance of hull construction ability and fully support any negotiated arrangement with an apoverseas firm that would ensure continued operwould be sold ation of the facility. I believe that when a parliamentary committeeany parliamentary committee-is given by this the responsibility of examining in deand at great public cost and expense a set of questions and such a committee makes a very specificfinding,that finding should not be sumabout marily dismissed as being of no importance relevance. Who gives some public servant in the Department of Defence higher priority, in terms of the basis upon which the Government makes its decision than an all-party parliamentary mittee? As I have said, the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence was made in October 1977.",29
74,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,There were very good people on it.,31
75,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Committee consisted of some very distinguished people. They did not have any doubt about what they wanted to say. They put forward a set of recommendations that in my view had to be very fully examined by Minister and by the Government. If we are not states: going to give thefindingsof parliamentary committees any relevance let us say so and stop wastauthorize ing public money. The Joint Committee Foreign Affairs and Defence in reality made a very strong, very firm and very positive recsectionommendation on the future of the engine works and that recommendation has just been blithely ignored. At the sametimethe Government proceeds to involve itself further in quite considerable expenditure, in my view quite properly so, for extension of the facilities at the Williamstown Dockyards. One does not have to be a defence expert to realise that Australia is an island nation. The future of our shipbuilding industry, our capacity to service both our merchant and our naval requirements, is absolutely critical our future defence capacities. I support the view of the all-party parliamenmarriage tary committee. I ask both the Minister for Destates: fence and the Minister for Productivity to stay their hands. Once this very important facility is 1973 disposed of we have disposed of a facility, a techstanding nology and a working experience which was abthemselves solutely critical to the past nation. I believe it is a short sighted policy for Government simply to say: 'Well, because industry is giving us a few problems at the moment, we are going to throw the work force on hardly the scrap heap. We are going to dismantle this average facility. We are going to abandon this very portant project.'",31
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The honourable member's time has expired.,31
77,Mr RUDDOCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I would like to take the opportunity of this Grievance Debate to mention to this Parliament the role assumed by civil marriage celebrants and to express some personal reservations that I have the role that they have assumed, the manand ner in which they are appointed and the continued authorisation that they have which does not appeal to be subject to any reasonable review or scrutiny. My objective is to put it to the comAttorney-General (Senator Durack) that this Parliament is of the view that there ought to be some qualification to the appointment of civil marriage celebrants, that there ought to be some more definite view of the role that they carry out in the community and the wider roles that they may assume for themselves, and that those persons appointed ought to be appointed only for a limited period rather than for life, as now appears to be the case. A civil marriage celebrant gains his power to marry people under section 39 the of the Marriage Act. Section 39(2) and (3) (2) The Attorney-General may, by instrument in writing, other officers of a State or Territory or other suiton able persons to solemnize marriages. (3) An authorization under the last preceding sub(a) may authorize a person to solemnize marriages at any place in Australia or only in the part or parts of Australia specified in the instrument of authorization; and (b) is subject to such conditions (if any) as are specified in the instrument. It appears that when some people receive that authorisation they enter into a new business venture. Very little public information is available about civil marriage celebrants, but some articles have been written about them. I wish to quote to from an article which appeared in the Melbourne Age of Tuesday, 11 May 1976 and in particular from one paragraph which describes the civil celebrants and their role. The article Civil celebrants are a special and rare race. They started in when the Labor Government put into effect a longlegislation fbr the practice, and have established as an alternative to church and registry defence needs of this ceremonies. the The article goes on to describe the way in which this they carry out their work and states: The celebrants are a mixed collection of people who are in it for the money. The fixed fee is $30 a time, for an of two services a week, which includes travelling eximpenses, pre-wedding consultations, and clothes. They do it because they say they like meeting people and being involved with them in the most personal moment of getting married. The article then deals briefly with the way in which civil marriages are being carried out. The only published information I have seen about the number of marriages that the civil marriage celebrants have been carrying out was supplied in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). In question upon notice No. 634 of June 1976, the honourable member asked the then Attorney General how many marriage celebrants had been appointed in each State and Territory and how many marriages they had performed. He also asked about the criteria for appointment and what informadon was available regarding the level of fees charged. It became clear that point in time some people had not carried out any marriages although some considerable time had passed since their appointment and that other celebrants were carrying out marriages with a considerable degree of enthusiasm which would certainly put to rest the comment  Celebrants Association of Victoria, that they were not in it for the money. For example, a Mr J. E. Fuller carried out 789 services between the period ofhis appointment on 2 August 1973 and the date on which the figures were compiled, 31 March 1976. There was also a gentleman",31
78,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,He may not have charged for them.,32
79,Mr RUDDOCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"He may not have charged for the services but if he had the amount involved would have approached $22,000 in a period of two years. Another gentleman by the name of Mr D. R. Messenger, who was appointed at a later date, conducted 736 civil marriages in a lesser period.",32
80,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,What is your complaint?,32
81,Mr RUDDOCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My complaint is about the people who gain statutory authorisation to conduct marriages, whose stated objective is that they are not in it for the money and who have turned this business into a corruption of our moral and spiritual values as represented through what I would regard as the legitimate forms-the churches of this country.",32
82,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The churches charge?,32
83,Mr RUDDOCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Of course they charge.,32
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr MILLAR Order! The honourable member for Dundas will address the chair.,32
85,Mr RUDDOCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The point I raise-I think that it is a very valid point-concern s the character of these people and what they are about. We now have a group of people who receive authorisation under an Act of Parliament to carry out a particular function and who are holding themselves out to perform a number of so-called services which are of a much wider nature and for which they are no doubt seeking funds, although in appropriate cases, as the honourable member has suggested in relation to marriages, they may not charge a fee. A document entitled Cultural Celebrations in Australia has been produced by Mr D. R. Messenger, who is the gentleman whom I said has carried out 736 marriages. He is a gentleman who, in my view, has set about to produce a series of pagan ceremonies to plagiarise what people regard as that at legitimate values in our community. For example, I refer to the name giving ceremony. What is a name giving ceremony if it is not meant to take up the christian ceremony of baptism, which has a special significance to those people who hold those very strong and personal beliefs?",32
86,Dr EVERINGHAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Aborigine s have name giving ceremonies.,32
87,Mr RUDDOCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Of course. What I am saying is that here we have a group of people who, by way of statutory endorsement for a particular civil function, are setting about to use the valid christian service as a basis for getting into a money making exercise for their own personal gain, not because there is any value in it. People would not place a value on a naming service of any sort if they did not believe in baptism and what it means. I know that some people have no personal beliefs in relation to death. One has to imagine what significance such people would see in a funeral service. But these same celebrants now hold themselves out as being available to carry out a non-religious funeral service. I do not know what that is. Certainly, I recognise that people who do not have any strong beliefs, and maybe some who do would recognise that perhaps there is a non-religious role in a wake. But I do not see why, other than for the purpose of making money, a group of people should use their statutory endorsement to carry out marriages to get into the business venture of promoting themselves as an alternative to the churches. I do not regard that as being satisfactory. I do not regard it as being a proper use of the authorisation they receive to carry out marriages. I believe that those sorts of people who have evidence on the public record that they are in it purely for the purpose of making money through the sort of services that they are prepared to conduct, not for any of those values that they publicly expressed in the newspapers and articles that I have referred to, ought to be looked at more closely and that some limit ought to be put on the time of their appointment so that we can review the very nature of the sort of role they are carrying out in the community and the wider functions that they are taking onto themselves through the statutory authorisation they have received.",32
88,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I shall address myself to some real political issues. I refer to the present scandalous deficiency in accommodation for the aged and handicapped people of Australia. Honourable members will be aware that the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Act of 1954, as amended in 1976, provides for the Department of Social Security to fund on a federal level, on a two to one basis, the capital costs of new nursing homes after appUcations are forwarded from religious, charitable or local government bodies. I outline some of the deficiencies and problems that arise from this program. Firstly, with regard to present day construction costs it is estimated that some $20,000 a bed is required to construct a nursing home. That means that some $2m would be required to construct a 100-bed nursing home. It means that religious, charitable and local government bodies have to raise a down payment in the nature of $650,000 for such a home. That is completely beyond the means of most of these bodies to which I have referred. The situation, however, is even worse. I refer to a submission from the Illawarra Retirement Trust-a n organisation in my electorate and in the electorate of Hughes-that provides accommodation for the aged and handicapped. Its submission to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, stated: The average cost of building a nursing home bed is $20,000. The maximum Government subsidy is $11,130leaving a balance of $9,000 to be raised locally by tary organisation. That is barely a 1 for 1 subsidy. The of furnishings has to been met entirely by the organisation. So in actual fact, because of today's costs, it is a $2 for $ 1 subsidy. It is really more like a $ $1 subsidy. The result of having to put down least a one-third down payment ensures that areas of greatest need are not necessarily the areas that receive the assistance. They are not necessarily the projects that receive, firstly, proval in principal from the Federal-State coarea, ordinating committee on the provision of nursing homes for the aged and, secondly, after approval is granted, funds from the Federal Department of Social Security. What is required as a matter of urgency is an amendment to the Aged Persons Homes Act to give the Federal-State committee the power to direct Federal funds on a full basis and according to need. Further I draw the attention of the House to the real cuts in this area that have been implemented by the present Government. In 1975 $30m was allocated to this area. In the Budget last Tuesday night I noted that only $26.lm was allocated. That is a monetary cut of 15 per cent but when one takes into consideration inflation over the last few years, it is a real cut of almost 50 per cent. Why has the Government done this? Obviously it is completely obsessed with its monetarist economic policies. It is trying to cut back expenditure in the same way as it did with every other subject which was dealt with in the Budget, including welfare. Probably another reason is an unholy fear of recurrent expenditure. The House will be aware that the Commonwealth also has a responsibility to fund recurrent expenditure up to $19.65 a day for patients in approved homes. I also add that the patient has a responsibility too because funds are taken from his pension and the Act requires that only $7 be left for each patient after the balance is made up. If there were enough accommodation provided in Australia one could support that sort of proposition. Mr Bourchier-It is more than you left them.",33
89,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,What is that? Mr Bourchier-That is more than you left them. Be honest.,33
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr MILLAR Order! The honourable member for Cunningham will address the Chair.,33
91,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do not think that what the honourable member for Bendigo said is true. The point about it is that this Government's fear of inducing recurring expenditure is inhibiting the honourable member for Bendigo and the the volun- Government from providing the needed capital cost expenditure in this area, as I have just proved. I inform the House about the sort of situation this not creates in some of the needy areas, such as in the 1 for electorate that I represent. The estimate of the at Health Commission of New South Wales is that the 50 beds ought to be available for every 1,000 people over 65 years of age. I am informed by the Deputy Director-General of Social Security apthat currently in the Wollongong-Shellharbour 328 beds are available. This is 22 beds for each 1,000 people over 65 years of age. That is not even one-half of the number the Health Commission of New South Wales said was required. True, stage 3 of the Illawarra Retirement Trust project providing an extra 80 beds at Woonona will go ahead but that will increase the number of beds available in the area to only 27 beds a thousand. I am informed that no further allocations for the present triennium have yet been made to my particular area which is a very large migrant and working class area. Currently, over 400 aged persons are being forced to go into homes outside this particular area. They are now residing in homes some 50, 200 or 300 miles away from their surviving spouses or families. Just imagine: We will all become old one day. People who cannot afford to have themselves looked after in private hospitals which this Government is so keen to establish find themselves in this very nasty situation. That is what is happening not only in my electorate but also in many areas throughout Australia. Let me give the House just one individual example: Only one week ago the relations of a 92 year-old blind woman came to me and said that she had been discharged from the Port Kembla Hospital on the advice of a doctor and had been taken home just two weeks before the relations consulted me. They asked whether I could help. My electorate secretary contacted not less than 18 nursing homes in the Illawarra, the tablelands and southern New South Wales areas. I shall quickly inform the House of the situation. At Chesalon, there were no beds and a long waiting list of two years; at Coniston, a wait of 6 months to one year; at Garrawarra-the only public home in the south west area- a considerable waiting period; at Mount Warrigal, a waiting period of five years; at Villa Maria, no possibility; at Olunda, a few months at the earliest; at Chesalon, Nowra, there was no hope; at the Nowra Rest Home, there were no beds; and so it goes on and on. That is the situation in New South Wales in this particularly vexing area. A great need exists for the provision of geriatric cilities and nursing homes in Australia. A great need also exists to stimulate the building industry which is in its biggest post World War II slump. Why should we not try",33
92,Mr BAUME,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,That is nonsense.,34
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order!,34
94,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I notice that the honourable point member for Macarthur has been quite successful in soliciting funds in this area because I undercause stand that his particular electorate has many more nursing homes per thousand people over 65 years of age than any other electorate in Australia.,34
95,Mr BAUME,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,So you admit you lied about Nowra?,34
96,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I do not know whether that is a ing it. wrap up for the honourable member for Macanhur but it certainly is not a wrap up this Government.,34
97,Mr BAUME,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,So you are admitting that were lying about Nowra?,34
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member for Macarthur will not interject.,34
99,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I am not lying about anything. I am telling you that the Deputy Director-General of Social Security,34
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member for Cunningham will address the Chair.,34
101,Mr WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Deputy Director-General of Social Security informed me that we have 22 beds per thousand in Wollongong and Shellharbour. I hope that the honourable member for Macarthur will support my efforts to rectify that situation. What we need in Wollongong, in the Cunningham electorate, is one major new geriatric hospital and one major new nursing home. That is the opinion of Dr Diment, the Regional Director of the Health Commission of New South Wales. But, of course, two factors are militating against that. Firstly, with regard to the geriatric hospitals, this Government has dropped the hospitals development program altogether which provided a $1 for $1 assistance to the States. Where does that leave us and our need for a geriatric hospital? Secondly, I again make the point with regard to nursing homes that applications are not considered by the Federal-State co-ordinating committee unless one-third of the capital cost is available either through private bodies or local council organisations. That is a disgraceful situation. As a matter of urgency, this faGovernment must intervene and introduce amendments to the aged and handicapped persons legislation to allow Federal-State coordinating committees to waive this requirement.",34
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
103,Mr COHEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a of order. I did not jump during the speech by the honourable member for Cunningham beI did not want to interrupt his time, but on two occasions during his speech the honourable member for Macarthur accused him of lying. Everybody in the House heard it and I was surprised that you did not ask the honourable member for Macarthur to withdraw. It was a most unparliamentary remark and I think the honourable member ought to apologise for mak",34
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,If the for remark was made. I can say only that over the noise of exchange the Chair did not hear the you comment. If the honourable member for Macarthur admits to making that statement. I would ask him to withdraw it.,34
105,Mr BAUME,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes , I regret that in the heat of the moment, being annoyed by the untruth, I did accuse the honourable member for Curmingham of lying. I apologise and withdraw. Mr West-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not put any untruths during that speech and I would like a total withdrawal by the honourable member for Macarthur. He is still alleging that I told an untruth. If he thinks I did, I would like him to say where it was.",34
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,There is no substance in the point of order. The offensive term was withdrawn.,35
107,Mr FALCONER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to raise a grievance about a leaflet which is circulating in some areas and which is put out by the Immigration Control Association. On its cover appears the title 'For Your Children's Sake-The Asian Invasion Must Stop'. This is an inaccurate and crude attempt to promote racial hatred and community tension. The publication is almost so puerile that it is not worth commenting on, but I must resist the temptation to ignore it because its contents are reminiscent of the softening-up which was undertaken in Nazi Germany against the Jews before the holocaust took place. I think we must lay to rest a number of the inaccurate statements-on e must think deliberately inaccurate statements-containe d in this publication and a number of others put out by the Association. I quote the following statement from the leaflet as my first example: Australian soldiers fought and died in New Guinea to keep the Asian invader from our shores, but these menThere are arrows pointing to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar)these men-thes e politicians-afrai d of offending the Nations are now breaking faith with those who died and suffered to keep Asian invaders out of Australia. They are actually encouraging the new (peaceful) Asian invasion threatening to overwhelm us. I think that is a travesty of what Australian servicemen fought and died for. They fought and died to keep Australia a free and democratic country, and part of that freedom and that democratic process is the right to decide what sort of immigration policy we should have and what sort of criteria should be administered.",35
108,Mr COHEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Most of our Asian neighbours were our allies in the last war.,35
109,Mr FALCONER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Indeed , that is quite true, as the honourable member for Robertson has pointed out. Most of our neighbouring countries in Asia were our allies during the last war. That is another inaccuracy in the statements in the leaflet. As far as the attitude of servicemen is concerned, I could take the author of this piece of paper along to Returned Services League clubs in my electorate where he would find very proud and very active members of the clubs who are themselves of Asian origin and are very well accepted in the RSL clubs. Let me move on to something else in this publication. Reference is made to an intake of Asians of up to 30,000 a year taking the jobs of our 400,000 unemployed. Firstly, I would like to comment on thefigureof30,000 a year quoted in the publication. I have tried to do a little bit of research on it to find out on what it is based. I can assume only that thefigureis based on a definition of non-Europeans in a very strict sense and that the 30,000 includes not only Asians but non-Europeans such as Turks and Lebanese. I ask: Who could be more European in many senses than the Christian Lebanese who have been coming into Australia as a result of the upheavals in their country? The very basis of thefiguringis highly suspect, to put it politely. Mr West-What about the Papuans in North Queensland or the Torres Strait?",35
110,Mr FALCONER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do not know whether the honourable member for Cunningham is supporting the Immigration Control Association. If that is his view, I would like to hear him state it. The publication states that these people are taking the jobs of our 400,000 unemployed. This is a typical tactic of using racial slurs to draw attention away from other problems or to find scapegoats for problems in Australia. It ignores, the fact that there are strict criteria for the entry of most migrants into Australia and that one of the strictest of those criteria relates to the occuUnited pational and training background which people must have before they are approved for permanent residence in this country. There are, of course, relaxed criteria relating to the intakes of refugees whom we accept from countries facing enormous internal upheavals which produce large numbers of stateless people, but those intakes are judged according to Australia's ability to absorb the people involved. I do not believe that in the aggregate they produce any major problem, certainly with respect to the total unemployment problem in Australia. My experience of those people is that they are readily integrated into the work force and become very respected and valued employees. The leaflet also makes some comparisons with other countries. I do not have the time to go through every line of this leaflet, but in one statement it is said that in South Africa there are a number of Asian people and that there are 750,000 unassimilable people who are causing immense problems. Of course they are unassimilable in that country because the laws prevent them from being assimilated in South Africa. I do not think it is reasonable therefore for the author of this leaflet to blame the people concerned for the laws of the country in which they are situated. But let me go on. The leaflet talks about the problems that have been experienced in Great Britain. Apart from the fact that I think the leaflet exaggerates the problems in Great Britain, I point out that Australia in the formulation of its immigration policies has always tried to learn from the experiences of other countries. One of the aims of our pattern of immigration is to try to ensure that we do not have developing in particular areas under-privileged enclaves people who form a problem in an area. For in example, we have had Indo-Chinese refugees coming through the Eastbridge hostel in Nunawading and the people from that hostel have spread out into the rest of the community. is an area which I previously represented, Deputy Speaker, but which you now represent following the redistribution. I am sure you will be aware of the extent to which those people accepted in the local community. One only has speak to the staff of the Mitcham high school the Nunawading South primary school to learn how well the Indo-Chinese refugees have been accepted by the staff and by the other children the schools. One only has to speak to employers to understand how much value they place on the contribution made by refugees to their work force. One only has to speak organisations, particularly those associated with St John's Catholic Church in Mitcham, which have had a great deal to do with the settlement these people to know how well they have been accepted as friends and neighbours in that area. This leaflet completely misunderstands-on e can only assume deliberately-the whole nature of the contribution these people are making to Aussubject tralian society. There is room for sensible debate about immidraw gration policies in this country. Late last the Minister released new guidelines which firmly and fairly administers. There is always room for debate about the exact nature of guidelines, and 1 know that I and other honour19.5-tha able members present continually make repDeputy resentations to the Minister about particular people in whom we have an interest and about aspects of the guidelines that we think could changed. But to try to base an attitude towards immigration on the sort of puerile propaganda contained in this type of leaflet does not do any good for the Australian community. It will only serve to exacerbate any tensions that might be latent in any situation. It will only serve to use these people as a scapegoat for problems which we have in Australia and which we must face up to as Australians. I appeal to members of the House to make sure that the tactic of the 'big lie' involved in the content of this publication is not successful and has no impact on the Australian community.",35
111,Mr BARRY JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Lalor) (12.11)Australians are the victims of a ruthless shakedown over international freight rates. Freight rates for the Australia-Europe run are set by an organisation of London-based shippers called the Outward Continent/Australia Conference. of The Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) admitted his answer to question on notice No. 1005, as set out in Hansard of 25 May 1978, that Australia has no say in the deliberations for determining inward freight rates for Australia, It either through the Australian Shippers Council Mr or the Commonwealth Government. The Conference has a vice-like grip upon freight rates into Australia. It gives a 10 per cent bounty to all are freight forwarders who deal exclusively with to Conference lines charging Conference rates. Forand warders who deal even in part with nonConference shippers are punished by being denied the benefit of the bounty. This has not led into a 'mutiny on the bounty', but it may lead to a difference between profits and losses for firms. It is very striking that only 2 per cent of imports and exports are carried currently by Australian to the local church owned ships. As we know, in our trade figures there are of things known as 'invisibles'. In the accounts they are divided into three items: Ships' stores, insurance and freight charges. Ships' stores are relatively small and I will not deal here with insurance. However, freight charges ought to be a of concern as they vitally affect trade. They should therefore attract the attention of the Government and of the House. I would like to attention to thefigureskindly provided by session the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his answer to he question No. 1007 on 25 May. The Treasurer points out that in 1976-77, the percentage of inthose visibles taken up by freight charges was t is to say one-fifth of the whole. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the Australian balance of payments statistics and part (3) of the be Treasurer's answer to question No. 1007. Leave granted. The documents read as follows(3) Freight on imports paid to non-resident carriers has represented the following proportion of total invisible debits in each of the last five years: Year 195758 1,610 195859 1,612 195960 1,844 196061 1,849 196162 2,123 196263 2,132 196364 2,737 196465 2,574 196566 2,639 196667 2,916 196768 2,931 196869 3,235 196970 3,967 197071 4,230 197172 4,740 197273 6,010 197374 6,688 197475 8,490 197576 9,408 197677 11,400",36
112,Mr BARRY JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the House. The Conference is a simple, old-fashioned cartel, practising the restriction of trade like a classic collusive oligopoly. One might ask why it is that our trade obsessed Government, so keen to lower wage rates for Australian workers in order to reduce domestic costs, sits by and watches the rip-offs imposed by the Outward Continent/Australia Conference which add significantly to the cost of all our imports. In 1973, for example, at thetimeofthe international oil crisis, the Conference added a surcharge to all imports to Australia, claiming that this was due to the uncertainty of oil supplies. This surcharge is still being levied. Why? Again the House ought to know what the Fraser Government is doing about it. Further surcharges are being imposed to provide against currency variations. The trend of these surcharges has yet to dwindle. As I said, in 1976-77 the percentage of invisibles taken up by freight charges was 19.5 per cent, or one-fifth. If the Government could take action to reduce thisfigure,even perhaps one per cent, it would have significant domestic impact. The Minister for Transport implied in answer to question No. 1005 given on 25 May that the Government acquiesed in this state affairs and admitted little involvement in the ting of freight rates into Australia. I am afraid that his answer shows ignorance of the practices 1972-73-14. 2 per cent; 1973-74-17. 6 per cent; 1974-75-19. 7 per cent; 1975-76-16. 8 per cent; and 1976-77- 19.5 per cent.

The Fraser Government, by training its guns on the Australian workers, ignores the assault on our economy by the City of London, which dominates the Conference. With the advent of container transport, importers rightly expected that there would be a reduction in freight rates. Indeed, freight forwarders offer a full container load FCL-discount . This discount should be applied to the cargo charge prior to the application of the currency and bunker, that is to say oil, surcharges. Yet many importers are given the discount after the application of the surcharges, adding to their freight costs, to their prices to Australian consumers and of course to Australia's invisibles account. I think that the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson), who is sitting at the table, will have some interest in this matter. Where the importer cannot take advantage of a full container load for his own consignby ment, the cargo is often consolidated with other cargoes that the continental forwarder has to his send. Far from this providing an advantage for the importer, it now provides an excuse for the of forwarder not to itemise the charges made so setthat the importer does not know whether the artificially inflated standard Conference charges have been calculated or even how, if they have been calculated. The Minister for Transport, in his answer to question No. 1004, showed that the Government has not even considered coming to grips with this problem. He said: (3) I am not aware of any regulations in force quire freight forwarders to detail charges in invoices to importers. This is a substantial and now significant aspect of Australia's trading relationship with the rest the world. It is becoming a more important part of our balance of payments on current account. This in turn affects the strength of the Australian dollar and the economy. With the investment lowance attracting considerable imports, I wonder how much of the supposed-bu t in some respects doubtful-benefit s of the allowance are eroded by the presently unquantified but uncourage doubtedly substantial price being paid to an questioned overseas cartel and to unregulated freight forwarders. If freight forwarders charge less than the Conference rates or if importers make use of non-Conference ships, such as Russian ships, they may be declared black and frozen out. In this respect I would like to take up some specific cases with the responsible interest. Ministers. What can be done? I believe this is a matter great importance, not only for Australian imlon ports and the price we pay for them, but for balance of the national current trading account and the protection of the national interest against gross exploitation by overseas monopolistic pracwith tices. I should point out that Australian shippers and the Australian Government are involved determining outward freight rates. All I am saying is that that same procedure which obtains for outward freight rates should apply to inward freight rates because of their importance in determining the domestic price of goods. It seems to be an extraordinary anomaly that they operate on exports but not on imports. The Government should declare that this is a case of a serious monopoly practice and it ought to up the matter immediately with the United Kingdom Government. This is a complex and tricky subject, not clearly understood sometimes even by importers themselves. It is rarely reported and basically ignored, I think, by ticians andfinancialjournalists. Because it is serious matter, because I think it does affect value of the dollar and the amount of money we are paying out, and also because it is not fully understood and not fully scrutinised, I ask the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for Transport to take it up, to vestigate it and to report back to the Parliament.",37
113,Mr THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS," I wish to speak on petrol pricing as it affects the isolated areas of Australia. In the recent Budget, the raising of the price of crude oil to 100 per cent of the import parity price was the speeding up of which rea process which was commenced in last year's Budget. Raising the price to 100 per cent of import parity has a number of advantages: First of all, it encourages exploration. Last year, after the of commencement of this system, 27 new wells were drilled in Australia. I understand that 130 permits have been applied for for next year. Secondly, the increased price for crude oil will speed alup the use of alternative energy sources. Many city industries use petroleum products when they could use alternative energy sources such as coal and gas. I hope that this present policy will enthose industries to convert to alternative unmeans of energy because we must preserve our very limited oil resources for users with no energy alternatives, such as primary producers, airlines and most of our shipping services. I believe that the policy of raising the price of crude oil to import parity is in the national I think that it was inevitable and that there was really no alternative for a responsible government, given the world energy crisis and our oU crisis. But, of course, there are disadvantof ages. The price of petrol will rise by 16c per galor 314c per litre. That affects all Australians. the But is affects most those Australians without alternative energy resources or alternative means of transport. In the cities and towns of Australia electricity, gas, railways, buses and trams there are alternative energy resources and in alternative means of transport. I want to quote very briefly the situation in my own electorate, which is probably one of the most difficult and worse served electorates in Australia for transport of all forms. There are 400,000 square kilometres in the mainland part of my electorate, excluding the many islands. There are less than 500 kilometres of usable railtake way in that vast area. There is limited sea transport. We rely almost totally on road transport and petroleum products. Therefore, I submit that those who live in the electorate of Leichhardt in far northern Australia are much polimore disadvantaged by this Government's pola icy, which I agree with, than any other people in the Australia. I would like to quote some costs and distances. In the town of Burketown the price of petrol last week was 25c per litre. It is now 29c per litre or more. Burketown is 500 kilometres from Mount Isa and 1,000 kilometres from inCairns, which is its nearest port. There are no railways, only roads.",38
114,Mr GOODLUCK,AUSTRALIAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS,"It is ruined because of discounting, isn't it? Mr THOMSONI note the point made by the honourable member for Franklin about discounting. He has made it in this House many times before and I agree with him. I wish I had time to deal with it. In the town of Coen, which is also in my electorate, petrol was 23c per litre. It is now 25c per litre. This town is 500 kilometres from Cairns and has practically no roads. Whilst our petrol is very expensive, it is cheaper than petrol in many other countries. I was informed yesterday that the price of petrol in France now is 60c per litre. In New Zealand it is 32c to 33c per litre, although the average income is about two-thirds of that in Australia. The honourable member for Franklin has often made the point about the discounted price of petrol in cities. This makes petrol more expensive for those in rural areas. I should like to think that the State governments would control the price of petrol. The Victorian Government did it with beer. Obviously it thinks that beer is more important than petrol. Perhaps it is. Because of the distance, isolation and lack of alternative energy sources, the people in isolated areas are specially disadvantaged. City transport is subsidised each year to about $500m by various State, Federal and local governments. Therefore I call on the Government to consider how it can best assist the people in isolated areas who are so very disadvantaged by this policy. Whilst it is in the national interest, it affects them very much indeed. At present dieselene which is very much used in our transport system, is free of excise for mary producers and miners. I call for the same policy to be introduced for petrol. Petrol which used exclusively on the farms and in the mines the nation should be excise free. difficulties; but this is done in Canada. Canada has what is called purple petrol, which is excise free for primary producers and miners. The dye to turn it purple is added by the fuel depots and is a fairly simple system. It means, of course, separate storage facilities are necessary in mines and on the farms of Canada. If it can be done in Canada, which has much the same probTasmania lems as exist on our continent, why can we not it here? I call on the Government to consider seriously the introduction of excise free petrol. We might not want to call it purple petrol. Pinklead blue is probably a better description for us. That is a short term solution to our energy problems in Australia as a whole and the farms and mines in the isolated areas of Australia in particular. We should be looking very much at alternative sources of energy and speeding up research on these matters. It is interesting that Brazil, which has a very serious energy crisis, has started adding ethanol, which is produced from sugar cane, to its petrol and is now approaching an addition rate of 20 per cent of ethanol to its petrol. It aims in the long term for 100 per cent of its fuel to be produced from sugar cane or cassava, which is a type of tapioca. Both sugar cane and cassava grow very well in northern Australia. Land is available for growing more sugar cane and large areas are available for growing cassava, which requires less fertile land than sugar cane. I notice that CSR Ltd presently produces ethanol from molasses, which is a sugar product, at about 28c per litre. It is not yet competitive but, of course, it is getting closer to being competitive as the price of petrol rises. If we put more research into the production of ethanol from sugar and cassava and the production of methanol from coal and the vegetable matter from which it can be produced, I believe that we eould reduce the price gap between petroleum products and other products which can replace petroleum in areas where only petroleum products, such as ethanol and methanol, can be used. Mr Braithwaite-Like the oil heaters of Canberra. Mr THOMSONWhy are the oil heaters of Canberra not run on gas or perhaps electricity produced from our immense coal reserves, instead of using our expensive and increasingly scarce oil resources? A new and large primary industry could be started in the far north to propriduce ethanol from sugar cane and cassava. That could be done right across Australia, not just in is my electorate. In the Northern Territory and perof haps in northern Western Australia the same There are thing could apply.",39
115,Mr GOODLUCK,AUSTRALIAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS,"And in Tasmania. Mr THOMSONI doubt whether it could be done in Tasmania. I know that Tasmania looms that very large in the mind of the honourable the member for Franklin but the growing of sugar cane there is not possible. There are some things cannot do. There are other sources do which we should be investigating and on which very we should be spending more money, such as liquid petroleum gas. The Government gave a last year by deciding that a proportion of the Commonwealth cars would be converted to LPG. We have vast reserves of LPG. It might be difficult to transport LPG from Bass Strait or the North West Shelf to far north Queensland, but if it were used in the rest of Australia it would release scarce petroleum resources for those areas without any alternatives. I think also that we should be doing increasing work on the production of fuel from shale oil. This work is proceeding. We have just signed an agreement with the United States and the United Kingdom on research into the production of fuel from coal. Mr Barry Jones-You should mention the Pritchard steam car, which is immensely important. Mr THOMSONThe honourable member for Lalor has made an interesting point. The Pritchard steam car would use Queensland products. I call on the Government to do all it can to reduce the imbalance which its new pricing policy for crude oil has placed on those people living in the isolated areas of Australia.",39
116,Dr BLEWETT,AUSTRALIAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS," I want to raise an issue that I think is of general interest to all members of this House, that is, the inadequacy of certain ministerial answers to questions on notice. I want to do so with specific reference to an answer given to me by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). On 10 April I asked the following question: (1) What was the time and location of each of the 40 or more violent incidents involving the use of explosives that occurred in Australia during the last IS years and which were mentioned by him in his Sir Robert Menzies lecture. (2) In these incidents how many persons (i) were killed and (ii) were injured and what was the extent of property damage. (3) In how many of these incidents have there been and convictions. (4) How many persons were convicted in relation to incidents. I did not ask this question in order to provide ployment for the bureaucracy. I asked it in general context of the Government's reaction to the tragic events that occurred at the Hilton Hotel on 13 February. I also asked it with specific reference to the remarks of the Prime Minister the Sir Robert Menzies lecture in which he rereal ferred to 40 or more violent incidents involving the use of explosives which have occurred in Australia during the last 15 years. Again, I did not ask the question for some explicit or implicit partisan reason but because I believe that this Parliament needs such hard facts in order to debate intelligently and sensibly the security options open to it and to this country. At the end of July I received a two-paragraph answer from the Prime Minister which appears on page 300 of Hansard of 15 August 1978. There is no need to read out that answer as contains very little information of value. I do mind waiting three months to get an answerself one understands the inquiries that are formation necessary-bu t I do object to waiting three months and then getting an answer without any substance. If honourable members look at what the Prime Minister said they will find that the answer contains not one explicit response to the four questions I asked. The bulk of the answer is devoted to explaining why the Prime Minister used this reference in his Menzies lecture, but this was not the question I asked. The answer contained only one new fact, a fact previously unknown to members of this Parliament, and that is that there is a confidential Commonwealth Police Force publication entitled 'Politically Motivated Violence and Vandalism in Australia 1963-1978'. Apart from that single fact, I , and I believe any other member of this House, could have written that answer on the night the question was asked. I do not believe that is good enough for this Parliament. The Parliament needs information on the nature and extent of the terrorist threat in this country and the success or otherwise of existing forces in coping with these problems. Let me give some good reasons why this Parliament needs the information requested in question No. 900. First, this Parliament will soon be faced with proposals to create an Australian Federal police force. There was a joint announcement on 28 July by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott) and the late Minister for Administrative Services (Senator arrests Withers) concerning the Government's intention to legislate in this matter. Moreover, in that statethese ment the planned creation of the Australian Federal police force was said to be in part due to 'the emconsiderable increase in the number of crimes the against the Commonwealth and the number of crimes of violence of a political nature'. For this Parliament to assess that justification and the adequacy of the proposals suggested we need the in facts requested in question No. 900. What is the extent of the problem in our society? What is the hard information? What is the record of existing police forces in coping with the problem? These are some of the reasons why we need the information sought. Another reason is that we will be required in the months ahead to assess some of the other recommendations made in the report by Sir Robert Mark. For instance, one recommendation is that State forces should take over the policing of Federal territories and airports. Again, we need the kind of information asked for to make assessit ments about that recommendation. Moreover, it not is interesting to note that Sir Robert Mark himindicated clearly that in Britain the very inI requested is made publicly available so that there can be an informed discussion in the Parliament and in the community. In a television interview Sir Robert Mark said: We had, I think, a total of 302 devices in my time as Commissioner. That was from 1973 until 1976 and we had 57 people killed and of course several hundred injured. But we arrested-in the whole country-w e arrested about 148 people and charged them with terrorism. Well so far as London is concerned, the clean up rate of all terrorist incidents is about 68 per cent to 70 per cent. Again, that kind of informadon which is available in England and which is recognised as necessary for parliamentary consideration of these issues is the same kind of information I requested in question No. 900. Further, Parliament will be required to evaluate the Hope review on protective security. There was a whole range of issues which Mr Justice Hope was required to look at in that review and to adequately assess his review this Parliament will need informadon on the extent and location of acts of political violence in this society and the success or otherwise of existing forces and, perhaps, the judicial system in coping with these acts. Therefore, I would like to request that the Prime Minister either provides a precise response to the queries raised in question No. 900-tha a set of answersMr Birney-Sen d it to the Attorney-General.",40
117,Dr BLEWETT,AUSTRALIAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS,"I raised it with the Prime this Minister simply because he had referred to the issue in his Menzies Lecture and I believed it within his responsibility. I would like him to vide either a precise response to the question raised-and I believe from his answer that the formation requested is available-o r to release the police report 'Politically Motivated Violence and Vandalism in Australia 1963-78*. I recognise that it is a confidential report and that in these delicate and difficult matters there may be elcovery ements of the report that could not be released the Parliament. I would be perfectiy happy if had an edited version which gave the facts required. 1 can see, however, that it may not possible to release the report as a whole of necessarily confidential information. I would be happy if specific answers to the four questions I raised were given or the report or sufficient parts of it were provided so as to inform this Parruption liament effectively.",41
118,Mr BURR,AUSTRALIAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS," I would like refer the House to the irresponsible action has been proposed and taken by a number of trade unions in response to the Budget brought down earlier this week by the Government. The thrust of the Budget was to reduce costs, to reduce inflation and to reduce interest rates so as to allow private industry to invest in this country, to go ahead with new projects and, as a consequence, to create new jobs. We read in this morning's Press where the Managing Director of Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd, Sir Brian Inglis, has predicted that there will be 15,000 jobs created in the motor vehicle industry as a result of this Government's decision to reduce sales tax. We have seen considerable interest stimulated overseas through the share markets and among other investors. Overseas investors are now looking to Australia as a profitable and stable country in which to invest and so promote new projects and create new jobs. This will be the basis for the recovery of our economy. There is now this prospect as a result of the responsible Budget that the Government brought down. However, what do we see in response to that responsible Budget, a Budget that is being given much credence throughout the business world. The unions say: 'We are not going to accept that Budget'. The union movement, and particularly those unions that are communist-dominated, already have started a process of rolling strikes to subvert the Government's policy, to prevent a ret is, covery being brought about by this Budget and to disrupt economic recovery in Australia. The waterside workers in the ports of Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide have gone on strike and is costing shippers $lm a day. I believe that this is only the start of what we can expect to see fell from an irresponsible trade union movement. proThe Government has made the point that if we are to see the return of a stable economy providining sound economic growth and prospects for future development, the burden must be shared by all sections of the community. We cannot have a responsible government working with the business sector to bring about an economic rewhile there is another significant section to of the community determined to subvert that rewe covery. If we are to see the economy run along lines that all Australians want, the trade union be movement will have to take to heart its role and because its responsibilities to the nation. Perhaps I should make a distinction here because I do not believe that subversion and disto industry is the response from all trade unions. If we look at the trade unions in which these actions are being brought about we note to with monotonous regularity that their that administrations are dominated by people who are associated with various factions of the Communist Party. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Port Melbourne would agree with that assessment. I am not saying that the trade union movement as a whole is irresponsible but I do claim that those unions that have communist dominated leadership are purposely setting out to subvert the economy of Australia. They do not want to see a sound economy based on private enterprise and they do not want to see the economy prosper. They are determined for political reasons to undermine the structure of our economy and so bring down the poliucal and economic structure of this country. It is a great shame for these people that the people of Australia are perceptive enough to identify what they are all about and were perceptive enough last December to see that these communist dominated left wing unions are purposely subverting Australia, as a result of which the Government parties were returned with their majority in this House. I believe that the people of Australia will be equally perceptive and will identify that the thrust of this Budget is purposefully to bring about economic recovery in this country and that those people who purposely engage in strike action, bans and limitations to subvert the Budget are doing so for purely political reasons, to undermine the structure and the basis of the economy of Australia.",41

I am quite sure that the honourable member for Port Adelaide is not out to disrupt the system-h e wants to see economic recovery and the creation of jobs in this country just as much as every member on this side of the chamber does-bu t I would be surprised if the honourable member and his colleagues do not recognise that the subversion that is coming from the trade union movement is not general and that it is engaged in by political activists within the trade union movement who are determined to subvert not only this Government but also the economic structure of Australia. I remind the honourable member that they are determined also to subvert his party. These people are political activists who, if they put their names on a ballot paper, would lose their deposits at every election. It is only the weaknesses of the structure of the Labor movement and the Australian Labor Party that have enabled these people to gain any power and influence. I would nope that the honourable member would be able to influence his party to change its structure and the structure of the Labor movement so as to exclude these irresponsible communist activists from having the influence they have been able to have on the Australian nation. We in this country are set now for an economic recovery. I believe that the majority of the people in Australia are determined to have that economic recovery and I do not believe that the people of Australia will tolerate these communist activists having the unreasonable influence they have been able to have in past years.",42

125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to fulfil its promises to acquire land rights for the Aboriginal people of Momington Island and Aurukun in the event of measures adopted by the Queensland Government proving unsatisfactory. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders havingrisenin their places",42
126,Dr EVERINGHAM,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"Fou r months ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) told the National Aboriginal Conference: These communities have turned to us. We will not fail them. He said that they wanted self-management, they were ready for it and they would get it. The appalling behaviour of the Premier of Queensland in the past week demonstrates that he is interested only in subjecting the two communities to the absolute control of his Government. He removed, by the threat of police force, a Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs official and the Aurukun Council's legal adviser from a meeting with that Council last Friday. The Government of this country must acquire compulsorily the land at Aurukun and Mornington Island as for months and repeatedly in the last week the people have asked them to do. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) promised such an outcome if the State legislation governing both communities did not measure up. Nobody can doubt that that assessment applies to the present position. That legislation does not measure up. About four months ago the Minister introduced a Bill to indicate the Government's intentions, and in his second reading speech he said: This Bill will guarantee the right of . . . communities on Aboriginal and Island reserves in Queensland to manage their own affairs . . . ensuring that, if the communities have chosen not to be administered by . . . the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, they will not have official management foisted upon them. If communides now . . . controlled by government officials consider that they are ready for self-government . . . they may apply to have the legislation cover their reserves. He said later in his second reading speech: . . . the establishment of the National Aboriginal Conference expresses the Government's commitment to involving Aboriginals in setting goals and objectives which government should pursue . . . in evaluating programs, formulating new programs . . . and help Aboriginal people . . . to take full responsibility for decision making in the management of community affairs. There is a world-wide trend to allow indigenous peoples to make decisions to take over the management of their affairs at all levels. But on that occasion deliberations and consultations proceeded, and have proceeded since, primarily with the Queensland Government and secondarily with the people on the reserves. Initially, outstandingly and overwhelmingly the concern of the Australian Government has been that we should not rock the boat, that there should not be confrontation with the Queensland Government and that, as the Minister said at Question Time this week, we must not bring in emotional issues. The Government's attitude is that we should sit down and talk rationally. For about 200 years people have been saying: 'Do not get emotional; be rational about the demands of Aboriginal people to determine their own affairs'. The net effect of that has been the continuing decimation of Aborigines and, in latter times, the cultural genocide we see progressing at an accelerating rate, if anything, under the present Administration in Queensland. In the same speech the Minister said: In Western Australia . . . the legislation provides . . . for the establishment of an Aboriginal land trust . . . Despite all the moves of the Western Australian Government to curtail the functions of such a land trust we have seen no definitive action or commitment by this Australian Government to put the interests of the Aboriginal communities ahead of those of the Western Australian Government which for some months has been preparing the erosion oftherightof Aboriginals to determine the use of their land in that State. We have seen no sign of any recognition, of, let alone any action to support, the unofficial land council which is active in northern Queensland and which speaks for the people at Aurukun and Momington Island. Later in his speech the Minister said: This Bill is designed to deal with a fundamental aspect of the Queensland legislation: Management of reserve communities by departmental officials. I believe it does this fully and effectively. It meets . . . the widespread and increasing desire of Aboriginal and Islander communities for self-management. The Bill, does none of those things; it has moved to achieve none of them. The Minister continued: The Government will watch the situation in these two reserves closely. If further action is necessary it will be taken . . . The Government would expect that good sense and a spirit of goodwill is shown by the Queensland Government . . . That expectation has been present from the beginning of time. But it is not borne out by the facts. The actions of the Australian Government do not measure up to its attitudes and policies as expressed and repeated from time to time.We warned the Government. I approached the Minister and offered to discuss the matter with him before it was debated in the House. The amendments proposed by the Opposition would have prevented this whole sorry chapter of delay, deception and deterioration of relationships between the parties concerned. But he said that there would be no point in having this discussion with members of the Opposition. The Opposition moved: That the Bill make provision for acquisition of reserves existing at 31 March 197S. That amendment was defeated in both Houses. A Queensland senator, Senator Kathy Martin, later said that in retrospect perhaps the Government should have looked at some of the Opposition's amendments. I suggest that now might be a good time to insert into the Act those five simple words: . . . existing at 31 March 1978. What we feared, what I expressed to the Minister, what the Northern Land Council told him, what the Aboriginal communities, their legal advisers and the Uniting Church in Australia told him could happen, did in fact happen. A week later on 6 April the reserves were degazetted. The Bill that had been introduced with such a flourish and fanfare to meet all the contingencies claimed by the Minister in his second reading speech was null and void; it had no effect on those communities. The Premier of Queensland laughed at the discomfiture that he created for the communities and for the Federal Government. On 17 May the Minister issued a media release about the Queensland Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Bill. He stated: The Commonwealth will be watching very closely the implementation of the new legislation and will take up Queensland Government any problems immediately they arise. That may have happened. If so, the Government has been very quiet about it. The onlytimethat have seen any evidence of the Government taking up any of these problems is when there a public outcry. It seems that the initiative always be taken by the deprived people before Porter said: the Government will make any public statement about any action it is taking to see that the Government Queensland Government carries out its obliagement, gations, particularly to bring forward a lease agreement with the Aurukun and Momington Island shires at the earliest practicable time. know that governments, bureaucrats, courts and legal people have a habit of using words such 'practicable' in such a way that the powerful people can benefit but the weak people are conState tinually pushed to the wall. How long does it to draft a lease? These people will be given only 50 years' access to their land under the terms of the lease. But how long does it take before the Governting ment will spell out with goodwill on both sidesabout which I have no doubt the Minister genuine-the terms of the lease? The legal throughout advisers of these people at Aurukun and nington Island have not sighted the lease. Those people do not have a clue what the terms of the lease will be or even where the 500 hectares that the State Government will reserve in each of pointed these shires will be situated. It which somebody wants to locate some facilities for mining bauxite. It might be located where somebody wants to take out a prospecting lease for copper, manganese or uranium. We do know what land is to be excised by the GovernGovernment ment from these territories. The people do know the terms of the lease. They are working in limbo and then are being condemned for not being able to manage. To jog the Government's memory on this matter of course we continually have to ask questions and raise this matter in public. On 14 March the interviewer on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program PM played a recording of what the Premier had said as far back as 30 June 1977. At thattimehe said: No, I don't want to take over the reserve as such . . . Those two little words 'as such' are very significant. He continued: We want the people to be free, to come and go-lik e Queenslanders. I never want any of these people to stay there if they don't want to, or control or regulate them in any shape or form. He is the same Premier who told the legal with the adviser of the councils when he met with the councils recently at Aurukun: 'Get out of here- I am the Premier of this State-o r we will arrest you.' The charge was not mentioned but if anyI one doubts that Queensland is a police State, they should see the Premier when he comes face is to face with powerless people out of the range of must the media. On the same PM program Mr Charles I will be greatly surprised, if after a few months of the assuming control and providing effective manthe peoples of Aurukun aren't extremely happy with the change that will have taken place. A few months have gone by and there is no sign I of those people being any more pleased about it. In fact they have gone to the extreme of saying: as 'We do not even want any State money here'. I believe that those people can survive without ofncials, State buildings, State money or take State help of any kind. They are demonstrating that by moving to outstations. They are moving back to the homelands where they are regaining their own dignity, becoming healthier and setup their own educational services without any pay. The children are far more interested in is that. This homeland movement is taking place  Moran intrigue by subversives. On the same PM program the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said: . . . it is a matter in which if the Queensland Government chose to act on its own it could . . . I am disapthat they didn't get in touch with me to let me know might be land on what was happening. He is still being disappointed; he will be disappointed for much longer if he thinks sweet reason will do anything for the people of Aurukun and not Momington Island while the Queensland has the whip hand. The legal not adviser to the Aborigines, who was not named for ethical reasons, referred to allegations about the takeover making access to the bauxite deposits easier. These allegations having been denied by the State Government, he said: From a legal sense no, but . . . as the managers of on. the reserve they would have people on the reserve. That is where the rub is. The Queensland expired. Government wants to be able to lean on people as it has leaned on people throughout Queensland for so long, to intimidate them and deprive them of services or to bribe and threaten them and to use police action in improper ways. Information about such matters I have documented to the Minister even this week. It has concerned other Queensland settlements. The Minister said that representatives of the at Uniting Church said: . . . that if it was satisfied that the people at wished to have the Queensland Government take administration then they would abide by the wishes people, but . . . all the indications were that people wanted the Church to remain. That position has never changed. It has always been the case. The Minister was asked whether the Commonwealth would intervene. He quisition, I said: answered: . . . I will be considering the matter very, very closely indeed and I wiil be reporting to the Government. He is still doing that. He does not report to the people of Aurukun and Momington Island; he does not report to the public; he reports to the Government and the Government then tells him what he can say. In fact I do not know whether he was even able to give an answer two days ago to the chairmen of the Aurukun and Momington Island councils when he was asked whether he would assist them to come down here to see the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I think the Minister replied that he would consider the request very closely. Because of the limits oftimeI cannot go into the whole history of this business but, as the Government pointed out in April and May, it has power under the Constitution to take over this land.

129,Mr VINER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON," 1 welcome the opportunity to answer the statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham), the shadow minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in the debate on this matter of public importance. Right the outset I would like to refer to the transcript of an interview that I gave to the Press on the Aurukun night of 11 April at the conclusion of the disover the cussions between the Commonwealth and of the Queensland Governments which led to the the agreement of that date to have the Queensland Parliament pass special local government legislation for the Aurukun and Momington Island communities. With respect to the question of acNow there will be consultation on both the legislation and the terms of the special lease and that the Commonwealth position is quite clear, that if those terms of legislation and lease are not acceptable then the Commonwealth will exercise its constitutional powers of acquisition. It will be seen immediately that the statement related to the adequacy of the legislation and the acceptability of the 50-year lease which it had been agreed would be given to each of those communities in place of the reserves which had been abolished. That passage, of course, is very loosely used by the Opposition to assert that the Commonwealth has said that it would acquire the land virtually at the drop of a hat. That is simply not correct. It is true that we have always reserved to the Commonwealth the possibility of acquisition, as I said the other night, in the nature of the ultimate sanction if the scheme of legislation to bring about self-management should so fail that it becomes necessary for the Commonwealth to act. The Commonwealth made that agreement with Queensland on 11 April in good faith and it will not repudiate it without good cause. Since that time. I and my counterpart Mr Russell Hinze, and officers of our respective departments, have put in a tremendous amount of work. We have not been going to the Press every day and reporting what has been done. However, I can tell the House that both of us have been in constant contact and our officers us quite plainly that they are have been working assiduously to set in train this legislation so that it can properly and effectively be a vehicle for self-management for these two communities. We have had our difficulties-of that there is no doubt. I will not go into a long catalogue of all the events that have taken place, of all the work that has been done and of the frustrations that have been experienced since 11 April. It may be that at another time and on another occasion I will need to do that. There were perhaps three critical areas of difficulty in getting the legislation off the ground. The first was the appointment of a shire clerk; the second was funding the shire councils which were established by virtue of the legislation; the third was establishing and putting into operoriginal ation the co-ordinating and advisory committees established by that legislation. Of course, easy for the Opposition to call for the acquisition of the land by the Commonwealth. It lives in the luxury of opposition because it does not bear responsibility of government. With that responsistresses bility on my shoulders I am not going to thrust the communities of Aurukun and Momington the Island into a state of political warfare between two governments within the federal system of Australia. Like the battlefields portrayed in 'Gone with the Wind', the injured, the maimed and the hurt, not in a physical sense but in a psychological sense, will be the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Momington Island. I consider that I have a responsibility to bend every effort that I have at my disposal personally and through my officers to see that this legisand lation does work, and does work for the of the people of those two communities. I these people- I know them well. I have had privilege of going into their communities and have enjoyed seeing some of their cultural social life. I know that these people deserve ter than either government has been able to give them up to now. I simply do not believe some the things that have been said about those people because I know them and I know the communiso-called ties. For example it is simply not true that there a reign of terror at either Aurukun or Momingwork ton Island.",45
130,Mr SCHOLES,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,There is when Joh is responsible.,46
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,Mr M ill a r ) Order! The honourable member for Corio must realise that he is not entitled to interject at certainly not from a place which has not been properly allocated to him.,46
132,Mr VINER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"Almost since the day of the agreement of 11 April I have had officers termination stationed at both Aurukun and Momington real Island. I have received regular reports from so I know what has been happening there. I have even gone to the lengths of having messages flown in, such are the difficulties of communication with Momington Island in particular but also with Aurukun because the lines of communication are public rather than private. What these people need above all is a period in which they can regain their equilibrium. Both governments at this moment have a heavy responsibility to see that those people can regain that status and the kind of composure that they have had in the past. I have had sufficient confidence in those people, for example, to appoint Mr Larry Lanley, the Chairman of the Momington and Shire Council, a member of the Council for AbDevelopment, which is a national body to advise the National Government. I know it is Donald Peinkinna, the Chairman of the Aurukun Council. I know how he has led his people with great fortitude during a time of conthe siderable pain and sickness for him. I know the under which these people are living at moment. As we are working to try to get this legislation going I wonder attimesjust what the two governments are fighting over, what we are fighting for. I know what the people want. They have the simple, human aspiration to lead their own lives and to manage their own affairs. People who live in shires, cities or municipalities know that good local government will allow a community to do just that. I must speak here also of the role of the church of people like Reverend Rollie Busch, the benefit Moderator of the UnitingChurch in know Queensland, the Reverend Davis MCCaughey, the the Moderator of the Uniting Church in I Australia and Mr Bill MCMillan, the solicitor to and both communities. I know how they have bent bettheir efforts constantly in personal discussion with Mr Hinze, with other Queensland Ministers of and with the communities to make this legislation work. I know that there have been other advisers at work such as Mr Frank is Purcell, Mr Michael Anderson who happens to out of the office of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and Mr Mick Millar who represents himself as being a representative of the people. But I make this statement unequivocally and clearly: The people who are representing and working effectively for the a i l - people of Aurukun and Momington Island are those people of the Church whom I have named. There are others whom I have not named. The Commonwealth has stood firm in its deto see that this legislation is given a chance and a real opportunity to work. It is a them good vehicle for achieving self-management. Regrettably, at every step, just when we seem to have reached the point where the administrative the difficulties have been overcome, something hapcils pens to frustrate it. I mention but one example at ment this point, namely, the notices to quit that were issued at Aurukun. Right at the problem was funding and departmental responsibUity. The Commonwealth said that fundefforts ing should be the responsibility of the Departcal ment of Local Government and the Minister Local Government because it was local government legislation within the umbrella of the genLocal eral local government legislation applying in tation Queensland. We said that that funding should be regard made direct from the Department to councils so that they could be truly autonomous, operating under their legislation, applying their without funds in the way they saw fit and employing the co-ordinating people whom they saw as necessary to do the to work in these communities. When on 7 August employing the Queensland Cabinet made critical decisions established. to the effect that local government functions in the two communities should be funded through the Department of Local Government, health functions should be funded and be the responsibUity of the Department of Health, that education likewise should be the responsibility of the Department of Education and that welfare yesterday, should be the responsibility of the Department of useful Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, it the Department appeared that at last these difficulties had been working overcome. It appeared that at last what the comunities. ordinating and advisory committee had recomto the mended to Mr Hinze had come to pass. Unfortunately, following the visit of the  both communities last Friday, we now are confronted with a situation in which the Queensland Government has decided to dissolve both councils and to appoint an administrator. Under section 16 of the legislation, I in pacity as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs must consulted before the councils can be dissolved and an administrator appointed. some discussions with Mr Hinze over last weekend, following the visit of the Premier to those places, I sent this telex on 15 August. I will read part of it into Hansard and seek leave have the balance incorporated in Hansard. The telex was sent at 11 o'clock on Tuesday, 15 August 1978 and reads: I refer to our recent telephone conversations about situation at Aurukun and Momington Island following your  As I have indicated, I believe that it is absolutely our two Governments should make a further effort that the local government arrangements are given a chance to work at both communities. I believe that action to councils and appoint an administrator would be precipitate and that it should still be possible to persuade the counthat self-management is possible under the local governarrangements if early action is taken to implement the decisions your Government took last Monday about payheart of the ments to the councils. Dissolving the councils now would undermine all our to implement the legislation, and create major politiproblems for both Governments. I believe it would further compound the difficulties of resolving the situation at for the two communities satisfactorily. Might I remind you of the provision of section 16 of the Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act requiring consulwith me before the councils can be dissolved? I do not your intimation by telephone as fulfilling the statutory requirement for consultation, but would expect a formal the shire communication in writing. The councils have asked that initial grants should be paid further delay and 1 think that if this is done and if the and advisory committee visits the communities help frame budgets and establish arrangements for staff, a sound basis for persuading the councils to rescind their decisions not to co-operate would have been I seek leave to have the balance of the telex in that corporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The telex read asfollowsThe Commonwealth Government reviewed the situation as I told you, and has suggested that it would be to involve officers of the Premier's Department and of Prime Minister and Cabinet, as well as members of the co-ordinating and advisory committees in out arrangements with the two councils and comIt would also be useful to post the acting shire clerk communities for the time being. I agree that police should be posted to the communities as soon as possible, in consultation with the councils, which asked you to arrange this. I would be glad to have your comments on these proposals.",46
133,Mr VINER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"That was my position on Tuesday morning. It is the position of the Government today. We believe that by sensible dismy cacussion around the table, involving both be Governments, the Church and the two communities, good sense can prevail and this legislation Having had can be made to work.",47
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,Mr Millar)both Order! The Minister's time has expired.,47
135,Mr BRYANT,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"The Premier of to Queensland must have been terrified when he received that telex. What has the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) said in the last 15 minutes? He has said nothing. What will he do? He will do nothing. He tells us about a catalogue the of difficulties, arrangements, visits, consultations, legislation and so on involving the Queensland Government. Every time an agreement is vital that reached, the Queensland Government changes to ensure it, puts Commonwealth ofncials off the land, dissolve bans them from the land, dissolves the councils and takes new actions. Yet the Minister and the Government still believe that they can get some sense and co-operation out of the Queensland Government and they will rely on legislation passed by the Queensland Parliament. Nobody with any sense of duty to the people of Australia in this matter would do that. Will the Minister never learn? He says that there have been more consultations and terms that are not acceptable, that the Commonwealth will not acquire the land but will make some arrangements about it. We have had so many positive statements from him when he does nothing, how can we rely upon anything when he has to make qualified undertakings? I suppose that the pure political issue is this: How long is the Country Party tail going to the Liberal Party poodle in respect of this matosition ter? There is only one thing that can be done respect of the land. It has to be acquired for Aboriginal people and vested in them in perpresent petuity. One of the great  belong?",47
136,Mr BRYANT,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,One of the more gratifying has facts of the whole situation is that the people Australia,48

138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,Mr MILLAR - has Order!,48
139,Mr BRYANT,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"One of the more gratifying facts of the whole situation Austraha are on the side of the people of Aurukun. The most gratifying features of the situation is the resolution of the people of Aurukun themselves who are standing up to both the Queensland Government and to the present inactive Commonwealth Government. I believe that there is only one action we can take-that to acquire the land in accordance with our constiis tutional authority under the Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Act and to deed it to the people in perpetuity. We are speaking this afternoon about this Government's most miserable performance in any field of governmental activity. And that is saying something. Over the last two and a half years we have discussed land rights and the forcountry. mation of Aboriginal councils. We told the Government earlier in the year cussed this matter that the Queensland Government could change the situation over night by a simple regulation which would change the status of the reserves. That is what the Queensland Government did. The matter has been discussed in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. We have had Press releases, visits, conferences and then even more of the same. I heard the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) barking from over there on my left somewhere about things about which he knows nothing. He might at least pay some heed to what has been going on. The initiatives taken on the whole question of the Queensland reserves have been going on for five and a half years. I have before me a newspaper article of 25 February 1973. At that time we had a Federal Minister who knew what he was about and who got on with the job. The headline above the article reads: 'State-Federal row looming over wag land'. The Labor Government put the propto the Government of Queensland that it in transfer the reserves to the Aboriginal people. the The Premier of Queensland did not answer. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is receiving the same treatment. But we put out feet along the road towards establishing substantial control the land for the people of Aurukun and elsewhere in Queensland. Every white community had a miserable record in this regard. It is of 215 years since the proclamation in respect of the Indian lands in Canada stated what ought to be done. It was decided that the Indians ought to have their rights in the land preserved. This was implied in the instruction to Governor Phillip. It been part of the running sore of Australian history. While governments and people might make whishtful sounds about this matter, nobody has been able to do anything effective is that the people of about it. What is the situation? In 1967, the people of Australia said to the Commonwealth: 'It is your duty to ensure that the Aboriginal people of Australia get their fair place in the sun in this continent'. That would include land rights and is all manner of things. The constitutional position quite clear. That is fortified, of course, by the Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Act. How do we go about that? If this afternoon the Minister were to issue, through the appropriate Commonwealth authority, notice to acquire that land it would become a Commonwealth land from then and the Commonwealth writ would run. That is what ought to be done. There are no difficulties about it. We do it to citizens throughout the We do it to people here and there if we want to build a freeway, an aerodrome or anywhen we disthing of that sort. Why are we afraid of the Queensland Government? If there is any government in this country that is without any credibility outside its own rigged electoral boundary system it is the Government of Queensland. The Premier of Queensland can only do himself and his party poliucal good by taking this action. Action ought to be taken by the Commonwealth. The process is clear, the constitutional position is clear, the need is imperative and it is urgent. The Minister might argue, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who was previously the honourable member for Parramatta, argued in another debate, that this would cost an enormous amount of money. Of course it would not. There is no precedent for assuming that the Government would have to pay for the assumed bauxite reserves. The Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Act has something to say about it. When we acquired the Lanyon property in the Australian Capital Territory only three or four years ago the proposition was put to us by its owner that we should pay for the future usage of the land, which was urban land development. He wanted $35m. I think we offered him something like $2m. Eventually, after a High Court judgment, between $3m and $4m was paid for it. That was a reasonable sum in view of the rise in prices and everything else at that time. There are no difficulties in taking this course of action. There is only hesitancy on the part of the Government to do what ought to be done. The Queensland Government's powers will remain, no matter what sort of legislation is passed. It has the power through its Parliament to change legislation in a moment at the Premier's whim or anyone else's whim. How can the Government introduce legislation which will overcome the Queensland mining Acts and the other Acts which empower various authorities such as the forestry and fisheries authorities to do what they wish with the land. We have had more failures than victories in this regard. The whole battle in this Parliament for land rights for the Aboriginal people has been accepted by both sides of the Parliament. It has been accepted by all the parties here. We would not have passed the Northern Territory land rights legislation if that were not so. We would not have established select and standing committees on land rights. We would not have appointed and supported the land councils in the Northern Territory if that was not what it was all about. I cannot understand-and the people of Australia to whom one speaks cannot understand-the hesitancy of the Government in this regard. I can only put it down to political cowardice- a failure to face up to the fact that the Government has a formidable political opponent in the Premier of Queensland. He must be shackled in this regard. There is no future for the Aboriginal people on those reserves unless we take this action. The Queensland Government's record is miserable. I hope that the House will take heed of what we are discussing this afternoon. Aurukun occupies an area of about 1.7 million acres. I suppose that if one examined the documents in the Parliamentary Library and the advertisements for the sale of land at Cape York and so on one would find that $1.50 or thereabouts is being paid for an acre of land there. Aurukun is worth perhaps $3m as a piece of real estate. There are, of course, many improvements on it. The Queensland Government has placed improvements upon it in the form of schools and so on but, if I remember correctly, it has done so mostly with Commonwealth money. A good deal of the improvements were made with Commonwealth money. On the other hand, Momington Island is much smaller. It is about 250 000 acres in size and is worth perhaps $400,000. If we are talking of money and if we have to buy off the Premier of Queensland, we are speaking of an amount of less than $3.5m. How long is this dispute to continue? I have visited the area, as has the Minister, my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) and other honourable members. The people there have developed a self-reliance and a resolution which fortifies my resolution in this regard. It is now over 20 years since this Parliament started to debate the issue. It is now 15 years since we took up the question of the position of the people of Yirrkala in the Northern Territory. The debate goes on and on. Occasionally, a resolution is reached which is to the advantage of the Aboriginal people but mostly from honourable members opposite, particularly from this Minister, we get the miserable pussy-footing performance that we saw this afternoon. There is no evidence that anything will be done. There is no point in sending telexes to the Premier of Queensland. There is no point in communicating further with him. When will honourable members opposite learn? Unless we act now we will be betraying the duty cast upon us by the people of Australia some 11 years ago-in 1967-and expected of us since. If it had not been for the interference of a previous Governor General we would have achieved the desired result long ago. I am quite certain that if previous Ministers of the political persuasion of those who sit on the other side of the House-the former honourable member for Mackellar or the former honourable member for Higgins, when Prime Minister-ha d been faced with this proposition they would have dealt with the Premier of Queensland with some resolution.",48
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,Mr M ill a r ) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,50
141,Mr RUDDOCK,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"I am sure that all who heard the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) speak in this debate this afternoon will acknowledge that, once again, he has spoken from the heart but not with his mind. Clearly, when one listens to the speeches that have been made in this place today by the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) and the honourable member for Wills and to the speeches that were made yesterday in another place, whose proceedings fortuitously were broadcast, as are the proceedings of this place today, one realises that the issue being pressed by the Opposition is regarded by it as being the principal issue warranting discussion as a matter of public importance. The Opposition put a great deal of emphasis upon the action that this Government ought to take and spoke at great length about the problems with which the Aboriginal people are faced and about the confusion in their minds. I think the debate can be brought down to that very narrow compass. Really only two propositions were put forward by the Opposition. Members of the Opposition said that there is confusion in the minds of Aborigines, that they are concerned about their future, that they do not know where they are going and that there are real problems besetting the Aborigines. The Opposition said that there is one answer to that, that is, the immediate acquisition by the Commonwealth of the land that the Aborigines are occupying in order that we may assert what all of us would acknowledge is in fact a responsibility that we have and perhaps a privilege that we have under the Constitution. But that would not solve the problem. The problem would not disappear; it would not go away. It would be there tomorrow if we acted in that way. The honourable member for Capricornia, by the very fact that he acknowledged my contribution to a previous debate, acknowledged the validity of the point that I made then that there are real consequences that we would have to recognise if we moved in this direction at thistimeand if we moved in a precipitant way.",50
142,Mr BRYANT,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,That will be the day.,50
143,Mr RUDDOCK,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"Admittedly, because we think with our minds. Whilst we have the same feeling in our hearts as the honourable member for Wills, we have to do what is right and what will be for the long term benefit of the Aboriginal people. The fact of the matter is that there would be consequences if we acted in that way and they ought to be acknowledged. There would be a continuing confrontation between governments. For all that honourable members opposite have said about our colleagues in the Queensland Parliament, they have pointed up with the utmost clarity that if we acted the matter would not be finished. Our Queensland colleagues would not lie down and say: 'Scratch our tummies. Everything is all right'. Thefightwould go on. It would go on in the courts of this land; it would go on in the media. What we have seen to date would not be the end; it would be only the beginning. I do not think our Aboriginal people ought to be fought over in that way. I believe that there is not a case for increasing the distrust and the dislike that some people of different racial origin have for each other. We should bring people together and get greater confidence, co-operation and wUlingness to work together. In the areas of Queensland where the Aboriginal and nonAboriginal people Uve together we cannot encourage distrust and dislike of each other. They have to Uve with each other cheek by jowel. Of course, there are other problems of cost which cannot be wiped away. The honourable member for Wills has suggested that bauxite is irrelevant; yet if he reads the speech made yesterday by his colleague in another place, Senator Gietzelt, he will realise that Senator Gietzelt sees it as a central issue. He would not be happy if we simply acquired the land at Momington Island and Aumkun at $ 1 an acre. He would be happy only if the mineral rights, whatever they are, also were acquired and taken away from the State Government. The whole concept of the valuation of land acquired by the Crown, in right of the Commonwealth, in this country is that the mineral rights are left in the hands of the States. If they did not remain in the hands of the States a whole new element of compensation would be involved, and that has not been taken into account. That would be not only in regard to this place",50
144,Mr BRYANT,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,What is the precedent for that?,50
145,Mr RUDDOCK,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,"There are no precedents for it because it has not been done. The fact of the matter is that if we acted in one place in Queensland under the Act that we have already passed every one of the other 14 Aboriginal communities would be in like a shot. We would not be acquiring two places; we would be acquiring the lot. What does that mean in money terms? It means that an enormous amount of land throughout the whole of Queensland would have to be acquired. There are other problems involving schools that presently are run by the Queensland authorities, hospitals that are run and funded through the State Health Department, and other services provided by the State. Does the Opposition say that they should go out and Commonwealth people should be put into run those sorts of facilities? Is it assumed that we can bring in government authorities from the Northern Territory to offer the same support and services as are offered in that place? What of the application of the general law which under Commonwealth statute we provide even on Commonwealth land? Even if it were handed over to the Aboriginals, this land would have become Commonwealth land. The general Queensland law would apply. How are those sorts of arrangements to be worked out? The confusion would be there, the fighting would go on and the Aboriginal people would be merely pawns. For members of the Opoperate position, quite irresponsibly in my view, to use the Aboriginals as pawns in their political argulease ments is quite unlike them in many respects. not believe that they would want to see the consequences of their action if it were taken that precipitate way. Of course, it would not the Opposition that would be taking the re have sponsibility; it would be us as the Government the day. These problems have to be overcome necessary. and we have to act in the interests of the Aboriginal people. We have to look to encouraging will on the part of all those involved. I edge that good will appears to have been lacking on the part of the Queenslanders, certainly in respect of the notices to quit that were served upon some of the people living in premises at Mornington Island and Aurukun. In my view, that did not exhibit good will and certainly did move: not encourage a co-operative attitude by the Aboriginal people towards the local government legislation. However, one has to look also at some of the other people who are there, whether they are supporters of the Government parties, supporters of the Opposition party, or legal advisers. One has to ask whether they are encouraging good will or encouraging ultimately a breakdown in relationships between two governments that have to work together in order to bring about the result that the Opposition has advocated as being an end result in itself. I suspect that some of those people have been so determined to ensure that this legislation does not work that in those situations they have been offering advice to the Aboriginal people that they ought not to co-operate. If that is the case, and I suspect that it is, then the difficulties that have developed to date are being exacerbated not by Queensland alone but by parties professing an interest in both groups of people. I believe that we need good will from the Queensland Government, we need good will from the Aboriginal people, and we need good will from all those people who advise them. Some of these selfappointed advisers from Victoria, such as Mr Purcell, have to encourage this sort of involvement if they are to uphold their responsibility and their interest in Aboriginals. That is my view. I believe that the legislation in Queensland must be given an opportunity to work, and the Minister's statement sets out the basis for that. He has made it clear that if it is to work there are still some responsibilities that the Queensland Government must accept. The question of funding has to be clarified. Permanent and full time shire clerks need to be appointed immediately to in both places. The co-ordinating committees ought to meet on the settlements and the documents need to be finalised and issued. I do If that sort of good will is offered by the Queensland Government the position of these in communities can be secured. If it is not, then I be think the end result may well be that we will to act in the way that the Minister in his of statement on 11 April indicated might be",50
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AURUKUN AND MORNINGTON,Mr M ill a r )good Order! The honourable member's time has acknowlexpired. The discussion is concluded. NA NA,51
147,Mr STREET,DETERMINATIONS," I That this House disapproves the following determinations, dated 19 June 1978, of the Remuneration Tribunal1978/6-Determinatio n of Allowances Payable to Ministers of State 1978/7-Determinatio n of Additional Salaries and Allowances of Office Holders of the Parliament. Honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced on 21 June the Government's intention of moving that determinations 1978/6 and 1978/7 of the Remuneration Tribunal be disapproved. The determinations cover special and travel allowances payable to Ministers and additional salaries and allowances payable to office holders of the Parliament. In reaching its decision, the Government felt strongly that it should set an example of restraint to the community. It had stressed to the Remuneration Tribunal that it considered that there should be no salary increases for those within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. This was consistent with an overall commitment to wage restraint which formed the basis of the Government's submission to national wage indexation hearings. Regrettably, the Tribunal did not accept the thrust of the Government's argument. I should also mention to honourable members that the Government does not intend to proceed with the implementation of the Tribunal's report 1978/1 which proposes increases in ministerial salaries. The Tribunal's recommendations in respect of judges, however, have been accepted and the Government does not intend to take action to disapprove the other findings of the Tribunal, including those relating to senators and members. In the light of the Tribunal's findings, it is the Government's view that these people should not be denied increases which reflect salary adjustments enjoyed by the great majority of Australian wage and salary earners as a result of national wage case decisions. They have already contributed substantially to restraint through the considerable lags involved in the adjustment of their salaries. I have moved for disapproval of determinations Nos 6 and 7, in accordance with the Government's decision reached after examining the Remuneration Tribunal's report, so that the disapproval may be effective from this date.",51
148,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DETERMINATIONS,"This is a motion for the disallowance of the Remuneration Tribunal's decisions Nos 6 and 7. The Opposition has no objection to the Government deciding to disallow in respect of own Ministers an increase that has been awarded by the Tribunal. In the context of the Ministers agreeing not to take the increase, that is fair enough. But when it is put in the context of being an example by which the rest of the community is expected to abide, the Opposition strongly objects to it. Other people in the community not have the income that Ministers have both from their present salary as Ministers of the behind it. Crown and from independent sources. Ministers could well have very substantial income from other sources. It is wrong in principle to suggest to the rest of the Australian community that cause the higher echelons of government, irrelevant. namely the Ministers, are prepared to forgo their increases the rest of the community should make a sacrifice. It is wrong in principle for reasons that I will mention. We are in the throes of discussing a horror Budget in terms of tax increases. People on low wages will be paying very substantial tax inDeputy creases indeed. In fact such increases could be high as 8 per cent for millions of Australian income earners. The Government is trying to suggest that because its select group of Ministers are going to forgo some token increase, the rest of the Australian community should follow suit. In the Budget Speech there is some very strong condemnation of what the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been doing in the past in allowing workers to get a quarterly wage adjustment. In every case, the advocates for the Australian Council of Trade Unions have had to produce evidence to show the Bench that there wereMr Street- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. What I have done is move for the disapproval of determinations 6 and 7 of the Remuneration Tribunal's report. I suggest that the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are not directed to those determinations.",52
149,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DETERMINATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to speak to the point of order. I am surprised to learn that the Minister is so sensitive. However, it was indicated in the Press at the time by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that Ministers would set an example by not taking their increase. Today is the first time the Government has taken overt action to indicate that its Ministers will not take the increase and that the Government will disallow the determination. Government will have to give reasons for its disallowing the determination. I suggest that the reason is as given by the Prime Minister and as published in the Press-so that the rest of the its Australian community will follow this example and not seek wage increases. This was said at the time, lt is also quite pertinent to the point that we as an Opposition should try to indicate to the Australian public the Government's motivation for bringing this motion to disallow a portion of a report before the House today. The Government do is putting forward a valid motion, but we are entitled to suggest criticism as to the motivation Mr Street- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not suggesting that. I am suggesting that the remarks of be the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are",52
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DETERMINATIONS,"I take the Minister's point, but I cannot satisfy myself that the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are not pertinent to the motion.",52
151,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DETERMINATIONS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The position is of interest to the as whole community. I put the matter in the context that the Government has a reason for disallowing the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal, and that reason is the setting of an example. The Government is not interested in just its own select group of Ministers forgoing a few miserable dollars; it is trying to provide an example to the rest of Australia. That is confirmed in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) wherein he impUes criticism of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for granting wage increases to wage earners in the past. I am making the point that the Government is trying to shelter behind this token gesture as a means of setting an example. I also make the point that it is not doing so. Looking at the income that Government members and Ministers get-and they could well have other substantial income-the y could well be doing a lot better than the rest of the people in Australia who are now going to have to pay increased taxes. I am criticising the Government's action. I do not object to the Government disallowing a determination which provides increases in the allowances of its own Ministers, but I make the point that the motivation behind it is not valid. To set an example is not a valid reason for disallowing the determination. I have made the point that it has been put before the Australian people in the Press by the Prime Minister that Government Ministers will set this example. There is no need to set such an example for the present large number of taxpayers in the community who will suffer hardship from the increased taxes. I quote what I said-and that is not always a good idea-as far back as 22 June when I commented on what the Prime Minister had announced: Mr Fraser would use a decision to give up ministerial ary allowances tojustify a horror Budget. I think I was reasonably accurate in what I said on 22 June last. That was the position at the time because members of the Press and the media generally wanted to know the Opposition's tude to the fact that the Prime Minister, apparcategory ently without consulting anybody, had indicated to the Press that the Ministers would not be taking the increase. That was one of the determiditional nations and one on which we made our position clear. But let us come back to what it is all about. us look at what has happened to decisions made by the Remuneration Tribunal in the past. There have been previous disallowances. They were made on the spurious grounds that such disalbunal's lowances would set an example. In fact a case such a disallowance was made in the Senate distinguished senator who, at the sametime,was never asked to disclose his other sources of income-and they were deemed to be substantial. Nevertheless, he argued for the disallowance on the basis that he was setting an example to the Australian people. He wrote to the Remuneration Tribunal at the time and said that every Australian entering pubUc Ufe should set such an example. But nobody ever bothered to cross-examine him on his other sources of income-and , as 1 said, they were very substantial. In fact it was suggested that they were earned while he was a member of parliament and drawing a salary. The point is that the Government should not be following the bad precedent of trying to set an example in this case. If the Remuneration Tribunal or any tribunal dealing with wage determinations takes evidence and then gives a ruling, the Government should accept that ruling. The Government gave evidence that it did not seek an increase but it lost the case. So why does it object so much to the Tribunal's determination? Why do we see this token measure being applied to indicate that the Government expects the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to use the same sort of approach in dealing with wage increase hearings? The Government is completely out of kilter. For that reason we object to the tokenism of the Government's approach. We have no objection to the fact that Ministers wish to forgo the increase. Again, it would be far more open, if Ministers were to reveal whatever other sources of income they might have. There is another factor involved. Determination No. 7, the disallowance of which relates to officers and office holders, applies to a number of sal- people including members of the Opposition. We have no objection to the determination relating to our increases being disallowed; let us put that on the record. We never sought increases so we can hardly object if the determination relating to them is disallowed. But we want to make it clear attithat a number of people who are in a lower of remuneration will really suffer if a determination providing for relatively small amounts is disallowed. They do worthwhile adwork in this Parliament for which they ought to get additional remuneration. To disallow that determination because Ministers decide Let that they want to forgo their increase, I think, is an unnecessary hardship on those people. Again, it belittles the Remuneration Tribunal because the Government is taking segments of the Tridetermination and saying that the Trifor bunal was obviously wrong in itsfindings.Let by a me make it clear: Anybody in Australia can make representations to this Tribunal. The Press, the editors and the newspaper proprietors can all go in and give evidence as to what they think members of parliament ought to receive by way of remuneration. It is a public hearing. We do not want to have re-trials of it in this chamber. It ought to be made clear that once the Remuneration Tribunal makes its decision that decision is basically binding. Let us have none of this grandstanding-peopl e trying to attain notoriety on the basis that the Tribunal did not know what it was about and that even when it makes its finding, the Government will disallow it. We object to that completely. The other point that has to be made is quite pertinent to the Opposition. At present our entitlement to Opposition staff, that is, leaders' staff, is 34. When the present Government was opposition, the Labor Government allowed it an entitlement of 38 staff. Our staff numbers have been reduced by four. We were disappointed to receive correspondence from the Prime Minister saying that he does not want to give us the ditional staff that the Remuneration Tribunal has now allowed us. I draw the attention honourable members to clause 27 on page 19 of means. the review of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal states, in relation to additional staff: We are in no doubt, however, that an additional member of staff should be made available to shadow ministers, so determine. We further determine that this staff be employed under the terms and conditions which electorate assistants. The number of shadow Ministers whom this entitlement shall apply shall not exceed the number of Ministers of State from time to time. There are 27 Ministers of State and there are only 20 shadow Ministers so, in fact, we be entitled to have 27 shadow Ministers and, accordance with this determination, an adby ditional staff member. We have never used our full entitlement in that regard. This determithe nation, which I submit cannot be disallowed, now is being interpreted by the Prime Minister as allowing us another 10 staff members. If that the position, it is contrary to this determination. The correspondence we have received from the Prime Minister is to the effect that he does not gard this as a determination; he regards it merely as a recommendation. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the tribunal itself said: We . . . so determine. Under the legislation, that is, the Remuneration Tribunal Act, when a matter is determined it stands unless disallowed. I note that there is question of disallowing it by way of a motion here. Arrangements existed as to what should be available to the leaders of the Opposition. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the present Government was in OppoOrder! sition, 38 was the entitlement for the leaders of expired. the Opposition. I have a statistical table which I can show my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) which shows that we have 34 so we do not exceed that figure. We have now received advice that there will be only an additional 10 staff allowed by the Prime Minister pursuant to this determination. Shadow Ministers are placed in the position of forgoing their entitlement. If they take their entitlement, the leaders of the Opposition will be obliged to reduce their staff by 10. That is wrong in principle from every aspect of the matter. Leadership of the Opposition requires a fair amount of skill and a lot of work to try to match the resources of the Government. At the present time we note that the staff of Government Minisin ters outnumbers the staff of the leaders of the Opposition by six to one. If honourable members look at the personal staff of Ministers and the entitlement of the leaders of the Opposition, they will find that we are outnumbered by six to one. adTo have that number reduced, by implication, by a further 10 is outrageous and unfair. That is of what the Prime Minister's correspondence I welcome the fact that the determination is aland lowed to stand but I strongly urge the Minister to member go back to the Prime Minister and say: 'Have apply to another look at the correspondence you are to writing to the Leader of the Opposition and make it clear to him that if you say that this is not a determination and that you are only going to allow 10 instead of 20 you are, in fact, going to would deny the Opposition leadership its full in entitlement and in fact reduce the number of 34 10'. He should remind the Prime Minister that we never had the numbers that were allowed to Opposition when we were in government. I make those points because it is very important, when discussing matters relating to the facilities is of this House and the Opposition itself, that points be put in the proper context. An Opposition is entitled to function within the demorecratic process. It should have as much expertise as possible, within the limitations of finance and as deemed reasonable by the Government. It is completely unreasonable now, when the Tribunal determination has made a finding in respect of submissions made to it, for the Prime Minister to intervene and say two things that are no completely wrong-firstly , that the recommendation is not a determination but only a recstaff ommendation. It is a determination",52

The paragraphs to which I refer are 8.3 and 8.4.I am quite prepared to be found out of order but I am referring to a comparison between the determinations we are seeking to terminate and their effect on determination 1978/9. Determination 1978/9 of the Tribunal made three main changes. The first was in the area of the number of pre-paid envelopes that may be obtained and posted, under the old determination, at Parliament House and that now can be posted in the electorate. This is to save cartage by members who may well compile documents back in their electoral offices. Now and then they had to cart rather massive documents in suitcases to Canberra for postage.",55

The motion relates determinations 1978/6 and 1978/7. As the increasing honourable member will appreciate, the motion does not require debate by the House if it is cepted. In this instance determinations 1978/6 and 1978/7 are before the House and therefore the honourable member may not proceed to disis cuss matters beyond those two determinations.",55

As such, I should have thought that that did fall within the field of debate on the motion minate determinations 1978/6 and 1978/7.",55

160,Mr BRYANT,DETERMINATIONS,"In supporting the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), who is the representative of an electorate, as we all are, I want to draw attention to the fact that what he is doing, perhaps inadvertently, is reducing the differentials between members of this Parliament. By reducing the amount of money paid to Ministers he is keeping salaries and other matters closer one another, which I think is as it ought to be. One of the weaknesses of the report of the Reto muneration Tribunal is the fact that there are differentials between members of Parliament. Ministers are at the top of the list of acpeople with resources at their disposal. They have much bigger salaries than everyone else and much greater resources to do their jobs. That necessary. If one goes far enough down the list, say to the seat of Wills, onefindsthat at the bottom of the list are the people who represent some the most populous electorates. I ask the I House, when next it faces the Remuneration Tribunal, to consider this question of the differentials that are developing between us. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) out this differential in regard to staff. I do not think that we can divorce just one determination from all the rest of them in this document. to terThe honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) referred to just one also. Most honourable members would agree with me that, in respect of the duties imposed upon us, the member for Wills has the same responsibilities, duties and rights to carry into legislation the beaspirations of his constituents as the Right have honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the honourable member for CoranIf gamite (Mr Street). I have 124 000 people in my I could electorate and the honourable member for has 99 000. He gets an extra electoral allowance because of the size of his electorate and gets other facilities as well. I am not now talking about those he gets as a Minister. Under this determination extra staff is to be given to members on this side of the House but only to some members. We should support the granting of extra staff to members. Ministers should be adequately staffed but, just as they have to compete with great resources and forces in the community, so do the rest of us. Mr Deputy Speaker, accepting your ruling this is not to be a general debate, though I wish were, I hope that honourable members will has apply themselves to what might be called the new feudalism, starting at the top with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and going down to the serfs at the bottom, the people like honourable member for Wills who happens to represent people and not tussocks, sandhills or iguanas. I make that comment to you in your pacity as the honourable member for Wide Bay. This is a most depressing feature of this docuthe ment, good as it is in some other ways. I cannot understand how a body of people led by a disviding tinguished and eminent judicial figure such the man who chairs the Tribunal, and does so very well, a man who has applied himself well the problem, could make the decision it did about postage.",55
161,Mr STREET,DETERMINATIONS,"Corangamite-Minister for electric Employment and Industrial Relations) agriculture, (3.18)-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) raised a point which needs to be answered. He referred to a letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) indicating that the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to the staff of the Opposition have not been fully agreed to. It has been longvolve established practice, accepted and adhered to the previous Labor Government as it is by this Government, that staffing for is the responsibility of the government of the day and is not a proper matter for determination by the Tribunal whose comments on the matter, therefore, the Government regards as being of a recommendatory nature.

Question resolved in the affirmative. ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL 1978 Asian  time. Second Reading  Foreign Affairs) (3.19)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of an amount up to $A96.82m towards the second replenishment of that the resources of the Asian Development Fund. it Honourable members will know that Australia been and continues to be a strong and active supporter of the Asian Development Bank which is highly regarded as an efficient and effective mechanism for channelling aid to developing the countries in our own geographic region. The prime role of the Bank, which was established in 1966, is to assist in the economic development of caits developing member countries and to foster economic and social growth and co-operation in Asian and Pacific regions. It does this by lending funds, promoting investment and protechnical assistance on a scale that develas oped countries could not achieve bilaterally. Since its establishment the Bank has lent about to $US4 billion for projects covering all the major sectors of economic development with emphasis on the development of infrastructure facilities in the transport and communications, industry and power sectors as well as projects for education, water supply and urban development. The Bank's lending activities are divided into ordinary and special operations. Ordinary operations are financed on the basis of the Bank's capital resources and its borrowings on the international capital market at commercial or near commercial terms. Special operations inloans made on highly concessional terms to by the Bank's poorest and least developed member countries and are funded from the Asian DevelOpposition parties opment Fund. The Asian Development Fund was established in 1974 to provide for the systematic mobilisation of resources for concessional lending to Bank's poorest and least developed counover tries. In this respect the Asian Development put Fund can be likened to the World Bank Group's soft lending affiliate, the International DevelopAssociation, although the obvious distinction is that the latter extends development assistance on a global basis while the activities of the Asian Development Fund are concentrated in the Asian and Pacific regions. Australia played a leading and positive role in the establishment and subsequent growth of the Development Fund. Australia contributed the equivalent of $A18m, or about 5 per cent, towards the mobilisation of the initial resources of the Fund totalling some $US500m. Under the first replenishment of the Fund's resources Australia maintained the level of its percentage share by contributing $A30.7m of the total replenishment amount of $US809m for concessional lending operations during the three calendar year period 1976-78. It is expected that funds available to the Bank under the first replenishment of the Asian Development Fund will be fully committed by the end of 1978. During the past 12 months a series of meetings were held by donor member countries of the Bank to consider a proposal by Bank management for a second replenishment target of $US2.15 billion for the four year period 1979-82. The Bank's case, for such a substantial increase which was supported by a number of donors including Australia, was based primarily on the following grounds: Firstly, if the Bank were to provide meaningful assistance to its poorer and less developed member countries, a substantially larger concessional lending program would be required in the next few years than in the past; secondly, a significant expansion was justified by the particular responsibility which, as a regional bank, the Bank owed to its developing member countries; thirdly, the need for the Bank to increase the size of its concessional lending program Member Australia . . . . .

At a final meeting of donor member countries in Vienna during April 1978, these principles were generally accepted and agreement was reached on a basic target of SUS2.0 billion against which Australia's 5.14 per cent basic share will be $A90.1m. In addition, a number of donor countries have pledged supplementary contributions and Australia has undertaken to contribute 5.14 per cent of these contributions up to a maximum total contribution of 5.14 per cent of SUS2.15 billion, i.e., $A96.82m. Specific amounts to be contributed by the various donor member countries are set out in the attachment which specifies the basic contributions and supplementary contributions in Tables I and II, respectively. I ask leave of the House to have the attachment incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted.

However, in accordance with our pledge, any further additional supplementary contributions to the second replenishment that may be made by other donors will increase the amount of Australia's supplementary contribution. For this reason, the Bill provides for payment by Australia of an amount up to the maximum of $A96,819,695. This amount will not be subject to future adjustments in exchange rates. In accordance with past practice with respect to similar contributions to the Fund and the International Development Association, it is intended to exercise the option to lodge non-negotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes encashable on demand as and when funds are actually required for loan disbursements. This will limit the impact on the Budget in the next year or so, as encashment of these notes will not begin before 1979-80. The Bank has a most important role to play continuing to foster economic and social develdebate. opment in the region of immediate interest to Australia. It is Government policy to give high priority to the Asian and Pacific region in its foreign policies and to co-operate fully with multilateral agencies in the region, such as the followed. Asian Development Bank. Continued Australian support for the Asian Development Fund is therefore clearly in Australia's national interest. This Bill provides an opportunity for honourable members once again to demonstrate their bithe partisan support for the Asian Development Bank and its Asian Development Fund as an debate effective and efficient development finance instiattention tution and our willingness to provide the poorest developing countries in our region with highly concessional assistance through this organisation. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

162,Mr FIFE,TABLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would Uke to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject in matter of both Bills to be discussed in this",58
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TABLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both Bills? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be",58
164,Mr HURFORD,TABLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS,"The House is discussing not only the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1978 but also Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1978.1 give notice to those who are paying attention to the on these Bills that they do not rivet the to any great extent and are not likely to bring down the Government, particularly as the Opposition does not oppose either of them. I shall deal first with the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill. It is so long since it was introduced into this House-indeed , it was before the recess-that its purpose is worth repeating; that is, to give effect to the Government's decision to continue to give assistance by way of a bounty to producers of books in Australia for a further period of 12 months. That period of 12 months is the calendar year 1979. It is right and proper that the Government should give advance notice of its being prepared to continue to pay this bounty for the calendar year 1979 because many of the orders which would come under the provisions of this Bill and which are placed by publishers and others who get printing done are being placed now, although the printing may not be carried out until the next calendar year. So it is important that advance notice be given so that the necessary planning can take place. The Opposition welcomes the introduction of this measure. We know that it is an interim measure while the Government gives consideration to an Industries Assistance Commission report on the longer term future of the printing industry as it relates to books and the material which attract a bounty under the provisions of the Bill now before us. I understand that that report from the Industries Assistance Commission was delivered to the Government on 1 August and that the Government is now considering its position in relation to the report. It would be helpful to me and to others who take an interest in Australian industry, in particular the printing industry, if the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) would be good enough when he is replying in this debate to give the House an indication of when the Government might make a decision on that IAC report. I look upon it as a privilege to represent the Opposition on various industry advisory councils. One of those councils is the Printing Industry Advisory Council. I am sure it would be of enormous help if at its meeting on 31 August of this year that Council could have some indication of what the Industries Assistance Commission has recommended to the Government and what the Government's attitude might be. Alternatively, if we learned only what the IAC's recommendations are the Printing Industry Advisory Council may give the Government some helpful advice in relation to what its attitude to the IAC report should be. The Bill that should take up more of our time in this debate is the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1978 because it is not just an interim measure. It provides for some time to come for bounty on the manufacture of larger tractors. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect the Government's decision to provide assistance for the manufacturing in Australia of agricultural tractors with an engine output exceeding 105 kilowatts. The Government has accepted the advice on this matter that is contained in the Industries Assistance Commission's report of 18 August 1977. This follows the Government's earlier decision to pay a bounty on tractors with an engine output of up to 105 kilowatts. The decision is to afford assistance by providing for the payment of a bounty which takes into account both the degree of local content-the minimum amount of local content allowed in a tractor for it to attract this bounty being 55 per cent-and the degree of tractor power. That is why we see the reference to 105 kilowatts. Provision is made for the amount of the bounty to be adjusted quarterly and to reflect import price movements as measured by the Reserve Bank. It is just as well that the Reserve Bank makes available these measurements. I take the opportunity of saying how valuable it is for decision-makers to have such statistics. There are many other statistics which we are not now receiving because of the Government's staff ceilings and its general attitude to Government spending and which we should be receiving from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to help decision-making in this and related economic areas. When people in our community mindlessly join tax revolts they ought to remember that one of the results of such revolts is that this country is more badly governed because we do not have satisfactory statistics on which to base proper decisions. I come back to the bounty on tractors. The maximum amount payable in terms of March 1976 import prices is mentioned in the Bill. It is $3,480 for every tractor with 100 per cent local content and a take-off of 150 kilowatts. No indication is given of the extent to which tractor prices will fall as a result of the bounty scheme, but of course we must accept that the IAC has done its homework and that this is the amount that is necessary to enable tractors made in Australia to be competitive with imported tractors. The IAC report stated: Information on the value of tractor sales is not available. The industry producing these large tractors at present comprises three small firms building a limited number of tractors. One firm is in Western Australia, another is in New South Wales and the third is in Victoria. A couple of months ago when I looked at this subject. I could say with confidence that each of these producers manufactured tractors with a local content of less to than 55 per cent and therefore would not be eligible for the bounty; but I understand that one of these small companies, the company in Victoria, now may be manufacturing tractors with more ance than 55 per cent local content and therefore production. under the provisions of this Bill may be eligible to receive the bounty. The IAC reported: . . . none of these interests, however, sought assistance and none was represented at the inquiry. However, I believe that the manufacturer in toria now will be glad that it is receiving a benefit in spite of the fact that it did not put in a mission. When I first looked at this question could say with confidence that requests for ance were received from only two potentialthey were large-manufacturer s of smaller tracwatts, tors, Chamberlain John Deere Pty Ltd and International Harvester Australia Ltd. The Chamberlain company informed the IAC that was then engaged in feasibility studies but it unable to provide the Commission with any deentry tails. International Harvester informed the with respect to large tractors: No consideration has been given, oris likely the next three years at least, to local production . . . Nevertheless more recent information shows that both of those companies may soon, if they have not already, enter into the production of tractors which would attract the bounty which is the subject of the Bill before the House this afternoon. The market for these large tractors has grown rapidly in recent years. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a representative of a country electorate, would know that. With the economies of scale that have been brought about of necessity, resulting in the amalgamation of properties into larger units, larger tractors are now being used, whereas in earlier years the smaller tractor was more prevalent. In 1975-76. sales of the larger tractor totalled 1,374 units. The trend towards larger tractors projected to continue, with a doubling of the number sold in 1975-76, that is, 1,374 units, 1983-84 which is the last year for which projecand tions have been made. Virtually all such tractors were imported, with the Chamberlain and Intercent national Harvester companies accounting for more than 50 per cent of imports. The IAC did not recommend assistance for manufacturers of per larger tractors at the previous inquiry into tracspelt tors because at that time it had no knowledge local production of larger tractors. In its report the IAC stated: The decision not to recommend assistance . . . considered unlikely to have adverse equity or resource cation effects. The IAC admitted: Established manufacturers . . . did not seek assist. . . potential manufacturers were unable to promote any detailed information concerning possible future Yet the Commission argued that developments in the tractor market and industry made it desirable to resolve the question of assistance for larger tractors so as to avoid undesirable longer Victerm consequences, such as distortions of commercial judgment concerning future production subpatterns of tractors above or below 105 kiloI watts. We all will understand that when people assistare making decisions about tractor manufactures, even in the smaller range below 105 kiloit is important that they should know all the facts about what they would receive by way of bounty if tractors above 105 kilowatts were it manufactured. These developments include the was trend towards larger tractors and the potential into local production of the principal imIAC, porters. These are all factors which must be taken into consideration in the longer term planning in this area of manufacturing tractors. to be given, in Again the IAC report stated: The Commission considers that assistance to tractor production should be uniform across the actual and potential range of production. Assistance to smaller' tractor manufacturers is currently being phased down over a period to 1 January 1982, to a lower long term rate of assistance estimated to be equivalent to an effective rate of assistance of about 25 per cent. What we are saying is that if the assistance being given for the manufacture of smaller tractors by way of bounty were analysed, one would find that the tariff equivalent would be about 25 per cent. I am sure the Minister would agree that as we look at Australian industry we tend to divide it into areas related to tariff or tariff equivalent. The area receiving 25 per cent tariff and below is is a relatively low tariff rate area and one to which we should encourage resources to be applied if by we are to maximise the use of those resources therefore to increase our standard of living. I would say that the area receiving between 25 per and 50 per cent tariff is medium ground. I think the Government looks upon the medium ground as being the area receiving between 25 cent and 35 per cent tariff, although it has not that out. In that area we should mark time of and keep what we have without perhaps putting a lot of resources into increasing production and increasing the application of resources. In my case, the area receiving above 50 per cent tariff, was or, in the Government's case, the area attracting alloabove 35 per cent tariff is one which we have to treat with great sensitivity, particularly where there is a high labour content, but one in which we would not altogether encourage new activity and new resources to be applied because that would not be the best use of those resources in order to maximise the standard of living. I mention that because it seems that if there an effective tariff rate of about 25 per cent on tractors that comes into that lower range and is something which we should encourage. Our inproduction tuitive judgment would tell us that, as a country which, in large part, is based on rural production has a lot of ability to apply research and developchain. ment in a mechanical area such as this and has such a large market for rural north, and as a tractor is heavy to transport and therefore would have a natural protection, perhaps the manufacture of tractors is an area into which we should be applying resources and seeing that employment is created. In summary, the bounty scheme recommended is merely an extension to tractors of up across. to 150 kilowatts of the bounty which has been operating for tractors below 105 kilowatts and which we know from an earlier report and an earlier Bill which is now an Act will continue to be applied until 1 January 1982. These are the facts. I have given some attitudes of the Oppopeople, sition on those facts inasmuch as I have stated that we are not in any way opposing the Bill inasmuch as I have stated that with an effective tariff rate of 25 per cent this should be encouraged. I would like to make a few more comments on this sort of legislation. We of the Opposition welusing come the increased use of bounties by the Government as a means of protecting industry. However, it would seem that the Government considering the life of bounties in only a relabounty tively narrow range of specific circumstances, cirto cumstances which are evident in this case of tracis tors. We want bounties, of course, because help to keep the cost of the particular product the consumer lower. This is particularly important where they are the initial product in a long line of processes which end up with the consumer. Let me just identify the factors which apply this case. First, the local industry is capable of supplying only a small share of the market at present time. So there is scope for a greater use local industry to supply a larger share of the existing market. Secondly, it is an industry could become export oriented. I mentioned little earlier that this product could be exported in particular to our Asian neighbours to the of us. A third factor which is evident about tractors and which is worth mentioning in the general context is that the producer provides a very early but substantial input in the production and distribution chain in this area. Tractors are used is for many purposes. They are used at an early stage of the production and distribution chain. If we can keep the costs low at the beginning of the and distribution chain the product is much less likely to end up with all the mark-ups that are added further along the production It is more likely that there will be a greater beneficial effect if one can apply the bounty at production to the thefirststage.",58
165,Mr GILES,TABLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS,Ver y succinct.,61
166,Mr HURFORD,TABLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS,"In other words, the costs of the end product are kept a lot lower. I am very glad that the honourable member of Wakefield approves of the way in which I am putting this The Opposition hopes that there will be a much greater potential for bounties than seems to apply at present. However, we will not get this while we have an attitude to government spending which relates to unpopular things such as inefficiency and so on. I think it behoves all of us on both sides of the House to point out to the particularly when there is a campaign such as the present one, that things such as and bounties which reduce the cost of a product to the consumer also come under the heading of is an area which government spending. The Opposition believes that the Government needs to look more closely at the possibilities of bounties rather than tariffs. Of course, this tendency would have a twofold impact upon the Government's budgetary management. There is would be a cost to revenue of paying out the and there would also, of course, be a loss revenue by not receiving the tariff. But really it necessary for us all to give consideration to they schemes to finance bounty payments because to they are so much better than applying the tariff. Perhaps consideration might be given to profit limitations on bounty payments to provide a safeguard against unreasonably high profits being earned by producers in receipt of assist in ance. We want manufacturers to be helped in this way if it creates rewarding jobs but not if the the bounty is going only towards providing larger of excess profits. I am not making the charge that there is any evidence that excess profits are being which made in this way but probably we would find a that there are cases in which the payment of bounties is leading to excess profits. Therefore I north believe the Government's object should be to establish machinery to see that this does not happen. Whilst not opposing this Bill there are some considerations which require more thought before we rush into across-the-board bounty payments too enthusiastically. I hope that I have canvassed some of the issues. I would like to make a couple of other points. The recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission was based upon the view that the level of assistance should be neutral across all sections of the agricultural tractor industry. Thus a bounty is recommended even before any significant production of larger tractors has been attempted in Australia. This assumes that the long run level of assistance to smaller tractors-that is the 25 per cent effective rate of assistance-is the optimum one relative to other activities, both in the manufacturing sector and beyond. It is extremely difficult to accept that this is necessarily the given the present 'Indian file' series of end-on tariff reviews. Certainty on this issue would be likely only if variations in rates of assistance reverted to large scale integrated reviews. I have said before-the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs is probablytiredof hearing it from me-that I hope that the Government will be able soon to give the IAC more resources for bench mark longer term work which I believe is not being done with the necessary speed if it is being done at all at present. It is unsatisfactory have reports for small sectors coming through 'Indian file', one after another, when what we really want to do is to look at the larger sector because so often one particular small sector of industry relates to another sector. It is intriguing that we are providing a bounty for the manufacture of products which are not at the moment being manufactured in this country, and I do not oppose this in any way. I have suggested that maybe in this country we should specialise in the manufacture of tractors. However, I repeat the Opposition's attitude that there is no medium and long term economic planning in this country to which we can make any reference. We have only short term ad hoc planning going from one year to another. We believe that we ought to emulate what is being done in most other countries and build up the mechanisms to enable us to engage in medium and long term planning-the setting of targets. We could do this through an economic council made up of representatives from business, the trade unions and the national and State governments. In this way we could start to determine on what areas we should be concentrating. Intuitively we feel tractors manufacture may be one of these areas. However, we do not really know because we have not had such medium and long term planning carried out in this country. Such a concept is not revolutionary. Japan, for instance, which hardly could be called a socialist society, has had its economic planning agency for years. The French, who do not have what could be called a socialist government, have a planning mechanism. We should have such a mechanism in Australia. We should have a mechanism under which medium and long term planning is worked out on a consensus basis with input from the private sector as well as the public sector and from the State governments as well as the national government. Until we have that sort of planning we cannot say with certainty that the manufacture of tractors is one of the areas in which we should put our resources. We have to work on intuition; we have to work by the seat of our pants. In the meantime the Opposition comes to the case conclusion that perhaps the manufacture of tractors is one of these areas. Certainly we have to go along with supporting a bounty measure like this which will give some employment, and give it in a way that will not add to costs. There is, of course, the possibility that the tractor industry will grow into a large industry in this country. I hope so. I would have liked this decision to have been made in the context of a proper planning mechanism. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Opposition does not oppose either of to these two bounty Bills. In fact it welcomes this form of assistance to the manufacturing industry of this country.",61
167,Mr OKEEFE,TABLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS," Iriseto support the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill. Recent and planned amendments to bounty rates mean an increase in the bounties for larger tractors and a reduction in the bounties for smaller tractors. These changes were recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission to bring about a more uniform rate of effective assistance of approximately 25 per cent as from 1982. The Bill currently before the House provides for a substantial increase in money terms in bounties on upper heavyweight tractors above 105 kilowatt power, none of which are wholly manufactured in Australia as yet. The bounty available from 1973 to 1976 on all tractors above 67 kilowatt was $1,560. This Bill increases this amount for example, to $2,465 for a 106 kilowatt tractor and $3,019 for a 130 kilowatt tractor. The extent of this increase in real terms dethat pends upon whether we compare the new bounties with real levels prevailing in 1973 or 1976. The bounty in money terms remained unchanged in that period but inflation of costs and prices accelerated the import price index issued by the Reserve Bank of Australia in respect of machinery, except the electric group, between the March quarter of 1973 and the March quarter of 1977. The index rose by 91 per cent between those March quarters. This is the index that the Government intends to us to adjust the new bounty levies from time to time. Hence, if we compare the new bounties with the bounties the Government originally provided in the March quarter of 1973, we see that the new levels are actually lower in real terms for tractors up to about 130 kilowatts in power, with a slight increase for those tractors above that power, after allowing for inflation between 1973 and 1977. For example, the bounty available for a 110 kilowatt tractor is 15 per cent lower. Taking into account the inflation between 1977 and 1978. the fall in real terms would be larger. For small tractors, the situation is complicated by the new larger bounties being phased in in three States between 1977 and 1982 under the Agricultural Tractors Bounty Amendment Bill 1977. In the initial stage, 1977 to 1979, the bounties are lower than the level set in the period from 1973 to 1976 for tractors up to 34 kilowatts. The bounties are higher for those above that power. However, by the time the last stage is reached, 1982 to 1984, the bounties will have been phased down so that they are lower than the 1973 to 1976 levels for tractors up to 66 kilowatts but still higher for those above that power range. The total sale of wheeled tractors fell from 21,158 units in 1975-76 to 20,667 units in 1976-77. However, sales of tractors over the 105 kilowatt level rose from 1,374 units in 1975-76, or 6.5 per cent of the total tractor sales, to 1,499 units in 1976-79, or 7 per cent of the total sales. Of course, this was due to the great increase in wheat acreages planted in this country. Huge areas of countryside were planted with wheat and this required tractors with greater horsepower. Nearly all big tractors were imported, with Chamberlain-John Deere Pty Ltd and International Harvester Australia Ltd accounting for nearly 50 per cent of the imports. In 1975-76, the imports accounted for only half of the Chamberlain sales but two-thirds of the company's profits. It should be remembered that the Chamberlain company was manufacturing tractors on its own account at Welshpool in Western Australia. The company then received great assistance from the American John Deere organisation which joined it to form a joint company in Australia called Chamberlain-John Deere Pty Ltd. More than 10 firms supply the market with tractors over 155 kilowatts, offering 40 models of widely different power and design. Some foreign distributors have come into Australia to sell their own tractors. For instance, the United States-made Steiger tractor is one of the biggest horsepower tractors operating in our grain belts. Steiger marketed its tractors through John Shearer Ltd, an Australia firm in Adelaide. But when Shearer sold some 78 tractors in seven months, the Steiger company decided to come to Australia and set up its own operations. The same thing has happened in respect of other types of tractors. For instance, the Versatile tractor is a very big horsepower tractor. The company appointed a farm agent in the Moree district of New South Wales who was a very successful operator. The American company was so impressed with the marketing operations in this country that it established itself in Australia to sell these big machines. Despite the competing sellers, mark ups can be high. There were cases of tractors being imported into this country for a landed cost of $30,000. They were being sold to farmers for $60,000 and $70,000. Some tractor companies have been competing in ways other than price. For example, they have been offering farmers and their families free trips overseas with an associated income tax advantage for those farmers who buy machines under this policy. Australia's farm machinery industries generally have been in recession. Recently they have been retrenching staff and have been offering big inducements to buyers of their machines. One of the problems with this business in Australia is that we havefluctuatingseasons with the result that these companies cannot get an even flow year by year. Their operations are subject to fluctuations. This has stopped other machinery firms from manufacturing these bigger horsepower tractors in Australia. For instance, quite a few companies in the United States of America indicated some 18 months ago that they were prepared to manufacture tractors in Australia. However, they were frightened off by the variable seasons that we experience in this country and they have not taken advantage of a possible bounty to manufacture in Australia. Several small local firms have found it profitable to assemble tractors over 105 kilowatts in power in Australia and to undercut the import price by some $ 10,000 to $20,000. The local firms operating in Australia, as mentioned by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), are Phillips at Merredin in Western Australia, Upton Engineering in New South Wales and James Nagorka in Victoria. The companies import most of the components, nearly all duty free. They are only smallfishin the market. Nevertheless, they are assembling these machines in Australia. The machines are of the large horsepower type and are reasonably well accepted. The main local content in these instances is the chassis and the labour for assembly which represents only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the total cost. As these machines are below the 55 per cent local content, these firms currently would not be eligible for any bounty under section 6 of the Act. To achieve 60 per cent to 65 per cent local content would require manufacturing in Australia the major drive line components which is apparently not viable at the present time. The various bounties that are made available in respect of tractor manufacture in Australia are set out very clearly on pages 2 and 3 of the current Act. The bounties that are payable for the various grades and types of horsepower, startingrightfrom the bottom to the high horsepower or high kilowatt machines, are shown in the Act. The major farm organisations have been pressing the Government recently to shift the means of protection for the Australian farm maway, chinery manufacturers from tariffs to bounty so as to reduce the cost to the ment is hesitant about doing this in the foreseeable future as the large budgetary costs would then have to be borne by the Government rather than by the end user. It is good to see that Government is prepared at all times to provide a bounty for the manufacture of farm tractors Austraha because it is important that this nation be independent in relation to farm machinery. is also very important from an employment point of view. The International Harvester company and Chamberlain-John Deere Pty Ltd provide employment for thousands of Australians at their plants and service organisations provide these companies with tyres, batteries, generators other accessories which are made in Australia Australian labour. It is pleasing indeed to take part in the debate on this Bill, which of course the honourable member for Adelaide has indicated is not being opposed by the Opposition. The Opposition resuch alises that for the good of Australia we should have a viable tractor manufacturing industry. is interesting to note that the large horsepower tractors coming into Australia come in duty free. This is one of the reasons why the bounty on large horsepower tractors manufactured in long Australia has been increased by the Government. I am delighted to note that the Government is keeping up with the situation. It is hoped that the Australian manufacturers will provide a bigger percentage of the large horsepower tractor market in this country. I support the Bill.",62
168,Mr FRY,TABLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS," I support these two Bills but wish to speak particularly to the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1978. I recall that when we discussed the tractor bounty last year the former honourable member for Wakefield, who was more commonly known as the 'modest farmer', expressed very strong support and put forward very strong arguments for the principle of bounty support rather than other forms of subsidy. I am always pleased to support those views and, like him, I think it is a philosophy that we do not make enough use of in our rural industries. I would like to see it extended further. It is an open system. We can see what is going on. It is subject to parliamentary review every year and the subsidy goes where it is intended, that is, to the manufacturer. It is not passed on to the user of the implement and, subsequently, to the consumer. Quite often the user-the primary producer-is not in a position to pass on his costs to the domestic consumer or to the export market. So this is a counter, in a to the undesirable effects of devaluation on primary industry. It is something which I support farmers. The Governvery strongly. Another aspect of the system which I think is most desirable is that it is a flexible system which the can be amended from year to year as conditions within the industry change. Of course, this is prein cisely what has happened in this case. The Government is not locked into a form of subsidy It that becomes irrelevant to the conditions or the environment prevailing in the industry. I think it also speaks well for the Industries Assistance Commission's report on the tractor industry, which is a well balanced report, that the Government has seenfitto adopt the recommendations and of the report. I noted the remarks of my colby league the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) about the lack of long term planning in these areas. I think we can see in the IAC a vehicle for long term planning. There is certainly an element of long term planning even in looking at a particular aspect of rural industry, as the market for large tractors. Of course, I would like to see the role of the IAC expanded to It embrace a much wider look at these problems and I would like to see a much closer working relationship developed with the Treasury and the the Department of Finance. There is an element of term planning in the IAC's reports. I would like to see much more notice taken of them and the Government being more prepared to adopt the IAC's recommendations much quicker. The need fbr this amendment has come about because there have been changes in the industry, notably in the growth in the demand for large tractors. The figures show that it has increased from 6.5 per cent to 14 per cent in the past few years, which is quite a substantial increase. This change shows the flexibility of the system in that we are able to amend the Bill to embrace this change. It is a very important change, particularly in relation to what is called timeliness in agricultural operations. When I refer to 'timeliness' the people on the land will know that I am talking about the very important time factor of when one ploughs, when one seeds and when one harvests one's crops. We know that there is a very precise time in the agricultural calendar when conditions are ideal to plough large areas of land. The trouble is, of course, that after three or four days one may find that these ideal conditions have passed. The land may start to dry out because of drying winds or there may be too much rain. As we move to a more sophisticated type of agriculture there is much greater scope for large tractors to be able to get in and do the job at the precise time that conditions are most favourable. This is extremely important, of course, in relation to harvesting. One could have a crop one day and it could be completely destroyed by a hail storm the next day. Sowing seed at the right time and ploughing and cultivating at precisely the right time can mean a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars in regard to the income from a wheat crop, an oilseeds crop or any other large acreage crop. Of course, a large tractor enables the operator to be precisely spot on. I think we should be suporting local production in principle. Although we import many of the tractors we use there are quite a few features of those tractors which are not suitable for local conditions. Locally made tractors tend to be tailor-made to suit our conditions in a much better way. They are often much more rugged than imported tractors and last longer. It is often easier to service and to buy spare parts for locally produced tractors. Other elements that are often overlooked in imported tractors are safety precautions and the comfort of a tractor. We tend to make enclosed cabins and those sorts of things separately and to put them on the tractor later. I think we should be encouraging local production to build these amenities into the tractors in the first place but, overall, to produce a tractor that able to operate in our particularly difficult climatic conditions and over wide areas and rough terrain at a reasonable degree of comfort for the operator and that can do the job in as short a time as possible. I think our tractor production tends to be more labour intensive than the production in other countries because of the scale of operation. I think that justifies this form of subsidy by way of a bounty. There is a very good future for the production of large tractors in Australia and a modest investment in that area at this stage undoubtedly will pay off in the future. I do not think that the market is confined to Australia. I think opportunities exist for expanding our export market. It is only small at the moment, but it is surprising how often one runs into Australian machinery and Australian technology in underdeveloped countries in Africa and the Middle East. I was told by one of my colleagues recently that a big agricultural production scheme in Libya is backed up almost entirely by Australian technology and Australian machinery. There is great scope for this industry. I think that it is something that our trade commissioners are well aware of and that they are attempting to develop those markets. Unfortunately, there is a propensity for people in all countries to keep clear of wild buffaloes. I think the sort of wild buffalo diplomacy in which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and, in some cases, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) have indulged overseas has tended to undermine the good work of our trade commissioners in trying to sell Australian products overseas. It tends to produce an anti-Australian sentiment in those countries, which is most unfortunate. I hope that we will not have further examples of that because it makes the job of our trade commissioners much more difficult. One of the big problems of our trade commissioners is that sometimes they think they are selling Australian machinery and the recipient country thinks they are buying Australian machinery but if it happens to be made by a multi-national organisation the orders are sometimes redirected to another country which that organisation thinks can supply the machinery more cheaply. This is most unfortunate because quite often the purchasing country is buying in response to aid given by this country and price is not the only basis on which it makes a decision. For particular reasons it wants to buy an Australian product, and it is most unfortunate that it is not always able to do so beis cause of the operations of the multi-nationals. We have some reservations about this subsidy and about the fact that it is possible that, by helping a couple of multi-nationals to manufacture large tractors in Australia, overtimewe may be forcing some small manufacturers out of the trade altogether. Here again, I think isflexibleenough for the Parliament to be able to watch for this and to remedy the situation if it develops. We know the problem of the multinationals repatriating their control over them in many ways. But, if by subsidising through bounties we can create jobs in time. Australia and manufacture more large tractors, I believe that that risk is well worth taking as long as we keep the matter under review and are prepared to make adjustments fromtimeto time as the need arises. Generally, the Opposition commends the by Mr Anthony: legislation. It confirms that a bounty is a type of subsidy which can be amended. It isflexibleand can be tailored to fit particular situations. think it should be used much more frequently. I personally feel that there is a very good future Australia, both for domestic use and for export, for the larger types of tractors. Our machinery much more adaptable to the needs of the developing countries and the Middle East tries than is machinery from many other areas because we are accustomed to dry farming, which is the situation in many of those countries. We should explore this to the full in a positive and aggressive way. Although it may cost the public something in the short term, in the long term it will pay off. The cost of the bounty does not fall on a particular sector of the community. The money comes from government and the proceeds population at large contributes to it. The prodeveloping ducer or the user does not have to pay the cost the subsidy. For that reason we support the prinArab ciple very strongly and we support the Bill.

169,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"The We purpose of the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Bill is to establish an Overseas Projects in Corporation to assist Australian organisations to compete for overseas development projects in is order to encourage the export of Australian goods and services. Such projects represent a counlarge and rapidly expanding component of world trade. They are facilitated, of course, by the indigenous demand of many countries and by world aid programs such as those of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In addition, the availability of capital from oil producing countries is giving rise to a demand for very large scale projects in those countries. Further, as the oil producing countries lay off the of their oil sales in the form of loans to countries to ensure a return for the of future, the developing countries are using that oil money, if you like, for project purposes. This Bill represents the belated honouring of an election commitment made in 1977 by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). In the face of Australia's deteriorating trade, the Governhas introduced afive-prongedpackage proposal designed to stimulate export sales. This export development package is to cost an estimated $100m, and of course it is long overdue. We are faced with a critical trade situation in Australia. In addition to this proposal-this one-fith component of the package, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation component-ther e are four other matters to which I will refer briefly. The package includes 1978 changes to the export market development grants scheme. Exporters are to be given incenof up to 1 Sc in the dollar, up to a maximum of some $66m, in order to stimulate trade. The next component is the strengthening of the Trade Commissioner Service, especially in the Middle East, Asia, the Pacilic area and Latin America. Thirdly, there is to be an export promotion drive which will involve the use of displays, trade missions, trade fairs and publicity. Fourthly, there will be additional support for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, known as EFIC. The fifth component is the one which is the subject of this debate. The Opposition does not discourage this package deal at all. As I have said, it is belated. Industry has been looking for Government interest and activity in relation to the problems being encountered in the efforts of industry to bolster world trade. The Opposition agrees that strong Government initiatives are urgently needed to stimulate exports. We also believe that a properly run Overseas Projects Corporation could make a useful contribution. But we are not at all satisfied that the proposals before the House represent the desirable concept, the kind of concept that will make this Corporation successful. We note that funds for the export incentives scheme have died off in recent years, and the Government must accept responsibility for this. We note that the entire package of proposals relates to a report on export incentives which the Government commissioned and received from the Industries Assistance Commission. We are wondering why this report is still being withheld from the Parliament, from the Opposition and from the people. We feel that we could make a far more useful contribution to this debate if the Government were not so secretive about these things and if we knew of the real crisis confronting Australia's manufacturing industries. The fact of the matter is that there are worthwhile manpower policies prevailing in Australia at present. Not so long ago I saw a list of some 170 industry categories. In consultation with a senior public servant, members of the Committee on which I was engaged and I were advised that none of those 170 industries were regarded by the Government as worthy of government backing and support. Which trade industries have that imprimatur from the Let Government-'deservin g of government assistwhich ance'? Which ones are goers? Because of the inadequacies of and indeed absences of relevant trade and manufacturing policies, we are cer1978 tainly at a loss to know. I see the Minister for Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland) sita ting at the table. I am pleased to see him making an occasional visit to Australia. Mr Kevin Cairns-He has got a good suit on, too.",66
170,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Well, he is here in Australia. He is back from beating hisfistson the closed doors of the European Economic Community. He was not making much of a noise so the Prime Minister had to join him. Regrettably, to this stage, the response has been extremely disappointing. What we find is a vacuum in intelligent interest and appUcation by this Government to the trade opportunities in our own region-the Pacific and Asian region-that are staring us in the face. Hopefully this Bill might assist us in that connection because many great projects are to be built in the Pacific and Asian region. But we need this orientation. We need to realise that times have changed and the European Economic Community countries will not dance the tune just when our Prime Minister chooses to clap his hands. We need an overseas trading corporation as well as the project that is currently before the House for debate. Regrettably, when the Labor Government put the trading corporation idea before the Parliament it was rejected. Those who presently prevail in government must accept responsibility for the problems that have resulted from our not having an effective trading corporation in Australia. We have to face the realities of life. Only yesterday I think it was I heard the Prime Minister answer a question in the House in respect of one of our trading partners- a country from which I have only recently returned-the Soviet Union. The Prime Minister could not be disparaging enough about the Soviet Union. He had no consideration of the fact that there is a great imbalance of trade between Australia and the Soviet Union-a n imbalance which is greatly in Australia's favour. I think it is to the tune of no $400m exports to the Soviet Union and about $4m imports from the Soviet Union. Also, many job opportunities are involved in this consideration. This in turn affects the well being of Australians. But for the sake of miserable political advantage we see the Prime Minister and, I think, occasionally the Minister for Special Trade Representations playing politics about and the employment of Australian people. us have a cursory look at the trade situation will be affected in a positive way, we hope, by this Australian Overseas Projects Corporation. Our exports for the 12 months to June grew, I think, by about 6 per cent while our imports increased by about 8 per cent. That is not good situation. The downward trend continued into the month of July, the last month for which figures are available. Imports in that month increased in real terms by 2.5 per cent, but our exports fell by 8.3 per cent. As a result of this trend, our balance of payments is in a very precarious condition. The deficit on current account for 1977-78 was $2,410m-a figure revealed at page 22 of the Budget Speech. This is the result of a decline in trade surplus. This year it will hit deficit level probably in excess of $3,000m. To meet this critical and rapidly deteriorating situation, the Government is looking hopefully to private capital inflow and no doubt to further overseas borrowing. In passing, I make the point about the Government's dependence on foreign investment, which is a poor substitute for internal capital accumulation and investment. I took out somefiguresrecently to this effect: The total net inflow of identified foreign investment in Australia in 1976-77 was a record $ 1,931m-mor e than double the level of 1975-76. That is very short-sighted indeed. The income paid overseas last financial year was a record $ 1,653m. This shows how little long-term benefit the Australian economy receives from uncontrolled foreign investment. This tendency to solve our problems by allowing people to buy up Australia at a cheap rate following the 17'A per cent devaluation, in the long term has disastrous consequences for Australia. This is also the case when we are repatriating dividends overseas. The products of our manufacturing efforts go to benefit people in other parts of the world. For a long time there has been an overdependence on mineral exports to keep pace with our import requirements. Previously we relied on wool. We used to say that Australia rode on the sheep's back. Fortunately, for over a decade mining has been expanding and now represents some 30 per cent of our exports. But mining is low labour-intensive. Of course when we send our products of the mining industry overseas, this in turn generates an impact on our balance of payments. Australia is then faced with the dilemma of having to buy manufactured goods from the countries to which it has sold the products of our mines. When we sell a million dollars worth of bauxite to Japan we probably buy a million dollars worth of motor cars or footwear or textiles in return. So it is important that we minimise this dependency on our mining industry. After all, over half our mining exports go to Japan and the rate of that country's economic growth is now slowing down. As a result of that slowing down, already we have witnessed a decline in Japan's demand for raw materials for steel making. Our iron ore and coal exports have fallen as a result. The fact is that diversification of exports is essential. I suppose that consideration of that fact has prompted the Government to introduce this legislation. Internally our economy is so depressed as a result of government mismanagement that enormous areas of expertise and technological competence have been left a unutilised. There are many statistics to substantiate that contention. It is significant that our Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) now considers it necessary to prop up the private sector with the creation of this new instrumentality. He has not always taken that view. Hitherto his attitude has been that government interference would be disastrous. Back in September 1975, the Minister, as the then Opposition spokesman on trade, had different ideas. As the Hansard shows, on 4 September 1975, the present Minister, when speaking on the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation Bill, said: The second aim of the Corporation would be to assist small Australian manufacturers and processors to enter into overseas markets. The Opposition cannot see how the proposed Corporation would assist that aim. The Minister has this prejudice against government involvement. He continued: We believe that if the Government wants to help small manufacturers enter the export trade it should restore the expon incentive scheme. . . . When referring to countries with centrally planned economies, he said: Australia does not possess very much technology which these countries are seeking. But strangely he now has a Bill before the House which is designed to export that technology which allegedly is in short supply. In another vein in the same speech he said: It is unrealistic for small firms to rely on a government trading corporation to write their contracts for them. It is equally naive for a government to imagine that it can create a corporation which fulfils that function. Yet we find that that is the very purpose and nature of the legislation now before the House. In many respects the Minister has been forced to change his tune; he has had to eat his words, to eat humble pie because of the deteriorating state of our manufacturing industries. He admitted in his second reading speech that the private sector had called for Government support. He said: The Government has received a number of requests from Australian firms for support, assistance or direct participation in various development projects. He has had to admit that our companies are small and uncompetitive by world standards, that in a number of fields certain elements of essential expertise are located only in Government instrumentalities and that Government intervention and support is essential if Australian interests are to be able to compete on an equal footing with overseas competitors. I am concerned with clauses 11,12 and 13 of this Bill which relate to the management of this proposed Corporation. Five of the eight directors, including the Chairman, must come from the private sector. In fact it is possible under the legislation that all the directors could come from the private sector. In my view this denies the important and significant input and role of the pubUc sector. It denies the significance of governmental capitalisation of the project, the investment of $2m of public money and the backup for contingent liabilities of $50m. For that matter, without the imprimatur of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the good will which has flowed from our aid program, Australian enterprises would not get to first base overseas in competition for these projects. We have the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation for which I was once ministerially responsible and for which I think the Parliament has a great deal of respect. I fail to understand why that body is not given a substantial role in the Corporation. Why is it not to have representation on the board? It was established in 1970 and has a staff of 511 people, 148 of whom are overseas. Its pre-tax profit for the year 1976-77 was $ 1.87m and since its establishment the overall total dividend to the Government stands at 12.5 per cent on average capital. Why are we to have the extravagance of two overseas project agencies when we have the SMEC already in existence? It is associated with many projects for the Australian Development Assistance Agency. It is operating in 24 assignment locations and is expert on hydro-electric projects of the type it is building in Ghana. It is associated with ground water development projects, land setdement schemes, irrigation, highways, agricultural schemes and many other great projects around the world. It has operated successfully in about 23 countries and most of the States of Australia. Why is it not to have an effective role in this new Corporation, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation? Why is it ignored? Why is the Bill drawn to make it possible for all eight directors to come from the private tor? Why is the Australian community or the public sector to be denied representation on board of this great Corporation? After all, that organisation can exist only if it is government capitalised or government created. Its functions are to be financed from the public purse and inthere itial capital of $2m is involved with $50m ators stacked up for contingent liabilities. Why is this public enterprise to play second fiddle to every comparable body in the country, unable to compete, only permitted to charge fees but not to make a profit? Why is the Corporation to be unable to carry out its own project works and to be required instead to have its works carried out by private organisations? Why is the Corporation to be prevented from engaging in general overseas trading? Why is the Department of Construction disregarded and why is that great instrumentality, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, of which all Australians are proud, treated with such studied indifference, and, indeed, with such studied insult? This Corporation is off to a bad start because the Government has such an uncompromising antipathy to public enterprise. Under this Bill overseas owned, dominated and influenced firms can be assisted to make profits by a Corporation masquerading as a public instrumentality. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation should be made respectable and acceptable to the countries with which it wants ts> trade by becoming a genuine public instrumentality. I support the amendments to that effect which have been foreshadowed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), amendments which will soon be the subject of debate when the Committee stage of the debate is reached.",67
171,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"The real merit of this legislation is that it will make the skills of particular Australians available overseas. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Bill deserves to be supported for that reason, if for no other. There would be nobody in this House who would disagree with the view that skUl, knowledge, merit and abUity ought to be boundless in their operation. This Corporation will enable those qualities to be boundless in their operation irrespective of national boundaries and in so doing will help the people themselves and help Australia. I will give an example of what I mean. The purpose of this Bill is to make the knowledge of engineers, of some economists and of some agriculturalists-and these have been the most successful people-availabl e overseas. It will give them a chance to operate secagainst international competitors. I invite honourable members to compare that with the the export of other commodities which occurs in Australia. Normally we export our commodities. There are always vested interests in company commodities. For example, if coal is exported is a vested interest on the part of coal operin the export business. There is an overseas coal exporters' association operating. If iron is found and is exported there is a vested interest which exports and is directly related to something material. The same applies with respect to wool, nickel, copper and so on. This Bill is quite different in its application infinitely more human. There are people with eminent skill available in this nation. There are engineers with pre-eminent skill. This Bill will ensure that they can operate in a world where their skills are desired on at least an equal basis with engineers and economists from competing nations. There is something intensely human about this and something of which Australia fact ought to be very proud. This is also a magnificent economic investment. Commodities are often found and exported as a result of the application of luck. That has certainly applied in respect iron ore exports. There is no luck whatsoever having these skills available for use throughout the world. It will help the recipient countries and it will help individuals. Therefore, I must differ somewhat with thefirstsentence of the first paraand graph of the second reading speech of the Ministotal ter for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), in which he referred to: . . . an Australian Overseas Projects Corporation to assist Australian private organisations to compete for seas development projects so as to encourage the export Australian goods and services. Overwhelmingly this Bill is to enable the export of skilled Australians. That is a world of difference. I am deUghted above all that the gineering profession is to be the profession that will be helped as a result of the operation of this Corporation. I am deUghted that the engineering profession, which is going through very difficult times in this nation, has already been successful in applying its skills overseas. If we refer to survey of consultancy services conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics we see that there are some very interesting details and information avaUable. The number of contracts earned overable seas by Australian consultants in 1976-77 was three times that of the previous year. If we look at the net result of the consultancies which have found application overseas, there has been result from those activities in favour of Australia. For example, net earnings in 1975-76 were over $3m and in the subsequent year over $5m. I prethe sume that they have increased far more since then. Having mentioned thosefigures,we ask ourselves: Who are the people and professions which have been successful? This same data indicates that engineering and mining between them were responsible for 72 per cent that success. Agricultural workers, forestry account workers and economists were responsible for most of the rest. Why should I say that I am delighted that this legislation will be of particular use to the engineering profession? Of all the professions in Australia. I believe that the most disadvantaged and over a long period has been the engineering profession. It has been the most disadvantaged because it has been the casualty in every recession that has occurred in this nation. In every recession governments have cut expenditure, and I do not argue with that. However, the part of pubUc expenditure that has been cut overwhelmingly has always been capital expenditure. The plain is that a casualty of that kind of cut in expenditure, ipso facto, must be and always has been the engineering profession. Nevertheless, the figures I have mentioned demonstrate that the of engineering profession has skills which have in earned money for this country overseas. I have mentioned the sum of $5m. It might be said that that is only a small amount of money that it is not significant in the total. In the it is immensely significant. Looking at Australia's record overseas we see that the current account deficit for this year will be something over $2.5 billion. That deficit will occur in overspite of the fact that there have been positive balof ance of trade effects. However, the engineering profession and the other professions which will benefit as a result of the work of the Corporation have not been in deficit; they have been in positive balance. Even though the organisation of encapital in Australia makes it very difficult for these professions to function in a stable manner they have earned resources for this country overseas. Therefore, I am delighted that this Corporation will be able to help such people, and help them in their private capacity too. The Oppothe sition has made an enormous amount of the fact that the ultimate test of the value of this organisation is that it is to be attuned to the requirements of or is to make its organising ability availto private organisations. Insofar as it makes avaUable to private organisations those organising skills and information we ought to regard this part of its activities as a positive boon. As I a net demonstrated a few moments ago, one of the great professions in Australia whose technology will be exported overseas has been vulnerable in past because it has relied overwhelmingly on public capital. So, we ought to applaud the fact that the Corporation will be able to operate in what are the the private market. The summary of my argument is this: The of great problem this country faces is its current deficit. In a sense it is the narrow part of the Venturi tube through which we will have to fit all the aspirations of the Australian economy and we must deal with this task. How much we can get past that constriction will determine the future development of this country and enable an expanded Australian economy to work on current account surpluses and not on current account deficits. The people who have already enabled part of that problem to be overcome will be assisted by this legislation. I am reminded that Sir George Turner, our first Treasurer, in presenting one of his first Budgets was moved to remark that it had always been found easiest when cutting public expenditure to cut capital works. It speaks for itself. This Bill will deal with some of the problems created when this is done. I turn now to the Bill itself but will refer three parts of it-clause s 6, 8 and 14.1 think there was some misunderstanding about clause 6 in Australia the debate last night. Clause 6 will enable inforassist mation to be made available through the Corcountry poration. The Corporation will be able to assist Australian private organisations to negotiate with overseas organisations. It will give positive assistance. It will assist Australia private organisbution ations to carry out developments overseas. If vate organisations are not required want to do the work on their own or to participate in it, the Corporation can do that work as a principal agent. That is how I understand clause 6 (l ) (d ) of the Bill. I deal now with clause 8 because one or two its provisions worry me. I am sure that the Minisdifficulty ter Assisting the Minister for Trade and sources (Mr Garland) can put some of my woroperating ries to rest. Clause 8 makes it quite clear that Corporation is not to compete against Australian private organisations, nor should it compete against them. Sub-clause (2) makes when an Australian private organisation becomes aware that the Corporation is either negotiating with a view to the formation of an tralian consortium or is negotiating with an overseas government it can protest and, accordbate ing to the nature of that protest, the responsible Minister may direct the Corporation to cease operations or negotiations. I am concerned about the circumstances in which a private organisation might learn that negotiations are proceeding ation overseas or are being held between the Corporganisations ation and some overseas agent and then decides to protest. I hope that the rules of procedure which will be determined by the Minister will not allow the Corporation to be undercut or undervidualfirms.The written to this extent or made vulnerable to orto ganisations that might decide, after events have been set in train, to try to get in on them in of the work that has been done previously by the Corporation. Rules of procedure will have to be set and in this respect they should be workable rules. I turn to the other provisions relating to protection of private organisations. In clause 14 it is quite clear that the Board shall keep the Minister informed of its decisions with respect to matters of policy. If matters of policy are not acceptable to the Minister he can either recommend that they be altered or overrule them. I am pleased to note that approval for specific projects to be undertaken by the Corporation or the Board will not be affected by this provision in the Bill. I am delighted with the application of the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Bill. It will serve a to only very valuable and useful purpose in several ways. Not only will it assist relations between and the rest of the world but it also will some professions operating within this to market their skills overseas and make them available to the rest of the world without disadvantage. Not the least effect of that will be that in so doing it will make a positive contrito the solution of Australia's greatest and primost persistent economic problem, that is, the or do not current account deficit. I hope that the Government is not bluffing in regard to the proposed operation of this legislation. I presume that it is not and that it is quite sincere. There is an old French proverb in respect of of those who bluff that at the moment I have in recalling. Nevertheless, I hope that Rethe Government is not bluffing and that in the proposed Corporation in the way it the ought to be operated it will be able to nudge the international market to the benefit of not only those people in Australia who can benefit from it it clear that but also the country.",69
172,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS," I want to remind those who have taken an interest in the deof the purpose of the Bill and to respond to one or two of the questions that have been put its and the comments that have been made. This is an important Bill. The whole purpose of the proposed Australian Overseas Projects Corporis to assist Australian private enterprise orto seek and obtain large scale contracts for projects overseas. This would open a new area of opportunity for Australian industry as many projects are beyond the capacity of inditask of the Corporation will be bring together the skills that are readily available in Australia to present viable and competispite tive Australian bids for particular projects. The Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), in his second reading speech, referred to the objectives of the Corporation and to the way in which the Government envisages that it will carry out its functions. It will assist in the mation of consortiums to bid for particular projects. If requested, and with the approval of the Minister, it could take the role of prime contractor. The concept of the Corporation is to assist Australian private enterprise, not to compete with it. Deliberately included in the Bill are safeguards that will protect the position of Australian private enterprise groups in the event that they find themselves in competition with the Corporation. The Snowy Mountains Engineering CorporMany ation, which has been referred to several times, has established an international reputation as engineering consultancy corporation with a high degree of in-house expertise in a number of specific engineeringfields.The incorporation the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation's functions into those of the Snowy Mountains gineering Corporation could result in a loss opportunities for private enterprise consultants. Also the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporearlier ation is empowered to contract the engineering field. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation will not have the power or the resources to contract on its own behalf. The Opposition seems to envisage that there will be some serious overlapping in the functions of these two corporations. In fact, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation will be able to contract only as a member of a consortium or a prime contractor on behalf of Australian firms, whereas the Snowy Mountains Engineering poration could be a member of a consortium that which requests the proposed Corporation to As can be clearly seen and as has been spelt clearly, the Bill specifically prohibits the proposed Corporation acting as a principal agent in trading transactions and it will not empowered to displace Australian traders and statutory authorities in their normal activities. The supply of goods required for a particular project would be the responsibUity of the firms associated with it. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation will be required to act in accordance with sound commercial principles and will seek to obtain sufficient revenue to cover the costs of its ations and to pay a reasonable rate of return to the Government. Similar requirements are placed on the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. The major objective is to assist securing the profitabUity and viabUity of tralian private enterprise through the creation new market opportunities. As has Trade Commissioner Service will be briefed to provide information on projects to the Corporforation so that it will be in a position to inform industry of opportunities at an early stage. The Trade Commissioner Service will continue to service requests from individual Australian firms for intelligence on specific projects. A number of the comments that were made in the course of the debate seemed to indicate that the terms of the second reading speech have not been fully understood. I cannot understand why that would be the case because they are clear. of the criticisms that have been levelled by the Opposition obviously run counter to what the an Minister for Trade and Resources clearly set out. Early in his speech he talked about the need for the proposed Corporation, the examination that of the Government did and the reasons for it. That part of the speech was faithfully represented at Enthe beginning of the speech by the honourable of member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). He mentioned clearly- I hope I recapitulated this in my remarks-wha t the Government sees as in its own right in the objective. In leading for the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) seemed to believe that the Government was trying to indicate that the Corporation is to be set up for different purposes, but I really do not think that proposition can be sustained when one reads what has been said. In fact it is not the as Government's belief that it should have the power to buy and sell and to trade. It is clear Corfrom the amendment that it proposes to move that is the view of the Opposition, but that is act. not the Government's view. Of course, that out proposed amendment cannot be accepted. In this House in years gone by we have had vigorous deor bates about how this type of corporation might be be used. We do not agree with the Opposition's views about that. The honourable member fbr Hughes suggested that it was wrong for the Government parties when they were in opposition to disagree; but, of course, they made the reasons for that disagreement very clear. The honourable member may not accept them, but we hold the view very firmly that the Government should not set up another-it would be operanother-competin g trading corporation. When one reads the terms of the Bill in relation to this matter which was before the House a few years ago one will find that the powers of the corporin ation proposed in that Bill were so wide that it Auswould have been permitted-and we were fearof ful that it would in fact-to engage in widespread been said, the trading practices.",71
173,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,You do not like the people's instrumentalities making profits.,73
174,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"The honourable member said that I do not like the people's instrumentalities making profits. That is the core of the matter and I thank him for that interjection. The previously proposed corporation would not have been an instrumentality for making profits for the people. It would have been a government instrumentality that was influenced very directly by a government which had a socialist attitude and a socialist objective clearly in its platform. There is a deep difference between us. The objective that the honourable member and his party have had for many years is the fundamental difference between us. I am obliged to the honourable member for bringing it out so clearly. We have been over that argument many times and I believe that that attitude, which of course goes beyond simply establishing an overseas trading corporation, is a part of the different ways in which the public views our two sides of politics. Its point of view has been expressed at recent elections. So I will not go over that argument again in any detail. I think it has been made clear enough for those people who are interested. Let me come back to the Bill before us. At one stage I actually wrote down the words of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. He said: ' I think it is worthwhile, perhaps'. I put the word 'perhaps' in brackets. He goes along with the Bill to some degree, but he says that it does not have enough muscle. Presumably he proposes to put some muscle into it by way of the three amendments which he foreshadowed he would move and which have been circulated. I suppose that the major amendment concerns the matter which we have just been discussing. The amendment proposes to insert the following words: The Corporation may engage either as principal or agent in the buying and selling of goods overseas but not compete with any Australian organisation. For my part I find it very difficult to envisage how that caveat would work in practice. Clearly, in talking about not competing, the honourable member is trying to retreat from the situation the Bill which was introduced by the Labor Party in about 1974 and which would have provided for competition. In fact the two situations menwhat tioned in the amendment are impossible to sepnot arate. For the reasons I have mentioned and private sector. those set out so clearly by the Minister in his second reading speech, we cannot accept that amendment. In fact it would go right against intention in introducing this Bill. The honourable member referred to various clauses in the Bill. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), who made a useful analysis of the Bill in his contribution to this debate, pointed out the misunderstanding which seemed to exist in the mind of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith in respect of clause 6. Clause 7 points out the prohibition of buying and selling, which we have been discussing and which of course is the basis of the setting up of this Corporation; not some other proposal. It is fundamental to what is suggested. We do not want the Corporation to be open ended; we do not want it to compete; we do not want it to trade; we want it to achieve the other objectives to which we have referred. The clear policy of the Government which has been stated publicly manytimesis not to see an expansion of the public sector, particularly in our present situation. The Opposition for its part ideologically, and I think in practice, takes every opportunity to recommend and to achieve public sector expansion. That matter represents a deep division between the two sides. If the Labor Party could have the first amendment inserted in the Bill, that would go some way towards achieving its objective. In speaking of the amendments, I must say that the Government cannot agree to them. I have dealt with the first amendment, which aims to give the Corporation more power. The second amendment proposes that there be inserted in the Bill a requirement that the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary to the Department of Trade and Resources, the Manager of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Director of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation or their delegates be appointed to the board of directors. That would be obligatory. The honourable member for Hughes dealt with this matter in some detail and suggested that the way it was worded could and, I think he went on to imply, so as to would result in directors coming from only the private sector. I think he really has exaggerated the situation considerably. Decisions in respect of appointments have not been made. After all, the Bill has not yet passed through the Parliament and is not yet an Act. However, some of thought naturally has been given to this matter. Without in any way pre-empting what will be decided by Cabinet, I think it is fairly clear that is intended here is to achieve a balance and to provide for appointments wholly from the Equally, we would not accept this proposed our amendment because it in turn would make fixed appointments where some greater balance may well be achieved by looking at a wider number of categories. I understand what honourable members opposite are putting forward when they suggest a variety of expertise and connections and I would hope that would be achieved, but I do not believe that the appointments should come from the suggested areas. I do not believe that it would be wise to insert in a Bill an amendment to make something so fixed because, with the pressure of legislation, it is not easy to reintroduce a Bill in order to make an amendment. I am not quite sure that I followed the argument of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. I think he talked about some judicial decision making. With respect I must say that, coming from a lawyer, that rather puzzled me.",73
175,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,Balance .,74
176,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Balance . I accept that and think I have already indicated my sympathy with that view. I do not think that one should jump to the conclusion, as did the honourable member for Hughes, that there is any exclusion of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporthe ation or the Department of Construction. Those are areas that need to be considered. I hope that have drawn some distinction between the operMinister ations of the Snowy Mountains poration and the proposed Australian Overseas Projects Corporation. If we were Opposition's suggestion, in fact we would have real overlap, which we do not want. The corporDeputy ations have different objectives and I think they can pursue them very well. I would not agree with the honourable member that the Governfact ment has introduced this Bill belatedly. knows very well the pressure of introducing debate, legislation into this House. Every year more legislation is required. This Bill was included three-year program at the end of last year and has been introduced into this House in August of this year, so I think the honourable member must have spoken tongue in cheek. He talked a great deal about trade opportuniTrade ties. I do not propose to comment on every point he made. I must say that I found it all a bit difficult to follow. I would like him to elaborate some time on how the position of the balance trade with the Union of Soviet Socialist Repubfulfilling lics, if redressed, would create tunities, presumably in Australia, because I found that point a bit obscure.",74

178,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,It is all right. The Minister is closing the debate.,74
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,No; I am afraid that the Minister is not closing the debate.,74

182,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I was trying to help the Minister because everything he has said has been in reply to points raised by members. The Minister is not adding any new matter. Clearly he is giving either an affirmative or a negative answer to I what has been said in the debate. I thought he was entitled to continue on that basis because, in also my view, the debate is finished.",74
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that it was not Minister for Special Trade Representations who moved the motion for the second reading of I the Bill; it was the Deputy Prime Minister and for Trade and Resources. Standing Engineering CorOrder 68 states: In all cases the reply or the mover of the original question to accept the closes the debate. a This debate would have to be closed by the Prime Minister, who moved the motion for the second reading. Although the Minister for Special Trade Representations is a Minister, in he is speaking in the debate as an ordinary He member. Maybe he thought he was closing the but he is not. It is for that reason that it is my intention to call the honourable member for in a Paterson when the Minister finishes his speech.",74
184,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Can you clarify whether the Minister for Special Trade Representations is in fact presuming to speak for the Minister for and Resources? Is the Minister for Special Trade Representations deputising for him? It seems to me that in effect the Minister has been answering on behalf of the Government and to of that extent it would seem to me that he is the role of the Minister who introduced further job opporthe legislation.",74
185,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, might I say that I am designated the Minister Assisting Minister for Trade and Resources. I was under the impression that no one else wished to speak and I was replying to what had been said the debate. I might say with respect that I am sure that your interpretation of the Standing Orders is correct. I do not propose to make any further contribution. Might I also add that I understand it is proposed to deal with the amendments together and therefore there will probably not be a debate at the Committee stage. With that in mind I was also covering items that could be dealt with at the Committee stage.",74
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"I would Uke to give my decision. On a strict interpretation of the Standing Orders the Minister, even though he is the Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Resources, cannot close the debate. The honourable member for Paterson has indicated that he would like to speak. However, the conduct of the business of the House is in the hands not of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker but of the Government. Under the Standing Orders I would be required to call the honourable member for Paterson if he were torise.It is in the hands of the Government to refuse the honourable member the right to speak. Until such time as that action is taken I am bound by the Standing Orders to call the honourable member for Paterson if he rises. The Government then has the prerogative to decide whether it wants to hear him. In respect of the other matter, in view of what went on before I will allow the Minister to conAustralian tinue in the same vein if there is to be no dison cussion at the Committee stage.",75
187,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy tween Speaker. There will not be any discussion. conclude, I was dealing with some to the points which had been raised",75
188,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. I was wondering what your attitude the fact that the clock indicates that the Minister does not have any speaking time left.",75
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,In view of the fact that the Minister's time has expired I call the honourable member for Paterson.,75
190,Mr OKEEFE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS," I am sorry that I have caused this Uttle problem. I was of opinion that a member of the Opposition would speak before I made my speech. When that did not happen the Minister for Special Trade Repof resentations (Mr Garland) jumped to his feet and received the call. I apologise for what pened and I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate. The purpose of this Bill is to establish an tralian Overseas Projects Corporation to assist Australian firms to compete for overseas development projects. The Bill was formulated as a result of the growing commercial interests in overseas projects. The Government received a number of requests from Australian firms for support, assistance or direct participation in various development projects. At the same time several of the major sector industry organisations made representations to the Government requesting the establishment of a greater degree of co-operation between the Government and industry in the overseas projects area. It became apparent to the Government that the present ad hoc arrangements for considering each request on a case by case basis was not a satisfactory way of providing continuing government support to Australian exporters in this field. So during 1976 and 1977 the Government undertook a thorough study of the overseas projects market. Submissions were sought from private enterprise groups and the Trade Development Council. Therefore the proposals contained in this Bill have been thoroughly researched by the Government over quite a considerable time. Following this study possible approaches to the problem were discussed with representatives of industry organisations and the Trade Development Council. As a result of this consideration the Government was convinced that if interests were to be able to compete an equal footing with overseas competitors an overseas projects corporation would need to be established to facilitate direct co-operation beindustry and government in this field. To Therefore the Government undertook to establish such a corporation during 1978 as part of its policy, and of course this undertaking was outlined very considerably in November 1977 is to during the last Federal election campaign. A great amount of investment in large developmental projects in developing countries has taken place during the past 10 years. This has been most notable in the Middle East where oil prices have been at a very high level. The investment has enabled these oil producing countries to embark on huge development programs of a the continuing nature. In addition, nnancial institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are providing large amounts development funds to developing countries to enable them to improve their food production hapcapacity and so on. There is great competition among overseas countries to gain a share of the large contracts for development projects. Contracts are being let for projects such as port faciliAusties, railways, dams and hospitals. Countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Korea and Japan are competing for these contracts. Organisations from these countries are being helped by their own governments to gain the contracts. AusAustraUa traUan companies must have the backing of this Government if they are to be able to compete successfully. The Corporation will be concerned only with development projects overseas and it will prohibited from engaging in general trading. It will provide information on opportunities for Australian involvement in overseas development projects. It will assist Australian private organisations to negotiate or carry out overseas ment projects by providing technical advice or, on request, joining into a consortium with private organisations provided it is requested to do so. It this can agree to carry out the whole or part of an satisfactory overseas development project with a view to ar- 'Robinson's ranging for the work to be done by Australian tation private organisations. There are huge contracting firms in this country that are capable and able to undertake projects of the type envisaged in the Bill. They have the engineering expertise as well as the necessary expertise in other fields. The Corporation will act only as a private contractor if no capable Australian private organisation is wUling to do so. Parts III and IV of the Bill relate to the estabUshment of an Australian overseas projects corporation board, the appointment of a managing director and the engagement of the staff of the corporation. The board will consist of a full-time managing director and seven part-time directors, four of whom will be drawn from the private sector and one of whom will have experience in rural industry. No doubt this part of the Bill has been very well researched by the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) and the Government. I cannot see why the Opposition has raised such a fuss about the personnel of the board who will look after the Corporation. Part V of the Bill sets down the nnancial and accounting policies and responsibUities of the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation. It is to operate commercially and charge a fee for its services. An initial working capital of $2m is to be provided and the Corporation will be empowered to enter into contingent liabilities up to an initial limit of $50m. The legislation will assist Australian companies to gain access to overseas markets which are at present avaUable to progressive firms and traders. From an economic point of view, first Australia must develop its overseas trade. This Bill certainly will give an Braithwaite, R. A opportunity to progressive firms and interested organisations to take part in the great development that is occurring in neighbouring countries and other countries generally. We have in the contracting companies and the engineering companies with the expertise and the know-how to undertake these contracts. I fully support the Bill. I think that it will be of great assistance to our overseas trade and will develop be new markets of great advantage to Australia. Debate interrupted. NA",75

209,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS," I seek leave to move three amendments to clauses 7 and 13 which read, in part: Clause 7. (1) Subject to sub-section (2), the Corporation shall not engage, whether as principal or agent, in the buying or selling of goods. (2) The Corporation may(a) buy goods fbr use by the Corporation within Australia and subsequently sell such goods; and (b) buy or sell goods to the extent that that buying or selling is incidental to the provision by the Corporation of a technical or advisory service to an Australian private organisation or an Australian consortium. Clause 13. (1) The Board shall consist of(a) a Chairman; (b) a Deputy Chairman; (c) the Managing Director; and (d) 5 other Directors. (2) The Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and the Directors referred to in paragraph (1 j (d) shall be appointed by the Governor General and shall be so appointed as part-time Directors. (3) At least 4 appointed Directors (of whom at least one is the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman) shall be persons who are engaged in private industry at the time of their appointment and appear to the Governor General to be persons who have experience in matters related to development projects. (4) At least one appointed Director shall he a person who is engaged in private industry at the time of his appointment and appears to the Governor General to be a person who has experience in matters related to rural industry. (5) An appointed Director shall hold office for such period, not exceeding 3 years, as the Governor General specifies in his instrument of appointment. (6) An appointed Director is eligible for re-appointment. (7) The performance of the functions, or the exercise of the powers, of the Board is not affected by reason of there being a vacancy or vacancies in the membership of the Board. Leave granted.",79
210,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"I move: 1. In clause 7, omit sub-clause (1), substitute the following sub-clause: '(1) The Corporation may engage either as principal or agent in the buying and selling of goods overseas but not so as to compete with any Australian organisation.'. Second Reading 2. In clause 13, sub-clause (I), after paragraph (d) add the following paragraphs: '(e) the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs or his delegate; (f) the Secretary of the Depanment of Trade and Resources or his delegate; (g) the Manager of the Commonwealth Development Bank or his delegate; and (h) the Director of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation or his delegate.'. 3. In clause 13, at the end of the clause add the following sub-clause: '(8) No Director shall be involved in the consideration or shall vote upon, any matter in which or indirect interest.'. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Bill 1978 has been the subject of continual debate for two days. The matters now before the Committee are the amendments moved by the Opposition to clauses 7 and 13. As honourable members will understand from what has taken place already, the Opposition feels that whilst the concept of this Bill is admirable, legislation of this type will not be of assistance to overseas projects generally. Honourable members will notice that the Bill places very severe restrictions and limitations on what the proposed Corporation can do. Its powers and functions are to be directly subservient to any private organisation. We of the Opposition recognise that we want to expand industry and we are not trying to suggest any socialistic measure; but we have always said that it would be far better to do so by way of an overseas trading corporation or, in the context of previous deliberations in the second reading debate, by using the technique of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. That body has quite extensive powers and only a slight legislative amendment would be required to enable it to act in this same area of overseas projects. Honourable members will notice, as we have said, that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is doing very well. It has experience overseas and it has the ability to encourage further work for Australia. According to its last report it was making a handsome profit. It paid substantial income tax and gave back $650,000 to the Australian taxpayer. This represented a 25 per cent return on capital. That shows the expertise that it has. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporlisten ation, even before it comes into being, is to prevented from engaging, either as principal or agent, in the buying or selling of goods. Our first amendment is to the effect that we should enable this Corporation to act as a principal or agent. will not do any harm to any private organisation. It is said in the Bill that the Corporation will able to assist, inform and generally guarantee that Australian enterprises will be encouraged enter the overseas area. The point has been put to me by the private sector that the restraints corporated in the Bill reduce the chances of private Australia securing overseas projects. The qualifications stated in the Bill could mean that inadvertently the Corporation could be delayed in acting speedily or that private organisations could miss out on securing overseas contracts because of the possible delays caused. The Corporof, ation must wait until the moves by private organhe has a direct isations are known, and while private organisations may be working out whether they should tender direct or otherwise there will be further delay and we could well miss the potential. The Bill is designed to provide for a fair degree of procrastination and uncertainty, all for the sake of maintaining the appearance that private enterprise at all times has not only priority of tendering but also the right of objection should the Corporation move at a faster rate. Despite what was said in reply by the Minister for Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland), honourable members will notice that the Corporation is not to act as a prime contractor. Those limitations will cause concern to the Corporation. The Bill indicates clearly that the Corporation should be involved in large scale projects, not just simple ones. It is reasonable to query why the Government has decided to develop a brand new type of enterprise in an area in which Australia has only limited experience rather than to foster the operations of an organisation geared to medium sized contracts. We get those particular problems. Time is limited and I do not want to delay the Committee, but if we could embellish this legislation by guaranteeing that the Corporation could act as principal or agent in this capacity it would assist the private sector. I refer now to clause 13. Despite what was said in reply by the Minister, clause 13 states clearly that the board is to consist of eight members, of whom at least five must come from the private sector. That is mandatory. It is no good saying that there will be a balance. Five out of eight is a majority. We suggest that if the Government is to become involved with overseas projects it should to the expert advice it receives from the be Department of Foreign Affairs or the advice it receives on the overseas trading resources of this nation by way of overseas trade representatives. It should look also at the intelligence available It from the Commonwealth Development Bank and communicate with the Snowy Mountains be Engineering Corporation. By all means have a board but it should have that sort of expertise to which immediately gives the Corporation an overseas connection. The board should not have ineight members of whom five must come from the sector. It is no good saying that there is a balance in that. Surely nobody would suggest that it would be a socialistic enterprise if we have on the board people who are already beholden to the Government in an important number of fields, namely representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Resources, the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. Such people could do nothing but add to the expertise and ability of the Corporation to get new projects and to give advice as to the type of projects that are considered. The Bill should not be left as it has been drawn up-that there can be a board, five members of which must come from the private sector, with possibly eight coming from the private sector. By all means have the board but there should be a guarantee of that sort of representation. Our amendment is on that basis. Finally, because the board would be taking people from the private sector who would need to be experienced in this type of overseas project development, it must be facing a conflict of interest. While it has been put to me that the Government has provided a safeguard in been another part of the Bill, I do not know whether has. The apparent safeguard we are asked to poration consider as being acceptable is contained in clause 18. Our amendment to clause 13 states that no director shall, as a member of the Board, consider any matter in which he has a direct indirect interest. It is a complete prohibition which must be maintained in the public interest. The Government has invited us to accept that there is no need to go ahead with this amend which ment because the Bill already provides for case of a director who happens to be a member, but not a director, of another corporation comtrading prising more than 25 persons. I do not think is strong enough. We are dealing with matters considerable import and I do not think we lation should weaken the legislation with that sort provision. It will not go over at all well people who hold the view that there should be no conflict of interest at all. The protective device in the Bill requires a director to advise the board that he has a conflict of interest and therefore will not take any part in the board's decision. What we in the Opposition are saying is clearly shown in the second part of our amendment lation which states that no director shall consider such matter. In other words, there is an immeditrading ate prohibition and no equivocation on that poslegislation ition is possible. The Government has said that there is a gap our present capacity to undertake the work envisaged for the Corporation and that there is need for something to be done about it. The position supports this view but queries whether this legislation provides the right approach in view of all the dreadful limitations it places on the Corporation. If it is to be a corporation run by the private sector why must we limit it in this way? We would have no objection if the Government were to say that the Corporation could do what it wanted to do as a principal or agent. However, the Bill provides that any private organisation can object to the Corporation's activities and that the Corporation cannot act as a prime contractor. We do not think that is a sensible way to approach the problem and accordingly have moved the amendments.",79
211,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS," I would like to reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and speak to the amendments he has moved. I accept that these amendments have been brought forward in good faith to improve the legislation. However, I believe that they are unnecessary because the Bill has drafted to meet certain requirements. The it amendment to clause 7 seeks to enable the Corto act as a principal or agent in the buying or selling of goods overseas but not so as to compete with Australian organisations. That is not acceptable to the Government. The Governor ment believes that it is not tight enough to guarantee that there will not be unfair .competition with existing trading organisations in Australia. I suppose one might think that this is a rather rigid attitude to take but it is an attitude was formed following the legislation that the the Labor Government brought down when it was in office and wanted to establish an overseas corporation whose activities would have that conflicted greatly with those of many of our of export and trading organisations. That legisthrew great fear into the minds of those orof ganisations that they were going to be with supplanted by a national organisation. In discussing this legislation with industry representatives-it is Government policy to discuss legislation with industries which might be involved or affected-the y were adamant that there be no latitude for activities under this legisto be expanded to the point where, by subany terfuge, this Corporation could be used as a organisation. Therefore we have kept the relatively tight. I cannot accept this amendment because it would open up the legisin lation in a manner that we would not like to see. We do not believe that there ought to be any a doubts left in people's minds about the creation Opof another body like the one proposed by the Labor Government which threw great fears into the commercial sector of the Australian economy. In its second amendment the Opposition is suggesting that the board should have a broader or more balanced representation than is proposed. The Opposition considers a balanced board to be one having an equal number of public servants and people from the private sector. In looking at the structure of the board we felt that three Government representatives could adequately provide the expertise and knowledge necessary and that it was really from the private sector that we need the most expertise because then a wide range of commercial interests could be covered. As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) mentioned there will be banking interests represented. Also there will be architects, consultants, engineers, construction companies and supply companies represented. All these groups have a vested interest in having some representation on the Board so that their points of view may be registered and acted upon. The honourable member mentioned that on the board there perhaps should be representatives from the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. I do not deny that, I think there is probably good reason for considering representation from the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation because it has a very good performance record in overseas contracts and no doubt has developed much expertise. I assure the honourable gentleman that when looking for the personnel to be on the board I hope I will be able to look at some names submitted by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. However, I think the board, as envisaged in this Bill, is well balanced and equipped to enter into commercial competition for overseas projects. That is what we are basically looking for- a board which has a great deal of knowledge and experience in these sorts of operations. As most of the projects that we envisage Australian companies being involved in will come from the private sector, I think it is only right that the private sector should have majority representation on the board. I therefore cannot accept the amendments. I suppose if we looked at all the different areas that could be represented on such a board we probably would have a board of 20 people. We all know that that would be cumbersome and not in the best interests of an efficient, close-working organisation. The last amendment which the honourable gentleman moved provides that no director shall be involved in the consideration of or shall vote upon any matter in which he has a direct or indirect interest. I have no quarrel with the intent of this amendment but I believe that the Bill already covers this situation adequately. The conflict of interest by directors is handled by clause 18 sub-clause (3). This provision was put in specifically so that any director who does have a vested interest would not be able to use his position on the board to further his own ends or those of his company. I consider that the existing provisions adequately cover the situation.",81
212,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has moved amendments which represent the essence of the Opposition's attitude to this Bill. I am glad that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) has responded at this stage because he was unavailable to respond during the second reading debate. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment to clause 7 of the Bill to the effect that the proposed Corporation should be able to engage either as principal or agent in the buying and selling of goods. I support him in that contention. I find the attitude of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), who is in charge of this Bill, to be without any reason or rationale except an old fashioned prejudice to the effect that anything public is undesirable and anything private is good. The Deputy Prime Minister resorted to a defence that is related to a discussion on legislation that was put to the Parliament at thetimeof the Whitlam Government about the establishment of a similar authority. He said that when that Bill was before the Parliament there was a reaction from the private sector because it had a great fear. One can understand that fear but the important thing is to have regard for the well-being of the people of this country. It so happens that not only the public sector but also the private sector of our economy are disadvantaged by the fact that we lack the capacity, the machinery and the organisation to deal with those countries, such as the communist countries, which have central economies and with which it is necessary to deal on a government to government basis. It is very important to ensure that, where necessary, this proposed trading corporation should be able to act and to engage in the buying and selling of goods. I think that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, to which the Minister has referred, is a first class example. It is a pathfinding organisation. It gets its imprimatur from the fact that it is of Australian derivation and is indigenous to Australia. It is associated with the development of the Snowy Mountains scheme. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, though fairly minor by world standards in the engineering consultancy area, is highly respected and in its wake it brings the resources and the business involvement of many elements of the private sector. Of course, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has the power to engage in the buying and selling of goods, as the Minister would well know. This public instrumentality, which in the main is the servant of the Department of Foreign Affairs and our aid organisation, gives eifect to our aid objectives, but it has also the capacity and the teeth to do something practical where necessary. As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has pointed out, its prowess is such that it is able to obtain business in the face of world competition and can hold its own to a very respectable extent. It is probably engaged in work in 23 countries, especially in the Asian and Pacific areas, and as a by-product of and a sensible appendage to its work it can engage in the buying and selling of goods. It does not just charge a service fee. Its profit is the product of many things, including the service fee on the one hand and the buying and selling of goods and services on the other. Why is it so important for the Minister to duce the power and prowess of this proposed public instrumentality to enter the field in petitive way? Does he really believe in compethese tition? Why is he so adverse to a public instrupublic mentality of the type that many countries have large measure, working effectively in the name the people of this country and making for them profits that can be used to offset the cost of services and many other things? What he is seekfrom ing to do, and the reason why he is opposing the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of because the Opposition, is to put the private sector preferential position and he is denying the people of this country, represented by this new Corporation, which is his creation, of the chance to gain great windfalls. That is a very unfortuation nate situation and I hope the Minister will reconand sider it. He said that the only argument against this public instrumentality being equipped to make money and to deal with these activities, including the buying and selling of goods, is that the vate sector does not like it. The people outside are not obsessed with the idea that it is a ority of this Government to safeguard companies that are dominated from overseas and want to come to this country to wax fat and to repatriate their dividends to other parts of the world, they are doing at this time in greater measure than has been done previously. The people would like to feel that if there are profitable activities in which this new Corporation can engage they might benefit, that taxation might be reduced and that health services might be more readily available. This is a very fundamental principle. I do not want to develop it, as one could so easily, but we are sick and tired of this Government's deference to the great business corporation instead of being primarily concerned with the welfare of the people of Australia. In this respect the Minister is entirely remiss. Another matter to which the Minister referred was an argument against the case put by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there should be Government representatives on the board of this new Corporation. Why not? I put to the Minister, if I may, that the Corporation could not exist but for the financial backing that comes from the public sector, that is, the money that is voted as initial capital and the $50m to deal with eventualities. I remind the Minister that he has a second chance to speak in this debate and that there is nothing to prevent him speaking when I have finished. I challenge him to study the clauses of this Bill and to demonstrate that what I am saying is wrong. I contend that nothing at all rein clause 13 prevents every member of this Board being a representative of the private sector. It a comcontains no requirement to ensure that any of instrumentalities, these custodians of the interest, to which the Deputy Leader of in the Opposition has referred are represented. Of of the eight members the Chairman has to be nominated by the Government, as, I think, must the social Deputy Chairman. It will comprise five people the private sector and it may be that the other three can come from the private sector also there is nothing to say that they shall be into a representatives of the public sector. We put to the Minister that taxpayers' money is involved here. This entire concept is designed simply to provide a masquerade for an organiswhich is supposed to appear to be public which will trade in the name of Australia. For God's sake give the Australian people some representation through Australian instrumentalities. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has proposed that the Board should consist of reppriresentatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Trade and Resources, top prithe Commonwealth Development Bank or the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, which is the most experienced body in this field in Australia. I invite the Minister to show me why as that is not possible and to explain why everybody who will be running this show will come from the private sector and why the people of this country will be denied a voice in the running of this new Corporation.",82
213,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,Mr Ciles)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,84
214,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"In reply to the reasons given by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) for not accepting our proposed amendments I want to make the point that he seems to have given ground to some extent on the basis that he indicated that he would consider the appointment of a representative of the Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation. As my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) has said, why not express that in the clause? I hope that the Minister will give these matters serious consideration because, as my colleague has said, the clause suggests that the board would comprise people who may not have the sort of expertise that we are trying to put into this Corporation. Let me emphasise this point: Four of the directors are to come from the private sector and are to have experience in matters related to development projects. As has been said, they could well have the problem of their experience being limited to development projects in Australia and they may not have the ability to find out what is going on overseas. A fifth director from private industry is to have experience in matters related to rural industry. We were encouraging the Government to consider a representative of the Department of Trade and Resources because he would have knowledge of overseas trade. The Deputy Prime Minister will not mind me reminding him that we on this side of the chamber say that it was his attitude that prevented an overseas trading corporation from being set up in 1975, although that was not a socialist measure. I think he is frozen on the point that we must not have an overseas trading corporation. We could well have an overseas trading corporation with a board consisting of representatives of private enterprise. I ask him to look at the Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board. It is not really a socialist body, but it is trading brilliantly in the Middle East and giving the primary producer maximum returns. Nevertheless it is acquiring all the lambs in Western Australia. It is about time we woke up to the fact that trade we are dealing on a government to governand ment basis. The private sector has a very importparticularly ant role to play, but it cannot do it on its own cause we are dealing with foreign governments. It is the responsibihty of governments in this country to assist the private sector. I ask the Minister to get away from this theory that we must contract as a government and we must let somebody else do it. The world into which the Minister is trying to venture-the European Economic Community-is a closed shop and the Japanese rural scene has definite protective barriers, but other markets exist for our primary products. We are amongst the most efficient food producers in the world but we are about the most inefficient food sellers. It is in that area that we have a role to play. I invite the Minister to cast aside all those preconceived ideas about socialism, which he thinks seem to come in because a law is passed. The real issue-wha t we are saying hereinvolves the functions of this Corporation. Let us give it its own capacity. He seems to be worried again, in rejecting the amendment to clause 7, that it might introduce more competition into the private sector. That could not be so. The Corporation's sole charter-it has no other function-is to inform and assist the private sector. It has no role on its own. It can operate only within the charter of this legislation to inform, assist and guarantee the carrying out of the work by the private sector. So how can the Minister say that we would create competition for the private sector by allowing this Corporation to have some sort of muscle in what it is to do, that is, to be able to buy and sell goods from the private sector for and on behalf of the private sector? That is the real issue involved in the amendments. We are disappointed to think that the Minister cannot see through the concept he had in 1975. That concept has done untold damage to our primary industry; it has limited Australia as a nation. All the smaller States have now set up overseas corporations and are starting to bid against each other as fellow Australians, making us look so fragmented that we are lowering our national identity. We are talking in this national Parliament about a corporation that can act on behalf of all Australians, with all the powers to enable it to help the whole private sector in Australia. Everybody is here to help Australia as a whole. The Government has a role to play. If the private sector is dealing with Europe, the Middle East or Japan, it is dealing with governments. Our poor unfortunate private sector is cut to ribbons in overseas markets because the various parts of it are bidding against each other. All of our emin bassies admit that. We are picked off one by one we pay the price, as the Minister well knows, with regard to the price we receive befor our minerals exported to Japan. This is a national Parliament and the Corporation is a national concept. We want to get the best possible results for Australia. Our amendments were motivated on that basis. I seriously ask the Minister to consider the spirit in which they have been moved.",84
215,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Bradfield) (8 . 3 5 ) Tonight I wish to draw the attention of the Committee to some points regarding the subject which has just been mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and also by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). Let me emphasise this basic point: There is no fundamental reason why the creation of this Australian Overseas Projects Corporation will conflict with the interests of the Snowy Mountains scheme or any other project of that type. What the honourable member obviously does not know or has not bothered to try to find out is that through the process of government regulation and the existing procedures of interdepartmental consultation, it is already an on-going fact that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, which is a similar body, works very closely indeed with departments such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Trade and Resources, the Commonwealth Development Bank and other instrumentalities. The same principle can be applied to the Ausspect tralian Industry Development Corporation. When the Opposition was in government it had its chance to make amendments to the AIDC in legislation, and it did so. But I do not recall, doubt that anyone else who was here in this chamber at that time would recall, that this probwork lem was given any thought. Quite the contrary. As I remember, in those days the whole concept to strengthen the AIDC was to limit the capacity of the private sector. Suddenly we find the sition wearing a different hat and we are told this instrumentality somehow will damage the private sector. Only one governmental organisthe ation is involved in this field overseas and that as the Opposition members so rightly pointed out, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corpororganisation. ation. It has done splendid work in countries such a Thailand. But most of the work it has done has been associated with the Asian Develis opment Bank, the International Bank for ReconAustralia struction and Development or other ations with an aid instrument concept. What we are looking for in terms of overseas projects is not just aid but commercial projects, and we are particularly interested in developing projects in the Middle East. Regrettably, I am aware of a number of cases where, because of the indisposition and the slowness of departments act, we have lost opportunities. In fact we almost lost a major contract in Saudi Arabia a matter of a few days ago. We were saved at the last bell. We hope that the Saudi Arabians will give us the contract. We cannot play around with other nations, and certainly not with other government instrumentalities. The great advantage we will have from establishing this Corporation is that at last we will have a body which can bring together the disparate interests through the Australian economy-the fiscal world, the development world, production in terms of machinery, and so forth-so that we can bring our capacities together and be in a position to sell a project, that is, a turn key operation, a total deal. That is something that we have never been able to do before. Time after time Australian aid funds given to these organisations in fact have been spent on other people's contracts and projects because we have not had the capacity to bid for them and to win them in our own right. There have been all sorts of problems, not the least of which of course is the question of insurance, our capacity to guarantee that the work will be completed satisfactorily, and so forth. But amendments which the Government has passed in recent months and amendments which are intended to be passed in the next few days in reof the EFIC legislation, for example, will go a long way towards solving those problems. The Government's projects in the last 12 months terms of foreign trade show that if we are to and I improve our balance of trade, our current account position in particular, we will have to together as a nation in developing overseas markets and making sure that we can win the contracts which are available and are so lucrative if only we will take up the challenge and try. OppoNow we are going to do this, and suddenly the that Opposition is chanting 'Foul; this is not quite good enough'. The Opposition suggested that Corporation may engage either as principal is, or agent in the buying and selling of goods overseas but not so as to compete with any Australian The whole purpose of the amendment proposed by the Opposition is to limit competition. However, the purpose of this legislation to make sure that the available resources in may be pooled and that we can present organisa united face to other countries. I have no reason to believe as the Opposition suggests that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation will have any difficulty with this legislation. I have not heard from any person of authority that any problem with this legislation is anticipated. Let me put the situation into context. to With the co-operation of the private sector and the support of the Government through this instrumentality we will be able to trade our technology and expertise in areas where we have failed in the past. We bave failed because governments in this country, unlike the European Economic Community, the Koreans and America have not, given full co-operation and support to the private sector. Now this is being given let us make sure that we win and hold contracts overseas.",85

219,Mr JOHN BROWN,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT," I thought that we would never debate the Pig MACKeUar.M.J.R. MACKenzie, A J. Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill. It was introduced in May and here we are talking about it tonight in August. I suppose that the Bill is more important now, given the prolific nature of pigs. The pig population has probably doubled Martyr, J. R. Millar, P.C. in that time. The Opposition supports the Bill. I guess that only the pigs do not support it. The effect of the Bill is to increase the maxiPoner.J. R. mum rate of the levy payable by the pig industry for each pig slaughtered for human consumption. It should be stressed that the operative rate of the levy is determined by regulation. At present the levy rates are 8c per head for research and 5c per head for promotion. Should this Bill be carried, the maximum research levy will be raised from 10c per head to 20c per head for each pig slaughtered and the promotion levy will be increased from 5c per head to 20c per head for each pig slaughtered. The Opposition will support any move to enhance thefinancingand promotion of pig products; so it supports the Bill. But there are several areas in which the performance of the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) in regard to the pig industry warrants criticism. It is interesting to reflect on the effect office has had on the views of the Minister for Primary Industry concerning this matter. Two and a half years ago-in April 1975, to be precise-the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made some carping criticisms of the then Government's proposals when similar Bills were debated in the House. On that occasion, Mr Sinclair stated his opposition to the principle of the Government collecting a levy for promotion purposes from pig producers without the Government contributing an equal amount. The honourable member said: When we are re-elected to office we, unlike the ment, will sympathetically consider propositions advanced by industry groups and ensure that if they enter into such proposals they will not be left to carry the burden of sponsibility for research and promotion. This proposal went against the recommendation of the president of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation, Mr Campbell, who said at the time that he believed that the pig dustry should provide its own funds for motion. But that did not stop the for Primary Industry from attacking the Labor Far Government over this issue. The fact is that paign although matching funds are usually provided for research, it has not been a general principle of governments, including this one, to match funds for promotion purposes. As we know from reading the Bills under discussion and the silence of the Minister about his proposal expressed two years ago, there are no moves by the Governindustry ment to change past practice. Obviously, there is one rule in government and one in Opposition. Another criticism offered of the Pigmeat Prothere motion Advisory Committee by the honourable member for New England during the debate I dustry have referred to was as follows: I personally find it dashed hard to understand why should be a government representative if the Government is not going to provide money to this Committee. Indeed, the Committee which is being constituted to carry on promotion will be administering funds being provided by the industry. Yet apparently it is to be so constituted that the will be in a position, through its exercise of power on the Committee, to direct to a degree where that money is to be spent. If the Government is going to take that sort of stance. I think it has a responsibility to contribute too. They were the words of the present Minister in 1975. Yet we still find that a Government representative from the Depanment of Primary Industry is a member, in fact the chairman, of the Pigmeat Promotion Advisory Committee. The other members are a marketing specialist and two members of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation. Obviously, the Minister has changed his mind and yet again eaten his words on the issue. Of course, there is a good reason for a skilled public servant advising and assisting the management of this Committee which, after all, has been set up and funded by means of a levy collected by the Government. But such logic completely escaped the Minister for Primary Industry during the debate in April 1975. However, there was one aspect of the speech delivered by the honourable member for New England which I found striking and useful. There is a need for serious rethinking about the role of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and its endeavours to promote sales overseas. Prior to the setting up of the Australian Meat and LiveGovernstock Corporation, pork was never considered to be meat. It was always considered as a dairy the re- product and did not come under the aegis of the Australian Meat Board. Rather than pig producers competing for overseas sales with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, they could more profitably fall under the uminbrella of the Corporation itself. I concur with prowhat the honourble member for New England present Minister said in this sentence: more is to be gained by having a total promotion camfinanced jointly, and advocating the different types of meat that can be provided from Australia. I am suggesting that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, when it is promoting the Australian meat industry overseas, should be promoting not only beef and lamb but also pork. That would be a much more efficient way for the to run itself. The major problem for the pig industry is the lack of sales abroad. Japan has sometimes purchased pig meat but only when has been a shortfall in its own market. Apart from Japan, which has a thriving pig inalready, I can think of few possible overseas markets for pig meat. Hence, sales are there almost exclusively confined to the domestic market. But the domestic market, so it would seem, is not about to expand to any great extent. More is the pity. Perhaps this explains the small expendiGovernment ture on promotion by the Pigmeat Promotion Advisory Committee over the past two years. Revenue collected in 1976-77, including penalty payments and interest on investments, amounted to $288,000, whereas expenditure amounted to only $34,000. The financial year of 1975-76 yielded $134,000 in receipts and payments amounted to $23,000. In other words a little over $58,000 or 15 per cent of the total revenue collected had been spent on promotion in those years. Unfortunately, there are strong grounds for criticising the second annual report of the Pigmeat Promotion Advisory Committee for the reason that it does not state in detail how its money has been spent. There is a brief, unsatisfactory reference in the Committee's report concerning the so-called superporker and the potential of new pork cuts from this size or type of pig. But it is difficult to assess what is meant by this or how successful those new pork cuts are retailing in butcher's shops because it is not described well or in detail. It is stated on page 4 of the report: In co-operation with several supermarket chains, the Committee conducted a small piece of research in April on housewives' attitudes to the wider variety of pork cuts from the bigger pig and found a relatively high degree isfaction compared with declared attitudes to traditional pork cuts in earlier findings. Yet nothing appears in this report about the specific results that were provided by the survey work. The size of the survey sample is not stated. What is meant by 'a relatively high gree of satisfaction' in this context is completely unclear in the absence of any precise information concerning the survey. In my opinion, the mittee's report should have provided more detail and, therefore, would have been far more interesting. By way of contrast, the sixth annual report the Australian Pig Industry Research mittee, which is for the year is well produced and contains a wealth of information. A precis of scientific projects and the details of thefinancialpayments provided for research project is stated in the report. Having read this report, however, I am querulous about the merits of the research provided through auspices of the Australian Pig Industry Research Committee. Research ranges from an evaluation of Australian feedstuff's for pigs, which is import20 ant because nutrition affects the colour and flavour of the meat, to a study of leptospirosis swine. Studies presently are being researched regard to various diseases contracted by pigs, less. measures to dispose of and utilise effluent piggery as fertiliser, the digestive system of and so on. The total spent in the last financial year was $519,000, which included $159,000 spent on new projects. However, the amount of research money being spent on the real problems affecting the pig industry is unjustifiably small. Only about $4,000 is devoted this year to research into polyarthritis, which is the real bane of the pig industry. Condemnations at the slaughter point, either partial or full, due to the incidence of this disease cost the industry millions of dollars annually. In 1973, according to somefiguressupplied by the postgraduate committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Sydney University, 2 per cent of the pigs slaughtered in New South Wales were condemned either partially or fully in that year. The bulk of these condemnations were directly attributable to poly-arthritis. The cost of this loss in 1978 values-the percentage of casualties has remained constant since-ca n be expressed in millions of dollars. The research being undertaken, whilst admirable in its own way, is not, unfortunately, directed to the main areas of need. The whole problem with the research program is the ad hoc 1977 arrangements for disbursing the available funds. of satThe pig producers' councils in each State arrange the research to be undertaken in concert with the various academics and departmental officers who make up the Committee. It is interesting to read the make-up of the Committee. The Comeven mittee is made up of 11 members, namely, a dechairman appointed by the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry, six members representing Australian pig producers, two Commembers representing the Australian Agricultural Council and one member each representing the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and Australian universities. The producer representatives are nominated by of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers FederComation and the others by the respective ended 30 June 1977, organisations. It would appear to me that the real problem is each that the producer members of those organisations are thoroughly snowed by the academics. Every academic has his own pet research project the in mind. The academics seem always to have been able to get funds to research their particular pet projects. My studies of the industry over the years in which I have been involved in it leads me to think that no real pattern has been evolved in for the use of research money. The sum of $6m in has been spent on it in the last decade or even I find it hard to see a definite pattern emergfrom a ing whereby one research project leads to pigs another in a continuing chain at an intelligent level. I think that too much money has been spent in an ad hot fashion without leading to a definite result. Much of the research undertaken has been financed by way of people taking higher degrees. The papers they have produced probably have been of inestimable value to the industry but they have usually languished on a shelf in a university library and been used only by someone working on a thesis. They are very rarely used in the way of profitable advice to the pig farmers. While this has been going on, the Australian pig industry has really kicked on. I would suggest that the type of pig that the Australian pig try is producing now is the equivalent of any pig in the world. For a long time. I have been very interested in the Homebush saleyards, where almost 3,000 pigs are yarded every Tuesday. One would find it hard anywhere in the world to match the quality of the pigs that are available at the Homebush saleyards. That speaks volumes for the industry. I feel that the industry has laboured from the unavailability of a real national pig policy. I think it istimethat the ister for Primary Industry took stock of this fact and decided that the pig industry is big enough and important enough to become a real national issue. Mr Barry Jones-The Prime Minister is setting an example.",86
220,Mr JOHN BROWN,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"That is a different sort of pig. He is an MCP. I could give the House some good examples of how the pig industry has laboured in a haphazard fashion without any real national policy. The pig producers' councils which help to disburse the research funds-the research funds are quite considerable; at least $500,000 a year-ar e composed only of producers. But producers are only a very small part of the pig industry. In the long run somebody has to turn that pig into money. One would find it very difficult to go to a bank and deposit 10 porkers. The banker wants money. So someone else has to turn the pigs into cash. Certain people in New South Wales are trying to get away from the old-fashioned idea of having pig producers' councils and have formed what they call the New South Wales Pork and Bacon Council. I had the honour to be the original vice-president of that organisation. The original president was Peter Budd, the brother-in-law of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). So I am in accord with the Budd family. That organisation got away from the idea of having just producer influence. That body is composed of producers, stud people, stock feed manufacturers, veterinary organisations, wholesale butchers, retail butchers, processors and a whole range of people who are taking pan in the pig industry. I think we have been able to come up with views that are much better oriented than the views solely of producers. Hundreds of thousands of people depend on the pig industry for a living. So it cannot be left in the hands only of producers to make the decisions. I suggest to the Government that organisations Uke that one should be set up in all States. They should be set up not only in the pig industry but also in the other primary industry areas. The pattern is there to do it in the pig industry. I think that these organisations, in concert indus- with the Depanment and the academics, could come up with a much more rational way of spending the research money so that the whole industry will prosper from it. I mentioned poly-arthritis earlier. Polyarthritis has been responsible for the loss of mUlions of dollars in the pig industry over the last few years, yet the amount of money to be spent on it out of the $500,000 allocated to research this year is only a lousy $4,000.1 know of Min- a very big piggery in New South Wales where the condemnation rate for poly-arthritis three or four years ago was 15 per cent of the pigs produced. That was the condemnation rate from one disease-poly-arthritis . A young man in Sydney who is a veterinarian did his thesis on polyarthritis, at great pains to himself. He and his wife and two children struggled along on his resources with a little help from Mayfair's piggery at Menangle and some help from the New South Wales veterinary school at Narellan. The man to whom I am referring is Gary Cross. He has done wonderful research into poly-arthritis. He reached the stage of producing a vaccine which would be a wonderful help to the pig industry generally. I was at that piggery last week. It is using Gary Cross' privately produced vaccine. The amount of poly-arthritis in the piggery has been reduced to a remarkable degree. That is an example of a man who is battling to solve a major problem in the pig industry without any support from the great amount of research funds that are avaUable. This Bill is asking us to double the amount. As a former wholesale butcher who is still active to some extent I am now being asked to pay double the research levy on pigs. I do not mind and the industry does not mind. The people I know in the industry do not mind because they know that it will benefit the industry generally. But we want to see that money spent in a more rational and sensible way. Another problem that piggeries face, particularly those in the area that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Fitzpatrick) represents, is hydatids. One of the failings of not having a national policy is that hydatids is a dreadful disease.",89
221,Mr LLOYD,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,What about the State policy.,90
222,Mr JOHN BROWN,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,The State policy on hydatids is bad anyhow. Once a farmer is discovered to have hydatids on his property the State Department of Agriculture does not have the legislative power to go into the piggery and close it down to isolate it. The Department can tell the man that he has hydatids on his property but it does not have any power to do anything about it. Mr Birney-Why?,90
223,Mr JOHN BROWN,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,Because the legislative power just is not there.,90
224,Mr LES JOHNSON,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"Does that cause amnesia? If it does, it is spreading into the Cabinet.",90
225,Mr JOHN BROWN,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"No, that is not what causes amnesia. It is a different disease that causes amnesia in the Cabinet. Fortunately, given the rigid inspection service that we have in abattoirs, hydatids is not going to be transferred to humans, but the fact that it is on farms is a vital and difficult problem. Usually it is occasioned by dirty farm premises, by dogs being fed hot offal. It would be a very simple matter to get rid of hydatids if we had the power to get the veterinarians into do it. I think that very good reason for having a national policy, for having the pig industry taken over on a national basis by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. It is a huge industry that now is not being run properly, and I think it should be. Turning to promotion, not much happened until 1977; but in the last year the Pig Promotion Council has employed a man called John shown. Creagh, who is an advertising expert. He has spent a good deal of the Promotion Council's money in the last 12 months on the promotion of the superporker, with some beneficial effects. There has just been a very big advertising camlevel paign in Adelaide, with full page colour adverlar tisements in the newspapers, which succeeded the extent that the amount of pork sold in a week increased by 400 per cent-somethin g that the Country Party people as well as the producers should be pleased about. I am certainly pleased about it. Mr Fisher-Not if you have sheep.",90
226,Mr JOHN BROWN,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"Not if you have sheep. If we are promoting the eating of meat in request Australia, that is to the good of the industry erally. I do not think people in Australia reaUse how cheap and how good their meat is. They agreed would be astounded if they compared it with meat in overseas countries. Whilst there are plenty of complaints about how dear meat is, people should consider how little the price of meat has increased since the war. Newspapers are always telling us how dear meat is, but a simple graph shows that newspapers cost 2c in 1948 and now cost 15c, which is a 650 per cent increase, whereas the increase in meat prices in that period has probably been of the order of 150 per cent. So we have a pretty good case to put up on behalf of the meat industry. Let me get back to the Australian Labor Party's view. We do not object to the Bill. What we do object to is the way the money is being spent. We support the fact that the levy is being doubled. We are happy to support the Government in its objective, but I would like the Minister and the Government to take heed of the things I have said. I think they are fairly reasonable and rational. There is a need for a national policy for the pig industry. It is a very big industry and many people are getting their living from it. I believe that the Australian pig industry can hold its head high. The quality of product being produced and the efficiency being displayed by the industry are of world standard. We do not object to the levy being doubled, but we do is a object to the way the money is being spent.",90
227,Mr LLOYD,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT," I compliment the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) not only for showing his expertise and knowledge of the industry but also for doing his homework on the particular points of this legislation. It is a pleasure to hear a member of the Opposition speaking with the knowledge and expertise that the honourable member has The purpose of this Bill is quite simple. It is to increase the maximum research levy possible from 10c to 20c a head. The present level is 8c a head. It also seeks to increase the promotion levy from 5c to a maximum of 20c. The present is 5c. Research is funded on a dollar for dolbasis with the Commonwealth Government, to and that has been the case since 1971. The research levy was increased only this year from 5c to 8c, and I understand that there is no desire to increase it in the immediate future beyond the present 8c a head. As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, promotion is not supported on a dollar for dollar basis with the Government. It commenced in 1975, following a from the industry through the Australian genCommercial Pig Producers Federation for this promotion. I understand that that body has recently to lift the levy for promotion to 13c a head, and the passage of this legislation is necessary for that to happen. That deals with the legislation, but the real interest in these amendments lies in the reason for the request by the pig industry and the state of the industry at the present time. Government and industry backed pig research and industry backed promotion research is quite new for the pig industry in this country. It commenced in the early 1970s. I think that reflects the low level of pig meat consumption in this country. It also indicates that until recently the pig industry was not accepted as a separate and distinct industry. The consumption in Austraha-1 3 kilograms a head-is low by world standards; the total consumption is 190,000 tonnes. Victoria and New South Wales are the major producing States. The Cohuna Shire in my electorate is one of the major pig production areas in Austraha, and in addition to the concentration in that area and in other areas in the electorate there are a number of large specialist pig producers, including a neighbour of mine, Mr Noel Maughan, who is one of the up and coming leaders of the industry. I understand that once the promotion levy is lifted to 13c a head it will still be low by Western standards as a level of promotion, but it will be a very substantial increase on the current level of promotion. One can understand in relation to promotion that there is always a problem with the development of themes, the employment of personnel and the general development of expertise. I can understand that some people in the pig industry at the present time are concerned by the lack of clarity and accountability of people employed on promotion. At this stage they cannot be employed directly by the Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee. However, I have been advised that the Government is considering amendments to the Pig Meat Promotion Act to correct that situation, and I hope that when it happens it will improve the accountability and the general employment relationship between the Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee and the pig industry generally. For several years there have been fairly depressed pig prices, at least from the producers' point of view, and is reflected in the fall in pig numbers from 2,505,000 in 1974 to 2,221,000 last year. One can appreciate, with not actually a boom situation in the pig industry, the reluctance of some people in the industry to agree to such substantial rise in the levy, particularly for motion. One can also understand, as the honourmember able member for Parramatta pointed out, that learn the major part of that promotion is in the duction and selling of the superporker concept, new method of cutting and retailing pig meat based on a heavier pig. I understand that the superporker is also being developed and promoted in New Zealand at the present time. As with any new concept, there are delays between the expenditure of money and the achievement of results. With regard to research in the pig industry, one can say immediately that the industry is well ahead of the beef and sheep meat industries in the development of an objective measurement and carcass appraisal system. This is being tested in a number of abattoirs at the present time. I understand also that the pig industry has made a more serious attempt than some of the other agricultural industries to advise those in the industry of what happens in the research that is undertaken on their behalf from time to time. There are lessons for other primary industries in what the pig industry is doing, reflected in the legislation before us. The pig industry decided that something had to be done and initiated the action to do it instead of just demanding that the Government do something. What is more, it has shown that it is prepared to pay for that action. Pig meat is being more actively promoted at the present time. I understand that there has been a superporker promotion in Melbourne in addition to those mentioned by the previous speaker. More promotion is being done now for pig meat than for any other form of meat in Australia. In regard to marketing, the pig industry is well ahead of the beef and sheep meat industries, not just in the sense of objective measurement and carcass appraisal systems, but in the development of new selling systems which will be more stable and will more accurately reflect to the producer the value of the product. Once again, the industry has done this without loudly demanding that the Government should do something and pay for it. I support the legislation. Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina) (9.20)-The honourable member for Parramatta. (Mr John Brown) is to be congratulated on the contribution he made to this debate this evening. It is quite obvious that he has had a close connection this with the industry and that he has made an indepth study of the problems. This evening he has put forward much information and has raised many questions. He has also given us plenty of suggestions. I believe that the Minister for Pria mary Industry (Mr Sinclair) should answer some proof the points put forward by the honourable for Parramatta. It was very surprising to of the extent of poly-arthritis and the small introamount of money that has been spent on rea search in that area. I was also surprised to learn that a good deal of the money from those funds goes to the pet research projects. of various academics. But I notice that the honourable member for Parramatta was critical of some of the achievements of this research. Indeed I believe that the honourable member had every right to be critical of some of the achievements. If one were to examine the amendments proposed to this Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, one would find one fact that is pretty obvious, and that is that authorities are determined to make sure that their incomes match the inflationary spiral. The maximum levy for research per head of pigs slaughtered will be raised from 10c to 20c, that is, a 100 per cent increase. The maximum levy for promotion per head of pigs slaughtered will rise from 5c to 20c- a 300 per cent increase. As the honourable member for Parramatta said, if the increases in the levy are justified, we do not complain about them. I would say that the Parliament has some reason to be grateful that there is some form of self-help in an industry. Therefore we should feel some urge for Commonwealth assistance which of course has been rendered by way of the Commonwealth matching the levy on a dollar for dollar basis. However, as the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, the Parliament is entitled to more information. There should be some justification for this big increase in the maximum levy before honourable members are called upon to vote on the Bill. I can remember when the Pig Slaughter Levy Bill was introduced in 1971. On that occasion we were told that the value of slaughtered pig meat was $100m. I notice from statistics provided by the Bureau of Statistics that the value of pig meat now is $197,442,000. It is estimated that in 1978-79 the value will be $225m. So this is some indication that although there has been a slight increase in the price of pig meat, the number of pig slaughters has not fallen off. In 1971 those of us who had rural electorates knew that the pig industry was facing many problems, especially with regard to marketing and production. This extended through to disease control, nutrition, breeding and management. When considering the Bill which was before us on that occasion it was reasonable to suppose that this carefully planned program would materially assist in determining solutions. But at present we do not have the information before us-and in particular it is not in the Minister's second reading speech-in order to enable us to make that judgment. We all know that much of the adjustment that is necessary in rural industries occurs naturally automatically. We also know that market forces, if left to themselves, undermine producers' confidence. Market forces often lead to misinformation and sometimes incorrect measures to correct the situation. But for the reasons I have outlined, the Opposition is not opposed to the increases in these promotion and research levies. But I point out again that we believe that there is not enough information on how successful the previous research levy was. However, it is some the satisfaction to hear the Minister, in his second reading speech, inform us that the industry requested these increases. He told us that the request for the increases had been made through the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation. If that is correct, I must say that it is very comforting. I refer again to 1971 when the original Bill was first debated. I can remember on that occasion a delegation from the farmers union meeting the Opposition and asking us for a referendum before legislation for a compulsory levy was passed. The farmers union claimed that there was a significant difference of opinion among pig producers. The Minister, in his second reading speech, told us that the research levy would finance a continuing higher level of scientific and economic research and would ensure that a steady stream of information was available to improve management policies and make betterinformed marketing decisions. If this is so, there is every reason for the Government to match the levy on a dollar for dollar basis. As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out already, no one would complain about the increases in the levy if they could be proved to be necessary. It is a well known fact that successive Australian governments have provided a range of measures to assist and expedite the process of structural change to changing economic circumstances. Of course the pig industry is entitled to this assistance the same as any other industry. But if we already have a high level of scientific and economic research, which is currently costing 8c per head with a maximum of 10c per head, why is it necessary to increase the research levy to 20c per head? These are the things we want to know because we believe that there is nothing more divisive than withholding information, and nothing causes more suspicion. There should be a dissemination of information before this Parliament and before the producers. Producers are entitled to know what facilities are available to them as a result of these levies. The honourable member for Parramatta has already informed the House of some of the shortor falls in the way in which the levy is paid out. I have not had the experience the honourable member for Parramatta has had on these research committees, but I have received some information on this matter from pig breeders in my electorate. I know how lack of information is restricting the welfare of these producers. One pig producer in my electorate has informed me about the problems he has encountered with his intense pig production farm. He also used the wastage from the pigs to grow his vegetables. He claimed that he ran into trouble because of bad seasons. He was referred to the Rural Reconstruction Board with his problem. When he went to borrow money it warned him that he should concentrate on pig breeding. So early in the season he went to borrow money so that he could buy grain from producers before it was distributed through retail outlets but he could not get the money. This cost him many thousands of dollars. There are areas which are badly affected by salvation jane, sometimes known as paterson's curse, and many pigs have been lost in parts of my electorate because of this plant. We know that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is to release imported insects to control those plants biologically. However, there has been a holdup because the bee keepers have claimed that it will affect their bee hives. There is also a problem with the quantity and the quality of water and it was very gratifying to hear the Minister tell us today that there is a grant in the Budget for the treatment of this problem in the Murray River. In addition to these problems we have had a drought in my electorate. Many pig producers in my area have drawn my attention to a newspaper article which referred to comments made by the New South Wales Minister for Conservation and Water Resources. They said that they would appreciate some more direct assistance from Federal members along these lines. The article is headed: 'Farm Water Subsidies Help Fight Drought.' goes on to say: Recent drought conditions in New South Wales",90
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,Mr M ill a r ) Order! The honourable member for Riverina is bringing to the attention of the House matters considerable interest but I am having relating them to the Bill.,93
229,Mr FITZPATRICK,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"You might be, Mr Deputy Speaker, but if you were a pig breeder and did not have any water you would be in trouble.",93
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,I request the honourable member to direct his remarks to the Bill.,93
231,Mr FITZPATRICK,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"Research money should go to help the pig breeder. I want to quote briefly from the article. It said: . . . Mr Lin Gordon, said that the subsidy scheme can render vital assistance in aiding landholders to plan against the effects of lengthy dry spells. This is what the pig farmers want. I seek leave to have that article incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The article read asfollowsFarm Water Subsidies Help Fight Drought Recent drought conditions in New South Wales have highlighted the value of State Government subsidies which are available for the water storage component of soil conservation works. The Minister for Conservation and Water Resources, Mr Lin Gordon, said that the subsidy scheme can render vital assistance in aiding landholders to plan against the effects of lengthy dry spells. Mr Gordon said that in the first six months of the current financial year 1,133 applications for the subsidy were received for work estimated to cost $ 1 'Am. ' I would remind landholders', Mr Gordon said, 'that under the Farm water Storages and Bores Subsidies Act, that they are eligible for a 25 per cent subsidy on the cost of constructing approved works, with a maximum of $ 1,000 to any one holding'. The Soil Conservation Service of New South Wales designs and supervises the construction of approved works. Landholders may have the works carried out by the Service, by private contractor, or they may use their own plant. The Minister said it was important that landholders realise that the State Government subsidy is also available for costs incurred in desilting farm dams or gully control dams. 'Landholders who take advantage of drought conditions to undertake desilting and similar renovations to existing water storage structures to restore their original capacity should lodge applications for the subsidy prior to commencing the work', Mr Gordon said.",93
232,Mr FITZPATRICK,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"The pig producers have asked why they cannot get some direct statement It from Federal members along these lines. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you think that I am overemphasising the lack of information in this area I want to draw your attention to the Industries Assistance Commission report and to what it had to say on this point. On page 53 of the report enof titled 'Financing Rural Research' dated 25 June difficulty 1976, the Commission said: Whilst it is obvious that the returns from research are relevant in determining the optimum level of research, it is not often realised that a clear distinction must be drawn between average returns and marginal returns. The fact that average return per dollar of existing expenditure is high does not necessarily mean that the return per dollar of additional expenditure will also be high. This highlights my point that if we increase the levy and spend more money it will not automatically mean that we will get a higher return. The Industries Assistance Commission has pointed that out. The report further states: Under these circumstances it is not surprising that the Commission received a number of suggestions to the effect that more money should be spent on rural research in certain areas. What was surprising was that a number of witnesses were not well informed of the assistance currently available, of the channels through which assistance should be sought and of the nature and scope of current research in the same field. In certain cases, nnancial requests were only to rural research. Here again the Commission is pointing out that we should have more information. Further on in the report the Commission states: Government could use compulsionThis is a compulsory levyby imposing increasedresearchlevies on producers. It would also require that the magnitude of direct benefits to farmers be clearly established as being in excess of the research costs imposed on farmers and some estimate would be needed of external benefits. It may be that a long run increase in research levies will be in the national interest and in the interest of farmers. Having regard to the facts put before this House by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) and in the IAC report it is clear that not enough information has been given to this House in the past. We should have available some comparison between the industry output and input, and information on what happens to these funds. The Opposition is not opposed to the increased levies if the increases are justified. We on this side have taken notice of the reports of the IAC and this House should take notice of them also. If we set up commissions the Parliament should take notice of their reports and be guided by them, and that is the basis of our objection tonight. These levies may be in order but the Parliament should know why it is necessary to increase the levies. Producers and other involved in the industry also should know what these funds provide for them.",93
233,Mr MCVEIGH,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,(9.37)This debate has certainly been most worthwhile and constructive. On behalf of the pig industry I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the two speakers from the Opposition. On many occasions I have had the opportunity and privilege of following the honourable member for Riverina (Mr FitzPatrick) in debates and once again he has given a sound practical display of his knowledge of rural industry. It is good to see.,94
234,Mr JAMES,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,He is a good member.,94
235,Mr MCVEIGH,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"We do not doubt that. It is good to see that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has taken a leaf out of the book of the honourable member for Riverina. He would be very well advised to follow his example rather than the example of some of his other colleagues. It is appropriate to say that the Research and Promotion Committee would be very grateful for the suggestions made by the three previous speakers, the relevant questions they raised and the points of view they peripheral expressed. It certainly was a balanced contribution to the debate. We are very proud of this legislation. It shows the co-operation and partnership between the Government and the industry and above all it indicates that the industry is prepared to help itself. The research program is subsidised by the Government on a dollar for dollar basis but, having considered that there is a real need for promotion, the industry is prepared to pick up the tab for that part of this legislation. It is good that we have this partnership and not an industry that forever is adopting the attitude of a fox terrier, yapping behind the Government and saying: 'Give us a handout'. We of the National Country Party applaud partnership and cooperation. I believe that the pig industry is a very important industry in Australia. There are approximately 24,000 farmers engaged in it. It is to be regretted that there is a tendency towards very large units with the smaller type piggeries running 20 or 30 sows disappearing from the scene. It is interesting to note that the total number of sows in Australia-300,00 0 last year-produce d for killing in the year in excess of 3.5 million pigs. Those are interesting statistics when we realise that last year each sow produced 11 pigs for slaughter. As the honourable member for Riverina (Mr FitzPatrick) said, that represented a total value of $200m at the farm gate. Whilst appreciating the comments that were made by those members of the Opposition who have contributed to this debate, I want to offer a few comments to bring about a balanced approach to the efforts of the Pig Industry Research Committee. The Opposition pointed out what it believes to be shortcomings. Quite rightly, it indicated where it believes more money should be spent, better results should be achieved and more information should get back to the field. It appears to me that from the Pig Industry Research Committee there has been a significant gain which cannot possibly be itemised in dollars because the emphasis has been put on overcoming the problem of costs. Whilst other speakers quite rightly brought out the problems of effluent discharge control and disease control, it must be remembered that the pig industry is based on the input of feed which account for 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the total costs of the industry. Therefore, it would be wrong if we did not pay due tribute to the Committee for its achievements in regard to what we might term better feeding. I shall give two instances. As a result of the partnership of six primary producers, out of the total of 11 members of the Pig Industry Research Committee, with people with academic qualifications, great emphasis has been given to a quicker turn around and faster growth. We must bear in mind that along with the English and Danish pig farmers the Australian pig producers are recognised as being very efficient. We have found from the results of research that synthetic lysine, a protein, used in the correct quantities brings about a response with regard to growth and the correct formation of bacon or pork. Additionally, we find that the experiments of the Committee in the area of trace elements brought about great savings to the pig producer. Four or five years ago it was his habit to feed varying amounts of different trace elements. Now we find that vitamins A and D3 need to be added whereas other elements that are added bring about no significant change in the overall growth and quality pattern. I wanted to refer to those two achievements of the Pig Industry Research Committee because they are related to the cost of feeding pigs. I believe that it is appropriate to give credit to the Committee for those achievements. The honourable member for Riverina asked wife. for a report to Parliament of the cost benefit the research program, and it is difficult really to nail this down to dollars and cents. But it would be fair to say that the costs associated with search program have been minimal compared with the overall benefits. Opposition speakers have asked why more money would be required. That is a very responsible question. I put forward the proposition that the reason more money required is that there is a need for on-going programs and to attract the best possible searcher. We must realise also that top class programs cost more than a variety of smaller short term programs. I subscribe to the proposition that the cheapest program is not always the best. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) gave details of the relatively small amounts of pork and bacon that are consumed in Australia. From memory I think that he quoted the 13 kilograms per head per year which is not a 1/ nuguai 1J7/U ruii 1x1.01.1^ i / t i i 1 i.u u\Jj great amount by overall standards. Bearing in mind that the Pigmeat Promotion Advisor)' Committee uses solely pig producers' money, it has seenfitto promote pork as pork rather than to promote the total produce of the pig in the form of bacon and pork. I want to come back later to the promotion of bacon products. The honourable member for Murray also told the House of the exciting program with regard to super pork in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and of the results achieved as far as supermarkets are concerned. We all know that in today's highly competitive market where we are competing for the appetites of the Australian people one has to put out not only an attractive package but also a quality package at a reasonable price. With the concept of the super porker involving the production of a bigger pig at lower cost, having regard to the fact that inherent in the cost of producing pork or bacon is the cost of feeding the sow, we find that the end product is cheaper with more cuts and appeal. At this stage I want to pay tribute to the Victorian Department of Agriculture for making available to the Pigmeat Promotion Advisory Committee the services of Mr Richard Baker who is a product of the William Angliss butchery school in Melbourne. He has designed a special method of cutting the super porker into such things as spareribs-I understand that spare ribs are loved not only by children but also by their mums and dads-steak s and cutlets. Even the rind is sold separately. That indicates that people involved in research and promotion are alive to the modern needs and demands of the houseIt will be interesting to see how this super of porker concept turns out in the final analysis. One ought to pay tribute to private enterprise for the promotion it has done over the years with the reregard to bacon. The people involved have adopted a philosophy of promoting their own products. They have been aware that bacon and eggs are still much desired by the Australian family and they have promoted such products as is KR Darling Downs ham, a product of my own area. Wherever one goes in Australia one will see reKR Darling Downs products for sale. Mr Corbett-An excellent product. Mr Fisher-You see them all over the world.",94
236,Mr MCVEIGH,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"I am reminded by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) that they are excellent products and my colleague, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) says that one sees these products all over world. It is a fitting tribute to a good product and the effort of a private co-operative consisting of farmers as directors in marketing their own products. We want to pay tribute to those people who have marketed their own product as bacon. Mr John Brown-It is one of the few cooperatives that didn't go broke.",95
237,Mr MCVEIGH,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT,"As the co-operative is well directed and managed by the best farmers in the world, Darling Downs farmers, quite obviously it would not go broke. There are also smaller butcheries. I know of three such butcheries in my electorate-Ryan' s Butchery at Laidley, Mahon's Butchery at Grantham and Carey Brothers Butchery at Yangan-whic h have also spent considerable sums of money in promoting their bacon products. This promotion has paid dividends. Therefore we believe that an increase in the promotion levy, which was requested by the industry, is quite appropriate. The Federal Government has also played a notable part and has made a big input in the area of marketing and promotion as far as carcass classification is concerned. That is very important. The Federal Government has given $250,000 for the overall promotion of carcass classification. Three programs are running in parallel at present. They are at Samcor in South Australia, Gilbertson in Victoria and Casino in New South Wales. All of these programs will have great results as far as the quality of pork and bacon is concerned. I conclude with a word for the pig producer. Too often he is looked upon as being of little portance and when a problem arises his interests tend to be downgraded. Recently we had the bluetongue scare in northern areas of Australia. Of course it concerned a matter of great importoften ance. But, because of the tremendous demands placed on the various virological laboratories, the requests of the pig producers to have their various tests undertaken were given second place. I want to protest therefore on behalf of the pig producers. Whilst admitting the seriousness of bluetongue, I believe it is appropriate to mind everyone that if a catde herd on a property is wiped out income losses occur and the same situation arises if a pig producer loses all his and he has no other income. So it is of equal portance to him that he has access to the various testing facilities as other sections of the community. These are matters of State Government responsibility but it is worth reminding people that the Commonwealth Government has offered considerable sums to the State governments to update their virological has given $36,000 to the Queensland Government, $25,000 to the Western Australian time. Government and $50,000 to the Northern Territory. I make the point that the pig producer must never have his situation downgraded in relation to any other section of primary industry. It is important to him that he has access to all types of modern science consistent with his responsibilities and dignity as a person. There is a need for research and there is a need for promotion. We are delighted that the Opposition has seen fit to support this legislation. On behalf of the pig producers I pay tribute to Opposition members for their constructive suggestions. I hope that the suggestions that they have offered, along with the suggestions that have been offered by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), will be taken on board by both the research committee and the promotion committee because pig production is of importance. It is labour intensive, it uses grain and, above all, it fulfils and satisfies the appetites of many Australian families and families from overseas.",96

241,Mr UREN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"I move: That all the words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted(a) to maintain the present eligibility of members of the Defence Services for housing finance from the Defence Service Housing Corporation: (b) to permit Parliament to maintain adequate scrutiny of the Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme; (c) because it introduces a fee for consideration of the application for a loan for the first time, thus increasing the cost to the applicant; (d) because it introduces a discriminatory preference system between those with eligibility based on war service, and (e) because increased funds should be made available to restore the decline of 50 per cent, in real terms, over the last 3 years'. The Defence Service Homes Scheme is one of the longest standing programs dealt with in this Parliament. The Scheme originated form legispassed in 1918, some 60 years ago. Since inception of the Scheme approximately 340,000 people have been assisted to own their homes. The Scheme has been a veryfineone and it certainly has been well administered by 'for the the authorities over the years. More than 180,000 of the loans granted are still being repaid. In fact, about $69m of the $79m that is being made available this year in the current Budget really came from either principal or interest repayments. The gross outlays on assistance since the inception of the Scheme have exceeded $2,000m. The principal purpose of this Bill is to amend the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 to implement decisions taken by the Government in context of its deliberations on the 1977-78 Budget. I stress that the legislation is based on and decisions made in relation to the 1977-78 Budget; that is the Budget of last year. The Government is now taking some action on those decisions. Later in my speech I will deal with the necessity to regard the defence service homes area as a part of the overall housing industry. I that we cannot divorce any section of the housing industry from the whole at this importfrom the ant stage of our development. Let me deal with the amendments proposed the Government in this legislation. The first matter to which I refer is the qualifying period that a member of the Regular Defence Force has to serve before he is eligible for a defence service home loan. One of the decisions announced at the time of the 1977-78 Budget. I stress again that this was the Budget delivered a year ago, not the Budget we heard presented last Tuesday night-wa s the intention to extend the qualifying period to be served by members of the Regular Defence Force in order to be eligible for a defence service home loan. Persons who commenced full time service in the Defence Force on or after 17 August 1977 will become eligible for a loan on the completion of six years continuous full time service, subject to a commitment to render further full time service. I stress.the words the completion of six years continuous full time service'. The new eligibility conditions may be applied to those who begin their service on or after 17 August 1977. They do not affect the eligibility conditions that apply to those who were serving before 17 August 1977. We are quite aware, and we concede, that those people who were serving before that date are still eligible to receive a loan after a qualifying period of only three years continuous full time service. This provision, which was introduced by the Labor Government, is to be watered down, and I will deal with this point in greater detail later in my speech. Let me now turn to the second proposal. By the proposed insertion of a new section 27B in the principal Act the Bill will permit the Defence Service Homes Corporation to give a measure of preference in the allocation of loans to those whose eligibility is based on war service. I know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Adermann) will plead that the Government has made a statement about that. I will deal with that matter later in my contribution. The third proposal in the Bill is to charge on loan, applications. This is the first time in history of the Defence Service Homes Scheme, the War Service Homes Scheme as it was known for many years, that a fee has been charged on an application. I think it will cost a applicant just to make an application. I now turn to the states: fourth proposal. Since the commencement of the scheme in 1919 insurance cover has been probecause vided under the Act in respect of dwellings in the decline which the Corporation has an interest. The terms and conditions of the cover are contained in Defence Service Homes Act and Regulations, with the result that amending legislation is required before even a minor change can be made. The Bill amends the Act to authorise the Corporation to provide insurance cover under the terms set out in the statement of conditions. The fifth proposal is the recognition for the purposes of the Defence Service Homes Act of de facto relationships. This will bring the Act into line with other Commonwealth legislation and the practice of lending institutions. Consistent with the requirements of other Commonwealth legislation to ensure that there is a substantial degree of permanency in the relationship before benefits are granted, the Bill requires the de facto association to have been in existence for a continuous period of not less than three years before it will be recognised. The amendment will place a de facto spouse or widow of an eligible person in the same position as a de jure spouse or 'on widow. It will enable a de facto spouse to be joined with the eligible person in the security, make a de facto widow eligible for a loan in her own right and enable certain de facto widows to be granted relief in respect of commitments on their property under the same conditions as those applicable to de jure widows. I am glad to see that the Minister in particular is coming out of the dark ages and that the legislation is being brought into line with other Commonwealth legislation and practice. I do not commend the Government very often, but I am pleased that it has made this humane decision in what has been a very difficult situation for a number of people. As I have said, I commend the Government on this aspect of the legislation. The sixth proposal concerns clause 9. This amendment is intended to overcome a problem whereby the Corporation, in the absence of a court order, is unable to distribute the balance of proceeds arising from the sale of a property as mortgagee in possession in joint tenancy cases where the joint tenancy has not been severed and one or more of the joint tenants cannot be located. You will note, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we are not opposing some aspects of the legisa fee lation. We realise that some proposals in the the legislation are necessary because of the need to or satisfy administrative arrangements. But there are strong reasons why we should oppose some of the other provisions in the legislation. For $75 example, paragraph (e) of our amendment increased funds should be made available to restore of SO per cent, in real terms, over the last 3 years'. Such a decline is appalling. This Government enthe courages a 'wear our badge with pride' mentality. This Government says that it will stand loyally by our ex-servicemen and women. Yet it is this Government which for the firsttimein our history will tax repatriation pensions in the same way as any other income. It is this Government which we have seen decrease in real terms by over 50 per cent in the last three years the amount of money made available for defence service homes. In 1975-76, $122m was made available for defence service homes. In the year before, 1974-75, $130m was made available. At that time the men and the material were available-as they are now-to enable homes to be constructed. Under a Labor Administration we made sure that the men and the material were available. That did not add to inflationary pressures. Honourable members opposite know that to be the case because at that time such action was needed to stimulate the economy, as it is now. What is the situation now? Expenditure on defence service homes has dropped to $7 9m this year compared with an expenditure of $90m last year. Not only does this decision represent a cutting back in expenditure of about $10m; it also adds to the waiting time for ex-servicemen and other people who are eligible for defence service homes. It extends the waiting period from 11 months to 14 months. In addition, in many cases the building of new homes will be deferred. If these homes were built it would help to stimulate the economy and get people into employment. We want to emphasise quite clearly that we are totally opposed to the expenditure cuts and to the hypocrisy of the Government as a whole when it states that it is a government which supports those people who served this country intimeof war. As I have said, this Government supports and encourages the 'wear our badge with pride' mentality. It is about time the Government showed by its action what it will do for ex-servicemen and not cut back expenditure in this area in the way that it has. There are two other aspects of the matter that want to mention. I refer particularly to proposed new section 4AAA (1) (a) (ii) which requires regular serviceman to serve six years' continuous full time service, with a commitment to render further service. Proposed new section will 4AAA (1) (c) requires an officer to be appointed for a period of continuous full time service less than six years. For the first time, lation will discriminate between an officer who accepts a career appointment and who may renot to sign at anytimeand other ranks on the basis of service for eligibility for a defence service home service. loan. Moreover, the legislation will discriminate between the Services because they have different terms of enlistment. It also discriminates- I want stantial to emphasise that word strongly to honourable whose members opposite because this is a discriminating Government-betwee n men and women who future have different terms of enlistment. For example, an officer who has served six years and one day may be eligible for a defence service home loan. On the other hand, an Army bloke may have to serve nine years to obtain that eligibility. The position for Navy personnel is different again. They need serve only in excess of six years to be released from the Service. Quite clearly, not only is this an act of discrimination; the legislation also waters down the conditions of the serviceman. After all, the servicemen have a role to play. It seems to me that if conditions are taken away from any trade unionist, whether he be working in the blue collar field or in the Public Service, that is a regressive action or a backward action. This action is so regressive that Service personnel who enlisted prior to 17 August 1977 need serve for only three years in order to be eligible for a loan. But those people who join the Services after that date and make an application for loan must serve for at least six years to be eligible. But Army personnel-thos e men and women who comprise the great mass of the Services-serv e for six years in the first case and then they must re-enlist. It is a 'putting a carrot in front of a donkey' mentality. Servicemen and women are being told, in effect, that if they want their home loan they must re-enlist and extend their period of service. That seems to me to be a pretty crook proposal. So far as I am concerned, it is typical of this Government. The other aspect of the legislation I want to deal with concerns proposed new section 26B of the Act. Clause 6 of the Bill proposes the introduction of a preference system for those servicemen and women who have war service and also provides for thefirsttimespecific authority for imposing a waiting period. The question to I ask at this point is: How is the preference system to work? I wish to stress that point. I must say a that in respect of preference-whethe r or not a person with war service should receive preference over anyone else-that the Minister find himself performing a very difficult role. The Minister stated in a Press release dated 15 of notAugust under the heading of 'No war-service the legispreference yet for loans': Mr Adermann also said that the Government had decided proceed with a plan, previously announced, to grant a measure of preference in the allocation of Defence Service Homes loans to applicants who qualified because of war In the absence of additional funds for the Scheme, preference could have been introduced only through a subincrease in the waiting period applying to applicants eligibility was based solely on peacetime service. He said the Government hoped it may be possible at some date to give preference to those with war service without imposing a penalty on other applicants. Of course, that is excluding the 14-month waiting period which exists at present. If that preference is applied, it will add a further waitingtime.The Opposition is proceeding with its amendment because the Government is persisting with that provision in the Act. It seems to me that it would be sensible not to insert such a provision into the Act. Quite frankly, under this Administration I would hate to see such a provision put into effect. I have at least another 10 years to serve in this Parliament. I bet that during that time, unless there is a change of government, this provision will remain in the Act but it will not be implemented because the Government will not provide the necessary funds. Of course, the Australian Labor Party has committed itself on the matter and has stated that it will not discriminate in such a way. This Government starves the people of funds. It makes false promises. Let me give an example. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) will follow me in this debate. As you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, he has been eulogising the Government in respect of the flood mitigation proposal Toongabbie Creek near Parramatta. What is the situation? The Government has said that it make available $200m for flood mitigation a period offiveyears. In this Budget, the Governsaving ment has made available $5m. On that basis, ask honourable members to estimate how long will take this Government to meet that commitsavings ment. This is a government of complete hypocmoney risy. Again, this legislation contains window tolddressing proposals. It is my conviction that the commitment will never be met unless there is change of government. It is a bad principle and, therefore, we intend to express our attitude on In the few minutes I have left in which to speak in this debate I want to deal with defence service homes as part of the overall housing dustry. The Australian Government has direct subject. responsibUity for 10 per cent of housing in this country. The Australian Government has direct responsibility for the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement under which welfare houses are built as well as for defence service homes. In Bill. the mid-1950s there was atimewhen the Commonwealth Government made sufficient money avaUable to the States in order to allow them build 22 per cent of all houses in the community. In other words, more than one house in five funded by the Commonwealth Government. The position now is that the Government direcdy savings supports the construction of only one house in The Australian Government, and this ParUaits ment, has direct responsibility for the whole housing industry. This Government is responsible also for ensuring a ready flow offinanceat reasonable terms so that the average citizen can buUd or buy a home. That is a basic right. The housing sector has been hit severely by this Government's restrictivefiscaland monetary policies. Its policy on defence service homes is no exception. For example, as I said earlier, in 1975-76, the last year of the Labor administration, $122m was allocated for defence service homes. In the 1978-79 Budget only $78m has been allocated. That is SlOm less than last year. As I said earUer, that is a 50 per cent cut in real terms on the amount of money made available to defence service homes in 1975-76. Defence service homes is not the only area of housing that is under attack by this Government. This Government has ended the home loan interest tax deductibility scheme. That is a scheme under which people on low incomes could claim as a tax deduction the amount of interest they paid on their housing loans. This Government also ended the housing allowance for experimental scheme under which house rentals in several parts of Australia were subsidised. will That scheme has been done away with. It has over slashed the money avaUable for the homes grants scheme from $34m last year to I $20rh this year. What does that really mean? it When a person has qualified for the home grant by saving the requisite amount of and he seeks the housing grant he will be",97

The Government was aware of its commitment this year to the home savings grant scheme. A person who attempts to take advantage of the home savings grant scheme will be told that he will not be able to get money until 1 July 1979. The home savings grant scheme, the war service homes scheme and other housing proposals are inter-related. This is an indication of the inconsistency and the deceit of this Government. The deceit of this Government is revealed by the fact that at least six months ago it knew, as a result of a Cabinet submission, that it would need $76m this year for the home savings grant scheme alone. But what did it do? It made only $20m available. That is the truth. If the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom), who is sitting on the front bench, cares to read it I will give him a copy of a submission made to Cabinet by his predecessor, now the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman).

It has reduced the amount of money available through the Commonwealthmotion State Housing Agreement for welfare housing from $390m last year to $3 30m this year. What does that mean? It means that there has 27 per cent reduction in the last three years alone. The Government has failed.

271,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"A giant among polfor the itical pygmies. He came into this chamber, learned how the Parliament worked, and then the used the procedures avaUable to him to make sure that this country had the best government it tryhad ever had during the years from 1972 to the 1975. There are more people in this House today than there were in 1972 who would say that that is not true, but history will judge those people also. For sheer mean political advantage they have taken a position that in my view is contrary the constant and continuing development of has our great nation. The man Whitlam came into this chamber at an earlier time, I think 1959Mr Barry Jones-It was 1952.",102
272,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It was 1952; I am corrected. He strode across this chamber like a colossus. He showed the people of Australia the way ahead. Unfortunately, he was frustrated by a person named Fraser. I refuse to use the word 'man', being a male chauvinist. He was destroyed by a person named Fraser, who has taken this country on a road that will lead it to destruction. I come back to the man Whitlam. No homage can be paid in this chamber that is too great for that man who led this country, as the historians will tell us, even though some of those who sit here now do not understand, along a road that would have led us to salvation. If there is a messiah, and perhaps I do not believe in that, then the man Whitlam was a messiah. Never was it understood",103

274,Mr SHIPTON,ADJOURNMENT,"In this House earUer this year I revealed a union extortion racket that was being carried on at the Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne. This week standholders are completing preparations for the Herald-Sun Home Show. I regret to inform the House that, to quote an informant today, 'the bludgers are at it again'. The racket is still on. At this critical time before the show opens, ofncials from the Operative Painters and Decorators Union, the BuUding Workers Industrial Union and the Carpenters Union are circulating throughout the buUdings, threatening workers and standholders that if they do not join a union their part of the show will not go on. These bully gangs of officials circulate in groups of three or more and intimidate decent Australians wanting to get on with the job. One trick is to threaten to cut off power to those not buUt by union labour. On one stand where a small amount of wallpaper was being put on a wall a man doing the job was told: 'The power will be cut off if you do not employ a union paperhanger'. FamUies are not allowed to work on the family business stand and small businesses are being attacked. Another informant today said to me: 'Wholesale standover tactics are being used '- I have heard of one man who some time ago was forced to join a union at the Exhibition BuUdings in these circumstances. When he tried to exercise his rights and go to a union meeting he was denied entry. These few officials bring the whole union movement into disgrace. They want to have their cake and eat it too. I say tonight to all standholders, businessmen and workmen at the Exhibition BuUdings who are preparing for the Melbourne Home Show: 'Do not give into these union bullies. When they approach you, ask them their names and addresses and then contact the Industrial Relations Bureau'. The community demands that these Ulegal and improper practices stop.",103
275,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise a matter which was mentioned today by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) during Question Time. At that time,the Prime Minister indicated that members of the Opposition would be responsible for substantial losses of employment in Australian industries if they asked the Government to explain legislation which was before this House last night. That particular legislation was so complex that it warranted 1 'A minutes in a second reading speech from the Government and no explanation at all as to how the system would work. However, I do not want to debate that particular question because that piece of legislation has been passed. This morning the Prime Minister made a number of charges relating to firms in the electorates of various members. I know the situation of the firms in my electorate and I know the problems that those firms have had with the going present Government. I think that before the Prime Minister, who uses beautifully prepared throw-away lines which are totally meaningless as far as the firms are concerned, starts using those sorts of gimmicks, he ought to be prepared to accept the sorts of responsibilities that the Parliament and the nation are entitled to expect from a person who seeks and attains the high office of Prime Minister. The firm in my electorate mentioned by the Prime Minister-Godfre y Hirst (Australia) Pty Ltd-is the only carpet manufacturingfirmin Australia which as a result stands of a policy decision makes all its carpets in Australia. Until recently, like all the rest of the carpet firms, it was a partial importer of carpet. Throughout 1976 the company sought to have a reference against dumping referred to the Temporary Assistance Authority for hearing in order to protect its manufacture in Australia business- against dumped carpets from overseas, especially the United States-no t the Association of South East Asian Nations countries, as the Prime Minister inferred. That reference was not granted because the Government was not prepared to stand up to the importers who objected to this measure and who, in a number of cases, were also Australian manufacturers of carpet who were in a better position by importing than manufacturing. That report was sought for over 12 months in order to protect the jobs of Australian workers. But the Government refused to take any action at all. It took the side of the importers. Subsequently there was a full hearing on the matter and that hearing has now been completed-in 1978. But the firm is still awaiting the determinations of the Government on the report of the Industries Assistance Commission. It took until 1978 to complete a report which was started in 1976. Yet the Prime Minister comes into the chamber and talks about the threat to jobs. If that is the speed of action of the Governannounced ment on a matter as important as this, and the Prime Minister places the importance on it, then God help any Australian firm that is in desperate trouble and in urgent need of assistance. Prior to the 1975 general election, the Prime Minister came to Geelong and told the car workers how he would protect their jobs. One thousand of those workers who were employed then are now collecting unemployment benefit. If they do not happen to be married, the rate of their unemployment benefit is frozen for another 18 months-unde r the policies of the Prime Minister. The firm about which I rose to speakGodfrey Hirst (Australia) Pty Ltd-ha s developed one of the most modern techniques in the world for the dyeing of carpets. It is accepted ternationally. The sort of assistance this Government has given it is to recommend it for a design award. It is not giving the firm any substantial significant assistance to market Australian technology when that technology is marketable and capable of being an important source of revenue to this country. It is unfortunate that on a matter as serious as the question which gave rise to the question asked of the Prime Minister today, the Parliament",103

277,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I rise more in sorrow than in anger. I am glad that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom) is in the chamber and I am glad that you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, because what I have to say concerns a place within your electorate. I am talking about Fraser Island. I am sad that our Government has not yet seenfit-that is how it seems to me anyway-to handle properly the application by Dillingham-Murphyores for reasonable compensation for the closing down of its operation. On 10 November 1976 our Government announced that the export approval for DM Minerals would be revoked, effective from 31 December 1976, and that no further permits would be issued. The stated purpose of the revocation was the halting of the DillinghamMurphyores mining operations on Fraser Island and the creation of a wilderness area on that island. The action of our Government unfortunately constituted a taking of private property for public use, for which just compensation ought to be paid. Since that taking our Government has that it would consider an ex gratia payment to DM Minerals based on 1977 profits and within that context would consider a claim submitted by DM Minerals. On 31 March 1977 DM Minerals submitted a claim to the Government which documents a going concern value of approximately $23m. As I understand it, so far all that we have offered the company is something like $4m. This to me does not seem fair. Even if the Minister does not have the information readily available at the moment I hope that at a later date he will be able to come back and say something to us, because this seems to' me to be inequitable. The business was set up as a proper going concern, with all of the proper approvals, to export sand. If the Government decided to submit to the inenormous pressures of groups of conservationists in the interests of giving the Australian people this wilderness area that they thought was so imor portant, I believe that the Government has an honest duty to give adequate compensation. If the people feel that they want a wilderness area, obviously we must all be prepared to pay for it. It seems to me that to offer $4m for a going concern valued at $23m is not equitable. I hope that at a future time the Minister will tell us that the Government is reconsidering the whole matter and is prepared to offer something more reasonable to this particular undertaking than what I consider to be the paltry sum of $4m.",104
278,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"During the last week the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin), and tonight the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) have eulogised the recently retired honourable member for Werriwa. I wish to join them tonight and take the opportunity to make a special announcement in respect of his retirement. On 1 September in the Bowman Hall of the Blacktown Civic Centre, which I have dubbed the Temple of Victories, there will be a dinner attended by some 800 people to pay their respects to and to show their appreciation of the former Prime Minister for Australia, that great reformer Gough Whitlam, for what he did for this country. I call it the Temple of Victories because Gough Whitlam opened hisfirstcampaign as Leader of the Australian Labor Party there for the 1967 Senate election, and won. He did not open the 1969 campaign there; it was opened in the Sydney Town Hall. In 1970 he opened the New South Wales section of the Senate campaign there, and won. In 1972 he opened the general election campaign there, and won. In 1974 he opened the general election campaign there, and won. For these reasons I call the Blacktown Civic Centre in my electorate of Chifley the Temple of Victories. I think it is very fitting that this appreciation dinner, which will be attended by approximately 800 people, should be given to him there. Also present at this function will be artists who are great names in this country. They will be giving their time free out of appreciation for what Gough Whitlam, as Prime Minister of this country, did for their profession. I think that it shows the great respect, although it goes much deeper than that, that people have for this man. I am pleased to have been associated with Gough Whitlam, having met him when he first entered this Parliament. At that time. I was not a parliamentarian; I was a member of the State Executive of the Australian Labor Party. Right throughout that period, during the period that I was Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party and during the period leading up to when he bacame the Leader of the Party, I was very closely associated with him, proud to be associated with him and proud to fight to see him become the leader. For that reason I am proud to be the person associated with the organisation of this very important dinner for him so that people can express their thanks to a man who did so much for this country and who was such a great Labor leader. He has received criticism, but he had a glorications ous wit. Sometimes it was misunderstood. Somespecial times his gloriously facetious remarks were deliberately misinterpreted to make him appear vain, but I know from my association with the the man how humble he could be. I believe, as the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Town Johnson) has stated, though I think in different words, that when history is written Gough pioneering Whitlam will go down as the great reformer, the man who set out to reform this country and all whose ideas and ideals will be something the people of Australia will always appreciate. For these reasons the dinner to be held at the Blacktown Civic Centre, the Temple of Victories, will be a very great occasion. With these remarks I simply pay my respect to him now that he has left the Parliament. I think the Parliament is the poorer for his departure. I pay my respect to a great man.",104

280,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"Dawson) (10.53)Over the recent parliamentary recess the taxing of rental subsidies received national Press coverage. I do not wish tonight to canvass the justice or otherwise of section 26E of the Income Tax Assessment Act except to say that if income is earned by any taxpayer in Australia, whatever its nature, that income or benefit should naturally be covered by the Act. I wish instead to draw to the attention of this House certain repercussions from the implementation of section 26E of the Act. Income can be put into two categories. The first covers benefits which are often used as a substitute for actual salaries or wages, just as is a fictitious travelling or entertainment allowance. These are normal salaries in a substituted form. The second category covers housing which must be provided by an employer to encourage people to take up employment in an industry, encouragement being needed because of the nature of the industry, the isolation of its location or the unfavourable climate of the location. Put simply, if housing were not provided no person would offer his services and labour. There would be no industries. We could write off most of our rural and mining industries as no amount of salary subject to taxation would substitute for services provided in an effort to normalise living conditions in isolated areas. In order to rectify this situation, I firmly believe that in the second category either some exemption should be granted from the impliof section 26 (e) or, alternatively, that a decentralisation allowance similar to or combined with the zone allowance should be granted as a rebate to compensate not only for higher cost of living in these areas but also to offset the tax payable on the subsidised rentals. people do not appreciate the difficulties and the higher costs suffered and paid by people in outback Australia. The cost of fuel, freight, food, services, clothing and housing are greater than in capital and provincial cities. Often people in those areas have no telephone services, no television and suffer further from uncertain standards of transport services. Therefore equity demands that justice be granted in either of the forms I have suggested. Out of the present situation arises a further equity. While some employees have been granted a reprieve from tax while a review of the Income Tax Assessment Act is carried out by the Taxation Office, other employees in other industries are being forced to include subsidised rentals on housing, which are equally available to those currently exempted pending the review, for assessment as income for the 1977-78 year. I mention in particular sugar mill workers and employees who have paid tax consistently for decades but then on a token rental. From 1 July 1977, the values, reassessed by the Taxation Office have increased tenfold. I have even heard of a station manager whose income has been reassessed over the past five years on his subsidised rents on a station in New South Wales. This is discriminatory. It is inequitable. I believe this action to be unconstitutional under section 51 (ii) of the Australian Constitution. I ask that a full deferment be available to all employees, wherever they are, whatever job they do, until the review has been completed by the Taxation Office. I ask also that the concessions which I previously mentioned be fully evaluated to ensure that pioneering and decentralising industries are not disadvantaged further in comparison with the rest of Australia. Also, if values are to be assessed, I ask particularly that they be appUed properly, taking into account all aspects of the rental values in isolated areas which naturally would depreciate more than would be the case in a capital or a provincial I know that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has enumerated how such values should be fairly assessed and the conditions which would apply, but the opinion I have formed from what I have seen is that the valuers are not taking these aspects into account to the extent that they should. As a consequence, the values I have seen have been too high in relation to all the circumstances. I ask for justice in this respect also.",105
281,Mr HUMPHREYS,ADJOURNMENT," I wish into devote the couple of minutes remaining to the honour and the memory of Mr Gough Whitlam who was one of the greatest Prime Ministers that this House has ever seen. I say this with sincerity: Gough Whitlam will go down in history as one of the greatest Prime Ministers who ever stepped into this House and who passed from it gracefully. Whilst I know that honourable members opposite fought very hard to get rid of Gough Whitlam, I can assure them that they were not responsible for getting rid of him; that was the doing of some Press barons. We all know who the Press barons are. We will not name them tonight. What they did to Gough Whitlam was criminal. It was tantamount to character assassination. We all well know that Gough Whitlam achieved for Australia and for Australians some of the greatest social security benefits ever known in Australia. Mr Martyr-That is not what Clyde tells us.",106

286,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate is interrupted. The House stands adjourned until 2.15 p.m. on Tuesday next. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: (1) Can he say whether the 1976 New Zealand Commission of Inquiry into Motor Spirits recommended that the New Zealand Government closely watch international developments in the oil industry; if so, is he able to give the reason for this recommendation. (2) What arrangements has the Government made to monitor potentially damaging developments in international oil distribution to Australia. (3) Is he also able to say whether the 1976 New Zealand Commission of Inquiry noted that long term security of supply of oil is of prime importance; if so, what steps has the Government taken to ensure long term security in view of the increasing Australian dependence on imported crude oil. (4) In view of the recommendation of the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry that a detailed investigation of supply costs would be in the public interest, does the Government intend to examine the supply costs of petroleum and petroleum products in Australia. (5) Is he also able to say whether the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry concluded quite emphatically that the existing price and motor spirit distribution controls should be maintained; if so, does the Government intend to examine the Commission's Report to see whether controls should be introduced in Australia on profits the number of retailers and the lease agreements between wholesalers and retailers in the petroleum distribution industry. (6) Does the Government see the need for an examination of the potential cost savings from Government ownership of coastal oil tankers as was suggested by the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry. (7) In view of the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry's recommendation that price control of imported products be continued, does the Government plan to introduce price controls over imported petroleum products into Australia. (8) As the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry noted that the absence of controls market place giving satisfaction either to the oil companies or to the retailers, does the Government agree that controls on petroleum distribution should be introduced in Australia. (9) Does the Government agree with the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry's observation tial overcapitalisation in the petroleum industry in Australia. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (9) While there may be some similarities between the situation in Australia and New Zealand there are also differences. In any event I believe it would be quite inappropriate for the Australian Government to base its policies and actions on conclusions reached by Inquiries conducted overseas. Rather the Australian Government should determine its position on such matters having regard to the specifics of the Australian situation and any studies made in relation thereto. In this regard, the Royal Commission on Petroleum carried out wide ranging investigations into the operations of NA upon notice were circulated: Petroleum Industry the petroleum industry in Australia and six reports were prepared. The first three repons were presented during the (Question No. 60) period of the Labor Government. The Government's decision on the Fourth Report was announced by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs on 31 May 1977; and the decision on the Fifth Report was announced in a statement. I released to the press on the 'Petroleum Refining Industry' on 1 June 1978. The Government has not yet made a decision in respect of the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission. In regard to future security of supplies of oil, the Government's policy is to actively revive exploration in Australia. This is having effect as is borne out with the increasing level of drilling and seismic survey activity. At the same time in the context of its energy policy, the Government is giving increasing attention to conservation and alternative source of energy through such bodies as the National Energy Advisory Committee and the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. Advisory and Consultative Committees: Inclusion of Members of Parliament (Question No. 1149) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 6 June 1978: (1) What advisory or consultative committees has he established or continued which include members of parliament. (2) Which members and senators are included on these committees. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2)1I have not established or continued any advisory or consultative committees which include members of parliament. Department of Transport, Canberra: Incidence of Sick Leave (Question No. 1189) in Australia has not produced a Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 May 1978: (1) How many officers from his Department's Canberra offices took sick leave in 1976. that there is a substan(2) What percentage of the total staff establishment did this number represent. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 270 officers took a total of 13,486 hours sick leave. (2) These figures represent 80.35 per cent of the total staff and 2.1 per cent of the total hours available to be worked in 1976. Air Transportation of Hazardous Cargo (Question No. 1428) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 1 June 1978: (1) What is the definition of hazardous cargo as provided for in regulations governing the transport (a) within Australia and (b ) entering or departing Australia. (2) Will he specify the precise relevant regulations and/or legislative provisions covering the transport of hazardous goods or freight by aircraft. (3) How many prosecutions have been launched in Australia, in each of the last S years and in how many cases did convictions result, in respect of breaches of regulations relating to the air carriage of hazardous cargo. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Hazardous cargo is termed dangerous goods in Australian legislation and is denned as explosive substances and things which by reason of their nature are liable to endanger the safety of an aircraft or persons on board an aircraft or which are declared, by notice published in Air Navigation Orders, to be things which are likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft or persons on board an aircraft. This definition applies to Australian aircraft wherever they may be and to foreign aircraft operating tralian territory. (2) Air Navigation Regulation 120 and Air Navigation Orders Part 33 cover the air transportation goods. (3) All prosecutions launched have led to convictions. Two prosecutions occurred in 1973, four in 1975 and one in 1978. There were no prosecutions in 1974,1976 or 1977. Australian National Railways Commission: Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 1 June 1978: (1) Are the latest accounts available for the the Australian National Railways Commission those for the year 1974-75. (2) If so, why are the accounts for subsequent years not available. (3) When will he table the accounts for those years. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable year only: member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Australian National Railways Commission has long recognised the urgent need to plan and re-organise its accounting structure so that acceptable principles valuation and operating result derivation could be applied consistently from the inception of its operations on 1 July 1975. Implementation by ANR of a new accounting structure however has been delayed because the Commission gained effective control of the transferred systems only on 1 March this year, the delay resulting from the protracted negotiations with the South Australian Government on the of cargo on aircraft timing of the declared date. (3) There are some outstanding matters yet to be resolved but it is to be hoped that the accounts for 1975-76 and 1976-77 will be tabled in the near future. Oil Production (Question No. 1547)",106
287,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 8 June 1978: (1) What was the actual level of oil production to which the crude oil production levy and the State royalty applied in each of the years (a) 1975-76 and (b) 1976-77 and what is the anticipated level in (c) 1977-78, (d) 1978-79, (e) 1979-80 and (f) 1980-81. (2) What was the actual revenue or is the anticipated revenue to the States from oil production as a result of royalties levied or to be levied on the well-head value of oil in each of the same years.
