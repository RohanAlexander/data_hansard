2,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Health on line: a report on health information management and telemedicine, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed. Mr FORRESTI am absolutely delighted to table this report. It is the second major report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in the space of a week. This is an important report for the parliament to give consideration to: countries around the world are examining the potential of information technology to improve the delivery of health care. This is the first inquiry by a parliamentary committee into the capabilities of this technology and its possible deployment in the Australian health system. The committee has decided to use the term 'telehealth' to replace 'telemedicine' and 'health informatics' instead of 'health information management'. The report has identified that telehealth and health informatics will improve the delivery and quality of health care, particularly for rural and remote communities. Telehealth consultations can reduce necessary travel both for the patient and the doctor and allow a GP in a rural practice or in a remote Aboriginal community to consult with a specialist anywhere in Australia, or indeed in any country in the world. However, access by rural and remote communities to appropriate telecommunications facilities is limited and the committee has therefore recommended that these communities should apply to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to upgrade the level of their facilities. To further improve equitable access to rural and remote areas, the committee has recommended the establishment of centres of excellence in major teaching hospitals to provide a link from medical specialists. From these centres, Australian medical education to students studying in their own countries could be delivered, as well as foreign aiq, including humanitarian Report aid. After visiting the Kintore Aboriginal settlement in the Tanami region of the Northern Territory, the committee is convinced that isolated Aboriginal communities and their medical professionals would derive enormous benefit from telehealth. The committee has therefore recommended that the Tanami network's submission to the regional infrastructure fund should be approved if it meets the board's criteria. I understand that announcements will be made shortly in respect of that. Telehealth is likely to diffuse responsibility for patient care across state and territory jurisdictions. The committee has therefore recomm-nded that the Australian Medical Council should negotiate with state and territory registration bodies for a national framework of mutual recognition. The technology moves across the state boundaries. By providing a strict definition of telehealth, it is recommended that telehealth consultations be recognised on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Other measures are also considered necessary to encourage GPs to take up technologically based clinical processes. The majority of the committee has recommended that non-bulk-billing doctors should un- have access electronically to the mediclaims system for the Medicare rebate portion of the medical bill, with the outstanding balance being paid by the patient at the time of the consultation. It is not proposed in the report to change in any way the current paper based bulk-billing arrangements or entitlements which are simply designed to act as an incentive to encourage GPs to take up the technology. If I may turn to health informatics because this is a contention area which the committee has addressed, the committee supports the introduction of health informatics on a national basis. Health informatics will allow the aggregation of patient information in the form of an electronic record. This will ensure the reduction in the current significant number of adverse health events and lessen duplication and waste of health resources. The report also recommends the introduction of a patient held electronic health card system and links very well with the committee's report tabled last week with respect to concession cards. This will resolve the question of ownership and patients' rights of access to their own health information. The allocation of a unique patient identifier is also recommended. This will reduce the possibility of data being incorrectly attributed. The committee has very seriously considered questions of individual privacy, confidentiality and security throughout the process of the inquiry. The committee has concluded, however, that concerns in this regard are often overstated and that the advent of electronic health records can in fact enhance the security of records, given the serious deficiencies of the insecure paper based system which currently exists. The report proposes changes in the way communi ty pharmacies record details of prescriptions dispensed by recommending the introduction of the Canadian Pharmanet system. Pharmanet will allow the monitoring of prescription drug usage, thereby minimising drug interactions. Again, this is consistent with the report tabled last week in respect to concession cards.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! Just a moment. The gentleman up there with the baby-don't feel that you need leave the chamber because the baby is causing you some distress. People with the best lungs in Australia try to compete for attention down here, and we would be more than happy for you to stay. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",14
4,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"I am more than happy for those in the gallery to hear my comments on this very important report which proposes to encourage whole of the nation solutions to health informatics. The committee has recommended the use of the Internet with appropriate security safeguards as the primary means of electronic communications. The Internet offers flexibility and accessibility, particularly to rural and remote health care professionals who still only have the old copper wire system at their disposal. Increasingly, health consumers are accessing their own health information and data, particularly via the Internet. The committee has therefore recommended the implementation of a national education campaign which stresses the necessity to verify the accuracy of this information with a reliable source. The cooperation of the medical profession, particularly general practitioners, is essential to the successful development of streamlined health care. The committee has therefore made a number of recommendations designed to encourage the computerisation of general practice. These include: funding training programs, reduction of sales tax on technologies purchased specifically for online clinical purposes, and accelerated depreciation for this equipment. The committee strongly believes that the full deployment of telehealth and health informatics within the Australian health system will improve the delivery and outcome of health care for all Australians. If the full potential of these processes is to be realised a national approach is essential. The committee has concluded that many of the recommendations made in this report go beyond the health portfolio and require intersectoral consultation and cooperation. The committee has therefore recommended that the National Office for the Information Economy is the appropriate body to implement or monitor these recommendations. This is a significant report and contains recommendations which will stimulate considerable debate. The committee is confident that the process will lead to profound benefits in the delivery of health care across the nation. Given that I have only had the opportunity to chair this committee since September, I want to thank the previous chairman of the committee, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), for steering the inquiry through the intricate information gathering stage. I would also like to thank all members of the committee and record my appreciation for the cooperative nature with which the committee worked. My very special thanks go to all the members of the secretariat, particularly Marie Kawaja, whose hard work in assembling the pre-draft report helped steer it through to final agreement.",14
5,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"I too welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this very important report entitled Health on line: a report on health information management and telemedicine. Like my colleague the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), I would like to express my appreciation to the colleagues who were on the committee and also to Marie for her dedication and great support in putting this report to bed. Speaking for five or six minutes does not really give me the opportunity to go into what I consider to be a very important report for the improved delivery of medical services in Australia, especially in the many remote and rural areas that we covered in this reportareas often neglected and underserviced. Telehealth and telemedicine is an important emerging policy area which· can provide not only improved medical service delivery to all Australians but also valuable export earnings for our country as we get involved with many of our neighbours. Hopefully, they will be able to afford it once they have sorted out their financial hassles. Those of us who were involved in the numerous hearings were involved in a great learning curve as we battled to come to grips with the complexities of providing modem medical technology across the vast distances here in Australia. We were enthralled as we experienced at first hand many of the telehealth/telemedicine projects that are currently running in various parts of our country. I am proud to say that Australia is the forefront in this telemedicine and telehealth area. One of the projects that we visited was the renal telemedicine network based at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital renal unit in Adelaide, which has set up a video-conferencing link with four renal dialysis centres as far away as Port Augusta, which is 300 kilometres away. We also had the opportunity to look at the trials between this hospital and two remote Aboriginal communities at Yuendumu and Kintore. Kintore is about as remote from civilisation as you would want to get. It is 500-odd kilometres north-west of Alice its Springs; seven hours by road, if you are game, and an hour and a half by twin-engine aircraft. The trial there included specialists in such areas as diabetes, psychiatry, pharmacy, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, neurology and renal medicine and provided people, as I said, in some of the remotest parts of Australia with access to world-class medical services through telemedicine and telehealth. The opportunity is limited only by the ability to provide these communities with the technological wherewithal to survive. It is interesting to note that in our report we mention that despite major advances in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure, particularly since the 1980s, the committee was told that people living in rural and remote areas of Australia are still suffering from the so-called tyranny of distance, and access to telecommunication services is inadequate and cost excessive. Despite the big bunfight between Telstra and Optus, I think they are only really interested in the five big cities and some of the smaller towns. When it gets to going out into the real rural and remote parts of Australia, the ISDN network roll-out is not worthy of their consideration. Hopefully, our recommendations, if taken up by the government-and I am sure they will be-will provide people, irrespective of where they live, with access to telemedicine and telehealth. In chapter 6 we speak of the impact on the medical profession of this area. It is interestat ing to note that the pharmacists were first out of the blocks and have embraced this technology, and radiologists and pathologists are also seeking greater computerisation of general practice in order to streamline teleradiology and telepathology. The report states: ... the Department of Health and Family Services also identified General Practice as an area: critical to health sector management overall, an area where their involvement in information management and their use of Information Technology we saw as being critical for how things could develop. 6.4 The AMA and the RACGP are similarly concemed about the reluctance by GPs to computerise and. reinforce the point . . . As the member for MaBee said, 'the issue of privacy came up and related to our report that we tabled in the House last week where, as soon as you mention medical records, smart cards and the like, the civil libertarians of this world raise their heads, shout, holler and beat hollow drums. I would like to think that, when people read this report, they will see that the whole issue of privacy, confidentiality and security has been addressed. We do have the technology to enable all people to have whatever information about their medical conditions placed on a card. There is the encryption potential, and rather than being a disincentive I think it is a wonderful incentive to enable better health services to be provided for all Australians. It is a matter of educating people, and one of our recommendations is that the government introduce an education process whereby people are not frightened away by this whole issue of someone knowing exactly what is wrong with them. The other area I would like to quickly mention is health informatics. It is probably one of the most complicated areas that I have come across, and the whole issue of setting up a national standard",15
6,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Mallee wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated at a later occasion?,16
7,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,16
8,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the and member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Committee Report",16
9,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, I am pleased to present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, on an inquiry into federal road funding entitled Planning not patching: an inquiry into federal road funding, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",16
10,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"Given the integral part roads play in everyday life, the committee was not surprised by the overwhelming public response to the inquiry. In total, the committee received 845 written submissions, 80 exhibits and heard evidence from 169 witnesses during 14 public hearings in every state and territory. The committee also undertook a number of inspections, which added a flavour and relevance to the formal evidence. The committee's report contains 34 recommendations, and I will touch on the major themes. One of the key messages received was the need for the development and implementation of a national strategic transport plan encompassing all forms of transport and all levels of government. The evidence suggests that operational efficiencies and developmental opportunities are being lost in Australia due to what appears to be a patchy approach to planning. As the title of this report implies, Australia needs planning, not patching, in its approach to the provision of road infrastructure. The Commonwealth is in a unique position to ensure that Australia's total road network is developed in an integrated and cohesive manner with the three tiers of government working together. The majority report recommends that the Commonwealth should continue to provide specific purpose-that is, tied-payments for the national highway system and roads of national importance. The committee concluded that the current procedure of untying road funding to the states, territories and local government, then effectively retying it by separately identifying the budget papers and seeking assurances that it is spent on roads, is illogical. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth should use specific purpose---'--tied-payments via block grants to ensure that funds are spent on roads, but allocations to projects would be determined by states, territories and local government. The committee received evidence that the Commonwealth's current annual funding approach to its road program generates uncertainty. It impedes the ability of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to undertake long-term planning and inhibits the efficient operation of the road construction industry, resulting in less value for the road dollar. As an alternative to the uncertainty of year to year funding, a rolling three-year funding approach, with guaranteed funding levels for the national highway system and roads of national importance, will demonstrate the Commonwealth's leadership and commitment to the implementation of a national road strategy. The committee considers the existing arrangements which link the Commonwealth's road program to a hypothecated, or earmarked, proportion of fuel excise to be ineffective and misleading. Fuel excise represents a general purpose tax and there is no longer any real correlation between it and road funding. The Commonwealth :;hould fund future road programs directly from consolidated revenue. The committee considered the question of private sector involvement in the provision and funding of road infrastructure. The case is compelling for the increased use of competitive tendering and contracting in the provision and maintenance of road infrastructure. Proposals for private sector investment in roads need to be examined on a case by case basis. For each project, the questions which need to be asked are: what is the net benefit, and is the distribution of the benefits and costs acceptable to the community? The findings and recommendations of the report were supported by all but one member who took a strong, alternative philosophical position on the role of the Commonwealth and the it in role of the private sector in road funding. In conclusion, I would like to extend the committee's thanks to the many organisations and individuals around Australia who assisted the committee with its work. Without the goodwill of so many people, the committee's task would have been appreciably more difficult. I would particularly like to thank the Hon. Mark Vaile MP, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, who chaired the committee for all but a few weeks of the inquiry. He demonstrated a great deal of dedication, energy and focus. The committee also notes the contribution of the deputy chair, the Hon. Peter Morris MHR, who acted as chair for some parts of the inquiry and went to great pains to see that all views were fairly heard. My thanks go to my fellow committee members, who invested a great deal of time, energy and good humour, which made this inquiry an enjoyable and worthwhile experience. An inquiry of this magnitude is an enormous undertaking and I wish to record the committee's appreciation of the contribution made by Meg Crooks, committee secretary; Geoff Johnston, inquiry officer; Jason Allford, research officer; and Annette Fischer and Natalie Milner, administrative officers. I commend the report to the House.  p.m.)-I would like to commend the chair of the House of Representatives Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Committee on the even-handed manner in which he conducted the affairs of the committee. He was thrown into the deep end towards its conclusion, but he is renowned for his even-handedness and the fairness in the way we carried through the final stages of the committee's work. Mr Martin-That's a bit much!  Similarly, I would like to commend the former chairman of the committee, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile). At times I thought that in his eagerness to ensure all points of view were heard he actually sat there waiting and thinking, 'Maybe another point of view will be brought up if I wait long enough.' But he did provide a very fair approach to what is a very wide subject. It is a subject of intense public interest and it will always be a subject of intense public interest. The minister and former chair is going to find out a bit more about that now, coming from Taree and the area where we have special arrangements with respect to the Pacific Highway, but he will be vigilantly watched by every member of this House to ensure he acts with probity and fairness. I would like also at the outset to thank and congratulate the members of the committee staff: Meg Crooks, committee secretary; Geoff Johnston, inquiry officer from the department; Jason Allford, research officer; and Annette Fischer and Natalie Milner, the administrative officers. They are very patient people and very dedicated people. There were times when we wanted them to do more than they had done or not do some of the things they had done. Certainly, some of the proposals they brought forward at times did not meet the ready acceptance of the committee, but they did a great job and they deserve to be congratulated and I am very happy to join with the committee chair in saying that. The chairman referred to recommendation 4 of the report, which is: . . . an integrated strategic plan for the national transport network by 1 July 1999. Let me say that the interfaces, the linkages, between the forms of transport are those areas of greatest importance for efficiency improvement. One day in this nation, we will have an overall approach to the four forms of transport-where they will come together and we will try to get some form of overall assessment and evaluation of funds that are invested and work out how we can make this system, as a total system, work better for the benefit of this nation. Recommendation 5 deals with 'greater certainty in road funding'. If there is an area of waste in the road system at every level of government, it is the area of uncertainty in road funding. We still find that there are levels of government that, come 30 June, are desperate and hell-bent on spending the money they have got, because if they do not spend it by 30 June, it lapses. That area has not been properly addressed yet, and recommendation 17 is for a rolling three-year program. The recommendation states: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth ensure greater certainty in its tied road funding program by implementing a guaranteed funding approach for a rolling three year period. That picks up that issue. I just want to say to the parliament that that is probably the most important recommendation-it is the certainty in road funding, the ability to plan and the ability to utilise equipment. A five-year program would have been better, but at least the three-year program is an important start. Then there is asset management and the debates we had about who should be responsible for overall asset management of the vast asset of the road systems of this nation, on which we spend about $6 1Abillion per year. That is another key area in which we need to ensure there is an overall strategy and collaboration between the three levels of government. The next area is tied funding for roads. Dare I remind our colleagues in government that 'we told you so'. When they untied road funding for the states and local government back in 1991, we said that some states would be coming back to them and saying that that was not the efficient way to do things. There is no certainty when you give blocks of money to states and blocks of money to local government for spending on roads. It is a good intention but, if you do not tie it down to ensure it is spent on roads, the invitation is for the money to be spent on other purposes. So we have come back in recommendation 16 with: ... that untied road funding paid to States/ Territories and local government be paid as tied blocked grantsThe committee also recommended that funding for roads which the federal government is responsible for should continue to be by way of specific purpose grants. I commend all those involved, particularly my colleagues on the committee, for their contribution to the report, and we will have further discussion on this at a later stage.",16
11,Mr ROSS CAMERON,COMMITTEES,"Today I rise in dissent. I rise as a minority of one in a committee of 14. I am strengthened in my resolve by the belief that, if Henry Parkes were here today, he would dissent with me. If Alfred Deakin were on the transport committee, he would be on my side of the argument. Informing the constitutional draftsmen was a philosophy of government which resulted in considered decisions about which tier of government would accept which functions. The resultant division of powers became known as the federal compact. Each of the colonies ceded a measure of their sovereignty in order to bring into being one federated Commonwealth. The national government was to be a limited affair, exercising only those enumerated, specific powers mentioned in the constitution. The states retained a general law making power over the remainder. Today that federal compact lies in tatters. The whole rationale of the constitution has been subverted by an unremitting arrogation of power in Canberra. Road funding is merely one example. Healthy communities devolve power; they share it around. In the words of M.K. Ghandi, 'The greatest expression of power is to give it away.' Since Federation, we have done the opposite. The executive government of the Commonwealth, supported by a pliant and centrist High Court, has reduced the states to so many supplicants, begging for Commonwealth alms. We have deprived them not only of a fair share of the revenues but, more darkly, of the power to raise their own. The Senate is turning out to be one of the great mistakes of the constitution. Certainly it has failed in its intended role as a guardian of states' rights. The Senate has become a chamber not of the states but of the parties, and its membership the lackeys of each party's executive. The imbalance of powers is reflected in, and sustained by, an imbalance of funds. Australia now practises the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance of any federation in the world. Mr Hockey-Hear, hear!",19
12,Mr ROSS CAMERON,COMMITTEES,"As a result, costshifting bureaucratic duplication and cynicism have been woven into the very fabric of our public life. At a time of remorseless global competition, this is an indulgence Australia simply cannot afford. It lies within our power to reform, and I say, 'Let reform begin with road funding.' The Commonwealth has no business in roads. The state road authbrities, local government and the private sector are the experts. Let them have their head. We should simply hand over the money and let them do their jobs. Better yet, we should hand back the power to the states to raise their own revenues, because only then will they be in a position to discharge their duty to the peace, welfare and good government of the citizens. I note the Minister. for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) is present in the chamber. I thank him for his indulgence and willingness to hear a dissenting voice, which has been consistent throughout the committee's deliberations. I thank the chair likewise for his indulgence of my idiosyncrasies. Better minds than mine are in the majority report: the deputy chairman; Ralph Willis, who is in the chamber; and others such as the opposition spokesman on transport are all in the majority. I am the dissident, the idiosyncratic one. But, nonetheless, I have support in the chamber. I note the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) was giving healthy 'Hear, hears'. I hope that this first voice of dissent will mark the beginning of the turnaround to restore the federation to see it achieve the status imagined by the fathers of the constitution. This is a great country, but this is an important problem. We must tackle it and let us begin today.",19
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Nehl)Does the member for Hinkler wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,19
14,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks at some later date. Leave granted.,19
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Treaties Committee Report",20
16,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's 11th report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",20
17,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"The report I have just tabled deals with 11 treaties, including one on economic and commercial cooperation with Kazakhstan which we have recommended should not be ratified at this time. The latter approach is a committee first and I will say more on that in a moment. We have recommended ratification of the remaining 10 treaties as proposed. However, in the case of one of them, the agreement on trade and economic cooperation with Malaysia, we have recommended also a study to establish whether any other trade or financial agreements are required. In particular, the need for an investquarantine ment protection agreement needs to be reviewed. A double taxation agreement with Malaysia was signed in 1980, and the study we have recommended should consider whether this needs to be revised or replaced. Many of our reports, and accompanying tabling statements, have made comments about a lack of consultation in the process set up after last year's reforms. Unfortunately, that shortcoming persists with some of these treaties. For example, consultation with at least two of the states about the medical treatment agreement with Ireland appears to have been perfunctory and did not take up their concerns. We have made some comments on that matter. On the amendments to the Asian-Pacific Postal Union's constitution, there was no consultation with postal unions or philatelic organisations which might have been interested. Consequently, we will keep consultation under review until it reaches and maintains a satisfactory level. On the other hand, it is pleasing to be able to mention a particularly good national interest analysis for the agreement on the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia and the Pacific, or NACA. This shows evidence of widespread consultation with the many groups with an interest in that agreement. More importantly, it included sufficient detailed information for us to grasp easily what the agreement set out to do and where there were difficult issues. I think that all of my colleagues on the committee would join with me in saying that those responsible in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy did a very good job on this NIA. They were very responsive also to suggestions from our secretariat during the inquiry process. The NACA agreement will provide a means for this country's aquaculture industry to both contribute to and receive knowledge in this rapidly growing industry. As the section on this agreement in chapter 4 of the report shows, this is a substantial subject. During our hearing on it, concerns were expressed about the future of Australia's regime as a member of NACA. We were advised that membership 'would not affect our sovereign rights to set our levels of quarantine protection'. In view of the evidence we were given about diseases in some parts of the Asian aquaculture industry, this latter advice is very important indeed. I return to the agreement on economic and commercial cooperation with Kazakhstan. Of itself, this is not a very significant agreement. However, it is important because it is the first time we have recommended that a treaty should not be ratified. Briefly, Telstra was operating within the law in Kazakhstan but found that its licence for a joint venture arrangement was revoked, suffering a loss of some $A7 million. Although Telstra is not the only Australian company operating on a joint venture or other basis in Kazakhstan, the way it has been treated sets a generally unacceptable standard. To ratify this agreement would send the wrong message to Kazakhstan about what is acceptable in commercial relations with Australia and internationally. We have recommended against ratification at this time because, whilst we do not think that any agreement would have protected Telstra totally, we do believe that it has treated in an unacceptable way. It is difficult to be clear about the position in that country, in time. but Telstra just might get its money back. It certainly wants to remain operating in that country. We have recommended also that this agreement not be reconsidered for ratification unless and until there are demonstrations by Kazakh authorities of good faith in its trading relations with Australia. We believe that either re-entry into the market or payment of compensation would be appropriate ways of showing much-needed good faith in this situation. The situation in Kazakhstan may change, and ratification of this agreement could be proposed at some time in the future. If so, we have recommended that a new NIA outlining the reasons for the change should be tabled to allow the committee to consider the matter further. The second chapter of the report reveals that we were not happy with all aspects of the evidence given to us by DFAT, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the Kazakh issue. This was especially so at a hearing on 1 September, when pertinent evidence was not presented-something, I have to say, which was out of character for that department, which has set a uniformly high standard in the evidence it has given at many committee hearings since the middle of last year. There is one further point I would like to make on the Kazakh agreement. We were concerned that the Minerals Council of Australia was approached to give evidence but decided to leave this to individual member companies. This was very disappointing, as we believed it could have made a very useful contribution to our understanding of the situation in central Asia as it affects a range of Australian companies. I commend the report to the House.",20
18,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMITTEES,"Barton) (1.09 p.m.)I join with the chairman of the committee in recommending the report to the House. This 11th report, as the chairman noted, is significant because it is the first time that the committee has actually recommended against been the ratification of a treaty-and I think we have considered over 90 treaties at this point As members are aware, the treaties committee is a joint committee made up of Liberal, Labor and Democrat members and senators. It is significant that this report was unanimous, including the recommendation against ratification of the agreement on economic and commercial cooperation with Kazakhstan. The difficulty which committee members had with that particular agreement with Kazakhstan, as the chairman has noted, was not such so much with its terms but rather with the conduct of Kazakhstan officials and, in particular, officials in their dealings with Telstra. The terms of the agreement itself are relatively standard terms and, as we note in the 11th report, the committee has already recommended ratification of similar agreements with Romania, Mexico, the Czech Republic and Lebanon. As the chairman has mentioned, the committee had significant reservations as to whether there was any usefulness in ratifying the treaty with Kazakhstan, given the past conduct of the Kazakhstan officials in their dealings with Telstra. The situation with respect to Telstra has been. outlined and summarised by the chairman, but basically in 1994 Telstra began a joint venture called Satel, the other participant in that joint venture being Kazakh Telecom. Telstra's investment in Satel was about $7% million and the joint venture was to provide high quality telecommunications to multinational companies operating in Kazakhstan. The joint venture was for an indefinite period. The Satel joint venture proceeded profitably and successfully up until 1996. It appears that at that time, however, the Kazakhstan government made a decision to sell 40 per cent of its interest in the state owned Kazakh Telecom to a Korean conglomerate of the car manufacturer Daewoo. It appears that in order to increase the price of the share holding in that company the Kazakhstan government promised Daewoo a monopoly over Kazakhstan telecommunications. In that context, the activities of the joint venture companies and specifically the activities of Telstra proved an impediment to the granting of that monopoly. To get Telstra out of the equation they required the joint venture to re-register. There were several other joint venture companies in a similar boat. But in order to re-register, Satel, the joint venture company, was required to have the signatures of both joint venturers, the shareholders in joint venture, which of course included Kazakh Telecom, which was still 60 per cent owned by the Kazakhstan government. Kazakh Telecom withheld their signature and hence the joint venture could not be re-registeredo Having committed itself to significant investment in infrastructure, Telstra continued managing the business of Satel for a short time. However, again, in order to terminate its activities, the government froze Satel's accounts and required it to repay any profits that had been earned from I January 1997. By their actions, which can only be described as high-handed, the Kazakhstan government therefore forced Telstra's investment in Kazakhstan to end abruptly. It has been said that the concept of the rule of law as we know it is non-existent in Kazakhstan, which is an emerging economy. From a personal point of view, however, the concept of good faith is not one which is based on any legal premise but rather is based on mutual respect and integrity. Clearly, the actions of the Kazakhstan government were quite inconsistent with that obligation of good faith which is an essential underpinning of any commercial relationship. The members of the treaties committee therefore formed the view that it was pointless for the Australian government to enter into an agreement with the Kazakhstan government which, at this stage of the game at least, has not demonstrated that required goodwill and integrity for there to be any meaningful and viable treaty agreement. The position which we have adopted again demonstrates that international treaties are not edicts of the United Nations acting as some international parliament. Rather, treaties are agreements between sovereign nations. The mere fact that a nation enters into a treaty is a confirmation of its own sovereignty. At the same time, it would be pointless to enter any commercial relationship, which is equivalent to a treaty relationship, if you do not have faith in the integrity of the other party. Disappointingly, at this point in time, members of the treaties committee found that they could not accept the existence of that the required good faith in view of the conduct demonstrated by the Kazakhstan government. We have indicated, however, that we would readily review and revisit our decision, should the required good faith be demonstrated and, in particular, should the government of Kazakhstan offer appropriate compensation or permit Telstra to re-enter the country.",21

22,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"The Customs Legislation (Economies in Transition) Amendment Bill seeks to unravel the mess caused when the government agreed to treat some market goods from China as being sourced from a free market. It seeks to force the government to act on this vital issue to safeguard Australian manufacturers from unfair export pricing practices. Without this legislation, all goods allegedly dumped from China will be priced as if they come from a free market economy, no matter how much the production and sale is government controlled. Anti-dumping measures are fundamentally designed to ensure fairness in international trade. They should not be used as a protective trade barrier. Clearly, legislative changes necessary to preserve the integrity of Australia's anti-dumping system. However, we believe that the primary focus of such legislation should be to create Australian and build national wealth within our international trading obligations. The government created the problem that this bill seeks to address more than a year when it decided to treat goods from China on a case by basis, apparently as a trade-off for the botch-up over the DIFF scheme. It mishandled this matter in a way that has resulted in all goods from China being considered as sourced from a free market. In the case of glyphosate, in the face of overwhelming evidence that export and domestic pricing of glyph os ate from China was government controlled, the government allowed it in. No other OECD country treats product from China in this way. In February 1997, the government announced it would legislate to fix this problem, yet the legislation was not introduced parliament until June. Even then it was woefully inadequate. Since then-that is, five months ago-nothing has happened. That bill has languished on the Notice Paper. The government has refused to bring it on for debate in the House of Representatives even though it has a clear majority here to deal with it and even though hundreds of jobs have been lost and at least one major investment worth $80 million has been lost offshore-the Monsanto investment, which has now gone to Argentina. The government's bill is now listed for Thursday of this week with no priority given to it in the Senate's list of priority matters for the end of the year. This makes it virtually impossible - o get it through the parliament this year. The effect of that is that nothing can be dealt with until at least March next year and, in the meantime, all products coming from China will be treated as if they come from a free market. Labor has therefore decided to introduce its own bill to force the government to act. Australian industry cannot put up with continued dithering from this government. Under are Labor, when goods sourced from China were subject to anti-dumping complaints the domestic price was determined by reference to a surrogate country. China has been conjobs sidered a command economy with the consequent ability to artificially suppress domestic prices. Our bill seeks to restore that arrangement, whilst allowing individual goods to be treated as coming from a free market on a ago case by case basis. Unlike the government's legislation, our bill takes account of circumstances where input prices are government controlled or where there is substantial government control within the industry sector. The government's mishandling of this matter reflects its mishandling of the broader anti-dumping issue which I will deal with in the second bill: its failure to fulfil its election promise to reduce the maximum time for a dumping case and its failure to keep its promise not to water down existing safeguards. The issue has had three ministers-four if you count the now Minister for Industry, into the Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who claimed in correspondence when the government was in opposition that he had responsibility for anti-dumping. But when he got into parliament he said it was not his responsibility. In 1992, the current Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) said: Australia has become a dumper's paradise. Products that no other country will take have been welcomed into our land. He was particularly critical· of China. The member for Wide Bay now has his chance to make a difference. We will want to see how he votes on this particular piece of legislation. I urge consideration of this legislation before the House. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed in completeness and our amendments do that. (Time expired)",22
23,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,I ask leave of the House to present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Leave granted. Bill read a first time.,24
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (WILLETT REVIEW OF ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Crean.",24
25,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"The Customs Legislation (Willett Review of AntiDumping Measures) Amendment Bill 1997 implements Labor's announcement of 3 November 1997 to implement the key recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report. As such, it will safeguard thousands of Australian jobs from unfair international trading practices by strengthening anti-dumping legislation-legislation which has been significantly eroded by this government's inaction. This bill is part of a strategy designed to ensure that existing jobs and new job opportunities are not lost through unfairly priced imports. It is designed to get the government to honour another of its election commitments and put in place a single stage process for anti-dumping complaints to ensure that they are completed in no more than 155 days. The Willett report, which this bill seeks to implement, was commissioned by the current government to cut the time taken to investigate complaints of dumping and to improve procedures to ensure Australian producers are not disadvantaged. It was a firm coalition promise, yet while the Willett report has been in the hands of the government for over a year, the government has done nothing to put in place anyone of the 23 recommendations that have been made. What it did do was shave 30 days off existing investigation times, but it did that without addressing any of the fundamental structural issues highlighted by Willett which require legislation. The government also announced that the entire anti-dumping system would be reviewed by the Productivity Commission but, to date, neither the Productivity Commission nor any other government body has done any further work on the issue. This is despite the fact that, with recent economic developments in Asia, uncertainty over the government's lack of an industry policy and the mess created over the treatment of dumped product from China, Australian manufacturers are now more exposed than ever before to the threat of dumping. This form of government inaction has become a regular pattern: first, make an election promise; second, redefine the promise as non-core; third, delay the decision by commissioning a report; fourth, when the report recommends action, announce another inquiry to consider the recommendations of the first inquiry; fifth, forget to send the reference to the second inquiry; and, sixth, close your eyes and hope it all goes away. But this issue will not go away. It is clear that both legislative and administrative change is needed to preserve the integrity of Australia's anti-dumping system and to restore confidence in the system among manufacturers and primary producers. Labor has decided - hat the time for waiting is over. Too many investment decisions have been put on hold or are already lost. In the case of Monsanto, an $80 million investment has been lost to Argentina while manufacturers wait for this government to stop its dithering. Without pressure from Labor, there is little chance that anything will change. This bill addresses all Willett recommendations which can be covered by legislation. It is consistent with Australia's obligations under the World Trade Organisation. The focus of the bill is to safeguard Australian jobs against unfair pricing of imported goods while maintaining our international commitments under the WTO. Its measures include a reduction in the maximum investigation time to 155 days, provisional measures which can be imposed after 60 days of an investigation commencing and a single stage investigation process to be undertaken by Customs, rather than the overlapping twostage process currently in place, with Customs to receive additional resources to carry out this expanded role. Also, this bill seeks a more stringent approach to be adopted to seeking and verifying information from importers. Once again, it is Labor which is setting the agenda on these important issues. It is now up to the government to spell out where it stands: with Labor, Australian industry and Australian jobs, or against them. It is an issue of particular significance in the pulp and paper industry where investment is being threatened at the moment by imported product from Indonesia. We will be interested to see how the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) and the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent), to name just two members, vote on thiswhether they support jobs in their communities in their electorates or whether they are prepared to let them go in the interests of inaction.

27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Hellfire Pass",25
28,Mr ADAMS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (I) recognises the impOltance of Hellfire Pass, immediate railway line route and adjacent camps in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, where Australians were prisoners of war; (2) calls on the Government to set in motion the means by which the Thai Government can be approached to have these sites officially recognised as important to Australia; (3) calls on the Government to seek a special status of this area in the form of a reserve or park, to be administered under the War Graves Act, and which will ensure Australians have permanent access; and (4) is of the opinion that the museum under construction and being built with Australian funds should be guaranteed sufficient funds to allow a curator to be located permanently in the region to continue the development of the site. On a recent trip to Thailand, I visited the site of some of the most notorious prisoner of war camps of the Second World War. Hellfire Pass is now a historical site, lying peacefully on the border of Thailand and Burma and is part of the infamous site of the Burma-Siam railway where so many suffered and died during its construction. It is a site of immense significance to Australia and to Australians and to other allied prisoners of war in the east. We need to ensure that family and friends of those who died there, along with the survivors, have permanent access to it. Ongoing generations of Australians can visit Hellfire Pass and the other sites of historical importance there and understand a little bit more of the supreme sacrifice made by so many of our countrymen. For those who survived and are still living, there is a place that will live on in their memories. In 1983, a former Australian prisoner of war who returned to visit the railway, Mr Tom Morris, asked to have Hellfire Pass preserved as a historical site. The result of this was an agreement between the Australian and the Thai chambers of commerce and the Australian government, and Hellfire memorial was opening in 1987. In 1995, the Australian government decided that it would provide substantial funding to develop a more significant memorial complex at Hellfire Pass, building on the work already completed. The delegation visited the site of the museum currently under construction and the was shown some of the artefacts that had been found during the excavation for construction as well as along the trail where so many had worked. The current caretaker of the site, Rod Beattie, has been doing additional work along the line with the help of others. He corrected us on some of the myths that surround the site. While we were there, Rod talked to us about the difficulties of piecing together the railway's short history. It has taken a long time for some prisoners to say what really happened there as it was so traumatic. So many stories grew from what was not said rather than from what was. I understand that there is already considerable work being done on developing a memorial of understanding with the Thai government to tum this area into a reserve of significance for Australia. The new Australian ambassador to Thailand has been briefed about the site. There will also be a discussion with the Thai ambassador in Australia. I have been informed that there will be a board of management set up to manage the site. Some discussions include the possibility of having a curator available to continue the excellent work of Mr Beattie. The Thai government has been most cooperative with Australia. Certainly while we were there they showed us the utmost courtesy and every assistance to ensure that we were able to visit the war graves, the bridge over the River Kwai and Hellfire Pass. The delegation laid a wreath at the war memorial and at Weary Dunlop's plaque in Hellfire Pass. The leader of that delegation, the Parliaand mentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mrs Sullivan), who is at the table, found it a very moving experience. The reason for this motion is to place on record the excellent work being done in Thailand on behalf of all Australians and to ensure that we continue to support the recommendations that will be made to give this site a permanent pl-ce amongst our s-ecial :nar graves sites. I WIsh to make two pomts. FIrst, we must ensure that this site is accessible in perpetuity for Australians to visit. Second, there should be sufficient funds available to ensure that the work that Rod Beattie has done in his free time as the Commonwealth War Graves supervisor is taken on as an important part of the memorial museum. There is still so much to discover about this extraordinary example of courage and fortitude displayed by Australians in the most hideous of circumstances. We owe to those people and their families an understanding of the full story. I hope that all those who were on the delegation with me will support the thrust of this motion and will follow in their various ways the continuation of this excellent project. (Time expired)",25
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Laurie Ferguson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak at a later time.,26
30,Mr BRADFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I was not a member of the delegation that the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) spoke about. However, like many Australians with an interest in the events of the Second World War, Hellfire Place is a place that I would one day like to visit. In the same context, I also plan to visit Gallipoli one day. I think many Australians are visiting these places now to see first-hand what they look like today and to share in the memories of what occurred in those places so many years ago. As the member for Lyons said, the Hellfire Pass memorial project is under way. He visited the museum that is under construction. As I understand it, the museum will be at least a fairly substantial contribution towards the story of the prisoners' commitment and suffering. I am sure that this project is being, will continue to be, supported by the Australian government. I am pleased that we are getting the full cooperation of the Thai governmeht as well. I understand that the museum will be completed by February 1998. I am sure it will be something that many Australians will want to visit. Hellfire Pass epitomises the suffering of the prisoners of war of the Japanese. Along with some other notable features, it was one of the key elements of the Thai-Burma railway, which was constructed by prisoners of war. Many of the stories that we read about it indicate the terrible deprivation that prisoners suffered as they worked on that project. They dug through solid rock day and night. The sick, observed Weary Dunlop, and as the member for Lyons mentioned, were frequently treated with special savagery. 'Savagery', it seems to me, is probably the operative word when we describe the sort of treatment that prisoners of war were subjected to by the Japanese on the Thai-Burma railway. Many I know who are still surviving today are able in some respects to forgive their captors, but they are absolutely unable to forget. More than 16,000 British, Australian and Dutch prisoners and 80,000 conscripted Asian civilians died while building this infamous railway. Many survivors still suffer enormously. Weary Dunlop has been mentioned a couple of times in this debate. In 1988, he was listed amongst the 200 great Australians on the bicentennial list. His own service on the Thaiminister Burma railway was immortalised for the sacrifice, compassion and service that he exhibited. But he was by no means alone. Those qualities were exhibited by many who served at that time. I had the privilege a few weeks ago of being a part of the Ex-Prisoners of War Association of Australia national reunion, which was held on the Gold Coast. It was held from 27 October to 3 November. It included quite a large number of different activities. The key event was the dinner, which occurred on the Saturday night. It was attended not only by me and my wife, because I am the patron of the Ex-POW Association on the Gold Coast, but also by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott, and Mrs Joan Scott. It was a very big event attended by a large number of ex-PaWs from all theatres of war, not only Japanese ex-PaWs. Many of the expaws are getting quite old now but it was wonderful to see that so many of them were able to come to the Gold Coast for this reunion, which one imagines may be one of the last national events that these men and women-because there were women amongst them-are able to hold. I would like to congratulate Harry Nesbitt, who lives on the Gold Coast and who is the National President of the Ex-POW Association, for the success of the event. I would particularly mention Hugh Simmons, also a Gold Coast resident, who was the chairman of the organising committee. It was a wonderful time not only at the annual dinner but also at the memorial service that was held on the morning following the annual dinner in our war memorial park at Burleigh Heads. The other notable feature of the weekend was the presence of the Menin Gate buglers. Many members will be aware that the government sponsored the visit by the Menin Gate buglers. Their attendance at the memorial service on the Sunday morning was very special and added to the sense of this particular occasion. (Time expired)",26
31,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am pleased to second this motion on a number of fronts: firstly, as the shadow for Veterans' Affairs; secondly, as the leader of a delegation in October 1994 as chairman of the subcommittee of the foreign affairs committee; and, thirdly, as a representative of western Sydney which has seen Australia's main Thai-Australian cultural connection, the Loy Krathong festival, germinate in recent years. That delegation of October 1994 included, amongst others, the Speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Like the recent delegation of the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), we also visited the Hellfire Pass site. We also had the opportunity to visit the nearby Kanchanaburi cemetery where a large number of the 2,800 Australians and 12,000 allied servicemen in to to who died are buried. It is quite pleasing to put on the record the degree of interest that there is in this site and in the sufferings that the Australians experienced there on the part of the Thai government and the Thai community. It is also vital to put on the record not only the work of the Ex-POW Association but also the work of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok. This chamber covers a large number of Australian companies that have a direct commercial interest and involvement in Thailand. They certainly were in there at an early stage. As other speakers indicated, the work on the Hellfire Pass did involve tremendous suffering by those people with the spread of rampant diseases, starvation, no consideration whatsoever to the occupational safety of those involved and a fairly murderous straining timetable which took a major toll on these Australians and also on a very large number of conscripted Asian workers. It followed a murderous 200-kilometre route walk for the vast majority of these people. In one part it entailed the digging out 500 metres eight metres high of earth and stone. It involved the collapse of bridges, killing many people in the process. It also involved detonation work, without any real indication to those involved that it was about to happen, and related deaths from that. Hellfire Pass is a very central consideration of people that have followed Australia's war effort. As others have strongly stated, Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop was a seminal representative of that Second World War experience and his ashes are buried there. From recollection, the genesis of this project was in 1989 with the Ex-POW Association. The motion moved by the member for Lyons is a very practical one with a variety of suggestions as to what should occur there. Importantly, it calls for the presence of a curator and the devotion of funds so that the museum can be maintained permanently in the very region where the development occurs. It is pleasing and quite understandable that both sides of the House are giving this motion very strong support. This is also an opportunity to put on the record the context of comments made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) a few weeks ago when she misrepresented the nature of our connection with Thailand in the recent collapse of its markets that it was a loan rather than direct aid. As a person who led an Australian delegation to Thailand, I would like to say that we had a great experience in regard to the feeling of Thais towards this country. They are appreciative of the efforts we made perhaps when their own leadership in the Second World War was a bit questionable. There is a very clear recognition by the Thai population of the sufferings experienced by Australians and the need to preserve recognition of that within that country. This is part of a wider example of close contact between the two countries. It is certainly not something that the Thai government ignores and feels is very minor. They understand the feelings in this country about this site. They understand the interest of Australia in having it recognised as part of our heritage within their land. I once again put on the record my appreciation of the member for Lyons in moving this motion and of speakers on both sides in supporting this measure.",27
32,Mr BROUGH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"In rising to support this motion by the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), I thought it would be worthwhile explaining how Hellfire Pass actually got its name. Hellfire Pass is about 110 metres long and about 17 metres deep. As some of the previous speakers said, it was basically solid rock. The people that worked on this project used very crude implements in digging down through rock. The Hellfire Pass name was derived from the fact that they worked virtually 24 hours a day around the clock. Apparently you could look down into the pass that was being built and see where there were fires set up. That was the light in which these people operated. It was not as though people were operating in eight-hour shifts. The fact was that Australian and British forces, as well as locals, would spend 16 to 18 hours a day with crude implements digging through rock. This went on for 12 weeks but, unfortunately, that was not the end of the project. From there the railway had to be continued for some 421 kilometres or thereabou ts. I cannot begin to imagine the hardship and the deprivation that these people must have suffered from. I have been reading some of the comments that have been attributed to individuals that were there and I would like to read a couple of them into Hansard. The first one is from Hugh Clarke on the scene at Hellfire Pass cutting: It was like a scene out of Dante's inferno. The Japs decided we would work twenty-four hours a day, two shifts, one was the day shift and one was the night ... If you stood on the top of the cutting you would see the burning fires at intervals of about twenty feet; you'd see the shadows of the Japanese with their Foreign Legion caps moving around with their sticks belting men . . . There was shouting and bellowing. And this went on all night. Another gentleman, Stan Arneil, says: In one of the worse speed oswhich is a hurry-up work perioda time when work had to be done extremely quickly, we started at 5 o'clock in the morning ...",28

NA Constitutional Convention",29
34,Mr SAWFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As of 5 p.m. last Thursday, 20 November, a greater percentage of South Australians had voted in the Constitutional Convention election than in any other state or territory. Further analysing the figures, it is interesting to note that more people in the seat of Port Adelaide, at 36.9 per cent, had voted than in any other seat in South Australia-although at 36.43 per cent and 36.11 per cent, the seats of Sturt and Bonython are not far behind. As far as the states are concerned, South Australia is at the front on 34.44 per cent, followed closely by the ACT on 34.13 per cent. The Northern Territory, on 23.31 per cent, Queensland, on 23.62 per cent, and New South Wales, on 25.52 per cent, are dragging the chain. Taking into account individual seats, I am pleased to inform the House that the highest current voter turnout belongs to the seat of Maribyrnong, which is held by my Labor colleague Bob Sercombe. The turnout in Maribyrnong, at 43.91 per cent, is quite remarkable at this stage of the count. On the not so high side it is interesting to note that the turnout in the government seats of Wentworth in New South Wales and Moreton in Queensland have, at this stage, been remarkably low at 15.9 per cent and 16.2 per cent respectively. I am grateful to my district divisional officer Graham Carey for the above information. I seek leave to table the relevant information for the benefit of members. Leave granted. Essay Competition",29
35,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This year's essay competition for the seat of MCMillan has been won respectively by Melissa Rowlings and Alyson Beasley. Melissa is from Moe, which is a part of my electorate in Gippsland. She writes: .. Why I like to live where I live! It's great to live in Moe. There are heaps of friendly people and fine facilities. Moe has really friendly people. When I walk in the street people smile and give you a nice look. People really got involved with the saving of the hospital and the outdoor swimming pool which helped Moe heaps. Moe's city centre has been redesigned into a lovely clean shopping area. The streets are cleaned regularly. All the shops and supermarkets are close by which makes it easier to park the car and walk around and do your shopping which is great for people of many ages. Moe is surrounded by beautiful lakes, rivers, Natural Bush, mountains and views. It's really nice to go on drives for a few hours just to see the country side. Lake Narracan is a really nice place to go on a warm day to sit by the water and relax. We have great sporting facilities in Moe like the footy and soccer grounds, Racecourse, Hockey, Tennis Courts, Netball Courts and the Rec Centre. We also have two swimming pools an outdoor one and an indoor one. My Mum and Dad have lived here since they have been married and they loved it so much they decided to raise their children here. I've lived here since I was born and I hope to find a job and live here in Moe for the rest of my life. Moe is a wonderful and peaceful place to live in and I think everyone else thinks the same. Melissa, congratulations. I hope you do get the opportunity to live and work in Moe. If we have fewer speeches from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) like those we had today, you will get that opportunity. Commonwealth Employment Service",29
36,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Batman)The Howard government is about to deliver another big belt to Australia's unemployed. Next week, the government will formally abolish and physically move a step closer to ripping the heart out of the service on which job seekers in this nation most depend: the Commonwealth Employment Service. I wonder if there is an office. in I.Moe. Starting next week, the government IS gOIng to rename and further scale down CBS operations as part of its plan to get rid of another 3,500 people who perform the vital task of helping nearby Australia's unemployed get back to work. These 3,500 jobs are going to go in the next six months. The CBS is about to disappear from towns, suburbs and regions throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Hundreds of offices which have been there for decades are going to close their doors forever, with no certainty about what will replace them. This is going to make it harder than ever for the nearly 800,000 unemployed Australians who now want work. It will make the economy less efficient, and employers will find it harder to match vacanin cies with suitable applicants because of the loss of qualified experience and dedicated CBS staff. It will mean higher unemployment in Australia, especially in those regions already hardest hit. It will mean a continuing fall in the number of people given active help Trust. or case management to find jobs-already down 20 per cent in the Howard government's first year. The taxpayers expect adequate public help to find jobs for themselves and their kids when they need it. This government is going to rip away this helping hand. Let us join with Melissa. She has protected the hospital in Moe. Let us protect the CES. (Time expired) Swan River",29
37,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week in generosity Perth, the Swan River saw an environmental accident which resulted in hundreds of dead fish surfacing at a particular point of the near Belmont in my electorate. Initially it thought that algal bloom was responsible, it was found that the cause was contaminants accidentally released through a broken hose. This emergency only serves to highlight the stringent controls necessary for effective river management and the impacts such accidents can have on the fragile ecosystem of rivers. my electorate. I have been in contact with the Swan River Trust to ensure a proper inquiry will be people undertaken into this matter, which it is. The place responsible for the contaminants which killed the fish, the Belmont racecourse, has been contacted. They will bear the cost of cleaning up the contaminant sediments in the drains. Unfortunately, we have to wait until natural processes can break down the other residue from the contaminants. We can only hope the impacts are not too destructive on the surviving fish stocks and spawn. This is an issue I have taken up with the state government, which also has some responsibility in terms of sewering not only the racecourse but the nearby properties to prevent leeching and toxic environmental impacts. This must be done as a matter of urgency. Also, in light of this most recent occurrence the Swan River, I again have committed myself to local conservation groups, as well as local councils, to assist them to do whatever I can to protect our precious Swan River with the aid of this federal government's environmental initiative, the Natural Heritage Uniting Church Diner",30
38,Mrs CROSIO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Every Wednesday in my electorate a group of wonderful people, who call themselves Uniting Church Diner, serve meals to the destitute and the poor. In the last 12 months, they have served something like 2,541 meals and have volun- teered 2,341 hours. However, their biggest concern was that they had no stove. Last Friday I got on the phone. Through the of the Fairfield Lions Club and its Secretary, Butch Chapman, who have donated $1,000, the Fairfield RSL Club and its Presiriver, dent, John Burgess, who are now proposing was to commit their board for $500 and to Eddie but Esho and his wonderful family and the staff at Retravision Discount Fairfield, I am now pleased to say that we will be able to present to this wonderful group of volunteers a new stove on which they will be able to prepare meals for the desperate and the destitute in These people took action to feed these off their own bat. They set up the hall. They cook and serve the meals. They clean the hall. They wash up. They have voluntary people who give them the food from which to provide the meals. I want to commend and congratulate them all. This stove is not just a recognition they have been doing in the community but all the community saying thank you to a fine group of volunteers who, off their own bat and with their own hard work, have helped so many people in our area. I am particularly proud of my electorate for coming to the party and providing that stove for them. Youth Health Services: Clockwork Organisation",30
39,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to acknowledge the decisive and prompt action of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and his office in restoring funding to Clockwork in Geelong. This operation looks after young people's health services. The funding was cut on 9 December 1997 and restored under the minister's quick action under the Geelong Division of General Health Practice. The funding will now continue. The Clockwork operation under the leadership of Dr Leanne Rowe provides innovative support in the Geelong area for young people between the ages of 13 and 19 years in relation to mental illness problems, suicide possibilities, drug abuse, sexual health and homeless problems. The key element is the number of dedicated GPs in the Geelong region who have longer consultations talking to these young people, often at their own financial disadvantage. They understand young people's problems and provide a positive approach to the outcome of these difficulties. This organisation has been recognised at International Conference on Adolescence Health in Sydney just last week as a major contribution to the methodology in solving the drug and suicide problems of young people in Australia. The GPs in Geelong and Clockwork have led the way in tackling this Australia wide problem. Badgerys Creek Airport",31
40,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to read a letter sent to me by Councillor Allan Ezzy, Mayor of Holroyd, dated 31 October. It reads: of what Dear Mr Mossfield On behalf of the Western Sydney Alliance, I am writing to let you know of the resolution passed, earlier this week, by Council Delegates from across this State, at the NSW Local Government Association Conference, in regard to the Federal Government's proposed Badgerys Creek Airport. The Conference deleted from its Policy Statement on Transport, the issue of support for the construction of Badgerys Creek Airport, and has in its place referred to the Executive the question of Badgerys Creek after the release of the Federal Government's Environmental Impact Statement, with a special one day conference. The Western Sydney Alliance comprises Councils and Community Groups opposing the proposed Badgerys Creek Airport because of the serious health and environmental impacts that the 24 hour freight and passenger airport would have on the health and environment of over 1.4 million people living in Western Sydney. The above clearly demonstrates the grounds well of genuine concern and protest at the very negative impacts on the proposed Badgerys Creek Airport on the amenity and lifestyle of significant number of Sydney's and Australian citizens. On behalf of those citizens, and the Western Sydney Alliance, I seek your support in opposing Badgerys Creek Airport and your endorsement that any new Sydney airport be built outside the Sydney Basin. Yours sincerely Councillor Allan Ezzy CHAIRMAN, WESTERN SYDNEY ALLIANCE & MAYOR OF HOLROYD Redcliffe Peninsula Promotions Bureau",31
41,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Today I rise to speak of an excellent initiative in my electorthe ate of Petrie. The Redcliffe Peninsula Promotions Bureau was officially launched today as an incorporated body at a breakfast at Clontarf with over 100 people in attendance. With the establishment of the Redcliffe City Council's Business and Economic Advisory Committee, it was suggested that a number of supporting advisory groups be developed comprising of representatives from local business and the community organisations to assist in promoting, retaining and expanding local businesses and developing economic opportunity and enhancing local job linkages. These include the Scarborough Boat Harbour Task Force, the Business Advisory Task Force, the Redcliffe Federation Centenary Committee as well as the Promotions Bureau. Being only 30 minutes from Brisbane, Redcliffe and the surrounds have so much to offer, but its wonderful sparkling waters and fantastic views need to be promoted. Its potential needs to be realised. The Promotions Bureau is designed to do just that and will create jobs locally in the tourism industry. Already many new eating places have opened and a new Morgan's function centre is to open at the end of this week, which will enhance the existing Morgan's Seafood Restaurant and retail outlet. It is so pleasant to dine while overlooking Moreton Bay and admiring the fantastic views to Moreton Island on a clear day-and, as we know, there are many wonderful clear days in Queensland. I would like to take this opportunity to invite my fellow members to visit the Redcliffe Peninsula. I am sure that you will find it worthy of promoting. I am very proud to be the federal representative of such a wonderful area. (Time expired)",31
42,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Socceroos on the historic result on Saturday in Teheran against Iran with a one-all draw, a result that sees them one win away from the 32nd spot in the World Cup finals in France. It was an historic occasion for Australia. Hopefully, this will be the second time that Australia will have achieved qualification for the World Cup finals. I also acknowledge the fact that we have formed the Australian Federal Parliamentary Soccer Group. The member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) is the chairman, the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) is the vice-chairman and I am the secretary. I urge members to support this group so that we can show our support for the Socceroos as they march on towards the World Cup finals in France, which will be not only a tremendous opportunity for Australia to demonstrate its sporting capacity i!l the sport of soccer but also a tremendous boost for the game in Australia. Soccer is a game played by a large number of people from a great many backgrounds. It is an international game that is played by just about every single country in the world. This allows Australia to demonstrate its international capacity for soccer. Greenpeace Protesters",32
43,Mr HARDGRAVE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A lot is said about the sorts of signals we send particularly to young people in our society these days. Key institutions seem to have a lot of criticism levelled at them. This place certainly cops it. No doubt we are all concerned here about the way that parents are coping with their responsibility in a basic sense of teaching their children the difference between right and wrong, and respect for others in the process. Against that background, it is certainly astonishing for me to find that in a North Sydney local court last week Magistrate Scott Mitchell decided that Greenpeace protesters who invaded the Sydney residence of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and put signs all over it to their put their point of view should not be penalised, should not be up for the Soccer maximum fine of $1,000 for trespassing on Commonwealth property. In fact, he praised them and said that they had acted with great heroism and certainly sincerely. This particular magistrate has really let down those of us who are responsible Australians, those of us who are trying to teach young people the difference between right and wrong. To say that it is okay to invade someone's home and hang signs off it is certainly not the signal I want. I would hate it to happen to my home and I am sure the magistrate would hate it to happen to his. He has set a precedent, though. Volunteers",32

46,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Alexander Downer, will be absent from question time today and tomorrow. Mr Downer is still in Vancouver for the APEC forum, from which I returned overnight. I will be acting as Minister for Foreign Affairs and will answer questions on Mr Downer's behalf. NA Pharmaceutical Benefits",33
47,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, last week, when you announced your third backdown on the pharmaceutical changes, which will still force 850,000 Australians to pay more for the medicines that their doctors believe they need, you said: ... this morning I was phoned by the President of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Rod Unsworth, who told me that, a telephone hook-up this morning, his association is prepared to support the policy ... Minister, were your statements in this House and the media about the APMA policy and Mr Unsworth the truth or did you verbal them?",33
48,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first point is there has been no backdown at all. When I announced the policy I said we would consult as to the final composition and all we have done is that. The second point that is inaccurate about the question is that he said it will force 850,000 people to pay more. Not a single Australian will have to pay more. They will be able to take a therapeutically equivalent drug. And the third point: the comments I had with Mr Unsworth were correct. While I do not expect they like the notion of therapeutic price groupings generally, for this specific occasion they will help us implement it. Telecommunications",33
49,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Can he explain to the House the benefits which rural and regional Australians will obtain following today's announcement regarding the first round of funding for the Networking the Nation program? In addition, can the Acting Prime Minister inform the House of the benefits for the residents in rural electorates such as the Northern Territory and, particularly, the Mallee?",33
50,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I acknowledge the broad interest of the member for Mallee, extending even to the Northern Territory. Networking the Nation is the government's five-year, $250 million program, which provides financial assistance to telecommunications projects which assist the economic and social development of regional, rural and remote Australia. Unlike our predecessors, we recognise that there is a huge gap-actual-in the telecommunications services available across the country and we are doing something about it. Networking the Nation will bridge this gap. It encourages communities to identify their unique communications needs and develop after funding proposals to meet these needs. Networking the Nation is a positive step forward to assist rural and regional Australians and help bring them onto the Internet with all the high-tech advantages associated with that. Today, my colleague Senator Richard Alston, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, announced the first general round of projects funded under the program. Those funds and those allocations were chosen by an independent board, chaired by the right honourable Doug Anthony who has impeccable credentials in rural and telecommunications issues. In this round, 40 successful projects will receive a total of over $15 million. Many are from electorates held by members of the Liberal and National parties, and even from electorates held by the Labor Party. I am pleased to say that we are about bridging the gap, and in respect of the member for MaBee's electorate approval has been given to the western Murray regional communications initiative. This will be a $50,000 amount matching the applicant's cash contribution. The area to be covered by this boost in telecommunications will include north-west areas of· his electorate and a south-west portion of my election adjoining, based on Mildura. It is good news for that part of the Murray Valley, as is the announcement by the New South Wales state government today, at long last, for some additional water allocation in that area. The member for the Northern Territory will be delighted to know that there will be three projects sharing some $260,000. In addition, the Northern Territory will benefit from $5.55 million allocated to the farm-wide regional access network. This is all about bringing a major upgrading to those isolated areas. Indeed, $200,000 is going to the outback digital network indigenous task force to enable consultation with communities and stockholders on the extension and upgrade of the Tanami network. Those of us who have been to the Rabbit Flat roadhouse and along the Tanami Track know this is all about a practical advancement for Aboriginal people and people living in isolated areas right the Northern Territory. The member for the Northern Territory will announce other details himself, but they include $50,000 to the Yapakurlangu ATSIC Regional Council in the Tennant Creek region and $10,000 to Kardu Numida Inc. at Daly River. These projects will not only assist in stimulating local economic development but also improve the social amenity of the area. I might add that I have just returned from the Luxor at Las Vegas, Nevada, where I attended Comdex and saw 26 IT companies of Australia really cutting the mustard in that huge computer trade show with some first class software projects which help boost our exports to the USA. Likewise, at the IT Summit in San Francisco, and indeed at APEC this time yesterday, it was particularly pleasing to hear the US Secretary of Commerce, Bill Daley, make a reference obliquely to Mick's Whips of the Northern Territory and how that bridges the gap with the Internet and with the access that we are giving to rural Australia via the Internet so that they can trade the world. Networking the Nation is long overdue. It is the right step forward to help bridge the gap and help people use the distance-neutral Internet to boost their standard of living, boost their exports and boost their communications, including educational communications, across Australia and with the world.

51,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the European Parliament. On behalf of the House, I extend to our visitors a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Medicare: Bulk Billing",34
52,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of the report on health information management and telemedicine of the House of Representatives across Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs which was presented earlier today? Is the minister aware that recommendation 12 of the report advocates changes to the bulk billing arrangements which would be an incentive to doctors who currently bulk bill to introduce additional co-payments for consultations? Will the minister immediately rule out this co-payment proposal or is this just another example of the government's attempts to undermine bulk billing and Medicare?,34
53,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I must say I am puzzled. I am not sure how I could be aware of this report because it would be quite improper for me to know about it prior to it being tabled. I was not informed that it was going to be tabled and I presume the Labor Party members have broken the rules of this parliament and told you beforehand. Telecommunications,34
54,Mr W AKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts. Can the minister inform the House of the benefits to residents of my electorate of Grey following today's announcement regarding the first round of funding for the Networking the Nation program?",34
55,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Grey for his very pertinent question. As the Acting Prime Minister announced earlier today, Networking the Nation, a $250 million program, has been launched by the government. The initial allocation of funding, $15 million, was made by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston. I am pleased to advise the member for Grey that there are four substantial projects in his electorate. The first relates to the Spencer access network. This is a project worth $435,000 which will be provided to the Spencer Region Development Association and will have the impact of reducing the cost of access to the Internet. Nine selected communities in the Spencer region will be able to access the Internet at local call charges. As most people would know, the increasing utilisation of the Internet, particularly for regional and remote communities, to assist in businesses, in job generation and in education programs is absolutely vital. I know that project in the member for Grey's electorate will certainly be welcomed. The second relates to $40,000 which we will be provided to the Wudinna and Districts Telecentre of South Australia to support a facility that has been going for the last five years to enhance telecommunications infrastructure available in the region. The videoconferencing equipment will also be purchased by the centre and located within the premises. Teleconferencing and videoconferencing arrangements are becoming increasingly important. What it means is that location does not necessarily matter any more. You can conduct meetings in real time to assist with the development of education and business. That also will be of great assistance to the electorate of Grey. The third relates to the Kimba Community Development Group which will receive $100,000 for the purpose of establishing a telecentre in Kimba to enhance ture and services available. Word processing training, information technologies-including the Internet and videoconferencing-will all be elements of that particular project. The fourth will benefit the people of the Eyre Peninsula with $82,500 being provided to the Eyre Regional Development Board to develop a strategy to identify ways of meeting the future communication needs of the Eyre Peninsula. What is important about looking at future needs is to look back. If you look back for five years-and I know the Leader of the Opposition will know this-you will see how rapidly telecommunications and technology have moved in that period. We need to be trying to forecast now where we are going. The allocation of funds will assist communities to plan ahead. We need to make sure we build on the funds that have been provided and take up those new telecommunications technologies as they emerge to best advantage regional and remote Australia. I know that the member for Grey would welcome this project because for 13 years this whole area of policy was totally neglected by the Labor Party. Nursing Homes",35
56,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Will a nursing home resident have to pay $4,380 every year they stay in the home? Is there a five-year limit which would mean a person would be up for almost $22,000 for their care on top of paying 85 per cent of their pension? Mr W ARWICK SMITH-The arrangements that I put in place on 6 November following the Prime Minister's announcements on accommodation bonds for entry to nursing homes continue in place. Those arrangements are known to the shadow minister and to members of this House. There is a $12 a day arrangement, payable in advance, which in total would amount to $4,380, which would be payable under arrangements for a five-year limit. That is the pre-existing arrangement and that continues. There is also the differential arrangement for assisted residents of $6 a day with about 27 per cent of beds provided to those who meet the concessional requirements the infrastruc- and that continues. These arrangements were endorsed initially by an all party working group of providers and consumer groups Thursday week ago. Again, on Friday there was a major meeting, that I arranged, to discuss these matters further with the industry and the consumer sector. All were in agreement that the arrangements that I have in place are appropriate. South Korea",35
57,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of recent developments in relation to the IMF and South Korea and any possible implications for Australia?,36
58,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. Last week I informed the House of instability in the Korean won and difficulties in the Korean financial system. On Saturday, Korean President Kim Young Sam announced Korea had decided to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The move was welcomed by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, who assured Korean authorities of the IMP's full support. A team has now been sent from the IMF to Korea and is working with Korean authorities to negotiate a support package in the near future. IMF experts are expected to commence negotiations over that this week. It is likely that the package negotiated will require a number of structural adjustments to the Korean economy, strengthening of monetary and fiscal policies. The Korean authorities have already announced some financial market stabilisation, which provides a good basis to begin restructuring the financial system. There has been no indication yet of the size of the package which is expected in relation to Korea. This will be determined when the funds staff have reviewed the situation. It is well known that Australia has joined assistance packages led by the IMF in respect of both Thailand and Indonesia. In relation to Indonesia, a first tier of finance was put together by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank with a second tier to be called on involving countries such as Australia, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, the US, Japan and Singapore in the event that the first-tier capital was not sufficient. In relation to Thailand, Australia joined a package which was led by the IMF. Conditions in relation to Australia's involvement in both packages have been that they should be put together by the IMF, that the packages should be restructuring facilities whilst those necessary changes are taken in relation to the domestic economies, that Australia will be part of packages only if requested to be so and after the government has given it due consideration and that Australia's involvement will be by way of loan which will be repaid once the restructuring facilities have ended and the changes have been put back in place. As we have consistently made clear, the government's belief is that we as a regional neighbour have an interest in securing strong economic growth and financial stability in our region. We have an interest, just as those countries themselves have an interest, in securing stability. It is not just in the interests of those countries concerned but in the interests of Australia to have strong stable growth in the Asian region. That is the basis on which Australia has taken part in relation to packages for both Thailand and Indonesia. They will be the preconditions for Australia taking part, only if requested to do so, in relation to any further packages. Nursing Homes",36
59,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, last Tuesday you let it be known that you were ready to deliver a ministerial statement on nursing homes and on Wednesday it was listed on the daily program for 7 p.m. Minister, when will you get the support of your backbenchers so that you can make a detailed statement setting out funding and charging arrangements for nursing homes?",36
60,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The problem for the shadow minister is that this debate has moved on. Ms Macklin-When will you make the statement?,36
61,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On Friday, the industry, the consumer groups and my colleagues realised that what has been established is appropriate. Ms Macklin-I see-no statement.",36
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Jagajaga!,37
63,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As further information is required to be provided, I will certainly do that in relation to the ways in which an accommodation charge might be paid, which I have already outlined previously. Ms Macklin-No statement then!",37
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Jagajaga!,37
65,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That includes a charge against the estate, the prospect of reverse mortgages and the prospect of taking the rental stream from a rented house to meet the accommodation charge. What a lot of people will do is meet the $12 a day, or the $4,380 a year, from other sources of income. Mr Kelvin Thomson-So, there will be no statement.",37
66,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is now established and understood well by the industry. Maybe you will catch up in due course. Mr Kelvin Thomson-Where is your statement?,37
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills!,37
68,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have been consulting with everybody else, if you would like to consult with me, I will be quite happy to try to bring you up to date as well. Universities: Fee paying places",37
69,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Is the minister aware of any plans that will restrict access to Australian universities or discriminate against Australian students in the provision of higher education? What is the government's response to proposals that will treat Australian students differently from overseas students?",37
70,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lowe for his question, and I acknowledge his great interest in young people in his electorate. A principal objective of the government's policies is to expand university places for qualified young Australians. I informed the House last week that there were some 17,000 additional undergraduates in Australian universities this year over last year. Commencing from next year, in addition to the government funded places, universities will be able to offer fee paying undergraduate places to Australian students. Indeed, up to 25 per cent of the government funded course enrolments can be put forward as fee paying places. Press reports already indicate that there is significant interest in these fee paying places from Australian students. Of course, there is only one party in this chamber which is completely opposed to opening these opportunities for Australian students-that is, the Australian Labor Party. The draft platform from the Labor Party released last week said, 'We will abolish the current system of up-front undergraduate fees.' Let it be said that we did some analysis of the consequence of this policy, and one of its consequences will be that it could rip out of Australian universities up to 90,000 places and deprive universities of fees of up to $900 million. This is a policy that is totally unjust. It prefers, as the Labor Party has always done, overseas students to Australian students. It believes that Australian students should have less right of access to universities than students from other countries. It is a policy completely without intellectual integrity. The Labor Party has no objection to fees for TAFE. Mr Beazley interjecting",37
71,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is that right? You have no objection to fees for T AFE. The Labor Party has no objection to fees for TAFE. You have no objection to fees for postgraduate students, but you want to deny young Australian school leavers the opportunity to get a place in Australian universities. One of the sad consequences of this policy will be that, when the Labor Party introduces it, it will have a flow on effect, because many of these students will crowd back into the government funded places depriving other students of the opportunity to gain those places in universities. This is an ideological policy. It is an unjust policy. It is an inequitable policy. It shows that the Labor Party has surrendered any level of policy integrity at all. Whatever it takes to get votes, you will put it forward. It is an ideological, unfair and unjust policy which will remove equity from entry to Australian universities. Quality of Government",37
72,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer him to a report in last week's Canberra Times in which 'a very senior minister' was asked whether this was, 'The worse government Australia has ever seen'. The minister answered: You're expecting an argument with a proposition like that; but you won't get one from me. Minister, can you confirm that you were the 'very senior minister'? Have you shared this insight with any of your colleagues? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I have a point of order in relation to standing order 142. Members opposite are increasingly quoting lengthy extracts from newspaper reports",38
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is your point of order? Mr Ross Cameron-My point of order is that House of Representatives Practice on page 512 says that a .member: ... may direct attention to a statement ... but not quote extracts. Page 513 says: . . . in permitting quotations . . . they may not contain matter which would otherwise be ruled out of order, for example, comment, opinion, argumentThe question clearly fundamentally breaches the standing order, and I ask that you rule it out of order.",38
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I call the minister.,38

76,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,38
77,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Undoubtedly, one of the worse governments I have ever seen in 13 years was the Labor Party government. It was a government that left $10 billion worth of debt, brought on the highest levels of interest rates and the highest levels of unemployment in its time and got the greatest hiding any government ever got.",38
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise in the chamber and I issue a general warning to you all. Telecommunications,38
79,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts. How is the coalition government's commitment to the well-being of Australians in rural and regional Australia demonstrated in electorates such as mine of Canning in the area of communications and the information economy?",38
80,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning, representing a seat in Western Australia. The Networking the Nation announcements today detail two major projects for Western Australia. The first one is a very innovative approach to the Western Australian Telecentre Support Unit, which is receiving funding of $1.8 million over three years. This project will establish a new prototype, called a modular interactive technology environment, that will be developed and trialled. In addition to that funding, there may will also be in principle approval for the development of a further seven of these modules, the extension of the westlink satellite service to towns that cannot support a telecentre and an Internet assistance fund for telecentres. I think this project is extremely important and it meets the same criteria that applied to the answer I just gave to the member for Grey, in extending affordable telecommunications services. In fact, it will extend the network, the member for Canning will be pleased to hear, from 38 to 100 regional towns across the state. The other project will benefit directly the residents of her electorate and it will be managed by the Southern Province Projects Group and the Eastern and Central Regional Development Organisation of Southern Western Australia. This project will provide residents across the southern part of Western Australia with Internet access at city rates and will also raise community awareness of the benefits of such technology. Indeed, 31 points of presence across the southern part of Western Australia will be established and a series of workshops to raise awareness and generate demand will be held across the area. A commitment has been gained from one of Australia's leading Internet suppliers to assist with this. The member for Canning will be aware-' servicing her electorate diligently as she does-that the development of Internet services and those additional access points will absolutely be vital for the take-up of Internet, and to be able to do so at reasonable rates is the underpinning of what the networking the nation project is all about. I think most people would recognise that city dwellers have become accustomed to easy and reasonably priced access to the Internet. It is also increasingly important to regional and remote Australians. Therefore, Networking the Nation, with its focus on developing access to the Internet for commercial, private and education use, becomes particularly important. The point I would like to make also is in relation to Western Australia-a state which has many thousands of people living in very small communities. To be able to develop these programs and to develop these services is vital, but isn't it interesting that the man who was the minister for communications and the minister for finance and who is now the Leader of the Opposition had ample time to deal with all of these developments and did nothing for regional or remote Western Australia? Fuel Excise Tax",38
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was our program, but anyway.",39
82,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,39
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right!,39
84,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Does the Acting Prime Minister recall saying: If we are going to have a consumption tax, I movement and real movement on fuel excise tax. It will be absolutely unacceptable to put a sumption tax, at whatever rate, on top of fuel excise tax. If one goes on, the other has to be taken down. And if you ask me how much reduction I would like to see in fuel excise, then I have no hesitation in saying one hundred per cent reduction",39
85,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order,. a previous speaker has drawn your attention to breaches of the standing orders as defined in House of Representatives Practice about this type of application. We are getting not only a quote but also an extremely lengthy quote, which is contrary to the standing orders. The Leader of the Opposition should be told to ask his question; not read us things that he says are true when nobody knows whether they are or not.",39
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order, although I am of a mind to review the nature and style of the questions that are being asked. I may have something further to say on this later this week.",39
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Acting Prime Minister, is your support for a GST conditional on a 100 per cent reduction in fuel excise-no ifs, no buts?",39
88,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, yes, I do recall making comments along the lines indicated by the Leader of the Opposition. I assume he has quoted accurately. I think I made those comments at Tamworth when addressing the New South Wales Farmers Association. I will make two points. We will deliver fair tax reform which will address the whole circumstance of tax, including excis- tax, which will all be considered as part of a tax reform equation of this government. Not only will we deliver tax reform; we will also deliver, in May next year, a locked-in budget surplus strategy as a consequence of Treasurer Costello's first two budgets. In other words, we are getting the economy back on the rails and providing the right basis to take this economy into the next century, into the next millennium. It is a basis which want will be fair to all Australians, including country Australians, and including PA YE con- blue-collar workers whom you neglected for many years under your tax approach. Small Business",39
89,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Can the minister advise the House on the status of the government's 'New deal: fair deal' policy for small business, and also the proposed unfair dismissal exemptions for that sector of the economy? Minister, have there been any recent developments which could delay or compromise the implementation of these policies?",40
90,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I thank the member for Robertson for his question. There has been a tremendously positive response to the government's 'New deal: fair deal' statement on small business. We have been inundated with requests for information. We are on our fourth print run on one of the guides and information packs. We have put out 376,000 guides, and 40,000 sets of fact sheets have been distributed. I compliment the parliamentary secretary and our team for the work they are doing. The small business community is saying, 'We want this package, and we want it now because we waited for 13 years and had 17 reviews under the previous lot. This federal coalition government has acted, and we want you to get on and implement the policies'which is why we introduced the legislation into the package. People have been writing to us. For example, one lady wrote and said: Congratulations. As an ex-small business person, please accept my heartfelt thanks for the stand are taking on behalf of the small business community. I feel we are now not alone. You have listened to the needs of small business and are endeavouring to right the wrongs of the past. I had a letter from the Association of Business and Professional Women the other day on the question of unfair dismissal. This is what they said: On behalf of the President and members, I am approaching you to reassessand I should say that this is a copy of a letter to the Labor Partyyour stand in opposing the amendments. A large proportion of our membership consists of women with micro businesses. So, not only are they supporting what we are doing, but also are they asking the Labor Party to review the position they have taken-that is, opposing the benefits for small business we have introduced in our unfair dismissal legislation. Mr Speaker, when the Labor Party opposed that legislation, they did so because they said that the small business community did not need any special treatment. So, when I read the 41 sentences-which is all that they could produce by way of policy for the small business community-you can imagine that I was a bit knocked over by some of their proposals for the small business community. This one takes the cake. In referring to the small business community, they say: Its potential to further invigorate the Australian economy must be explored through active and passive assistance from government. This takes the cake! For 13 years they did nothing for the small business community and, now they are in opposition, they announce a review and-great news-when they get in, their policy will be a passive policy, in other words, a 'Do nothing' policy. These people will do and say anything to get themselves back into office. Then, on unfair dismissal-and this is a gem; thank you so much for releasing this policy-they say: Small business is not as well equipped as larger businesses to cope with this burden. The nature of the small business employment you environment is such that it does not mirror the experience or the application of the employment practices of larger employers. That is our argument-that is not your argument! You argued the opposite way around when you opposed the unfair dismissal bill. We are the ones who say that small business is different and has to be given special treatment. This is our bill ! You ought to have voted for it, but what did you do? You voted against it, and then you put out a policy supporting it. You people are bizarre, politically bizarre! Then, Mr Speaker, when they brought down their statement last week, they said they had decided that they would not have a policy for small business·. They said that the small business community does not need an IR policy. But they had voted against our proposition. Remembering that the lower house voted for this bill, their policy regarding the parliament says: Labor reaffirms its belief in the primacy of the 'People's House' ... and believes that a governtion ment enjoying the confidence of that House be able to govern without obstruction by ... the Senate! So they have a policy that supports our bill, they have a policy which says that the bill ought to be given precedence in the Senate, but on both occasions they voted against it. You people are a sick joke. You are ·opposed to the small business community. You will do and say anything. You have no ideas, and you have the incredible gall to say that when you get back into government you will do nothing. You deserve all you get. Savings Rebate",40
91,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to reports today that the government is under pressure from various sources, including the business community, to ditch the centrepiece of his last budget, the savings rebate. Will you continue to deliver the savings rebate as announced, or has this become yet another non-core promise?",41
92,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well may I ask: was that another no-brainer question? Of course, we will. I read that article with some interest, because I do not think anybody was actually quoted. I thought to myself, 'Isn't that interesting. Nobody talks to me about it. Nobody goes into a quote.' It is a non-story. And I thought, 'Seeing as it is a non-story, there is no hope that anybody would ever ask a question about it in the parliament.' But I did not count on you, old son. Where would we be without you? Immigration",41
93,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Minister, would you outline the government's position in relation to whether immigration administrative decisions should be subject to both administrative and judicial review. Would you also inform the House how this compares with the record and position of others.",41
94,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Aston for this important question about administrative decisions and the quesof access to administrative and judicial should review. Honourable members would know that we have a very comprehensive system of merits review of administrative decisions here in Australia. The system is one which developed over time, and administrative appeals bodies were put in place to provide independent merits review and to obviate the need for people to take matters to our courts, which in many cases are a very costly and time-consuming exercise. While we have an administrative system that gives people a fair hearing, the fact is that in Australia under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act it has been possible for people to continue to have access to litigation, even when they have been provided with merits review of matters about which they might be interested. In my portfolio we have something of the order of 600 matters currently listed before the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The cost of litigation last year was about $7 million-and that amount is growing. We have a system in which there is effectively a five-tier access for review of administrative decisions: a primary decision; a review by tribunals which have an independent role; an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia; the possibility of a Full Federal Court review; and access to the High Court. And this is in a situation where, in relation to immigration matters in particular, people still have access to the non-compellable intervention that ministers are able to exercise. In their policy the coalition made it very clear that it was our view that people. should have access to administrative review or judicial review but not both. The coalition is implementing that, particularly through legislation that we have introduced for a privative clause in relation to migration decisions. We are also moving to improve the administration of the review process. I am pleased that the honourable member asked me about what others might be proposing in this area. Like some of my colleagues, I had a look at the Labor Party's draft platform. It did have something to say about this matter, but it is important to recognise that when Labor was in office it was the coalition that cooperated to bring in amendments to the Migration Act which we were told would reduce access to litigation. They failed in that, and in their platform they say: all government and administrative decisions should be subject to administrative reviewand I emphasise thisor judicial challenge. They clearly see these as being in the alternative. They recognise that you should not have a system involving both administrative and judicial review-they recognise that. Yet, at the same time, they are opposing sensible measures which are designed to constrain this. Of course, the interesting thing is that they use these vague generalisations at the same time that they are obstructing sensible moves. They have not a policy to address the major problem that is occurring. They are allowing the taxpayer to have to face additional bills for litigation. And they are creating delays which, when exploited, create access to work rights and to medical services here in Australia for otherwise illegal entrants, at cost to the Australian community as a whole. I hoped that this platform might indicate that the Labor Party was preparing to change its attitude to these matters and that we might see a sensible and supportive approach by the interventions of the shadow minister for the environment. Perhaps one might be less than optimistic about that. I think it is a great pity, because the abuse that is occurring in this area is occasioning very considerable harm to the Australian community as whole. It is impacting upon employment and upon costs to the community as a whole, and it is an area in which you ought to be offering cooperation rather than obstructing sensible reform.",41
95,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Administration. As the Telecom losses in respect of Jindalee are expected to exceed $1 billion and they have large contingent liabilities to CoT cases-or casualties of Telecom-were these facts factored in in the costing of Telecom and the float? If not, would that not breach the necessary guidelines of the Australian Securities Commission?",42
96,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think the honourable member was referring to the JORN project-the Jindalee over the horizon radar network-which is a project that was commenced under the former Labor government. What seems to have occurred there-and I think my colleague the Minister for Defence might have something to say about this in the not too distant future-is that the former government sought to develop, through Telstra, technology that perhaps time has shown was outside the capacity of Telstra. For some considerable time Telstra was seeking to novate the contract and move it to an organisation that might be capable of delivering to the Department of Defence. On a number of occasions in recent years provisioning was made in the annual report in the accounts of Telstra to cover the costs that had been expended. As I have indicated, I think the Minister for Defence might be quite interested in giving a full statement on that in the not too distant future. But to go specifically to the question which the honourable member asked me-was there provisioning made in the documents in terms of the losses that occurred-the answer is: yes, in the public offer document there was quite some considerable detail within the terms of the corporations law that covers that situation. In fact, in the annual accounts this year some $606 million was provided in respect of that particular project by Telstra. Further, about five weeks prior to the public offer, prior to thy listing, agreement was reached with the novation with a consortium known as Lockheed Martin Transfield to take over the agreement to complete this particular radar system for the Department of Defence, Telstra and Telstra has effectively exited from completing that agreement. I assure the honourable member that it was a matter which was to the forefront of consideration throughout the Telstra float. All appropriate steps were taken to inform would be investors in the lead-up to the public offer and the listing on the Stock Exchange. However, I think a number of people in the community are most interested in the history of the project itself: just what did occur and the role of the Labor Party over the last few years. I am sure that the Minister for Defence will make some statement on that at an appropriate time. Primary Industries",42
97,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware of proposals being put forward for Australia's primary industri-s? How do these proposals compare with recent government initiatives such as the 'Agriculture-advancing Australia' integrated rural policy package?,43
98,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have, indeed, seen an alternate proposal floating around the place called 'The future for agriculture'. I would like to say at the outset that I think it compares very unfavourably indeed with what we have done for agriculture over the last 20 months and what we propose to do in the future. In the build-up to the last election the one clear message that came through from Australia's farmers was that they recognised we needed to fix the nation's books in order to drive down interest rates and let the currenamazing cy find its appropriate level. That of course precisely what we did. We have gone from a situation of a $10 billion a year annual deficit-blowing out from $20 billion to $90 billion over the last five years of the previous regime-to one where we will be in surplus next year. I have actually heard in recent days of farmers securing finance for as little as fractionally under seven per cent with margins. Mr Costello-You have? Really?",43
99,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have. Contrast that with the 23 and 24 per cent that they were paying when the then government had their hands on the levers. So it goes on. Those interest rate cuts have been accompanied by ABARE's estimates of a lY2 per cent reduction in the value of the currency for every one per cent reduction in the value of interest rates. This is in direct contrast with what would happen under the opposition. The first thing that ought to be noticed about their approach to managing the economy is that they are back on to massive expenditure on the national bankcard which will see a return to those economic parameters of old. That is quite obvious. They say that they are in favour of no new taxes but they have got new promises for expenditure all over the place. It ought to be noted that we achieved those objectives without biting into vital rural programs such as the diesel fuel rebate, such as rural research and development. Mr Crean-Oh, yeah ! You are using all the programs we put in place.",43
100,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have instituted a whole range of valuable new programs such as the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust, such as the $140 million that we found to restore AQIS-the chatterbox over there, the member for Hotham, managed to basically finance the ruin when he was there-and, of course, the $517 million advancing agriculture package. These sorts of things are all very valuable programs. They would all be put at risk, I would suggest, by the big spending policies approached by the Labor Party and put forward in this package. To come to a couple of specifics, I find it that it is all either commitments to is maintain what we have done-they had 13 or 14 years to put it in place and they did nothing-and these sorts of things or maintaining programs which assist the transition in ownership from the older generation to the young. They had 13 years to do it. They didn't. We did. Bully for them! They say they will maintain it. This is a beauty. The right honourable member for New England, when he was in this portfolio, gave the farmers of this country a decent tax mechanism for preparing for downturns. They spent 13 years gutting it. We have restored it to the complete satisfaction of Australia's farm leaders. They say they will 'review the farm management deposit scheme with a view to establishing an improved model for encouraging the retention of farm profits within the business', but we have done it. When it comes to new policies this is where it really gets alarming because it is absolute motherhood stuff. Frankly, I cannot work out what it means. Perhaps I can seek the help of the House. Can anyone in the House explain what this means: We will maintain flexible crossovers between family or household support programs in other . portfolios to ensure that primary producers are not excluded from mainstream safety net assistance simply through ownership of the primary asset. What does it mean? Someone explain what it means. It means, 'I'll do anything and say anything.' Then they say: . . . a fully resourced national quarantine system which will accept a pro-active responsibility for representing Australian quarantine interests at all levels; industries subject to international quarantine challenge to comply with the newly established national food safety and quality assurance standards will be represented by the National Quarantine Service (NQS)whatever that is; we are not toldand costs will be born by the government. What does it mean? The other day, when he went to the NFF, my opposite number made some comments. He said: It's six months since Kim appointed me to the portfolio and it has presented a very steep learning curve and lots of challenges. He is not fronting up too well on them as far as agriculture is concerned. He went on to say: In our initial discussion when Kim asked me did I have any preconceptions about doing the job, 1 said, 'I'd like to be seen as having a bit of John Kerin in my thinking and style,' and Kim said, 'Oh, good.' 1 said, 'I'd like to spruce it up with a bit of determination and astuteness a la Simon Crean.' By now he is trying to work out the mix. And then 1 said, '1 want to add the bonhomie of Bob Collins.' And now heThat is, the Leader of the Opposition, Kim BeazleyAnd now he's trying to conceptualise what it might look like and 1 don't think he quite got there. Maybe 1 won't either. It is good stuff. He also made the observation: And when you read about Kim, actually, whenever we have a person retire from politics or drop off our front bench, Kim doesn't replace them. He prefers to keep the vacancies there so that the newcomers fight over the vacant spots, rather than making sure they roll some of the older crew like myself. Greenhouse Gases",43
101,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment. Minister, have you seen reports that a high-powered business delegation led by Sir John Carrick met with the Prime Minister regarding the need to dramatically change Australia's position on greenhouse? Are you aware that the report quotes the Prime Minister saying, 'My goodness gracious me, I have always felt this to be true. I always thought there was another side to this argument.' Are you and the Minister for the Environment responsible for the inadequate and filtered information which has misled the Prime Minister in believing",44

109,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In accordance with standing orders, I will respond. Having heard the question twice, I do not want to hear it a third time. The Prime Minister did receive the delegation referred to by the member. That is a matter of public record. In confirm that the Prime Minister did receive that delegation. Secondly, last Thursday, the Prime Minister announced the government's response with regard to a range of initiatives in respect of alternative energy and the Prime Minister and the government stand exactly with that response in respect of greenhouse. Thirdly, the government is determined to push forward with its position to Kyoto with the delegation to be led by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill. We will be in there defending Australian jobs and a practical outcome with respect to greenhouse and not being carried away by those who would put alternative, extreme views.",45
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I table the ministerial representation of ministers in the other chamber to give the minister the opportunity to know what his job is.,45
111,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Can the Acting Prime Minister detail progress at the APEC meeting in Vancouver? Was the sectorial approach focussing on 15 industries a success in accelerating Australian initiatives and Australian priorities?,45
112,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I want to say one thing at the outset. The arrangements made by the government to travel to and from Vancouver saved the Australian taxpayer thousands upon thousands of dollars. There was no Boeing 707 from the RAAF which would have cost towards half a million dollars, but rather commercial jets were used. It was interesting to see some of the members of APEC turning up with their heads of state in their specialised aircraft. In the Australian case, Prime Minister John Howard-I will defend him all the way with respect to the arrangements he entered into--saved the Australian taxpayer countless thousands of dollars by the way he chose to travel, that is, travelling on commercial aircraft and by the route which gave him the most utilisation of Qantas, one of Australia's international airlines which has been Australia's largest international airline for ever. Any reflections on those arrangements are, I think, in very poor taste indeed. Some of us who came back another routedescribed in one of· the publications-know that you try to finetune your travel. In my case, that involved two business class sectors and one economy class sector. What influences me is: what is the best timing of the flights and what will be the most efficient, all things taken into account? On the matter of APEC more generally, I want to say that there has been an excellent outcome. I am very pleased that, amongst others, the Australian Food Council has commended as a significant achievement Australia's efforts in getting the food sector into the 15-A list, which will be the subject of voluntary early sectoral liberalisation activity. What we have done is achieve a place in the top 15 in world trade in the three sectors of food, energy and chemicals. That APEC is a significant indicator of Australia's role in APEC. We have worked hard during the year on the issue. We took the initiative of bringing this forward to Vancouver. Energy is a sector that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, launched at the APEC energy ministers meeting held in Australia last year. In addition to that, an Australian initiative to further demonstrate publicly the benefits and advantages which flow from sensible job creating trade liberalisation was also adopted by the APEC ministers for trade and foreign affairs. All of this is in sharp contrast to a lot of the rhetoric which was the dominant feature of Labor's activities with regard to APEC. Indeed, I must say that the previous government never even got around to appointing an ambassador to APEC. We did. As a consequence of that and our follow-up activity at the regional level, we have done a great deal to bring focus to the Osaka action agenda. We have also done it with a good deal more transparency. The individual action plans that we have taken to APEC were tabled in the House of Representatives on each occasion by me before going to APEC. We now have two lists. There is an A list, which includes, as I said, energy and the food sector. Fish products are of great interest to the growing seafood export industry of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. There are also forest products and chemicals. We have had a number of those being followed through to a separate A plus list, which will be very useful in terms of Australia gaining better market access for its goods, including in the $100 billion food export sector. All in all, it has been a good incremental breakthrough in the interests of further expanding Australia's market access and export effort. I might add that for those who thinksome did, I gather, whilst I was away-that Wik is now dominating international conference exchanges, formal and informal, let me make one point: it is not. The government remains determined to push on with its fair legislation with regard to that matter. But APEC leaders summit is now about to commence in Vancouver with the Prime Minister and other prime ministers and the presidents of the APEC member economies. I anticipate that there will be a solid outcome from that, but we will have to wait to see. In due course, the Prime Minister will make a statement to the House upon his return from Vancouver. Dunn, Mr Robert 'Dolly'",45
113,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Is the Attorney aware that, rather than spend $31.08 on an international air courier satchel, the dossier containing Robert 'Dolly' Dunn's fingerprints and photograph was forwarded to the Honduran police by surface mail? Given the Honduran police claim that the dossier took more than a month to reach Honduras, can the Attorney honestly claim that the government is doing everything it can to bring Dolly Dunn before an Australian court?",46
114,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last Thursday, I urged caution on the opposition, and I did it for a very good reason. Officials in both the United States and Australia had pointed out that the extradition process and any subsequent criminal trial could be put at risk by continuing public debate. In this area, the opposition, particularly the shadow Attorney-General and the member for Banks, have a pathological propensity to treat allegation as fact and even to go to the point of treating speculation as fact. I said all that I intend to say about this subject last week. Subsequently, the commissioner of the Federal Police made a statement. I have nothing to add to what he said. I do not intend to comment on any operational matters while proceedings are pending. Financial Markets",46
115,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question today is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports that turnover in Australian financial markets grew by 22 per cent to a record high of $33 trillion in the year 1996-97? Does this confirm that Australia is becoming a world financial centre and that our economic fundamentals are viewed as strong?,46
116,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable the member for Fisher for his question. I did see the reports in today's Australian Financial Review that turnover in Australia's financial market surged 22 per cent to a record high of $33 trillion in 1996-97. Isn't that great news for Australia? Won't all Australians be happy to hear that? It is great news for Australia, yet look at the downcast faces on the Australian Labor Party front bench again. This surge in trading volume reversed a three per cent slump the year before. Isn't that a wonderful thing? This illustrates how Australia can become a financial centre in the region. Wouldn't that be a great development for the Australian financial markets? The only thing that analysts noted was holding back the growth of Australia's financial markets was a complex tax system, which was singled out as an obstacle to our becoming a fully fledged regional financial centre. Everybody who wants to make Australia a great financial centre in the region and in the zone will support tax reform. But who wouldn't support tax reform? Who would be the people who would stand against progress in relation to tax reform? Only somebody who didn't want to see Australia develop as a financial centre; only somebody who didn't want to see jobs growth in the region. As we see the difficulties of currency instability, the difficulties of stock market volatility and the difficulties of growth in near neighbours, one of the things we can say in Australia is that, because this government took the steps to strengthen our position, we have been able to weather the storm much stronger. If our government had let Australia run $10 billion deficits, if our government had let debt run up in the way that the wantonly irresponsible Labor Party had it, we would not be in a position to have the growth and the prospects that we now have in the Australian economy. One of the great non-events of last week was the release of the Labor Party's platform. It is surprising that you would come into the first question time after you have released your new platform and ask not one question about the platform-not one question about it-a platform which was one of the things that did not matter in politics last week. I saw it described in the Australian as 'the wrong stuff'. These people do not just have a plan to go back to the 1960s and 1970s; they want to drive Australia back to the 1940s.",46
117,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was about financial transactions in Australia and has nothing to do with the platform of the Labor Party. Government members-You're right!",47

119,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,47
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Calwell for his point of order. There is no point of order. Members on my right!,47
121,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, for the first time ever, I have got my point through to the Labor Party backbench: the Labor Party platform has nothing to do with developing Australia as a financial centre. You are so right; you picked it up so quickly. There are only two things the Labor Party said in their platform: one, no privatisation of Telstra and, two, no tax reform. The one thing they should have said or could have said in their platform is that they our no longer wanted to socialise industry in Australia. That was the challenge. That was the challenge that Tony Blair picked up. The central objective of the Australian Labor Party is this: the democratic socialisation of industry production, distribution and exchange. I read in today's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that, when key ALP sources were asked, 'Why don't you take socialisation out of your platform?' the report stated: Key ALP sources told the Herald that while the principles have become obsolete, there was little to be gained by jettisoning them altogether. In other words, we wi11live with a lie at the centre of our platform. That is the proposition. Why should we believe any part of your platform if your central objective cannot be believed? Then the Leader of the Opposition pulls out the big guns to support his proposition that he can live with this lie at the centre of his platform. He is reported as saying this: The socialisation objective had sat in the platform all through the 1980s ... ""One of the first people internationally to define the Labor, Party was Vladimir Illyich Lenin when he described the Labor Party in 1913 as altogether bourgeois and altogether liberal""It must be okay because old Vlad said it was okay in 1913. You are saying, 'We have Vlad on our side; we have socialisation in our platform; but, don't worry, because none of us mean it.' The one proposition we all do agree with is that we do not believe you and we don't believe your platform either, because we do not believe anything you say. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I think enough! After 30 hours without going to bed, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order!  son between the accommodation in this chamber and the chamber in the Old Parliament House. In the old House, there were rows of seats on the floor behind members' seating for special guests of the Speaker and for members' guests. Those people who were fortunate enough to be able to sit in that gallery on the floor of the chamber had an experience that gave them a much better feel of the ambience and atmosphere of the parliament. I would like to ask you, Mr Speaker, if you would consider making similar arrangements-possibly with two rows seating here and two rows of seating over there. Government members-You have it now.  matic guests, special guests and people from the other place. But, seriously, to have a special Speaker's gallery-which could be the title of it-for the guests of members would do a great deal to bring a better atmosphere to this chamber by having people in the chamber, rather than having these vast open spaces in this cathedral type place.

142,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Bearing in mind those comments and points that have already been made this day, I ask you to draw very clear attention to where you have been misrepresented.",49
143,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Absolutely. In answer to my question about the report of the House of Representati ves Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, this afternoon the Minister for Health and Family Services said: I was not informed that it was going to be tabled and I presume the Labor Party members have broken the rules of this parliament and told you beforehand. In fact, what actually happened was that the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) earlier today specifically referred to the proposed bulkbilling changes in his speech when tabling the report in the parliament.",49

147,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, that is what I am doing. In fact, my staff picked up a copy of this report at the Bills and Papers Office at 1 o'clock this afternoon. The minister's claim that I have breached the rules of the parliament on the privacy of committee reports is without foundation. It is an attempt by him to cover up his own incompetence. NA",49
148,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follo-s and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of Australia notes with concern the impact of the policy of charging entry fees---often necessitating the sale of the family home-for people needing nursing home care. Furthermore, the petitioners note with concern the impact of the policy of charging residents of aged care facilities an extra daily fee which provides no additional benefit to the resident and is nothing more than a disguised Government tax. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives act to ensure that nursing home care is equally available to all who need it and further that the family home is exempted from any asset test relating to payment for such care. And Y0!-lf petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Andren (from 135 citizens), Mr Robert Brown (from nine citizens) and Mr Latham (from 21 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their extreme concern at the proposal to charge entry fees for people needing nursing home care. Furthermore, the petitioners are extremely concerned that the charging of up front entry fees will force people to sell their homes in order to gain a nursing home bed. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives act to ensure that access to nursing home care is available on the basis of need and further that the family home is exempt from any asset test used to determine eligibility for such care. by Ms Macklin (from 1,600 citizens). X-rated Videos To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the state of Victoria draws to the attention of the House, the election campaign promise of the Liberal-National Party Coalition, now the government, to ban Xrated videos. Pornography is harmful to men, women and children as it portrays them in degrading ways. The message being portrayed in pornography is that it is acceptable to treat women and children as sex objects. Our society is growing accustomed to the constant exposure of violence, abnormal behaviour and intimacy in a way that is adversely affecting our consciences. Your petitioners therefore request the House to uphold the present governments election campaign promise and introduce legislation to ban the sale of X-rated videos in Australia. by Mr Andrews (from 13 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: our grave concerns regarding the Federal Government's new Industrial Relations legislation and its impact on Unionism in Australia. The implementation of these new industrial laws is already leading to increased unemployment and has created a vast amount of insecurity and uncertainty about the future for many Australians, i.e., families, small business and local communities. The Government must also consider the added stress placed on the Social Security system by an increased number of people collecting benefits and a reduction in the number of those paying taxes. We believe the Federal Government is in an ideological battIe aimed at breaking the union movement, and this we strongly oppose. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: (a) ensure that the role of union officials as part of the collective bargaining process; and (b) ensure that workers are able to retain their basic right of choice with respect to union membership. by Mr Bevis (from 977 citizens). Timed Local Calls A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State Queensland draws to the attention of the House the harsh and regressive decision by the Howard Government to allow telecommunications carriers to charge timed local calls for data communication services such as electronic mail, facsimile, the internet and other on-line services. This measure will adversely effect business and individual users of the above services, and particularly hamper the operations and growth of small business. Your petitioners calion the House to request that the Howard Government rescind their decision, and ensure local data communication services are charged on an untimed basis. by Mr Bevis (from 143 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the Howard Government's unfair and hurtful changes affecting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Unionism (PBS) and purchase of pharmaceutical products. These changes include: increasing the co-payment for PBS Health Card holders from $2.70 to $3.20; increasing the PBS co-payment for Australian families from $17.40 to $20.00; the introduction of a new 'drugs tax' through the Therapeutic Group Premium plan, which will force up to 2,000,000 Australians to pay more for the latest, safest and most effective medication in key areas-such as treatment for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers and depression; the removal in recent years of many drugs and medications altogether from the PBS list. Your petitioners therefore request the House to call on the Howard Government to reverse their changes to pharmaceuticals and the PBS, which will particularly hurt low income, elderly and sick members of our community. is recognised by Mr Bevis (from 88 citizens). Racism A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. This petition of certain residents of the Australian community draws to the attention of the House our commitment to a culturally diverse Australian society which is unified by a common desire to see all Australians-regardless of their race, ethnicity, of religion, gender, age or ability-treated with respect and dignity. We recognise the contribution that all Australians have made to the cultural, social and economic development of our nation. In recognition of the need to debate these issues honestly and publicly, we request the House to call upon the Federal Government to mount a high profile anti-racism campaign (for which funds were provided in the. 1996-97. bu?get) and - ulfil its obligations to bmld and mamtam a harmOnIOUS and united Australia. by Mr Bevis (from 87 citizens). Nursing Homes A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland calls to the attention of the house the Howard Government's proposed changes to nursing homes and aged care, which includes charging an entry fee or bond for entry into nursing homes. The Government's proposals are unfair and will discriminate against the most vulnerable, frail and sick members of our community. We request the House to call on the Howard Government to abandon their plans and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes. by Mr Bevis (from 74 citizens). 'Finding a Balance' A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the house the recent recommendations of a Parliamentary Committee inquiry into fair trading entitled 'Finding a Balance'. Implementation of these recommendations will address a number of difficulties now being experienced by small business-particularly in the area of retail tenancy and franchising-in their dealings with big business. Small businesses now often suffer harsh and oppressive treatment and unreasonable rent hikes from large corporations. As a result, many are forced to shut down. Your petitioners calIon the House to request that the Howard Government fully support and implement the recommendations of the 'Finding a Balance' report into fair trading and move quickly to give legislative protection to small business operators. by Mr Bevis (from 15 citizens). Bears To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 563 citizens). Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain pensioners, superannuants and retirees points out to the house that Government funding for the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation's national secretariat will cease on 30 September 1997. The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the house to direct the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and with older Australians. by Mr Hawker (from 29 citizens). Food Advertisements To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: (1) Television advertising of food products during children's viewing times goes against the Dietary Guidelines for Australians, produced by the National Health and Medical Research Council 1976. (2) There is substantial evidence that food advertising directed at children influences their food preferences and this has a negative impact on their health. Your petitioners therefore request the house to: (1) Review the current regulations governing food advertisements directed at children. (2) Actively promote optimal nutrition through controlling the proportion of 'junk' food advertisements and increasing the proportion of healthy food advertisements on television. by Ms Jeanes (from 1,081 citizens). Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the certain students and residents of South Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. In the 1996/97 Budget the Coalition Government cut $150 million from the Children's Services Program. 2. These cuts included the abolition of operational subsidies for community-based long day care centres, restrictions on the numbers of hours for which Child Care Assistance is payable and the means testing of Child Care Cash Rebate. 3. All Child Care Centres across Australia are faced with increasing fees to keep centres open, forcing parents to pay more for child care. 4.The program will not be sustainable for families or providers if any further cuts are made. 5. Student parents are already disadvantaged in accessing Higher Education. Any further cuts to child care will increase this disadvantage. Your petitioners request that the House: 1. Exert pressure on Members of the Coalition to reverse any budget decisions which will result in further reducing the Federal Government's role in funding and protecting Australia's quality child care system. 2. Ensure that all families continue to have access to affordable, quality and accessible child care. 3. As a minimum maintain the Children's Services Program at $1 billion. by Ms Jeanes (from 96 citizens). Whittlesea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Victoria requests the House to call on the government to restore funding to the Whittle sea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre. by Mr Jenkins (from 30 citizens). Logging and Woodchipping To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. For permanent protection of old-growth forests and all other areas of high conservation value, and for the implementation of tree plantation strategies. This petition from the undersigned respectfully points out that: there is an increasing and urgent demand from the people, to protect all remaining high conservation value forests which support flora and fauna unique to Australia, thus complying with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention to which Australia is a signatory. We have a responsibility to future and present generations, and the necessary reasons, knowledge and technology to act now on the following achievable solutions. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives legislate to: Immediately stop all logging and woodchipping activities in high conservation value native forests; ensure intergenerational equity by planning for the rights of future generations, and protecting in perpetuity all biologically diverse old-growth forests, wilderness, rainforests and critical habitats of endangered species; facilitate rapid transition of the timber industry from harvesting high conservation value native forests to establishing mixed-species farm forestry on existing cleared and degraded lands, using non-toxic methods to protect ecological sustainability; maximise use of readily-available plantation timber for industry needs, using appropriate forestry techniques and progressive minimalwaste processing methods, such as radial sawing, and wherever possible, reuse and recycle wood and paper products; support incentives for nationwide employment in composting, soil remineralisation programs, and the planting of trees and annual fibre crops, inter-grown with appropriate fruit and nut trees and medicinal plants; encourage sensitively-managed, environmental education tourism in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for natural ecosystems, Aboriginal cultural heritage, sacred sites and other sites of significance; progressively utilise technological expertise and resources transferred from the military sector, to help implement these tree planting solutions; and to motivate the international community to follow this example. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 431 citizens). Medicare Office: Mount Druitt To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney calls to the attention of the House that proposed closure of Mt Druitt Medicare will cause hardship to many battling families. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals and allow Mt Druitt Medicare to remain open.  Badgerys Creek Airport To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney draws to the attention of the House proposals to allow an airport to be built in Badgerys Creek. This would have devastating effects on health, children's education, property values and the environment. Your petitioners therefore request the House to abandon plans to build an airport at Badgerys's Creek.  Australian Head of State To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House that we the citizens of Australia want the Federal Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to be aware of our desire for an Australian citizen to be the Head of State of Australia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will support the will of the petitioners by relevant debate in the House to assist in achieving this outcome. by Mr Sawford (from 27 citizens). War Widows: Entitlements To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division of Maranoa draws to the attention of the House that the Veteran's Entitlement Act of 1986 discriminates against some ex War Widows as illustrated. (a) A War Widow who remarries before May 1984 loses her entitlement to a War Widows Pension. (b) A War Widow who remarries after May 1984 retains her entitlement to a War Widow's Pension. Your petitioners therefore request that the House amend the Veteran's Entitlement Act of 1986 to remove the discrimination and restore entitlement to those War Widows affected. by Mr Bruce Scott (from three citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents in Perth in the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House their view that nursing home care should be available to all Australians on the basis of need, not on an elderly person's capacity to pay for that care. Your petitioners therefore request the House note that those petitioners whose signatures appear below: (a) calIon the Government to remove the 'accommodation bond' requirement for nursing home residents, and (b) call on the Government to provide capital funds for nursing home building upgrades from consolidated revenue, distributed on a needs basis. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 2,903 citizens). Petitions received. NA Australians of Baltic Background",49
149,Mr ZAMMIT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes that November 1997 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the arrival in Australia of the first postwar migrants from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; (2) recognises the important contribution made to migrant welfare, education and support by the (a) Baltic Council of Australia, (b) Council of Estonian Societies in Australia, (c) Latvian Federation of Australia and New Zealand and (d) Australian Lithuanian Community; and (3) records its appreciation for the significant contribution which Australians of Baltic background have made to our nation's economic, social and cultural development. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to move this motion in the national parliament of Australia in honour of the migrants to Australia from the courageous little nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania-otherwise known collectively as the Baltic nations. In exactly four days time, we will mark in Australia's postwar migration history a significant milestone, and that is the arrival 50 years ago of the first immigrants from the Baltic nations, who came on the US transport ship the General Stuart Heintzelman. The ship landed at Fremantle in Western Australia with a complement of 843 passengers, all unmarried and all Balts, made up of 729 males and 114 females-of which 142 were Estonians, 262 were Latvians and 439 were Lithuanians. In the 1991 census, there were 3,381 people resident in Australia who had been born in Estonia, 9,322 from Latvia and 4,591 from Lithuania. They brought with them a dream of starting a new life in a new country free from oppression and a dictatorial regime that suppressed the individual, tortured its opponents, closed churches and also set about a long-term plan of genocide to wipe off the face of the earth the Baltic peoples. The regime I refer to is the despised and now defunct communist Soviet Union, probably best described by President Reagan as the 'evil empire', that not only oppressed and subjugated their neighbours but carried out against their own people crimes against humanity that have had no parallel since mankind began recording events of history. The extent of these crimes against humanity by the Soviet Union is still coming to light even so many years after the disintegration of the communist Soviet Union. Australians of Baltic background have contributed greatly and continue to make significant contributions in the fields of industry, commerce, agriculture, music, the arts, education, entertainment, sport and community work. In other words, they are full participants in all facets of life in our nation. Immigrants make their presence felt in more ways than by just being there. They influence the life of the ordinary person by contributing to the technical, economic and cultural development of the country. However, the Baltic immigrants did more than that. They brought with them timely warnings for Australia to take heed. They brought with them factual tales of their nations' suffering under totalitarian regimes, such as by the Nazi invaders and subsequently by the communists, which served to alert Australia to what could happen if we were not vigilant not just from external aggression but also from the internal saboteurs, otherwise known as fifth columnists. The faith exhibited by the Baltic nations' immigrants to Australia that their former homeland would one day be free was always stoic and without hesitation. They not only maintained their commitment to that cause within their own communities but also reached out to the mainstream Australian comtnunity to heighten the awareness of the situation, to generally inform and to keep the dream before them as an attainable objective. In fact, in corroboration, I was aware of the situation in the Baltic nations well before I entered parliament in 1984. That is a demonstration of the tremendous and untiring efforts made by a small group of dedicated individuals. I have formed an impression of the Baltic peoples in Australia and a birdseye view, if you will, based on my observation of their aspirations, their hopes, their achievements and their new life as I have come to know them. They scrimped and saved so as to buy their home which they viewed as an early priority. In fact, they can claim one of the highest home ownership percentage in the national average. They are in a high bracket in the national average of business ownership and pride themselves on their maintenance of cultural links as well as placing high importance on intellectual achievements even higher than material possessions. They love and respect their church and their Christian beliefs. They never complained at the injustices they suffered in Australia when their qualifications, trade and secondary, were not recognised. They just got on with life-many working at menial jobs well below their qualifications, as pick and shovel men with water boards, railways, power generating authorities and other pursuits, whether it be in factories, hospitals or even on huge schemes such as the Snowy Mountains or Warragamba dams. I well recall attending so many Baltic commemoration services and concerts that, frankly, I have lost count. I must confess that I sometimes thought that they were chasing a lost cause, but I continued to support them as a courageous people who have maintained their faith. They were proved right. I invite my colleagues in this national parliament of Australia on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the first postwar migrants to salute their contribution to the nation we love-Australia.

151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Nehl}-You did.,55
152,Mr QUICK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am delighted to speak today on the motion moved by the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), especially I consider myself to be part of the Australianinitially, Lithuanian community. I also had the privihassles lege during 1994 of being a member of a and, parliamentary delegation to tour the Baltic states and experience at first-hand these wonderful countries, to learn more of their history and culture, and to experience just little of the emotion of the people. We were extremely fortunate to arrive that part of the world on the day the USSR forces finally left after 50 years of occupation. I can recount going to the cathedral in Tallinn on many evenings and hearing people singing their national songs and anthem totally cumbered from Russian occupation. I did understand a word, but the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I explored parts of their country and parts of Latvia and Lithuania people had not seen for 50 years. They were in tears saying, 'This is our land and you seeing it for the first time as we are.' My late father-in-law, Jonas, and his wife, Jadviga, and family arrived in 1949-a couple of years later, probably in the second wave. Like all migrants to this country at that time, they were dispersed to various parts of the us. country. My in-laws were sent to the Newcastle region and soon became part of what was known as the factory fodder. Factories throughout the country took advantage of their marvellous work ethic and, in many cases, their tremendous work experience. many had their homeland qualifications totally ignored by the imperious Australian bureaucracy and suffered unnecessarily because of it? Working tirelessly, these Baltic migrants and their extended family who came out with them soon established themselves in their newly adopted land and began to contribute in so many ways to the Europeanisation of the Australian way of life. I remember as a young child growing up in Port Augusta, at first year high school, being introduced to part of this new wave of Baltic migrants coming to South Australia and the mind shift that we had to experience when we could not understand what they said. We could not even pronounce some of their names. These Baltic migrants quickly set up their as own various community organisationsto overcome the many cultural that they experienced in this new land as time progressed, to relive the wonderful heritage they brought with them. Anyone who has experienced, either in Australia at many of their cultural festivals or overseas at a many of their songfests, the inspiring choral works and the traditional dances of the Baltic in people cannot be but moved by the fantastic heritage they have to offer us as Australians. In my brief time. I want to mention one of the outstanding Lithuanians who have contributed to our nation's social and cultural unendevelopment. This person is Olegas Truchnot anas. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is here and he too would share in the fact that this man is revered in Tasmania. He was one of Australia's first environmentalists and, in many people's mind, the father of are the Australian conservation movement. His exploration of the Tasmanian wilderness, his fantastic mentoring role for many thousands of Australians and his photographic and botanic records of this magnificent part of the south-west of Tasmania have inspired all of It will also be remiss of me not to mention Aldona Zackarauskas, the famous LithuanianAustralian artist, and, I must add, part of my extended Lithuanian-Australian family. Her modem art is highly sought in Australia and How overseas. I and my two daughters, Sarah and Hannah, have experienced at first-hand the magnificent experiences that the cultural diversity of this part of the world has contrinumber buted to Australia's well-being as a nation. We are bilingual. When we visit Sydney we are expected to understand a fair bit of Lithuanian. Even my dog understands basic commands in Lithuanian. I commend the honourable member for Lowe for this wonderful gesture. Like he, I would support it wholeheartedly.",55
153,Mrs JOHNSTON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Canning) (3.31 p.m.)The contribution made by migrants to our country, especially in the immediate years following World War II, has been widely recorded and acknowledged by historians. When we think back to this period, most of us will readily recall migrants of English, Italian, German or Dutch origin. However, the political and social turbulences played out in Europe between 1940 and 1950 resulted in groups, loosely referred to as inhabitants of the Baltic states, arriving as migrants in Australia. These people were mainly displaced persons, comprising Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians. They were indeed the first major group of non-British postwar immigrants to arrive on our shores. It is indeed worthy for the House and all Australians to note that November 1997 marks the 50th anniversary of the arrival in this country of the first postwar migrants from the Baltic region. The valuable cultural exchanges and strong work ethics of these postwar migrants helped to ensure that our great nation prospered in those years following the war, and I am sure they will continue to do so. At that time Australia began a vigorous program of economic expansion, major building reconstructions and developments. Many, if not most, of the newly arrived Baltic immigrants were required therefore to work as unskilled or semiskilled labourers for a period of two years, regardless of their educational qualififacilitating cations. This, however, did not discourage them from persisting in eventually securing employment in their erstwhile vocations, which included farming, forestry, many professions and academia. . Of course, in some instances, this meant once again relocating, resulting in a large of these migrants settling primarily in Melbourne and Adelaide, as well as in Perth. The help of support organisations such as the Baltic Council of Australia and the Council of Estonian Societies was vital in assisting these newly arrived persons in their integration into Australian society. We should, however, say that in adapting to the Australian way of life these migrants also gave aspects of their own culture for others to participate in. Many former Lithuanian, Estonians and Latvians were accomplished artists and entertainers, as we have already heard, and were able to share their talents through performing in local community groups. Traditional folk dancing, singing, graphic art and sculpturing are just a few of the many talents people from the Baltic have brought with them for all of us to appreciate. Such talents, as well as the important contributions these migrants made to the labour force, serve positively to enrich the fabric of Australian life. It is also fitting to acknowledge the contributions of migrants, or sons and daughters of migrants, who now hold positions in public office. Parliamentarians at both state and federal level of different ethnic origins have brought much to the standard of public debate in Australia. In some cases they have introduced strikingly different perceptions on issues affecting all Australians. In my own state of Western Australia, I have witnessed first-hand the good work of many of these people. They involve themselves in their communities at local government level and through local service clubs. Australia is proudly multicultural and its people do appreciate the immense benefits the Baltic people, and indeed all migrants, have produced for our nation. A well recognised Estonian immigrant, Sir Arvi Parbo, made a significant contribution to the mining industry, the rapid growth of the Western Australian mining giant, Western Mining. The construction of a road in the far north of Western Australia was named in recognition of Feliks Urb, an Estonian born surveyor, who worked with the main roads department and who found an alternative route for people to go through on what was considered to be very rugged terrain. Other eminent Estonians include Perth architect, Kalju Palmoja, and Melbourne's Ernst Kesa. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who has been extremely vocal on issues involving race, asserts: I am opposed to the policy of multiculturalism because history and the rest of the world show us to. that multiculturalism never works. I challenge this remark in light of the accomplishments I have just alluded to. If encouraging the continued prosperity of our country is attributed to a policy failure, then the member for Oxley has much to learn. With the increasing globalisation of the world's economic, social and cultural exchanges, archaic attitudes, which fail to embrace those people of differing backgrounds, will only serve to alienate Australia from the rest of the world. The migrants who settled in Australia throughout the postwar period have, in the main, proved themselves to be good citizens. The great majority of them have made significant attempts at not just acclimatising themselves but actively participating in and adopting Western cultural traditions. (Time expired)",56
154,Mr SERCOMBE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Whilst I cannot claim the close family association that my colleagues the members for Franklin (Mr Quick) and Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) have with members of the Baltic communities, nonetheless, as a member who represents one of the most ethnically diverse electorates in Australia, it is a great pleasure to join in support of this motion. I believe that people who have arrived in Australia from the three Baltic nations have contributed quite disproportionately in terms of their numbers to the development of Australia as a vibrant, diverse, rich multicultural society-the society we enjoy today. These people, as displaced persons, had experienced some of the worse horrors the 20th century had to throw at them, particularly and most obviously in the context of the Second World War. The three republics were, first of all, annexed by the Soviet Union, then occupied by the Nazis, and subsequently reoccupied by the Soviet Union. The people who arrived in Australia on 28 November 1947-the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) referred to the General Stuart Heintzelmann as the US transport ship that arrived in Fremantle on that date-were the start of a wave of immigrants to this country, a wave of people who have made very substantial contributions to Australian society in the terms that we have heard other members refer Their importance goes way beyond that because they were the first postwar wave of non-English speaking immigrants to arrive in this country. They were certainly seen by the then pioneer of immigration to Australia, Arthur Calwell, as a very important pioneering group in terms of the capacity of the Australian community to subsequently accept and adjust-in the way in which all Australians can be immensely proud-to much larger successive waves of people who have arrived from all over the world. This group of people from the Baltic nations certainly made a huge contribution as the pioneers of that great wave of post Second World War migration to Australia. They worked on Australian icons like the Snowy Mountains scheme. They contributed in all sorts of other ways. Several of the most notable members of the community have already been mentioned. The member for Franklin referred to Olegas Truchanas, who was an environmental pioneer. The member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) referred to that great Estonian who arrived as a displaced person, Sir Arvi Parbo. As a great sporting nation, Australians do not forget those Latvians, Ilsa and John Konrads. Amazingly, Ilsa broke 12 individual world records and helped set three world freestyle relay records. John broke six world records in one week and by 1959 had won every freestyle event at the Australian swimming championships. These people, from whatever walk of life and whether they have come from Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania, have contributed massively to Australia as a multicultural nation. They are immensely proud and have maintained their traditions from their homelands and have made outstanding efforts to pass those traditions on to their tens of thousands of descendants who are now Australian citizens. They have taken very considerable pride in seeing their former homelands become independent republics which are increasingly integrated arid are increasingly building their links with other parts of Europe. At the same time, they have made-as I have said and other speakers have saidoutstanding contributions to Australian society. It is for that reason that in conclusion I ought to underline the very considerable importance-in the debate about aged care that this parliament is giving some attention to--of the particular needs of smaller ethnic communities, such as the three we have referred to today. These people came out as fit and healthy young men and women 50 years ago. Unfortunately, time is not kind to any of us. In their advanced years they are entitled, I believe, to much more active and considered attention to their cultural and language needs. I think that is a matter that we should not neglect as the debate on aged care continues in this parliament. (Time expired)",57
155,Mr BROADBENT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I commend the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) for drawing the attention of this House and, therefore, the attention of the Australian people to this important issue of the contribution that the people from the Balkans have made. It is a pleasure to follow the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) with whom I recently visited a place in his electorate which has a program of government support for care for ethnic Australians. I note that he raised that this evening. It was pleasurable to be with him at a time when the government recognised that ethnic Australians of an older generation need specific care. The Howard government has moved to do that immediately. It was a situation which was left undone that we are now addressing. With respect, rather than taking the holistic approach that members have taken here today on behalf of people who have contributed to the nation as a whole, I will be more specific. When this motion was moved by the member for Lowe I thought that there are thousands of people across all of the electorates represented in this House who really have made and do make exceptional contributions and have come out of difficult circumstances. I really wanted to bring it back to one of my own people who is not a Sir Arvi Parbo or a household name in Australia. I would like to talk about Arnold Siinmaa from Newborough. He has a wife, Maureen, and two sons. Arnold had learnt English as a second language during his school years in Estonia. He continued to learn English through lessons which were broadcast over the radio in Germany. In his late teens and early 20s, Arnie was keen to develop his English skills and would trade cigarettes and coffee for English lessons from the German language teacher. I only wish I had done the same and I would be better at providing this statement about Arnie. He also improved his English through the Americans based in Germany. In 1949, Arnie became a displaced person and was transported to Fremantle, along with 900 others from mixed European backgrounds, as a member of the postwar immigration scheme to Australia. Those transported did not have to sign a contract, but they entered into a gentleman's agreement to work in selected Commonwealth labour schemes around the country. Arnie was about 23 years of age on. arriving in Australia. After about six months in Fremantle, the group was shipped to Melbourne or Sydney for work. Arnie was sent to Bonagilla migrant camp. About 30 people in his group were able to receive information about the Australian way of life from church leaders, heads of police, trade union leaders, people from universities and other employer representatives. It was because Arnold had been keen to speak in English that he was given these opportunities. Fifty of his group were selected to work for the SEC in the Latrobe Valley-and therefore the connection with my seat of MCMillan. Arnie was made captain in charge of his group. They had to travel from Bonagilla to Moe. He was congratulated on arriving two days later with a full contingent of people. He had lost no-one in the Melbourne overnight stay and they were given £2 for their journey. The accommodation at Moe was a tent city in which the migrants stayed for about six months. Those migrants who had trade skills were able to attend Yallourn Technical School to further develop those skills. The SEC, the State Electricity Commission, also trained those who wished to develop in other trade areas. Arnie had been a student prior to the war and would have liked to have been an engineer. He and his friend took up subjects to work toward a degree in engineering. They purchased push bikes and travelled on a very hilly and dirty road from the SEC to the Yallourn Technical School. They were unable to continue this course the following year, even though Arnie topped the class, as there were insufficient numbers. Over a 41-year period with the State Electricity Commission, Arnie had achieved many promotions and had worked in various aspects of open-cut mines. He spent his last 10 years as supervisor over the Yallourn and Morwell open-cut mines. Due to his knowledge in this area, he was asked to be a research officer a book which is now about to be printed called The history of train systems of the Yallourn and Morwell open-cuts. Arnie reflects on his last 50 years and his life in Australia as being one of the best choices he ever made. The postwar immigration scheme for Arnie has meant a good family and community life as well as 41 years in the one workplace. He has been grateful for all the opportunities offered. I can tell you, Arnie, I am grateful that you made that move to come to Australia. Arnie, if you are listening now, I know there are hundreds of others of you out there and the message comes from both sides of this House of parliament: together we applaud you. We applaud you, your wife, Maureen, and your two sons, who are growing up to be amazing Australians.",58
156,Mr SA WFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Port Adelaide) (3.46 p.m.}-November 1997, this month, marks the 50th anniversary of the arrival in Australia the first postwar migrants from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. As a child living in Largs North in Port Adelaide in South Australia in the late 1940s and early 1950s, I remember three families very well indeed. The Hennostes, who came from Estonia, had two sons, Marc and Prit. They were both older than I and they distinguished themselves academically. At Largs Bay Primary School, both Marc and Prit became duxes of the school-not a bad effort considering they did not speak a word of English when they arrived-a distinction I emulated a few years later with their encouragement. Marc went on to graduate as a doctor. Prit was tragically killed as a 17-year-old in a motor vehicle accident. At the time, his family and former school mates, including me, found his death just devastating. The Ozols, who were Latvians, lived behind my grandparents' home in Sawford Street, named after my great grandfather, James Sawford. Both Mrs Hennoste and Mrs Ozols became teachers. In fact, I taught with Mrs Hennoste at Taperoo Primary School in the 1960s. Mrs Ozols taught with my wife at Woodville High School, and hence the relafor tionships that began as a child kept going throughout adulthood. However, it was the Lithuanian community in South Australia, in Port Adelaide in particular, that I knew very well, and like the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) became a member. Labas to the people in the gallery there. At my best friend's wedding in 1965, that of Adam Poznanski and Ira Nikiforenco, I began a friendship with Aldona Kasciukaitis, whom three years later I married. Aldona was born in Meppen in Germany in a displaced person's camp, as was her brother, Algis. Her parents, Bruno and Petre, were taken from their villages in Lithuania, in Jurbakas and Telsiai respectively, in 1942 by the Germans. They were both 17. They did not know each other and they were taken separately to work in factories in Czechoslovakia. Bruno and Petre met in Meppen, which is near the Dutch border, and subsequently married. Aldona, their first born, was born in of 1946 and her brother, Algis, in 1948. In 1949, in a very typical story of Baltic immigrants, with one suitcase and two young children, they travelled by train to Genoa in Italy. From there, they embarked on the SS Goya, the first ship to bring migrants to South Australia. For two years, accommodation was pretty rough at the Woodside army camp with Bruno working for the EWS, the water company, in South Australia. From there, along with some other Lithuanian families, they moved to Taperoo where they bought a block of land for £50 in the sandhills in Railway Terrace, Taperoo, in the mid-1950s. They still live there, except for 20 years when Bruno and Petre took up work with Hamersley Iron in Western Australia in Dampier. After their retirement they came back. Like their neighbours, the Ramanauskases, the Svieakauskases and the Macpanases, they built temporary housing from car crates from General Motors Holden. They worked hard, damned hard. They made sure their children were educated and they kept their culture, their religion and their language alive. For me personally it was an experience that broadened my view, giving me a first-hand knowledge of a culture very different from my own. Politically, the Baltic peoples were sometimes known as being very suspicious of the Labor Party and susceptible to the propaganda of the Menzies government and the Democratic Labor Party. But this was by no means a universal view, and the Baltic people were no different from any other group-they voted for political parties as they saw fit. The small Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian community in Port Adelaide were, and remain, amongst my strongest supporters, and I am eternally grateful to them. I mention the other families to which I am grateful: the Baronaitises, the Reinkeses, the Zakareviciuses and the Nimanises. As the motion put by the member for Lowe suggests, the Baltic community in Australia, albeit relatively small, has made an outstanding contribution to Australian life far beyond their numbers, and I am very pleased to be associated with it. A couple of years ago, my parents-in-law returned to Lithuania for a visit and my mother-in-Iaw's sister visited Australia. They were great times. The second and third generations of those young Baltic people taken away from their homeland by either the Germans or Russians, particularly since the end of the Cold War in 1988 and independence in the Baltic states, have commenced much more regular contact with their Australian relatives. The 20th century has not been kind to the Baltic states. We can only hope that the next millennium will be kinder and more respectful of those three tiny countries, those beautiful countries, around the Baltic Sea-Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Nehl)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Corporate Restructuring,60
158,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Barton) (3.51 p.m.)I move: That this House: (1) notes the increasing occurrence of corporate restructuring; (2) acknowledges that corporate restructuring frequently results in substantial job redundancies; and (3) amend the Workplace Relations Act to: (a) redefine transmission of business to include the phenomena of outsourcing of services; (b) protect the accrued entitlements of workers where employment is transferred to a new entIty as a result of corporate restructuring or outsourcing; and (c) recognise continuity of service for workers transferred to another entity as a result of corporate restructuring or outsourcing. All members are aware of the extent of corporate restructuring which is occurring in our economy. In particular, there is an increasing trend towards outsourcing. For example, a recent survey of members of the MTIA showed that 96 per cent of respondents to the survey either had outsourced part of their business or were contemplating doing so within the following three years. The theory behind outsourcing is that, if an enterprise concentrates on its core functions, it enables it to value add. By contracting out its peripheral functions, it can give them to an organisation which specialises in that particular venture. Despite the theory, there have been famous examples where outsourcing has been dramatically unsuccessful. In recent years, Woolworths contracted out their warehousing operations to Linfox. That proved to be an economic disaster because they had effectively surrendered the control of their enterprise and they quickly found it necessary to bring it back. Outsourcing becomes more sinister if it is done to circumvent or undermine established industrial conditions. Indeed, the recent survey to which I have referred showed that 43 per cent of MTIA respondents had contemplated outsourcing for industrial relations reasons. There are two recent examples of where that has occurred. One example is the Commonwealth Bank, which are in the process of outsourcing their information technology function to EDS Services, of which the Commonwealth Bank have a 35 per cent holding. But the main purpose of the Commonwealth Bank is to undermine or avoid the accrued severance pay and redundancy pay entitlements of those employees. Another well-known example is Arco mining, which have introduced subcontracting and, as a consequence and in the process, have terminated the employment of 312 employees. Section 149 of the Workplace Relations Act currently provides for the transmission of award obligations in respect of the transmission of a business or part of a business. It not clear, however, whether the decision to outsource functions as opposed to part of a business is encompassed within that section. For instance, it is doubtful that cleaning, security or even maintenance functions could be incorporated within the phrase 'part of a business' . More importantly, while section 149 does provide for the transmission of award obligations, it does not provide for the transfer of employment entitlements for employees who move to the new contracting company. In the process, those employees who transfer can lose their accrued entitlements, including annual leave, long service leave, sick leave and, most importantly, redundancy and severance pay entitlements. I was motivated to move this motion as a result of a decision by Judicial Registrar Ryan in a case called Stones v Simplot Australia in June this year. Judicial Registrar Ryan determined that redundancy and severance pay entitlements were not payable to employees in a contracting out situation where those employees moved to the new contracting employer. While I have difficulty with the decision-indeed, I feel it was based on false reasoning-it is a cause for real concern. In particular, those accrued redundancy entitlements provide a very real source of security for workers. In light of that decision, urgent steps have to be taken to ensure that, when workers move and become a new employee in a subcontracting situation, they take with them their accrued entitlements, that there is recognition for the continuity of their service and that they are not prejudiced in any way as a result of that move-particularly in circumstances where there is a growing trend by corporations to use a contracting out situation to undermine legitimate and accrued entitlements of workers, which provide security not only for them but also for their families. Mr Wilton-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",60
159,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"O'Connor) (3.56 p.m.)Briefly, in addressing this matter and considering the previous debate, may I add is another great Baltic state citizen of Australia to that list- Sir Arvi Parbo-and congratulate him for standing up and being photographed in full page as to put the common sense view on the native title amendments as have appean-d in the press in the last few days. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for letting me say that. It is interesting and a bit unfortunate for the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) that he has put his motion up today, the very day when the media has reported that the ACTU and a major outsourcing organisation known as Manpower are signing an agreement that a Financial Review article saysMr Wilton-Hardly unfortunate.",61
160,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Unfortunate certainly for this debate. The article says: The agreement restates the union movement's long-held preference for permanent full-time, inhouse employment. But in a significant break with past practice, it also contains the first unanimous and public acceptance of non-permanent employment across the ACTU-affiliated unions. In other words, while you guys continue your march back into the past, the ACTU has got ahead of you and done a deal. Mr Wilton-How wrong can you get.",61
161,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"You can make any inference you want on it, but I can tell you how Katharine Murphy, the journalist who wrote this article, has analysed it. You might also like to look at the cartoon today. The matter is of such importance that the paper has seen fit to give it prominence in that regard also. It is interesting that Mr Jackman of Manpower is quoted as saying: What we get out of it is basically the imprimatur of the head union movement ... [so] we're not the bad guys when we come onto a site. In other words, the reality of modem employment practice has been accepted by the ACTU. The member for Barton raised some areas of concern. I look at paragraphs (3)(b) and (3)(c) of his motion and find some contradiction in them. He went to the point of redundancy but if people are sacked, under the labour laws today, they will get a redundancy payment. If they transfer to the new employer who is taking on the outsourcing role, they are continuing an employment and redundancy is then something to deal with in due course. Redundancy is a very interesting thing, and I say that for the people who have had a long history of employing other people. There is still no redundancy for employers. Time and time and time again, they spend a huge amount of cash and capital training people who rise through their ranks and, at about the time they become valuable, they knock on the boss's door and say, 'Thanks very much. I'm off. I've got a better job.' I do not deny them the better job, but I think some of those small business people should be entitled to a bit of redundancy, too. Admittedly, most small business people put workers off when they lack the finances. That is particularly true with good people. They are never sacked if it can possibly be avoided, and that is the reality. There are a couple of matters that are worth addressing in terms of outsourcing. We have got to accept the fact that a job frequently just transfers; it is not lost. As I understand the realities, from reading I have done, in Victoria in the early stages of the Kennett rationalisation of the Public Service I think some 45,000 people were dismissed: 40,000 of them went back into similar employment and 5,000 did not. You can say that that is 5,000 jobs lost or that those 5,000 jobs in fact represented a measure of the inefficiency in the Victorian Public Service. No member of parliament, no premier and no prime minister has a responsibility to run an organisation inefficiently any more than a company director has. There is no social responsibility to create a job that is not necessary, because it just puts other people out of a job. That is the point. But too often we get the media saying, '45,000 jobs go,' when in fact they do not go; they are relocated. That is what outsourcing is all about. Many of these people get other employment, and that of course is a good thing. (Time expired)",62
162,Mr WILTON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"While I am honoured and indeed privileged to be seconding the motion submitted by the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), I am equally and obviously disappointed by the comments of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who has, by and large, failed to address the substance of the motion in any way, shape or form. The member for O'Connor, while recognising that the booming outsourcing industry is revolutionising the workplace, referred at some length to an article which appeared in today's Financial Review under the heading 'ACTU reaches historic deal with Manpower'. He referred to that article as being somewhat unfortunate, and the date of the debate today being indeed unfortunate for the member for Barton. He also referred to it as being an example of the ACTU's backward thinking on this issue and as a 'march back into the past' .",62
163,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Your backward thinking.,62
164,Mr WILTON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The article on the ACTUand the member for O'Connor might stop barking and start listening-said: ... the agreement recognised that companies like Manpower were leading the trend to supply more than casual employees. ""Increasingly, they will supply the full labour force and management of a company."" Clearly the ACTO is recognising that, in terms of the future, it has to be flexible, to acknowledge that outsourcing is a booming industry and it has to adapt its functions and services to the work force accordingly. Many companies are indeed restructuring the way they do their business. Often, of course, this does result in outsourcing their work. It is a reality and, as the member for Barton has said, the Workplace Relations Act does need to reflect this. The Australian Business Chamber estimates that one-third of manufacturers are now outsourcing some of their work. A survey by that chamber in August of some 500 companies found that more than half had been outsourcing in the past year. The chamber has also said that outsourcing was equivalent to about 4,250 jobs. Those workers who have full-time jobs are, of course, facing the prospect of being retrenched as firms continue to downsize their operations. The act as it currently stands is no doubt adding to the feeling of insecurity that many workers are experiencing. It says that this government does not care about you; you will have to bargain, and bargain hard, to stay where you are because, under this government, living standards will not improve. In this generation we have seen the end of an era of workers having a job for life. They are now more likely to change employers, careers and spend some time being trained or retrained between jobs. The act, in its current form, does not reflect the realities of the current Australian workplace. Australia's work force and its corporate structures alike are nothing like they were in the 1950s. Other countries have recognised that the world of modem business has, unlike the member for O'Connor, moved on and they have introduced legislation to protect the entitlements of workers when restructuring occurs. The International Labour Organisation raised the matter of contract labour in June this year when it said: There was a general agreement that contract labour is a growing phenomenon of considerable importance. A clear consensus emerged as to the applicability of fundamental rights to contract workers. The committee unanimously agreed that all workers, regardless of employment status, should receive the same protection with regard to the right to organise and bargain collectively, freedom from it has discrimination, and minimum age. The current Australian legislation does not reflect what the ILO has said. Some companies are using the guise of corporate restructuring to take benefits from workers, who are now being told by their employers, 'We are contracting out your job. If you want to be employed, then you had better sign the contract.' It is sign or go. These workers need some protection. They need to know that they are not going to lose accrued entitlements such as sick leave, long service leave, annual leave and other accrued redundancy entitlements. I would hope that all members of the House accept that these entitlements are a basic right and must be protected. Some problems faced by workers involved in corporate restructuring can be resolved by amendments in the form put forward by the member for Barton. I reiterate his comments relating to one of the primary functions of the federal government: that it should, as far as possible, provide for the financial security of workers and their families. The amendments proposed are relatively minor and reflect the need for the Australian government to act, and act now. (Time expired)",63
165,Mr WAKELIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"This is a very timely motion from the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) on the day-'Monday, 24 November-the ACTU reached the historic deal with Manpower. I note the increasing occurrence of corporate restructuring. I wonder whether that is quite as profound as might be suggested in terms of our historical development of industry and industrial relations in this country when we consider that, back in the 1920s and 1930s, we had something like 40 per cent of people out of work, 40 per cent of our people certainly on part-time or casual work and only 20 per cent of our work force, as I understand it, actually on the award wage or above. Before we get locked into some kind of narrow definition of our history, perhaps we should take some solid evidence of the past into account. It is true that since World War II the work force did get used to the 40-hour week, the job for life approach. Since about 1972 when we saw very significant changes in the labour market, changes in wage structures, the industry has felt the cold, hard winds of change, where basically many jobs, were phased out with the help of technological change. Although Australia has moved on to where our wage rates are quite competitiveprovided we are efficient-at that time our wage rates were putting significant pressure on our businesses. So we accept that the phenomenon of corporate restructuring is with us. I note with regret but with a sense of reality that the second part of acknowledging the corporate restructuring is that it frequently results in substantial job redundancies as a fact of life. With the shadow minister at the table, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), I note that that has occurred with AN in the time of both governments-but particularly in the life of the Labor government. There is no more stark reality of that situation than when we look at the work force in AN from 1983-84 through to 1997-98 when we have seen something like 7,000 or 8,000 jobs out of 9,500 disappear. Mr Tanner-Wilson said that was a good thing.",63
166,Mr WAKELIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Did he? Mr Tanner-Yeah.,64
167,Mr WAKELIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Very unfortunate. I am sure Wilson would not say that. Mr Tanner-He said that cutting jobs was a good thing.,64
168,Mr WAKELIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Wilson would not say that. The motion before the House seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act to redefine the transmission of business to include the phenomenon of outsourcing of services. I think that the historic agreement that the ACfU has made with Manpower is an acceptance of the way that this country will adapt to the 21st century in terms of labour market development. It is quite interesting to look around the world at places like the UK and the US where hundreds of thousands of employees have no physical contract, if you like, with the actual work site. It is quite a remarkable development that someone will tum up at that workplace and the employer will not have had any part in forming the terms of the agreement with that employee but there is this third party-as in the case of the ACTU's announcement today with Manpower. The motion proposes the protection of the accrued entitlements of workers where employment is transferred. I think it is appropriate that that should be done wherever possible. I think our current legislation endeavours to deal with that. Finally, the motion proposes the recognition of continuity of service for workers transferred to another entity as a result of corporate restructuring or outsourcing. That is a much more difficult issue to deal with. If a company is not able to be competitive, goes broke and loses people and then the next company is forced to take those people on at the same rates of pay, it may just be a repetition of history. (Time expired)",64
169,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I would like to congratulate the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) for bringing this matter forward today and to indicate how pleased I am to be following both him as the mover of the motion and my other colleague Greg Wilton, the member for Isaacs. I want to thank Rob MCClelland, who moved the motion, for his vigilance in identifying this as a problem and for drawing our attention to the dimension of the problem and the way in which the problem should be addressed. He indicated when he was speaking what it was which alerted him to this issue in the first place. He became aware of the fact that in the process of restructuring and outsourcing, as a result of arrangements which are either made or fail to be made by their employers, many employees lose not only the accumulated benefit to which they should be entitled at that point of time, simply because they transfer to the new legal entity which employs them; they also lose in the transfer the opportunity for them to take those entitlements with them. We do not need to be Einstein to understand the significance of this. In fact, I understand that about 400,000 employees every year are affected by circumstances of this kind. In those cases, not only do they have their entitlements stripped away from them; they are also not entitled to the accumulated benefits which should be available to them. That quite clearly represents millions and millions of dollars being expropriated from Australian workers, wage and salary earners, and transferred to business owners. I make it very clear that we are not disputing the desirability of restructuring or outsourcing. We accept that industry needs to be flexible. But we are concerned about the fact that there are so many of these cases where business owners are simply using these as cheap, dirty devices to rip entitlements from workers. That is what we are concerned about. The member for Barton indicated very clearly the way in which the legislation can be amended in order to ensure that that does not happen. Mr Deputy Speaker, how can you be sure, how can anyone be sure, whether or not any particular restructuring or outsourcing arrangement is a genuine one? I make this point: very often they are simply devices entered into in order to rip those benefits from employees. How can you be sure whether or not they are legitimate? If the original employer ensures that the accumulated benefits remain with the employee and enters into arrangements of that kind with the new legal entity which employs that employee you could say, 'Yes, it is likely that that is a genuine and worthwhile attempt at restructuring or outsourcing or whatever it happens to be on the part of those employers.' But if no such arrangement is made and if the situation is as outlined by the member for Barton-that employees not only lose the entitlement they would otherwise have received had they been dismissed completely but also are not allowed to carry with them the benefits which they have accumulated with their previous employer-it is very clear that the arrangements are simply a cheap and shoddy device to rip benefits off workers and transfer the monetary value to the business owners. Of course we are concerned about this issue. The motion that Mr MCClelland has moved indicates the way in which it can, at least in part, be overcome. In relation to (3)(b) of that motion-I have discussed it with the member for Barton as well, and he agrees there is a difficulty there-I simply make this point: would that lead to more dismissals and the taking on of new employees when restructuring or outsourcing occurs if we were to protect those workers in that way? But, as Mr MCClelland indicated, if those employees going with a new arrangement have specialist skills, that is likely to protect them. (Time expired)",64
170,Mr CHARLES,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It seems to me, I am afraid, that we have just one more motion by a tired old Labor Party that simply wants to return to the past. We know that Labor's policy in opposition-not their policy in government, but their policy in opposition-is to get rid of enterprise bargaining, get rid of workplace agreements and get rid of new arrangements that allow cooperative arrangements between employers and employees. What we have here is a code motion to return to the point where unions can control the lives of all employees. I am reminded of the building industry. The ACTU has wanted for as long as I have known to try to control the housing industry. The housing industry in Australia is one of the most efficient and effective in the world. We have some of the highest quality, least expensive housing construction available anywhere in the Western world. Why? Because of the subcontract system. But the Australian Labor Party demonstrated by their actions in government their desire to give the AIRC the right to regulate the employment conditions of contractors. The contractors supply work to major contractors. A building contractor may not have bricklayers himself or he may have bricklayers on one project.· He releases the bricklayers because the project is finished, tenders on the next project and hires a group of subcontractors. They might supply the bricks and the mortar as well as the labour to lay the bricks or they might supply their labour to do the lot and put up the bricks. They generally do so under a contract of employment. They say, 'Hey, we'll do it either for so many dollars per thousand bricks laid or for X number of dollars because we've measured the number of bricks on the job. We know how many square metres of brickwork there are-single skinned, double skinned or whatever-because there was a quantity surveyor and it says so in the bills quantity.' That is an efficient system. tion by the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) is that those bricklayers and brickies labourers who move from employment with a contractor to become self-employed subcontractors ought now carry with them all the terms and conditions of their employment with the employer in the first place. Why on earth would any self-respecting subcontractor want to be dictated to by the terms and conditions of his original employment? He wants to earn more money, not be constrained by what he earned on an hourly rate as an employee. I think this proposition to 'recognise continuity of service for workers transferred to another entity as a result of corporate restrucjob turing or outsourcing' creates some real difficulties. For instance, in Victoria compulsory competitive tendering is required since local government restructuring took place. Local government has been required to look at its operations.",65
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! It being 4.21 p.m., the time allotted private members business has expired. The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for La Trobe will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Commonwealth Employment Service",66
172,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is a pity the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) is leaving the House. As the son of a bricklayer, I know the problems in bringing up a family if there is no continuity of employment or entitlements: no access to sick leave, no access to holiday pay, no access to long service leave and, if it rains, no guaranteed wage for the purposes of looking after young families. That is another debate of for another day, but it is an exceptionally important issue out there for building workers But the proposi- and their families. More seriously, from next Monday, because of the Howard government's hopeless bungling of the $1.7 billion privatisation of the job placement market, Australia's jobless will be left worse off as the shutdown of the Commonwealth Employment Service gathers pace. From next Monday, the one national universal free service which has been with us for more than 50 years, filling nearly 70 per cent of all listed jobs, will not be freely and easily accessible to all job seekers. From next Monday, a big step towards the $1.7 billion privatisation of the CBS will take place despite the fact that parliament has not given assent to this major change in the way services are to be provided to Australia's 800,000 unemployed. So much for this government's respect for the parliament. If anything, it is another statement about their contempt for the democratic processes of this great nation. In fact, from this Friday, the CBS as we know and love it will cease to exist and a new organisation, the name of for which will be announced probably this week, will take over all CES type services from next Monday. There was more than 30 hours of debate on employment services in both this House and in the other place when the then minister, Senator Vanstone, went into a funk as it became obvious that the majority of elected senators were opposed to the privatisation of the CBS. What did she do? She refused to debate the issues and took her bat and ball home. The minister announced that she was not prepared to have parliament scrutinise this important change in the way we provide services to the unemployed and promptly withdrew the legislative package. The end result was that we now have a legal nightmare ahead of us and ahead of the unemployed and their families in the very near future. The unemployed and those who are there to help them will have to make their way through a legal minefield. What will happen is that public servants who begin implementing the new employment system may, from next Monday, be in breach of the Crimes Act. That is what it is going to be. Those people may be in breach of the Crimes Act for merely seeking to do their job because of their commitment to trying to do something for the unemployed and their families. That arises from the fact that the privacy rights of the unemployed have now been seriously undermined. They have been classed as second rate and the Privacy Commissioner has little or no role in investigating complaints from the unemployed. All that this government has done is create a field day for lawyers who can make lots of money taking cases through our courts and tribunals challenging decisions and holding up the system to legal banditry. The unemployed will not be thanking this government for undermining the CES system which filled nearly 70 per cent of the listed jobs-that is its history, and it is not a bad record. None these actions to disassemble the CES will create one real job. It is a bit like the work for the dole scheme-it will not create one real job. More importantly, in this instance 35,000 real government jobs will disappear as a result of this process. As to the legal morass, it will become evident that the community backlash against the government for failing to deal properly with Australia's unemployment crisis will be massi ve. The morass has been created because this government was not prepared to concede to this parliament the primacy it should have had to oversight a radical change in the jobs market services for the unemployed of Australia. It is a pretty big decision, a major change in direction. But you know the minister does not like debate, does not like accountability, does not like scrutiny and withdraws the bill and takes the bat and ball home. That has become part and parcel of what is expected from this government when it comes to standards with respect to ministerial activity, standards with respect to performance in the House on accountability or standards with respect to accountability to the Australian public on a change, you might say, that they did not announce prior to the last election. The morass has been created because· the government was not prepared to take into account the intelligent amendments to protect, for - xample, a free universal employment service proposed by both the Labor Party and the Democrats when the legislative package was first introduced. The morass has been created because the government was not prepared to listen to its own Employment Services Regulatory Authority. I hope the government is listening; this is its own authority. What did the Chief Executive Officer of ESRA, Owen Donald, have to say? I note that he finishes at ESRA this Friday. I refer to ESRA's last annual report. Not only did it warn the government but it actually savaged the government about the proposals that will come into operation within the week. The report shows, for example, the following statements by Dr Donald. Firstly, it basically says that the new system is an of immature competitive jobs market environment that has been created. He then goes on to suggest that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission responsible for monitoring the new market does not have the infraStructure and resources to do the job expected. It refers to the fact that the Productivity Commission's role as a complaints body is advisory only and that the Trade Practices Act is liable to be broken through widespread collusive pricing and market sharing. Finally, the misuse of executive power in the privatisation of the Commonwealth Employment Service may result in early legal challenges going all the way to the High Court. Out of all this, the government should now be aware that they have become a laughing-stock among private sector job placement services. I am pleased to say on the question of the need to supply labour to the private sector today that a major agreement has been announced with Manpower between the Australian trade union movement and a major national employer with respect to the ability to provide employment and to supply employers with workers. Let us go to those who were willing to participate in the tendering process. While I say the process has been a bit of a laughingstock, it is not only with respect to accountability but also in relation to those who particitalking pated as against those who refused to participate in the tendering process. What I find is that big players in the industry, such as Morgan and Banks and Manpower, are refusing to participate because they are aware of the costly legal minefields ahead in the so-called contracts the government wants to use. Dr Kemp, as the new Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, I suggest, is now responsible for this morass. He stabbed his previous senior minister in the back to get the job, so it is about time that he now assumed responsibility for sorting out this legal morass and tried to ensure that there are decent services made available to the unemployed right across Australia. Unemployment is still climbing, especially jn some significant regions both in the metropolitan areas of Australia and in regional Australia. There are nearly 800,000 Australians now looking for work. Dr Kemp, when will you step in and clean up this mess? What is your performance? We have now reached a point where one in three unemployed Australians is classified as long-termed employed; that is, unemployed for 12 months or more. The number of long-term unemployed has virtually continually increased since May last year, when this government decided not only to privatise the CES but also to withdraw decent job and training programs for the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed. When exactly will this government get its act together to provide the security of real comprehensive assistance to all Australians looking for jobs? That is the crux of this debate. The unemployed require assistance. They require a decent public sector provider that is capable of not only case managing people but also giving them the capacity to be directed to decent job opportunities or training opportunities that get them job ready and give them the skills and job readiness that make them attractive to the private sector. The refusal by this government to debate the issues to finality in the Senate and to conclude that debate in the House of Representatives is an absolute disgrace. We are about nearly 800,000 Australians who demand accountability with respect to major public expenditure on employment services. But what does this government do? It snubs its nose to the Australian public. That is the Howard government way. (Time expired) Native Title",66
173,Mrs DRAPER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is with great concern and sadness that I rise to speak in relation to the current Wik debate and reconciliation. It is most unfortunate that it has degenerated into almost a slanging match when true reconciliation between two groups of people can only come about when name-calling, divisive statements and the culture of inequality in health and education have stopped. My best friend for 22 years, Marilyn, happens to be Aboriginal. We have supported each other through the highs and lows of life, but we have never needed a bureaucratic, institutionalised reconciliation board to work out how our friendship or reconciliation between us should be conducted. My children love their Aunty Marilyn and have never noticed that she is anything other than a great friend and supporter. She is just part of our extended family of friends per se. Thank goodness my three boys have so far not heard the debate over Wik or the reconciliation board. Otherwise some irresponsible adults of this country would be teaching my children some values that I would prefer they did not learn. My boys do not care whether you are Greek, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Lebanese, English, Irish, Australian, Aboriginal or whatever nationality. I am pleased to say that they have a healthy respect and liking for all members of our global society. If people are kind to them, that is what they return. It is through education and our children that hopefully the reconciliation process will eventually be successful. Perhaps all Australians in the Wik debate do not know that the Indigenous Land Fund, which was introduced under the Native Title Act 1993, will hold $1.3 billion in trust for Aboriginals to buy the land they choose and that $45 million will be added for that purpose each year forever. So all the fuss over the 10-point plan, which is an attempt to solve difficulties with the Native Title Act 1993, and the subsequent Wik decision, even though Keating was determined that pastoral leases extinguish native title, is very sad, divisive and does not help the reconciliation process in any way whatsoever. Do our churches realise that Aboriginal Australians already own or control a land area the size of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory combined? Do they also know about the Indigenous Land Fund or appreciate our commitment of billions of dollars to indigenous specific primary health programs, medical services, education, training and business incentive programs for two per cent of the population? I would like to bring to the attention of the members on the other side of the House the facts behind some of the myths which have been circulated throughout this debate and have them incorporated in Hansard. Myth No. 1: that the act as it stands needs no amendment. The truth is that, in 1993, the Keating Labor government believed and accepted that the High Court had found in Mabo that the grant of a valid lease extinguished native title. Consequently, the current Native Title Act was never intended to apply on pastoral lease land and makes very little provision for potential coexistence. In addition, Mr Deputy Speaker, following Wik the act can now apply on pastoral leases. As a result, some activities that were otherwise allowed on pastoral leases could be prevented by the Native Title Act. Under the current act, native title claimants would have greater procedural rights than the pastoral leaseholder for mining activity on that land. That is, the act discriminates in favour of the native title holders. The act is clearly deficient in other areas. It is delaying and impeding economic development without delivering real benefits to Aboriginal Australians. To date, there are over 660 applicants for the determination of native title covering about 45 per cent of Australia. However, there is only one determination of native title on mainland Australia. Myth No.2: that the Wik decision gives legal certainty. Not so, Mr Deputy Speaker. The truth is that legal uncertainties arise because the Native Title Act was not designed to deal with coexisting rights and interests. Also, the act could effectively reverse the Wik finding that pastoral leaseholder rights prevail over those of native title holders. Of course, on its own, the High Court decision is not enough. Native title must be made part of Australian land law and management. This is what the bill does. Myth No.3: that the government did not consult indigenous interests about the bill. The truth, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that the government has been consulting as closely as possible with members of the National Indigenous Working Group and ATSIC. Most meetings with indigenous interests since the Wik decision, including several with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), were before the National Indigenous Working Group's dec-­ sion to withdraw from direct discussion with the government. Since then, technical discussion at officials level with the group's legal advisers have continued. In addition, the NIWG, ATSIC and other major indigenous organisations made major submissions to the hearings of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on the content of the bill. Myth No.4: that the bill represents large scale extinguishment of native title beyond the common law. The truth is that the bill confirms the High Court decision that native title has already been extinguished on tenures conferring exclusive possession, including freehold, residential and commercial leases, and some agricultural leases. In line with the Wik decision, the only extinguishment of native title rights on pastoral leases confirmed in the bill is of those which are inconsistent with the rights of the pastoral leaseholderthe extent of inconsistency is not specified in the bill and remains for the courts to decide. The bill also confirms, in line with the Wik decision, that the rights of pastoral leaseholders prevail over those of native title holders, but the bill ensures that future grants of such rights cannot extinguish native title. In addition, the bill recognises and protects potentially coexisting native title on pastoral leases which account for more than 40 per cent of Australia's land area. After the passage of the bill, native title can still be claimed on around 79 per cent of Australia. Myth No.5: that the bill's provisions allowing primary production activities on pastoral leaseholds extinguish native title by stealth. The truth is that the states and territories remain responsible for land management and administration, including of pastoral leases. Any additional primary production rights that a government might grant to a pastoral leaseholder cannot extinguish native title. Also, native title holders will be compensated by the relevant government on just terms for any impact on proven native title. Myth No.6: that the government's bill means an unprecedented land grab of freehold title by pastoral leaseholders, including wealthy and powerful onshore and offshore interests, paid for by Australian taxpayers. The truth is that the Prime Minister has made it clear that there will be no mass freeholding land grab at the expense of the native title holders or taxpayers. Currently, the Native Title Act already allows the states and territories to acquire native title rights if they do it through a non-discriminatory process and this, you will be pleased to know, will continue. The Commonwealth is also requiring beneficiaries of any lease tenure upgrades or freeholding to pay a proper contribution. The Commonwealth also understands that there is no intention to approve across-the-board tenure changes which would extinguish native title and, in any event, this would not be possible under the government's bill. Information from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics indicates that most pastoral properties and most pastoral land are family owned. ABARE estimated that, in 1994-95 in the pastoral zone, 3,762 farms were family owned and only 259 farms were corporately owned. Also, all pastoralists, whether they are individuals, families or corporate entities-including companies owned by ordinary Australianscontribute to the Australian economy and all require the certainty that the bill will provide so they can get on with their business. Mr Deputy Speaker, may I also draw your attention to some of the comments made about this issue in 1993 by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and the then Senator Gareth Evans. Mr Keating said: Only validated freehold grants, residential, commercial and pastoral or agricultural leases, and validated Crown actions will extinguish native title. And the then Senator Evans said: It is overwhelmingly likely that when this comes to be formally decided the High Court decision will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases do in fact extinguish native title. I believe the coalition has a sincere and strong commitment to the most important issues facing our Aboriginal population in health, education and reconciliation. I challenge all parties to come on board to work for these issues together. (Time expired) Australian Defence Industries Site: St Marys Badgerys Creek Airport  to talk about the ADI development at St Marys, which is both in my electorate and in the electorate of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly). I have said in this place before that I was always saddened by the closure of the St Marys munitions factory because it was such a large employer in my electorate. However, I guess it was always inevitable that the factory was going to close over time because of safety considerations. ADI together with Lend Lease have been developing proposals to redevelop the site. The state Minister for Planning established a section 22 committee with both Penrith City Council and Blacktown City Council involved in looking at appropriate development principles for the site. I believe the Lend Lease proposals are very exciting. The land is some 1,500 hectares, and over 630 hectares are scheduled to be reserved for open space. The purpose of my speaking today is to encourage the New South Wales government to give the green light to this development and to allow a regional environmental plan to be prepared and put on public exhibition. I particularly want to single out the role Penrith City Council. Penrith council are suggesting that they are completely dissatisfied with the 630 hectares and want the whole site proposed as a national park. If this had come at the beginning of such a proposal, then perhaps it would have some substance. But it is coming at the very end of the proposal. I note that Penrith City Council are not prepared to put one dollar of the ratepayers' money into such a park. They expect that the federal government will not only fund the remaining balance of the 1,500 but also make a compensation payment to ADI-an organisation corporatised and soon to be privatised-as well as to Lend Lease. I would say to the independent and Liberal councillors who control Penrith City Council that, if they are really firm about the ADI site becoming a national park, they ought to do two things. Firstly, they ought to put some ratepayers' money into it and put their money where their mouths are. Secondly, and more importantly, they should contact the Liberal member for Lindsay and very quickly determine whether or not the federal government is going to put any money into it out of the Federation Fund. I fear that this has been a very cynical exercise by Penrith City Council and that they know only too well that the federal government is not going to put the money into the site becoming a park. I can remember that more than 12 months ago Jim Anderson and I had a meeting with the then Mayor of Penrith City Council, Councillor Ross Fowler, and we discussed the ADI site. Indeed, it was Penrith City Council's concern that they did not have sufficient financial capacity to be able to manage all the open space. So here you have a council saying, 'Look, if you are going to give us 630 hectares of open space, we are not going to be able to maintain that.' Now, many months after that, they are suggesting that it all should become a park. If they could not manage 630 hectares, how are they going to manage 1,500 hectares? Can I say in response to that that Lend Lease have offered to set up a trust so that the councils can be relieved of the burden of ongoing maintenance of the open space. I of should also point out that the proposals being offered by Lend Lease include green space corridors. So you will have a corridor from the ADI site that leads directly to the university campus at Hawkesbury in Richmond and also another corridor going to the university campus at Nepean. I think this is one of the most exciting proposals surrounding the site. I think the real tragedy is this: if and when-and I believe it is just a matter of time-the state government gives a green light to this proposal, Penrith City Council are going to say to their ratepayers that, in a site of 1,500 hectares, 630 hectares of open space is somehow a colossal loss, a complete failure. I challenge any member of this parliament to get up and say that they have had a major development in their electorate, with 45 per cent of that being reserved for open space. I do not think any member can do that. Certainly, I cannot say that anything like this amount of open space has been provided for any development in Blacktown City Council or Penrith City Council. I think the Penrith City Council are somewhat hypocritical. If you look at the Glenmore Park housing development-an area where they exclusively were the plannersmost people consider that to have been a planning failure. In other words, when they had the opportunity to do exciting things as a council in terms of planning a new development, they failed miserably. In fact, I have often joked to the general manager of Penrith City Council that I will nominate Glenmore Park as one of those worse planning exercises that deserves to get a worse planning medal.in the awards that are being handed out. I do not think Penrith City Council understand the terrible reputation they are now receiving as far as attracting future development goes. It is true to say that any smaller development, other than ADI or Lend Lease, could not have coped with this series of delays and, in particular, this backflip by council. Indeed, I think there is a good argument for the Minister for Local Government, Mr Ernest Page, to look at just how the planning function in Penrith City Council has been exercised in relation to both Glenmore Park and ADI. I certainly urge him to give the green light as quickly as possible to that development. I also wanted to draw the attention of the House to a couple of other issues surrounding Badgerys Creek. Firstly, I want to talk about the EIS for Badgerys Creek. In an answer to a question, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), on behalf of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Senator Ellison), has conceded that 63 schools could be affected under the Badgerys Creek development; that is, that the students attending those schools will experience educational disadvantage. Because this is a summary document, you do not see the methodology that leads to the figure of 63-1 think the figure could be larger-and certainly the EIS does not give any indication that it could be something in the order of 35,000 students who will suffer this additional educational disadvantage because of Badgerys Creek. I would hope that, when the EIS is published a little later, the Department of Transport and Regional Development will disclose their methodology in relation to the schools being affected so that we can see whether it is too conservative or not conservative enough, whether more schools are affected and how many students will be affected by it. Of course, the western suburbs of Sydney are generally conceded to experience educational disadvantage already, without the addition of an airport. Lastly, I wanted to draw attention to the November issue of National Geographic, where it is reported: After vigorous opposition by conservationists, the government eliminated Holsworthy from consideration last September. Sydney's existing airport will be expanded to accommodate the nearly ten million passengers expected for the city's 2000 Summer Olympics. the Whilst it is not clear, the article seems to indicate that what the government is really considering is further expansion of Kingsford Smith now that Holsworthy has been eliminated and notwithstanding the Badgerys Creek EIS process. (Time expired) Citrus Industry",68
174,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in the grievance debate this afternoon, particularly as it is an opportunity that I was not expecting to come my way. One of the privileges of being the Government Whip is that, occasionallyMr Bevis-You have to fill in when the others don't turn up.",72
175,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Not at all. It is not a matter of them not turning up; it was an opportunity that occurred because leave was granted to another government member for a perfectly legitimate family reason. The shadow minister will be pleased to know that I am here in that context. Those in the chamber will not be surprised to hear that, having this unusual opportunity to participate at short notice in the grievance debate, I have chosen to address this afternoon what has to be currently the most frustrating and beleaguered rural industry in the nation-the citrus industry. No-one will be surprised to hear me say that since it is an industry that I as its representative in this parliament have addressed on a number of other occasions. I should hasten to reassure members that it would be unfair to paint the citrus industry as if the entire industry were facing doom and gloom and as if the outlook were black. In fact, if you are a grower of mandarins, lemons or navel oranges, while this has been a year of some frustration, the truth is that there are opportunities in world marketing terms and even in Australian marketing terms that would mean that those growers can look forward with at least some confidence to profitability in the future. Those who face the most concern and frustration among Australia's ci trus producers are those involved in the production of Australia's largest crop-valencia oranges. Valencia oranges have been grown in large quantities because they are such an attractive option for the production of either fresh juice or frozen concentrated orange juice. The member in this chamber most affected by these production moves has been the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) because it is in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area that the largest proportion of Australian valencia oranges are grown. This year it is not a case of the government having failed the industry but a case of the industry facing a number of unpredictable seasonal conditions. The first is that a large proportion of the valencia crop in Australia this year has been small because of a severe summer. There has been difficulty in the Asian market because of changes in the Asian currency and because of the fire crisis that gripped Malaysia. There is the additional difficulty that is partially parliamentary induced-that is, whereas historically the industry enjoyed a sales tax of zero on any of its product that was converted into a beverage that contained at least 25 per cent Australian juice, under World Trade Organisation rules that option has now been lost. It is popularly believed by citrus growers that both the present opposition and the government are responsible for the changed tariff regime that has produced part of the dilemma the industry now faces. It is true to say that, over the last 10 years, tariff protecconcentrated tion for the industry has fallen from 35 per cent to approximately five per cent. While that is true, it needs to be understood that reintroduction of a tariff at the former levels would not solve the industry'S present problem. The other myth that growers generally believe is that the Brazilians, who represent their major competitor in world terms and who are currently making available to Australian consumers frozen concentrated orange juice at 41 per cent less than the price charged two years ago, are dumping their product in Australia. If that were the case, there would be facilities to take an anti-dumping action against the Brazilians. The reality is that the Brazilians specialise in the production of frozen concentrated orange juice. The Brazilians pump their frozen concentrated orange juice into tankers that then make their way across the Atlantic to Rotterdam. They discharge tanker loads of frozen concentrated orange juice into the European market on a regular basis. Just 1Y2 of those tankers would supply Australia's entire import needs. So, effectively, we find it difficult-in fact,impossible-to compete against the Brazilians with the size of their production. Something like 80 per cent of the world's frozen concentrated orange juice is grown in Brazil; only about seven per cent is grown in the United States of America and less than one per cent is grown in Australia. Mr Adams-Is it American capital in Brazil?",72
176,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am not sure the member for Lyons necessarily needs a lesson in the entire citrus industry, but the Brazilian industry, as I understand it, is made up of Brazilian capital, American capital and a number of European investors as well. I am not sure what impact that has on the entire debate. The significant thing for the member for Lyons to bear in mind is that Senator Sherry, a Tasmanian colleague of his, when parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, advocated that it would be possible to change the sales tax regime in order to encourage Australian fresh juice to be taxed at a lower sales tax rate than frozen orange juice. It was a campaign that I joined him on, but it is a campaign that has failed principally because the definition of the juice as a food has been difficult to sustain. Many growers want to draw a parallel between milk, which if it is white milk is taxed at zero, and orange juice, which if it is over 25 per cent product is taxed at about 12 per cent. They say that, effectively, since both are beverages, they should be taxed at the food rate of zero. It is an argument with which I have a great deal of sympathy, but there is a dilemma in this that is not generally understood by growers or by relatively few parliamentarians as well. The dilemma is simply this: while white milk as such is taxed at a zero rate, a relativethat ly low proportion of white milk is consumed as a beverage. Most white milk, as we would all be aware, goes onto cereals or goes into the cooking process. Most of the milk that consumed as a beverage is consumed flavoured milk, which is taxed at the beverage rate of 25 per cent. So the industry already enjoys some sales tax advantage. This has fruit been a problem for both the Treasurer of the present government (Mr Costello) and the Treasurer of the former government to come to terms with. Does this mean that I, therefore, stand here representing the citrus growers of the Riverland saying that there is no future in the valencia industry? Does this mean that the government has effectively abandoned these growers? The answer is no. This is a vexed and difficult problem to resolve because of the obligations that we have under the World Trade Organisation, but it is not a problem from which the government is seeking in difficult some way to be shielded. The government has endeavoured age rural partnership packages, one of which has already been introduced into the Sunraysia, to allow growers to make a change from growing valencia oranges to growing alternative crop--perhaps mandarins, perhaps navels, perhaps wine grapes. A similar packwell age is due to be introduced into the Riverland by the end of the year. A similar also being tailor made for the MIA but has yet to be approved by MIA grower organisafailures tions in order to have influence in the Murthat rumbidgee area. What we do not need at this stage is some form of tree pull. That would be a superficialment ly appealing thing to do, because it would allow growers to get out of the immediate problem, but it would so reduce Australian citrus production that, first, we would cease to be major exporters and, secondly, we would find ourselves with too little fruit available as overrun to provide the fresh market in Australia. So' right now the chalout lenge exists for both the industry and government to get together and find· a technique whereby growers can be encouraged to keep trees in the ground in order to ensure Australia has fresh juice production of its own and the potential to expand export markets while at the same time making sure that we are not in fact allowing that fresh is juice to be unfairly impacted on by the price as of frozen concentrated orange juice. If you were to draw a parallel, it would be between what currently happens in the pine industry, particularly in the apple industry, with which the member for Lyons will be familiar, and what potentially could happen in the citrus industry. The point that the parliament should bear in mind is this: far from the industry being a disaster, it represents what is currently one of the most rapidly growing export industries in horticultural terms in Australia. But to sustain effective export opportunity we must have a viable juice market, and that juice market is currently being threatened by the price of frozen concentrated orange juice from Brazil. Solving this problem under WTO, guidelines will be and challenging, but it is a challenge that it is not being avoided by anyone of the members representing the industry in the to encourparliament. (Time expired) Employment",73
177,Mr ADAMS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish an the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) well in his dilemma which he summed up very in his speech. There are no easy solutions to that issue and it will take some time package is to get on top of. I want to grieve today for the government's in relation to the CES and the way it is approaching the changes in this area. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) previously dealt with how the governwas getting it wrong, and it certainly is getting it wrong. One of the biggest problems of course facing our country today is unemployment. Of all the government's failures, and there are many failures from this government-in administration, this government is probably shaping up as being one of the worse juice that we have ever had-unemployment stands as this government's greatest failure. It the has failed to tackle it in any way. What is the government doing? It is doing very little. So far the best that this government has come up with to try to find solutions to the unemployment problem is a plan to disperse the Commonwealth Employment Service and rename it the Public Employment Placement Enterprise or the PEPE. It has gone about its way by getting rid of a government service or by changing its name to PEPE. The PEPE, as we all know, will work in competition with the EPEs, the employment placement enterprises. These are privately contracted case managers who face the unenviable task of trying to get people back into work. The unemployed-John Howard's forgotten people-are now able to choose whether they want to be publicly case managed by the CBS PEPE or privately case managed through"" the EPEs. They now have a choice. If you are unemployed, you can choose whether you have help from the government or from a private person to case manage you back into employment. I understand the theory. The CBS and the EPEs are supposed to be competing on a level playing field and no unemployed person is supposed to be disadvantaged as a result of their decisions, whether they are case managed privately or publicly. Of course, this theory is not matching the situation out there in real life, because real life is a little differisolated ent from the theories people come up with, especially this government's theories. The effect of the government reforms means that people are missing out on training programs. I am aware of at least three people who have contacted me in my electorate where they have missed out on training opportunities. In one case, a man who had been unemployed for more than 12 months saw an opportunity arising in a fibreboard plant in northern Tasmania but was refused a place. In another instance a young woman sought training from a major north-west employer, again only to be refused the opportunity to participate. The system is not working. The system has already failed to give any help and to assist people back into the workplace. People go along in good faith to be assessed and are asked whether they want to be managed privately or publicly, but they are not told that they may well miss out on the very course that they want to do, depending on which one they choose. That is what is happening at the moment under these policies. Why are unemployed people not being informed of the implications of their decision when choosing between public and private case management? Why are they not being told? They should be. The people are just as unemployed whatever scheme they elect to be under. They are not in a position to understand the full arguments on the funding of the different bodies that are involved. The Employment Services Regulatory Authority'S annual report for 1996-97 warns that substantial challenges remain in developing the quality and effectiveness of employment services, especially for long-term and more disadvantaged unemployed people. That report is damn right. This government certainly have not got it right in working towards decent policy for long-term unemployed people. In my opinion, they have a long time to go before they do get it right. They say that the scheme's capacity to give a job seeker a choice of case management provider will indicate how well the market can deliver the service. Just by looking at the diversity of service providers and where they are located will tell us that people who live in areas are not being catered for. How can that be? The economies of this current scheme prohibit a proper service being provided in many areas. This scheme is totally unfair and it is more unfair in regional areas. It will become more so as time goes on. People will miss out without enough assistance. The statistics will show that up in the long term. It shows what a stupid move it was to try to privatise part of the system which was beginning to work very""well. You end up having a second-class system. This is especially true in regional Australia. This government is really setting up a scheme which is calling regional Australian people second class. In this brave new world of market driven social welfare this government just does not know what it is doing. It really has not got on top of its policies. It has half-baked policies which are not working and which are really affecting people. I do not believe that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) actually knows that it is not working yet, but I am sure that he is going to find that out in the near future in a big way. If they wanted to deregulate the employment services market then the least they could do would be to get the details worked out right from the beginning. They certainly have not done that. Given their record of incompetency in public administration to date, I do not hold much hope that they will get it right in the immediate future. This is a very unfair government. The government's policies are impacting on different groups within our communities in a very unfair way. Unemployed people in regional areas really are feeling threatened by this government and, of course, there are lots of other groups who are also feeling threatened-as we have seen as we have gone through the nursing home debacle. When we are dealing with these long-term unemployed people we need to have programs. We need to have the case management situation where there are resources for helping unemployed people to get into training and then get into jobs. You need resources to do that. You cannot do it without resources. That is what this government does not understand. It does not understand that it must put into get results. What it is trying to do is cut back. It will not get any of the results it is saying it will get. As I said, it is especially impacting in regional Australia and it will impact there further into the future. We will see the results of higher unemployment figures in the regions where the system is continuing to fail. (Time expired)",74
178,Mr LIEBERMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Indi) (5.12 p.m.)When this government was elected some 19 or 20 months ago it embarked on a number of very courageous reforms which, in many cases, were not addressed, although they should have been, in the previous 13 years by the Labor government. One of those reforms concerned the vexed question of the reform of the fuel industry, with particular regard to the great unhappiness and inequities between country and city fuel prices. In the last few months, the government has made substantial progress, despite the difficulties and despite the enormous number of vested interests in this industry, towards achieving reform and justice for motorists, particularly in the regional areas of Australia. We pledged that we would remove the barriers to obtaining access to bulk fuel from the terminals and refineries in Australia. Unfortunately, under Labor a club had developed which prevented people from gaining access to bulk and wholesale fuel from the refineries. That meant that many country and regional businesses and groups had to deal with selected people who did have exclusive rights to gain access to fuel. The issue was protected by an unholy agreement, known as the Laidley agreement, made between the transport unions and some of the oil companies. This agreement fostered that closed club. I am glad to report to the House that the Laidley agreement-and I say to the credit of the union that they agreed that the game was up-has now been effectively reformed and the negotiations for access to terminals and refinenes by the government are almost complete. I understand that in a very short time all of the players will be confirming that the barriers have been totally removed. That means that potentially people in the regions of Australia can group together and negotiate access to their own bulk wholesale fuel supplies and distribute them themselves throughout the regions of Australia or they may choose to maintain their contacts and access through the existing facilities. The point is that the government is introducing choice. Fuel The second move the government has made, which we have entrenched now, is that there shall be public monitoring and public disclosure of prices in the wholesale and retail industry in Australia on an authoritative basis so that there is more accountability and transparency. I am pleased to say that, with the help of the motoring organisations of Australia-the AAA, the RACV and the NRMA-and a number of other organisations, we now see regularly the publication of the prices in various parts of Australia. These prices add to the anger of many consumers when published because they highlight the inadequate competition, the lack of competition, in many parts of Australia. But the important thing is that the government has provided a database for public record so that the consumer in Australia will have more rights and will be able to blow the whistle where necessary as whistleblowers and report alleged breaches and improper trade practices to the ACCC where, I might add, there are penalties now of up to $10 million for proven acts against the Trade Practices Act of unfair competition. We will see more developments in the next few months along those lines. There are now monitoring stations throughout Australia supervised, I understand, by the ACCC which will build up the database and enable whistleblowers to take action when needed. The next exciting reform which the government is nurturing is the encouragement of new competition into the marketplace. There is not enough real competition because we have a limited number of major fuel suppliers in this country. You can work only with the clay you have. You cannot create competition overnight. The government is working assiduously to increase competition. We now have a position where new players are in the retail and wholesale markets, where fuel is being introduced into the marketplace against the existing oil majors, where innovative retail outlets such as Woolworths and smaller groups now are moving to provide in a loss leader fashion based on some of the experiences overseas, in America particularly, fuel at a discount for shopping with a particular retail organisation. In Shepparton, there is now an average fuel price of 73c a litre whereas just a few kilometres down the road in places like Benalla the fuel price is still close to 80c. The it has been constantly at 73c in Shepparton is that the new players in the game have come into provide real competition. There will be more of this. I expect that soon in Benalla a small family supermarket is going to announce that it has made arrangements with a new independent supplier of wholesale fuel to establish a petrol station as an adjunct to its supermarket business and offer fuel at a fair price, not at the inflated retail price that people in north-east Victoria are being subjected to unfairly. It is a very exiting development. We are also seeing the increase of storage for independents to bring fuel in and store whereas previously, if they took the risk of bringing fuel into compete against the majors, they would find it difficult to find storage, the wholesale price of fuel dropped suddenly and coincidently or they were even, in some cases, sent broke. So the extra storage is coming in and is playing a very large part of reforming this multi hydra-headed monster industry. As a result of the fair trading report, which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, had a lot to do with, and I commend you again for that, the government has acted and introduced legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to introduce a new offence, a new section, dealing with unconscionable behaviour which will help smaller retailers and other people to gain access to fuel at fair prices and to distribute it-a very innovative and great program. The government is also introducing changes to allow an oil code to be developed which will have teeth and which will be enforceable as a mandatory oil code under the Trade Practices Act if it is breached-something that should have been done years ago by the previous Labor government, which did nothing except have a number of inquiries year after year. There are a number of other steps that the government will be taking. Those steps will, of course, be confirmed in due course. The critical stage that we are at at the moment is that the oil code is to be developed-the government, I understand, will be facilitating-and if there is disagreement between the reason parties on the terms of the oil code the government will be considering introducing an arbitrator to settle the forms of the words in the oil code and that oil code will then become a mandatory code under the Trade Practices Act. All of these steps collectively, not on their own, will bring about more justice. They will provide new dynamics in the industry and in the market. It will be fair to everybody-fair to small retailers, fair to distributors, fair to oil majors, fair to independents and fair to anyone else who wants to be involved. But, above all, for the consumers of Australia, particularly in regional Australia, we will have more examples of the Shepparton example. I understand it is 73c in Shepparton today, in Wodonga it is 79.81c, in Wangaratta it is 79.81c and in Benalla it is 79.81c. Why? It is because there is not adequate competition yet. The government sees this, has targeted this and is doing all it can to foster the development of independents. This is going to happen. Already I thank the local governments in Australia, particularly those in my electorate, who have been very helpful and are doing all they can also to facilitate the opening and the establishment of new independents in their cities and towns. It is a great thing. I am talking with a number of smaller communities about group buying. They may not be able to attract the huge supermarket which can then loss lead fuel, but collectively they can start to make bulk purchases which would come in at the price in the city. So, if you have a tanker and can get fuel to Footscray at so much per litre wholesale, there is no reason why you cannot fill up a tanker for country Victoria on the same day from the same refinery at the same wholesale price, whereas at the moment we know that distributors complain that they cannot access fuel on the same day from the same terminal at the same price per litre. (Time expired) Industrial Relations",76
179,Mr MCMULLAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Canberra) (5.22 p.m.)I want to speak today in this grievance debate about what I call the tale of two industrial relations ministers. Over the weekend we have seen press reports and press releases about the consequences of the differing approaches to industrial relations by the  and the minister in the New South Wales government, Mr Jeff Shaw. If I have time, and if my throat and voice hold out, I might mention a third industrial relations minister, Mr Trevor Kaine, the minister in the ACT government. Firstly, I will look at the question of recent  Reith, and in particular two aspects of that. At a meeting on Friday, the conservative ministers responsible for labour matters agreed unanimously-that is, all of them except the New South Wales minister, who was represented there although did not attend-that they would oppose a 5.7 per cent increase in the minimum wage. They were collectively of the view that $380 a week was too much for the lowest paid Australians to receive-a 5.7 per cent increase in the minimum wage to $380 was too great. This is at a time when the weekend's newspapers revealed what we all have known: that executive salaries in those same companies are leaping through the roof. We have known for some time that executive salaries are increasing very quickly. The Cullen Egan Dell report most recently said that the rate of increase of executive salaries had slowed to a mere six per cent. But on the weekend we saw a more egregious example of this excess in the Sydney Morning Herald survey of the salaries of chief executive officers in Australia's top 50 companies, although they were not able to contact all top 50. The Sydney Morning Herald survey of the annual reports showed that the salaries of chief executives had increased by 15 per cent in the last 12 months. So we have chief executive salaries increasing at 15 per cent per annum; executive salaries, six per cent; salaries for people able to enter into enterprise bargaining, between four and five per cent; and salaries for people on the award, between one and 1.5 per cent. This is a very perverse sense of fairness, equity and a proper distribution of the burden of the fight against inflation. The richest pay no price. They get real wage increases of enormous amounts, not only in percentage terms but in real terms. What we are talking about in the minimum wage increase is $20.60 a week, about $1,000 or getting on towards $1,100 a year. The average wage of the chief executives who received the 15 per cent increase was $1.6 million per year. The increase per week which they are getting is much higher than the annual claim-three to four times the annual claim-of the lowest paid Australians who work for the same enterprises. Their salary is some 80 times that of the lowest paid Australians who work for these same enterprises. This is not a personal attack on those chief executives. I know many of those individuals listed in the newspaper. I have worked with them. They are hard working, honest Australians doing a very good job in many instances for their corporations. This is a sense of priorities. All the conservative governments in Australia are lining up and saying, 'We have now got the lowest paid caught in a pincer. There is no alternative for them. They can have enterprise bargaining-which many of them do not have the industrial muscle to win anything from-or they can have nothing.' But for other people, to those who have shall be given, and shall be given in very large lumps. The great irony is that those who would most benefit from a substantial increase in minimum rates in awards are in fact non-unionists. Non-unionists overwhelmingly receive their pay and conditions, where they are paid the legal minima, because of award rates. Agreements and enterprise bargains are overwhelmingly entered into by unions and overwhelmingly represent the interests of unionists. The non-unionists have their pay set predominantly, almost exclusively, by the award system, and this government that purports to defend their interests is leaving them high and dry. On this same occasion when the real priorities of Australians and working families are being ignored by conservative labour ministers, we have the Minister for Industrial Relations in the New South Wales government, Jeff Shaw, speaking on a very important, unheralded issue. He has said that students taking school holiday jobs should be wary and concerned about bosses who exploit them. Jeff Shaw knows, as I know, that most employers do not exploit people. Most Australian employers are decent Australians who pay the proper rate, but we also know that too many young people find themselves working for a few days on a trial period without any pay and then, after those few days, being told, 'I'm sorry, you're not suitable.' They leave, and they have worked up to eight days for nothing. We find them getting no offer in writing and having no recourse. These people are not getting the award wage, are being offered jobs which pay only a commission and are working in unsafe conditions. These circumstances were outlined very effectively in the newspaper article in the Sydney SunHerald referring to the initiative taken by Mr Shaw. He is putting out a pamphlet called 'Know your rights' that is being distributed to all schools, and I congratulate him for that. I also congratulate him on one other initiative associated with that which shows the contrast once again. Not only is he putting out the warning, not only is he expressing the real concern that parents throughout Australia feel, including myself, as their young children go out to their first jobs; he is tasking the Department of Industrial Relations inspectors to crack down on the dodgy employers because it is not fair to the kids and it is not fair to the decent employers who are paying the right rate and have to compete with them. How often do members of all political persuasions find around their own constituencies that the decent employers are finding it hard to compete because one person in the industry is ripping 6ff? Often we all know who it is but we cannot get anything done about it. Here we have industrial relations inspectors focused on this important task. It. is a sad contrast with this government, which is cutting back on the capacity of inspectors to go out and enforce these provisions. The Department of Industrial Relations is focusing on increasing the number of inspectors going out and freedom of association issues. That is the law and I do not object to it being enforced. I do not argue against it being enforced, but it is not the proper priority. The proper priority is the rip-off of young Australians and other working people who have legal entitlements which are not being paid to them and they should receive the support of their government. Once again, the irony is that people most dependent on these government inspection services are non-unionists. Unionists have .an alternative source of enforcement of their rights called the union. Non-unionists have to rely upon government inspection services. Why is it that this government, which purports to be concerned about the interests of those Australians, does nothing for them? You do not hear a word. You see in Victoria the evidence in response to a question on notice from my colleague the member of Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) showing how the number of inspectors in Victoria has been cut back since the Commonwealth government took respon-sibility. The capacity of people's rights to be enforced is being reduced and limited in ways that cause me great concern. I think it shows the difference in priorities. It shows the difference in thinking and approach. I congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Shaw, on his initiative, and I am sure many colleagues in here, no matter what their political persuasion, will welcome that tive and hope that it does mean that people will get their legal entitlements at the workplace. (Time expired) Royal Australian Air Force Base: Forest",78
180,Mr HICKS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The RAAF Base at Forest Hill has a proud history and has been an important part of the life of the city of Wagga Wagga since it was established in war time in 1940 as a flying training base for pilots and air crew. At establishment it was known as No.2 Service Flying Training School, 2SFTS. Over the years its role has changed, particularly over the past four years until today when the base is used for a number of training pursuits, the main one being the RAAF Air Force School of Technical Training or RAAFSTT. This type of training has existed at Forest Hill in one form or another since February 1946, prior to which training was provided at a number of locations throughout Australia. In 1969, the training of army aircraft technicians moved from RAAF base Amberley to Wagga Wagga and in November 1971 the unit was presented with the Queen's Colours for its outstanding training record. It was the first Queen's Colours presented to an individual RAAF unit. In March 1993 navy training was transferred to the Forest Hill base from HMAS Nerimba. Also in that year, life support training was moved from Richmond to the Forest Hill Base. The year of 1994 saw the introduction of the communications technician and operators training course being transferred from Laverton to Forest Hill. The RAAF School of Management and Training Technology, RAAFSMTT, is also located at the base. The base also has a health services flight which provides comprehensive health support for defence personnel stationed at the base with a 24-hour inpatient and outpatient service. This is part of the RAAF support service stationed at the base. At anyone time on the base there may be upward of 170 naval personnel undertaking courses. As I said before, the army is well represented with army students spending up initia- to 18 months at RAAF Wagga to receive training to become aircraft technicians and carry out engine and air frame maintenance on army fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. On October 1996 the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), as part of the defence Hill review program, instigated the defence efficiency review. The review was to call for a study of the requirements of the ADF with its aim to make $1 billion of savings within the ADF and to transfer these savings to the sharp or operational end of defence. On pages 23031 of the addendum to the report of the defence efficiency review, secretariat papers, as part of the report presented to the minister on 11 April 1997, a proposal for possible closure and sale of a number of bases between the years 2001-2006 was listed and one of these bases was Forest Hill, Wagga Wagga. At his press conference dated 17 April 1997 the minister stated that Defence cannot afford to carry the financial burden of obsolescent bases dating back to the Second World War and earlier. This announcement has caused great consternation amongst the people of Wagga Wagga because of the economic and social ramifications this would have on the city and district, and this is what I wish to bring before the parliament today. To give some idea of the economics of the proposed closure, the RAAF base has a $25 million annual input of direct salaries and services. Overall, this would have a $50 million annual economic impact. There would be a loss of possibly 200 jobs held by civilians in organisations like SERCO and the Public Service and an unknown number of job losses in the private sector providing goods and services to the base. The other known effect would be that on the business, social and educational life of the city. One point to be made is that being a regional centre in a rural setting the impact would be much greater than if Forest Hill was closer to a more economically diversified major metropolitan centre. To counter the possible closure, a 'Save our base task force' has been established under my chairmanship with the mayor of Wagga Wagga and Councillor John Harding presently as deputy chairman. The task force also includes the state member for Wagga Wagga, the Hon. Joe Schipp, and a cross-section of community members including three distinguished former RAAF members. The Defence efficiency review report states: . . . proposals should be examined in detail infrastructure reviews, which are underway. These reviews should be compelled to demonstrate why the bases cannot be closed rather than arguing for the status quo or some alternative option. Therefore, the task force is endeavouring to put an argument as to why the base cannot be closed. However, the main issue facing the Wagga Wagga community is that of the uncertainty of the base's future, mainly because the closure date is between 2001 and 2006. The task force, along with the citizens of Wagga Wagga, require a firm decision so they know where they stand and what strategies should be adopted long before then. It is totally unacceptable for a government report to be tabled which places a doubt over the future of the base until some time between 2001 and 2006. I have to admit that, although the task force has been working diligently to come up with sound reasons that the base should remain open, up until recently it has been more like shadow boxing rather than getting into a real fight because of the total lack of information that has been available. While visits to the base by the minister and the federal parliament's Defence Subcommittee have been important, it was not until recently, when I visited the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Les Fisher, that I was able to obtain some positive response. I thank the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, for allowing that meeting to occur. Air Marshal Fisher informed me of the following points. There were no hidden agendas. The only imperatives placed on the RAAF, as with other arms of the ADF, were to make savings. At present, ADF Joint Education and Training is carrying out a study related to rationalisation of training within the ADF. This study is being undertaken by a committee headed by Rear Admiral J .R. Lord, Head of Joint Education and Training. The officer responsible for putting the RAAF's case for rationalisation of all RAAF training is Air Commodore B.J. Espeland, who is currently carrying out an investigation with a view to rationalising all training reform by the RAAF in combination with the whole by the ADF training program. The future of the RAAF presence in Wagga Wagga will, to a large de-ree, depend on the outcome of that rationalisation study. Air Marshal Fisher stated that if the decision were his he would rather see technical training located at an operational base such as Amberley or Edinburgh. However, this would cost money that mayor may not be available within the ADF. The possibility of having the catering training facilities now under construction at TAFE Wagga Wagga used as a training centre for the RAAF or ADF was also raised. Air Marshal Fisher said this could be put before Rear Admiral Lord and Air Commodore Espeland but, if technical training programs were to leave Wagga Wagga, it would not appear feasible that catering and other nontechnical training would enable the base to remain open. Air Marshal Fisher would like to have decisions on ADF training made within the next six months because uncertainty is of no benefit to all the parties concerned. The fact that the Chief of the Air Staff is hoping for a report within six months should assist the Save Our Base Task Force and the City of Wagga Wagga to plan for the future. It would seem to members of the Save Our Base Task Force and me that if the objective of the DER is to save $1 billion it would be on a losing proposition by transferring, in particular, the technical training operation from Wagga Wagga. The first reason is the cost. The second is that new buildings would have to be provided at another location and the minister has said on more than one occasion that he does not want any more bricks and mortar. The third reason is that the base would have very little value if sold for other purposes. There should be another cost, and I draw members' attention to the United States experience. In that country, as a result of the end of the Cold War, a number of defence bases were closed while some undertook an enhanced role. As a consequence, a Defence Authorisation Amendment and Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 was enacted on 24 October 1988. Apart from other functions, this act, as stated in section 204 paragraph enabled, 'subject to the availability of funds', firstly, economic adjustment assistance to any community located near a military installation being closed or realigned; and, secondly, community planning assistance to any community located near a military installation to which functions will be transferred as a result of such closure or realignment. A similar situation would surely have to apply to bases being closed in Australia, as no government could overnight close a base that had been in a community for nearly 60 years and which presently contributed over $50 million per annum to the local economy. It would seem logical that, because of its successful history of training the three branches of the ADF, some tri-service technical training could be further centralised to Wagga Wagga. An $8.5 million catering school is to be constructed at Wagga Wagga T AFE, and this development could provide an ideal opportunity for tri-service catering training be carried out in Wagga Wagga. There may be a role for shared training between the Kapooka army establishment-the home of No.1 Recruit Training Battalion-and Forest Hill or even having helicopter training centralised at Forest Hill. One of the problems being faced is that, following the announcement of the findings of the DER committee which cites Forest Hill for possible closure, different agencies within the ADF have presumed it will close and the task force feels this could cloud their judgment on enhancing the role of the base. The task force is developing other strategies to handle this difficult situation, but I believe that in the midst of this operation some important facts should be kept in mind. Wagga Wagga is the largest inland city in New South Wales. It is logistically well placed. With Kapooka, it is still a defence force city. It is a university city. It has a highly skilled and well-educated work force and an entrepreneurial business sector, and it would be foolish to become despondent over what mayor may not happen with the future role of Forest Hill RAAF Base. That does not mean that Wagga Wagga should in any way give up Forest Hill without (2) a struggle. I ask the federal Minister for Defence to study carefully the concerns of the people of Wagga Wagga before he makes a decision on the RAAF Base at Forest Hill. Question resolved in the affirmative. AUDITOR-GENERAVS REPORTS",80
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On behalf of Mr Speaker, I present the Auditor-General's audit report No. 14 for 1997-98 entitled Financial control and administration audit-Official travel by public sector employees.

182,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (5.42 to p.m.)-On indulgence, I seek to clarify some remarks I made a little while ago. On 30 October in the second reading debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997 in the second chamber I said that the former government did not respond to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report relating to the migration agents registration scheme titled Protecting the vulnerable. At the time of that statement, that was my understanding. At that time. I was relying on incorrect advice that had been provided to me by my department. It has now come to my attention that a response was tabled in the House of Representatives on 30 November 1995 and in the Senate on 30 April 1996 after the change of government. I do note that the former government's response was not implemented. However, the current government has introduced legislation in the form of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill to implement a number of the recommendations in the report. I also note that the opposition has voted against these changes in the House of Represen tati ves. At the time of the second reading speech I also made two other minor errors that I would like to clarify. I might say that during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee hearing on the bill the deputy secretary to my department highlighted these matters for the committee and corrected them at that time. In the debate I referred to a fee for agents in the voluntary sector as being $450 whereas in fact the proposed fee is $475 until 20 March 1999 when it will be reduced to $350. I stated that agents must be members of the Migration Institute of Australia whereas I should have said that they must be registered with the Migration Institute of Australia. Both these errors were inadvertent and, in my view, not substantial, but I felt it appropriate at this time to clarify that.

183,Mr OCONNOR,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"Corio) (5.47 p.m.}-The bills before the House, the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997, relate to a very important environmental issue that has arisen because of the spread of exotic aq·uatic organisms to Australian waters. Since the mid-1980s, Australia's trade in bulk and manufactured commodities has increased dramatically. Australia has participated in the process of economic globalisation and trade liberalisation. We heard mention of that today on the floor of this parliament in question time when the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) referred to the important APEC negotiations which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is attending at the moment. APEC has been an important vehicle for that substantial increase in trade in both bulk and manufactured commodities. To give you an idea of how that trade has increased, since the mid-1980s exports and imports as a percentage of our gross domestic product have risen from 15 per cent to over 20 per cent. It is a very important increase and it reflects Australia's stronger trading position. An important part of our export trade and growth is, of course, bulk cargo---coal, iron . ore, grains, woodchips and petroleum. The latter three are very important exports and imports through the port of Geelong in my own electorate of Corio. Because of the nature of this bulk trade, a large number of ships arrive in our ports in ballast. It is estimated that 121 million tonnes of ballast water from 5,100 ships is discharged in Australian waters each year. Furthermore, 70 per cent of that ballast originates in Asian ports with half coming from Japan. The introduction of unwanted marine organisms through ballast discharge is currently having a significant adverse impact on Australia's marine environment. There are two major impacts: one is on Australia's lucrative seafood production and exports and the other is on human health. The growth in Australia's seafood production over the past decade has been substantial. Of course, that growth is most important to coastal regional communities such as those in Tasmania and Victoria and, indeed, around Australia. Many people rely for their employment on processing the catch and exporting it. It is an area quite lucrative export growth for our primary producers. To give you an example of the growth in the production of major fisheries products in Australia, in 1987-88 $246 million worth of prawns was produced in Australia. That rose to $334 million worth of product in 1995-96. Production of rock lobsters has increased from $252 million to $375 million, abalone from $96 million to $130 million, scallops from $22 million to $62 million, oysters from $36 million to $51 million, general fish products from $157 to $359 million and tuna from $19 million to around $100 million. Australia has had substantial growth in seafood production. Significant areas of that growth are now threatened by the problems that are associated with the discharge of ballast waters in our ports. Tasmania, particularly, has been hit by the introduction of two particular marine organisms: brown kelp, which has affected its lucrative abalone industry, and the Northern Pacific sea star which has spread along 200 kilometres of the Tasmanian coastline. I understand it has been detected in Victorian ports as well. The giant sea worm is now posing a problem to us in Port Phillip Bay. Apart from the marine pollution that comes from the discharge of ballast waters and the threats to our marine environment and aquaculture industries, there are also human health considerations where problems occur in the contamination of the seafood chain. The introduction of new species of toxic red algae has caused considerable problems. This problem has to be addressed. Australia has been at the forefront of international efforts to recognise the problem and the enormous risks posed to our marine environment and to stimulate not only domestic but international action to overcome the problem. The previous Labor government played a very active role, as I have just stated, in achieving global recognition of the problem and in putting effective strategies in place to deal with it. In 1990, Australia became the first country to introduce national voluntary controls for the discharge of ballast water. These controls were subsequently adopted by of the International Marine Organisation in 1991. In 1995, Australia developed a ballast water management strategy which has become a model for other nations around the world. The bills before us give effect to funding key elements of that strategy, which, as its major aim, seeks innovative and cost-effective measures to combat this very important problem and threat to our coastal marine environments. This legislation will pose no real financial burden on the Commonwealth. The bills seek to raise $2 million which will be paid into a research fund and will be levied on bulk carriers to the tune of $210 and on other carriers and tankers to the tune of $140. The legislation, as it has been presented to the parliament, has been drafted in consultation with major stakeholders: the shipping industry and research organisations, as well as state and federal governments. This levy will cut out at the $2 million limit and will fund research efforts beyond the year 2000. These are very important bills because of the considerable problems that have emerged in the past 10 years as a result of the discharge of ballast waters into our ports. A recent study done of Victorian ports, published in May 1996 and entitled Ballast water, hull fouling and exotic marine organism introductions via ships, canvassed the problem in the ports of Melbourne, Geelong, Hastings and Portland. The port of Geelong in my electorate-as you would know Mr Deputy Speaker, as you have a keen interest in matters relating to ports-is Victoria's principal bulk and specialist cargo port. It is the major point for the export of bulk grains. It is also a major point for the import of crude oil and petroleum products, raw materials for aluminium smelting and fertilisers. It is also an export point for petroleum products. From August 1994 to July 1995 there were 342 ship visits and an estimated ballast water discharge of over one million tonnes. The study of the Geelong ports was interesting. It indicated that ballast water discharged into the port of Geelong came from ships which had come from other domestic ports. That is not to say that those ships did not originate outside Australia. When we go behind the statistics, from August 1994 to July 1995 the port of Geelong received a substantial amount of ballast from ships which had nominated Tasmanian ports, notably Hobart, as their last port of call. Target species causing problems-species which are known to be established in Hobart but which are not yet thought to have established viable populations in Victoria-are the Northern Pacific sea star and Japanese kelp. With the nature of the trade that is occurring, we understand there is a risk to our port from ships calling in at other ports in Australia, such as Hobart in Tasmania, taking on ballast there, coming to our port and discharging that ballast. Another interesting feature of the statistics was the fact that ships leaving our port also call in at other regional ports, notably Portland. Whilst the problem may have some international origins, the domestic linkages are very important as well. This legislation, as I indicated, will raise million for innovative research projects to overcome this problem. It is a problem that is going to have an increasingly important impact on regional economic development in Australia. Many communities are placing great store and emphasis on the growth of their aquaculture industries. The particular problems that are being caused by ballast water are substantial and threaten over the longer term significant economic developments and the potential for job growth in regional areas. As recently as last Friday, I held a seminar in my electorate on the potential for the development of Avalon airport as an air freight centre for the export of perishable foods to Asia. Part of the cargoes that we hope will be leaving Avalon will be fish products and other aquaculture products from Tasmania and perhaps northern Australia. I was privileged to have in my electorate the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who came and spoke at this seminar that I organised in my electorate. He indicated to us the very strong interest in Tasmania among fish producers and aquaculture producers in using the Avalon facility to export their product into Asian markets, particularly Japan. We are looking very much at the development of Avalon to secure some job growth and substantial export and economic growth for our region. We hope to draw product from Tasmania in a substantial way. We do not want to see this problem stunting the growth of aquaculture around Port Phillip Bay nor do we want to see a substantial source of supply-notably, Tasmania-being affected in an adverse way, as it is now, by the problem of ballast water discharge. In conclusion, we on this side of the House are quite proud of the role that previous Labor governments have played in getting industry to recognise the problem and setting the basis on which subsequent action by this government is based. We were a government that encouraged the global recognition of a problem that has to be tackled on a global scale. Some of the procedures and protocols which have been developed by AQIS here in Aus$2 tralia have become models for other countries to follow. We are pleased about that. We are also pleased that this legislation will be able to provide funds to resource innovative research projects that will come to grips with this problem. From our side of the House, we will not be opposing the measures in this bill. We encourage the path that the government has taken. We support the measures in a bipartisan way.",83
184,Mrs GASH,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"I rise to speak on the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997, which seek to impose a levy on certain ships. The levy will be used for research into ballast water management and the prevention of the introduction of harmful exotic species of water organisms into Australia. I speak today as a representative and resident of the most beautiful electorate in Australia, Gilmore. Central to the beauty of Gilmore is the unique, spectacular and unspoilt environment of Jervis Bay. Its kilometres of superb coastline are home to a diverse range of not only fauna and flora but also aquatic life. The marine habitat is renowned as one of the scuba diving centres of the world. Its consistently clear waters and abundant creatures attract tourists, divers and nature from all over the globe. These crystal waters are also the only place along Australia's eastern coastline where the waters are consistently clear enough for commercial and other fishing vessels to conduct thorough external hull inspections. These vessels are both Australian ships, which regularly call into ports throughout the world, as well as foreign commercial ships. Australian fishing vessels also visit, some of them long-line fishing operators who venture from Port Lincoln to Mackay onto the coast of New Zealand and regularly call into the calm waters of Jervis Bay. The hull inspections, which must be carried out every two years, involve running a video camera over the hull of huge container ships and checking for damage, metal fatigue and rust, something which is vital for the prevention of disasters like those seen off the Alaskan coastline, which killed thousands of birds and sea life and cost millions of dollars to clean up. Each vessel that enters the waters of Jervis Bay, excluding Australian naval vessels, which have their own stringent safeguards against pollution, must receive a permit which ?utlines its obligations. These obligations mclude that vessels do not discharge any foreign substances into the bay waters, including ballast water. While I welcome these requirements and the adherence to them by the ships' captains, I am well aware of the difficulties of policing this permit, particularly in relation to water discharges. As such, I welcome any move by this government that would see the development of a management plan to increase the compliance measures for ships which enter the marine reserve waters of Jervis Bay. I would now like to illustrate the damage to the natural marine environment which can be caused by the introduction of exotic species into Australian waters. In 1993, a study was commissioned into the impact of Asterias amurensis, commonly known as the Japanese starfish, into Tasmanian waters. This starfish is usually confined to Japan and through the Bering Sea to as far away as Alaska. The report by CSIRO researchers Stephanie lovers Davenport and Richard MCLoughlin is a preliminary assessment of the distribution and potential impact of the introduced starfish As-erias amurensis in Tasmanian waters. They estimate that the starfish was introduced into Tasmania in the early 1980s. In the decade between then and the CSIRO study, it has become ""Yell established in large numbers throughout the east and south coast estuaries of Tasmania. The Japanese starfish is a voracious feeder and predator. It feeds on shellfish, such as mussels, scallops and clams, as well as crabs, other starfish and dead fish. They have even been known to eat each other. T?e --port concluded that the starfish poses a slgmflcant threat to some existing wild fisheries and aquaculture enterprises. So far the prognosis for distribution is not good. According to the report: . . . the population now established on the east c<;>ast of - asmania coul- provide a source of rapid dispersal mto Bass Strait and beyond. The species has a potential distribution of much of the east coast of Australia possibly as far as Sydney. The impact of this species throughout the eastern seaboard would be disastrousnowhere more so than in Jervis Bay where tourism and a budding aquaculture industry depend on clean, beautiful seas, not to mention the devastating impact on the marine life in our waters. So far, physical removal of the starfish from Tasmanian waters has been the only successful means of reducing the numbers. There is no record of either commercial harvesting or pest control having caused the complete removal of any animal introduced into Australia. The CSIRO report recommends the immediate commencement of research into the potential for more effective solutions but concludes that 'Asterias amurensis like other introduced animals is here to stay'. A report by Melbourne University zoologists, Gerry Hawkes and Rob Day, stated that the introduction of the starfish to Tasmanian waters is 'thought to have occurred through the transport of larvae in the ballast water of ocean going vessels'. The report also notes: Increasingly frequent visits by intemational cargo and fishing fleets to Australian waters have enhanced the chances of exotic species becoming established. A survey of Japanese ships arriving in various of Australia regularly found live plankton at the bottom of ballast tanks. This issue should be addressed internationally as a matter of urgency. I welcome the move by this government to protect areas such as Jervis Bay from the introduction of species such as exotic starfish which can have a dramatic impact on both native species and aquaculture industries. This levy, which will place the onus on the shipping operators to play their part in protecting the environments they enter, will go some way towards assisting in the prevention of introduced species to Australian waters and in the management of these species once they have arrived. It is not only the marine environment and the starfish which threatens our coast that we are concerned about, but the health of the Australian people is also threatened by the introduction of exotic marine species. In 1993 the people of Gilmore and tourists to Jervis Bay witnessed one of the most horrific environmentally damaging algae blooms. While this outbreak was caused by a native species of algae, it showed that you only need the combination of algae seeds and the right conditions to create a huge environmental problem. When the algae is toxic, the situation is even more dangerous. Already there is evidence that toxic algae exists in Australian waters and can be transferred in the ballast waters of international shipping carriers. However, many characteristics of this algae are not understood. As we saw recently in Sydney, infection of our shellfish industry occurs easily and can have a huge impact on human health. The establishment of an aquaculture industry is still under consideration as part of the development of a plan of management for Jervis Bay Marine Park. There are already oyster leases in several of the bay's tributaries and calmer waters which could be threatened by the introduction of toxic algae. This would, in turn, endanger the lives of the consumers of these oysters, not to mention our industry. Ongoing research into aquaculture industry possibilities and ocean medicines is essential. The hypothetical situation is frightening, ports because the threat of marine infection through introduced species which have been transported by globetrotting ships in their ballast water is very real. Once infected ballast water releases an exotic algae into new waters, such as those in Jervis Bay, there are no predators and no inhibitors to its expansion. More research into prevention and the development of a management plan to cope with such an introduction are vital to the health of Australians and our waters. While welcoming the move by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to develop a significant protection program for our waterways, I would also like to pay tribute to the work of local bodies in the electorate of Gilmore, which contribute to maintaining the purity of the water and environment which make up the total experience which a person has when visiting Jervis Bay. Local residents are involved in groups such as the Lower Shoalhaven Catchment Management Committee to improve and enhance waterways throughout the Shoalhaven as well as those waterways which feed into Jervis Bay. The management committee of its own initiative has developed plans to clean up and resurrect local rivers. They are cleaning out the exotic weeds across our escarpments and have coordinated their efforts with local farmers and business people to ensure farm chemicals do not infect our waterways. I commend the actions of the management committee, whose members are mostly voluntary, to take a stand and to work towards a cleaner environment for the residents of Gilmore. They are ably supported in their endeavours by the local Coastcare organisation which works very closely with local voluntary organisations, such as the Ulladulla Boardriders, to resurrect and protect sanddune environments and coastal vegetation for both local residents and visitors to the region. There have been notable increases in the numbers of dolphins which have been spotted in Jervis Bay. One of my favourite pastimes, which is shared by many Gilmore residents and visitors, is to watch whales using the bay as a playground on their migration north. Seals, penguins and bird life, including the magnificent albatross, are being monitored and, where possible, protected by local community groups and individuals who devote their time and energy to preserving the natural environment which makes up the unique experience of Jervis Bay. 1 also commend this government for the $1.2 billion it has committed to the environment through the Natural Heritage Trust, part of which will be allocated to community groups and organisations under the coastal and clean seas scheme. Coastal and clean seas will support the conservation, sustainable use and repair of Australia's coastal and marine environments. The program will target coastal and marine pollution, threats to marine biodiversity and habitat degradation-such as those posed by introduced species-and promote the sustainable use of coastal and marine resources. Gilmore residents have welcomed the introduction of the Natural Heritage Trust with the allocation of five programs which will focus on protection and conservation of the local environment. I am now urging all local groups to consider applying for funding under the coastal and clean seas program to help protect one of our most important assets. Tourism, of which Jervis Bay is a vital part, is worth more than $500 million annually to the Shoalhaven. Destroying that through the introduction of marine pests would not only impact on the tourism industry but also on one of the great icons of the Australian coastline-our beaches. The coast and clean seas program will provide $4 million for the reduction, management and local eradication of introduced marine pests. It is a partnership between government, industry and the community to protect Australia's waterways from the introduction of exotic species. Already the J apanese starfish, Japanese kelp, European shore crab and Northern Pacific sea star have become the foxes, rabbits and thistles of our seas. This initiative will include a rapid response capability to ensure that outbreaks of marine pests are eradicated before they can establish a foothold in new locations; implementation of management arrangements and guidelines to prevent the spread of pests via coastal shipping; projects aimed at reduction, management and local control of pests; and an amount of $1 million for the strategic ballast water research program administered by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The pro'gram will be a coordinated effortinvolving communities, ports, industries, the three tiers of government and the CSIRO-to protect our waters from these unwanted pests. But it is not only our environment and our health which will benefit from the introduction of these measures to protect our waterways. Australia's industry will also benefit. With 98 per cent of all cargo moved into and out of Australia by ships, it is important that the industry plays a role in looking after its own environment. In Gilmore, our largest industry is manufacturing. In fact, we have the third largest rural manufacturing sector in New South Wales. Small businesses make up a large proportion of these industries, and small and large businesses in Gilmore have been very proactive in accessing markets overseas. I must commend them for their initiatives. Shoalhaven businesses alone were assisted with more than $340,000 in export grants this year from this government. The first regional supermarket to Asia forum was held in the Gilmore electorate in recognition of the efforts of the local industry to promote their products overseas. Our boutique winemakers, surfwear designers, abalone and flower growers, starch and paper mafmfacturers, amongst many others, have been very successful in their efforts to access overseas markets. To continue this success, we need to protect both our shipping industry and our waters from further pollution. A further aid to our export industry will the development of the expanded regional road system, particularly the development of main road 92, which provides a link between Nowra and the south coast and the major highways in the west, creating better access not only for trucks to Melbourne but for Defence to their headquarters in Canberra and exports through the Canberra airport. In terms of the Defence contribution to the local community, there are more than 1,600 personnel currently stationed at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, injecting millions of dollars into the local community in terms of services as well as contracts for local industry. This looks set to increase with the proposed $126 million expansion of Albatross, which will boost the base's population to more than 4,000. Both HMAS Albatross and HMAS Creswell in Jervis Bay have developed their own stringent environmental management plans to ensure protection of the local area, its plants and animals. I commend those bases for their consideration of the local environment and community, and I commend the Defence Force as a whole for commitment to ensuring that no impact on Jervis Bay will occur. It will also provide an improved tourist loop, which will include Canberra and Sydney, with Jervis Bay being an important icon for visitors to the region. I congratulate the three tiers of government-the Commonwealth, state and Shoalhaven City Council-for recently committing the funding required to investigate the route selection for main road 92. It has been a long time coming, more than two decades, and it has taken the guts of the present council, the state government and this government to not only recognise the benefits to the region but make a firm commitment to doing something about it. Once the road is developed, increased numbers of tourists will be visiting Jervis Bay and the beaches of the south coast. Already 700,000 visitors a year walk through the serene and spectacular environment of the Jervis Bay National Park. Jervis Bay has more visitors than both Uluru and Kakadu. We must ensure that we protect the Jervis Bay be experience by protecting the purity of our water. Once again, I would like to reaffirm the government's commitment to not building a nuclear reactor in Jervis Bay. Despite scaremongering and misinformation by members of the ALP outside of this House, this government gave its firm commitment some months ago that the reactor at Lucas Heights would not be moved to Jervis Bay. Claims to the contrary are just prime examples of how the Labor Party is not interested in getting the facts straight, and their politics of scaremongering, when they know their statements are not fact. It is vital that this bill receive the support of all members of parliament as it is an important step in the protection of our coasts and waterways, our own industry and environment, and the health of all Australians now and in the future. Jervis Bay is a special place. It holds some of the world's most important marine animals. It is surrounded by forests and wetlands of national significance and is right in the transition zone for waters from tropical to temperate environments. As such, it is a difficult enough place for many of our marine species to survive and flourish. We do not need the introduction of exotic predators to threaten our marine life and industry and any moves to prevent this are to be welcomed by industry, by the residents of Gilmore and by all Australians who care about the environment.  p.m.}-I am pleased to participate in this debate on the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997. I am pleased that the opposition is giving its full support to an initiative that really started well back in the time of the previous Labor government. It is good to read the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) claiming the great progress the government has made, but at least he puts in the times and the dates. They were all in the period of the previous Labor government. So what this government is doing is simply carrying on the good work in this area that had begun under the previous Labor government. When I first raised this matter by way of a question on notice on 27 March 1979 to the then Minister for Transport, I asked: What specific precautions are taken to prevent any imbalance or contamination of marine ecology in Australia by the discharge of ship's ballast water taken on at foreign ports. That question arose because a captain from ANL had drawn to my attention his concern about exotic species of vegetation that were growing on the seabed off Port Walcott in north Western Australia in the iron ore ports. The answer that came back was simply an answer to brush aside the issue at that time. It was question No. 3537, and the answer from Mr Nixon, the then Minister for Transport, was this: Following investigation of this matter in 1975 by a Committee convened by my Departmentremember,this was asked in 1979the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account made funds available to NSW State Fisheries to investigate the effect of exotic organisms in ship's ballast water on the Australian marine environment. This investigation has been completed and a report is to be made to the Fishing Industry Research Committee. Further action will depend on the findings of that report. So back in those very early days, when these exotic organisms were first noticed, the response of the government at the time was to brush it aside as being a fishing industry matter, not a marine ecology matter. Australia has been a world leader in response to dealing with problems associated with the discharge of ballast water. Across the world, some 10 billion tonnes of ballast water is moved each year globally. Within that figure, 120 million tonnes per year is moved into or around Australian waters. When one looks at the activity of the individual ports, one can see that Port Hedland has in excess of 15 million tonnes. Port Walcott has 15 million tonnes. Hay Point has 15 million tonnes. Port Newcastle has 15 million tonnes. Port Kembla has more than 10 million tonnes of ballast water. In each of those ports, the ballast water is transported on an annual basis. Some of those figures would have expanded since they were first drawn up. The Iron Pacific, the world's largest coal carrier, has a dead weight tonnage of 231,000 and carries 130,000 tonnes of ballast water. I think that gives some perspective of the amount of water being transported around the globe and into and out of Australian ports. The condition of ballast tanks is also one of the major factors associated with ship safety. A big bulk carrier usually has three ballast tanks on each side of the ship running forward to the bow. They can be up to 60 metres long. They have baffles in them to prevent the rapid movement and sloshing of water backwards and forwards. They would reach from the floor of this chamber to the top of the seating in the gallery and their width would be probably from where you are sitting, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the end of the table here. These tanks cover an enormous area and hold very large quantities of water. When you realise that the Iron Pacific carries 130,000 tonnes when it is fully ballasted and it recently lifted 202,000 tonnes of coal from Gladstone, one can get some idea of the dimensions, the quantities and the weights that are involved in the transportation of ballast water. Ballast tanks themselves are difficult to enter. They are not always inspected because when a ship comes into an Australian port it is generally with ballast on board and the ballast water should be discharged at the same rate at which the vessel is loaded-it does not always follow, but that is what should happen under proper operating conditions. As the ballast water is drained out or pumped out, the load comes on board so the ship is not twisted, bent or put under undue stress. I went on board the motor vessel Ajax in, I think, 1995 at Port Newcastle. That vessel had the openings to the ballast tanks left open whilst it was loading. The inspector happened to look down and saw the condition of the steel members inside the ballast tank. Ultimately, the vessel was detained for serious corrosion within the ballast tanks, remembering the dimensions of those tanks that I have referred to earlier. The level of corrosion was very serious in the stringers that run from stem to forward to strengthen the ship and the bearers that run across the ship. No-one ever sees much of what happens inside a ballast tank, so serious corrosion inside a ship can be concealed for a long time before it is noticed. It was just bad luck for that ship operator· that it happened to be noticed. The response of the ship managers from Piraeus, Greece, at the time when they sent a construction supervisor out was to say, 'That is only a number of the stringers that run fore and aft on the ship that reinforce the decks and the bottom of the vessel and the hull. That is only 10 per cent of the stringers in the ship. The other 90 per cent are all right, so there really is not a problem.' He was avoiding the fact that the 10 per cent was concentrated all in one part of the ship. Had that ship subsequently got into heavy weather or difficult conditions, ultimately it would have fractured and snapped in two. So ballast water and the carriage of ballast water are very important in terms of ship safety. Australia has been at the forefront of international reaction to this matter. It is a matter of real importance to the industry . We have been at the forefront in introducing measures for reducing the risks posed by the introduction of exotic marine pests and diseases through ships ballast water. We raised the matter at the International Maritime Organisation in 1991. With the support of other countries with similar concerns, the IMO has developed draft international regulations that will form the basis of an additional annex to MARPOL 73178. That legislation will be coming forward shortly. As part of this process, Australia has chaired the IMO working group on the issue and coordinated the work of a correspondence group on structural integrity and stability requirements for ships engaged in ballast water exchange operations. Australia has also highlighted at the IMO critical safety elements relating to the exchange of ballast at sea. It is expected that the new annex will enter into force internationally within three to four years. In the past year alone, Australia has experienced several serious incursions of unwanted exotic marine organisms. A recent follow-up study has shown that there have been over 45 newly established exotic incursions in Australian coastal waters in the past decade. Not all of those have been harmful organisms, but some have been and it is a matter of great concern to this nation. We consider that there is a considerable degree of urgency in securing a mandatory ballast water annex to MARPOL. We must continue to alert the IMO that Australia is contemplating the application of current domestic legislation. We should be doing that to give mandatory authority to ballast water management requirements. Those arrangements would be in line with the provisions of the draft IMO regulations and guidelines and should be amended as revisions occur at IMO. That will help ensure international consistency and at the same time such action would be addressing an urgent need for Australia to more effectively control ballast water discharges. In July last year I was fortunate to attend hearings of the US House of Representatives Transport and Infrastructure Committee's Coast. Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee regarding the introduction of their legislation-a bill for the National Invasive Species Act 1996. That bill was dealing with the same problem in the United States. I sat through a couple of hours of the hearings. The legislation was being supported by all those appearing before the committee. One of the submissi()ns made the point that the US, which has a much worse problem than we have, spends close to $100 million annually to prevent the invasion of new agricultural pests but, in contrast, spends $1 million per year to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous aquatic organisms. So all of the submitters at the day that I sat through the hearings were supporting legislation in the United States similar to the legislation that is here. The US Coast Guard submitter appearing before the committee, Captain Richard Bennis, supported what was being put forward in the legislation and also a voluntary compliance code and a review of the effectiveness of voluntary guidelines and regulations every three years. He made the point in his submission that, if the voluntary guidelines do not work, then they need to move to mandatory guidelines.",86
185,Unknown,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to  break I was referring to a submission by the US Coast Guard, the statement of Captain Richard Bennis, on the National Invasive Species Act 1996, which was before the US House of Representatives Subcommittee on Water Resources and the Environment and the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, on 17 July last year. Time does not permit me to go through all the provisions covered in the submission made by the Coast Guard, but it is interesting to note that the Coast Guard submission refers to Australia-the problem is not one that is unique to the United States-having encountered an invasion by dinoflagellates which cause toxic algae blooms and how Europe was invaded by the zebra mussel. The zebra mussel proliferates in the Great Lakes of the United States. It is a small mussel, but it breeds at a fantastic rate. What I listened to, during the presentations at those hearings, was how these mussels effectively smothered the inlet pipes, or the pump-out outlets, in the Great Lakes where water is drawn for various purposes. There was the enormous task of constantly clearing the growth of the zebra mussels from strainers and sieves and screens. It is a freshwater animal which transferred from a northern European freshwater source to the Great Lakes. Some 500 exotic species have been introduced into the Great Lakes. We think we have a problem; their problem is vastly greater. We also think in Australia of the problems of imported non-indigenous species. A submission on the Sacramento-San Jaoquin Delta in the US referred to the 'AustralianNew Zealand boring isopod Sphaeroma quoyanuam which creates characteristic Sphaeroma topography' on many San Francisco Bay shores 'with many linear meters of fringing mud banks riddled with its half-centimetre diameter holes'. It goes on to refer to this Australian species being transported to San Francisco Bay and how it has effectively destabilised and weakened the rocks along the shores and facilitated the removal of the rocks by wave action. The submission refers to Australia as exporting our indigenous species to other parts of the 8 p.m. world. Can I turn now to the Port of Newcastle. Newcastle imports more than 10 per cent of the annual intake of ballast water-120 million tonnes per year are brought into Australian ports and 15 million tonnes of that ballast water is brought into the Port of Newcastle and is discharged in the Port of Newcastle. There are some 50,000 international ship visits to Australia each year from 300 countries spread over a thousand portsobviously some of them are fairly small-and in Newcastle that 15 million tonnes per annum is from domestic and overseas vessels but mostly from overseas. I am pleased to say that the port has been participating in the national ballast water study conducted by the CSIRO at the request of AQIS. The Centre for Research into Introduced Marine Pests completed a study in Newcastle about a month ago. I will come to that in a moment. In general terms, the result of that study showed there to be no evidence of introduced species except those that have been there for a long time. Before water ballast came into use in the early part of this century, solid ballast was used. In the case of Cook's Endeavour, for instance, cast iron was roped to the keel of the ship. In Newcastle, we have great quantities of rubble and bricks from the San Francisco earthquake that all arrived as ballast. Overall, Newcastle has played a major role in the receipt of ballast, although one it would rather not have. It seems that in the Port of Newcastle there is the yellowfin goby fish, an exotic species that has arrived, an invertebrate, the slater, and the mysid shrimp. Apart from that, we are fortunate to the extent that we have not had the problems that have developed in other ports, yet we do not know the life cycle of these introduced species and how long they take to develop. Various measures are put forward on how to deal with ballast water. Some of those involve the exchange of ballast water while others suggest ozone bombardment or filtration. Another proposal is the heating of the ballast water by passing it through the cooling systems of the engines of the vessel. I have seen one proposal that says that that does not involve much expense, but we have to look at those and ensure they are practical. Another proposal is the use of chemicals, and chlorine has been suggested. In the use of, chlorine, one would have to look at the consequential effects of its use and any further damage that might be caused to the environment. The easiest thing to do is to stop the entry of the ballast water. As the US Coast Guard submission said: don't wait until after it has arrived; deal with it by not letting it enter the port in the first place. Ballast water exchange at sea is not as easy as it sounds. About 80 per cent of the ships coming to Australia-as quoted by Dr Meryl Williams-are already exchanging ballast water. I note that she did not say what percentage of the ballast water is exchanged-the ships and the quantity of water do not necessarily equate-but the exchange of ballast water at sea has limitations. It is dependent on the size of the vessel, the structural integrity of the vessel and the weather conditions, and the essential exchange needs to be completed before any weather change. It needs to take into account the stability of the vessel-the inflow-outflow may be able to matched or it may not be-and it very much involves crew training and competency. I mentioned earlier the motor vessel Ajax and the serious corrosion that happened to it. Let me tum to another vessel, the ship of shame GIGA II at Port Kembla. On 5 November 1996 there was a collapse in its bulkhead between holds 4 and 5. In this case it is clear that the lack of competency on the part of the officers in charge of the ballasting of the vessel led to the hold being overloaded. Some 18 metres of water was put into the hold rather than the safe limit of 14 metres. The additional four metres doubled the pressure upon the bulkhead with the result that the bulkhead burst. There were two waterside workers working in the hold adjoining. One had a rope tied from his waist to a ladder-in case he fell off the ladder, not in case the bulkhead above his head burst. These are the kinds of people that the government and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) refer to as the rorting waterside workers, the idle ones or the inefficient ones. These are two decent Australian citizens. They were engulfed by many tonnes of water as the bulkhead burst. One was able to get to the top of the water as the water cascaded down from the hold. The other was submerged for some minutes. Rescuers finally got to him and pulled on the rope that was intended to hold him in case he fell off the ladder. It was that rope that enabled the rescuers to drag him out. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) will talk in more detail about that as I do not have time. Conclusion No. 5 of the report of the Marine Incident Investigation Unit states: There was no clear explanation as to the critical nature of the limit placed on the depth of ballast water in No. 4 hold. This was compounded by a lack of clear operating instructions, either in the native language of the ship's personnel or the working language of the ship. In other words, it was a multiracial crew which was not competent. Even if you wanted to read the instructions in English they were not there. The report further states: . . . detection of any deficiencies in the structure of the bulkhead was beyond the scope of Port State control inspections; and based on the system for assessing applications for single voyage permits, there was no reason to refuse the application. My view differs very seriously with those conclusions. I do not accept them. This vessel had a history of name change. It was a ship of shame. There was knowledge about that ship. There should have been much greater care taken in granting a permit for that vessel. It may be the investigator's conclusion that the detection of any deficiencies was beyond the scope of port state control inspections but that is certainly not the case for of that vessel. It was sheer good fortune, which the member for Throsby will refer to later, that the waterside worker who had been submerged beneath the water in the vessel survived after several weeks in a coma. Again I point out that it is a question of ballast water. They cut out a piece of the bulkhead and sent it away for sampling but it did not get there. The piece of bulkhead was destroyed.

186,Mr BILSON,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"Dunkley) (8.10 p.m.)Before us this evening are a few pages which represent two small bills-the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997. I suggest to the House that they are probably two of the most significant bills that this House will consider. In my view they are one of the most significant environment protection measures that this parliament has discussed in recent times, imd it deserves to be a headline grabber. I am disappointed that there are not more members of the press gallery present. I hope that many of those listening on PNN and through other avenues will take the time to acquaint themselves with what we are discussing tonight because it represents world's best practice in environmental management, happening in this country right now, being introduced by this government. Of itself, it is such a significant and constructive step for the protection of our environment and our marine ecosystems that it deserves more attention. It deserves to be one of those items that is the feature piece in weekend newspapers and magazines, because it is very exciting and it is very important. It is also evidence that the coalition understands environmental management issues and has the wit and the commitment to actually develop and implement responsive strategies. What you are seeing tonight is a further demonstration of the coalition's will to implement these strategies. It builds upon the early work done by the former government-which I must compliment them on as a good start; a bit ad hoc but a good start nonetheless-and seeks to put in place a comprehensive action program and strategy to address this very the charterers significant issue. As I mentioned earlier, in part through the work of the previous government Australia has had a role at the forefront of the development of international conventions relating to these sorts of issues through what is known as the MARPOL convention, surrounding the prevention of pollution from ships and the annexures that attach to and support the convention. I believe that what we are discussing tonight and what is facilitated through these bills will very much underline Australia's position as the world's leader in this area of ballast water management. This proposal we are discussing tonight is part of the coalition's world-class environmental policy, saving our natural heritage. It is a pleasure to be here discussing it this evening as I had the good fortune of being part of the formulation of that policy and working alongside then shadow minister, Rod Kemp, during its preparation. The coalition's policy that it took to the last election clearly identified that the introduction of noxious marine species into our waterways and into our marine environment was a significant threat not only to the marine ecosystems themselves but also to many other activities that depend upon the ecosystems. These include the economic advantages of aquaculture and the fishing industry and also our simple enjoyment of our coastal waterwaysand that is something that is very dear to my heart being a member that represents a coastal electorate. On 3 March, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) highlighted the importance of this issue: ... oil spills can be dramatic, (but) foreign marine organisms are more insidious. By the time they are noticed, it is often too late to exterminate themand they can do permanent environmental and economic damage. In line with that sentiment, ballast water, used throughout the last century as a means of stabilising ships in transit, has been identified as a potential risk to our environment. Around 150 million tonnes of ballast water is discharged every year by more that 4,000 vessels arriving at the 40 ports around our country. Ninety-eight per cent of all cargo in and out of Australia is moved by ship. Almost without exception, all the jobs in our mineral and agricultural export industries rely on coastal shipping. More recently recognised, though, is the significant threat that this ballast represents. There is an understanding that ballast water is not only a very important ingredient in the safe shipping and safe transport of our export goods but also a increasing recognition that the negligent discharge of it can place our marine environment under great duress and place at risk our natural ecosystems. The coalition's coast and clean seas initiative recognised the need for action and the need to support a strengthened research effort. The Prime Minister announced $1 million to go towards strategic ballast water research and development for 1997-98. The bills before us tonight are a continuation of funding beyond 1997-98 for a further two years by the introduction of a levy which is to be paid by the industry. This levy, I would say, stops short of polluter pays, but does recognise that the industry sees that it has a role in helping to address this problem. It is an important issue not only for our environment but also for the continuation of safe coastal and international shipping. The coast and clean seas initiative provides for a number of goals-the reduction, management and local eradication of introduced marine pests, the rapid response capability to stamp out new outbreaks where they are identified and strategies to prevent the spread of pests by coastal shipping. Those broad strategic goals are backed up by a strategic ballast water research and development program that targets efforts, research and resources. It has been developed by the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council, which includes shipping and bulk exporting representatives. So the industry has come on board and said, 'We want to be a part of these solutions. We understand the role that coastal shipping plays. We understand the role of international shipping and the importance of ballast water in the safe movement of those ships.' But it has also recognised that our environment has been changed by the ballast water discharging some noxious pests, plants and animals into our environment. The bill before us this evening talks about collecting, on average, a million dollars a year water for each of 1998-99 and 1999-2000. It produces $2 million on top of that $1 million the Prime Minister has already announced for the strategic ballast water research and development program. The bill provides for the payment of a levy of $210 per bulk carrier and $140 for other ships, including tankers, that are greater than SO metres in length per quarter. It is a levy that is payable quarterly, but it is only one levy payment per quarter per ship. So, if you happen to be a repeat visitor to this country or to our ports, you are not clocking up extra levies. You are paying one levy for the quarter, which, I might suggest, is actually a better deal than some of the frequent flier deals that are available for those who go by air. The industry supports the bill. It has been active in the development of not only the bill itself but the research and development program that I have briefly mentioned. As active contributors, the industry is to be supported and recognised for this effort, an effort acknowledging that established marine practice gives rise to threats to our environment, and the industry has recognised that it has a part responsibility for ensuring that those threats do not tum into disaster for our marine environment. The proposals that are being supported through these bills are very practical. They are a very sensible and responsible response to these concerns, concerns that the industry understands. They are the concerns of those who rely upon,or whose livelihood relies upon, the work the industry is doing. They are the concerns that have been recognised by marine conservationists, by recreational fishers, by divers, by natural resource managers, by public and animal health authorities, by seafood producers in the communities whose livelihoods depend on it and by ordinary folk in electorates like mine who could think of nothing more enjoyable than last weekend wandering down to Port Phillip Bay beach at Frankston and getting some relief from the very warm temperatures that surrounded us at the time. The bill gives us the mechanism to raise those funds. But what is most exciting is not the raising of the funds themselves; it is what the money is being applied to. It is what the bill facilitates that is most exciting and fasciAustralians nating, and it is something that I would encourage everybody to acquaint themselves with. With that industry cooperation, the strategic ballast water research and development program includes a number of very important elements to deal with the array of problems that are already appearing at some of our ports which have already been identified by speakers before me. Marine organisms introduced into Australia through ballast water discharge include the yellowfin goby, the striped goby, Japanese sea bass and sobaity sea bass. We have some species of crabs, isopods and shrimps that are not native to our area and are competing with our native animals and plant life for the nutrients and sea space that are available. We have Asian mussels, sea slugs and the European fanworm, known as the sabella, which cause such concern in the Port Phillip area because it fastens itself to crustaceans and makes the scallop industry wonder where their future is when they have these what I call 'underwater alfalfa'. Sadly, we do not have a market for them like we have for alfalfa, and they are causing great concern. The Northern Pacific sea star is well known to people in southern ports and, sadly, brown kelp is also rearing its head in more places throughout the country. Those sorts of introduced species are competing with and, in many respects, compromising the marine ecosystems in the bays, coastal areas and waterways where they present themselves. In many respects, our native underwater flora and fauna cannot compete to establish itself. We are seeing a compromising of those natural marine ecosystems. So, at an environmental level, these measures that are before us tonight are extraordinarily significant. They are extraordinarily significant because they are about protecting an environment that, in my view, is an ecosystem that we know least about. The ecosystem on our planet that we least understand and has been least explored is our underwater world. So these are extraordinarily important measures that go to investing in our future because the marine environment is so important to this country and so important to many who just absolutely adore it like I do. Part of the strategic ballast water program that is seeking to respond to those threats that are already here includes baseline study reporting so we can understand what sorts of noxious species have established themselves at ports throughout the country. Let us understand what the problem is so we can tackle it head-on. Very exciting and world's best practice again is the decision support system, which I would like to come back to a little later, if I may. Also, another part is a risk assessment methodology, which is at the heart of what we are doing. As you would well be aware, we in this country have traditionally addressed ballast water as a quarantine issue. That has been our practice. It has been the practice of countries like New Zealand. That is the strategy that we have adopted in line with AQIS strategies of risk assessment and harm minimisation. This is an important component of this program. Work and investment have also gone into port environment comparisons so that we can understand where the sensitivities are in these port areas, so we can get an understanding of what sorts of species fasten themselves and make one of our port areas home when we would really rather they were not there in the first place. BHP has been very enthusiastic about management measures and is leading the charge on heat treatment of ballast water en route. The idea is a simple one that says that, since you are generating a lot of heat through the engines of those large ships, why not use that heat to increase the temperature of the ballast water and kill the organisms that are in that ballast water? So some very exciting work is going on in that area and, as the previous speaker, the member for Shortland  effective way of dealing with it. There is also an awareness strategy just to make sure everybody is informed and understands the sorts of issues we are addressing here. The ballast water sampling and testing trials are equally important too to help us detect and manage infected ballast water. We do not have the resources available to send out ballast water policemen onto every vessel that travels around our exclusive economic zone and comes into our coastal shipping channels. Why not look at ways of testing the ballast in ships to see what the risks are and then develop our strategies to respond to those higher risk areas? That is what I will come back to shortly also. Then there is a project to understand what organisms survive ballast water movements in and out of ships and there are port contingency plans. What happens when a ship pulls in at port and finds the ballast it has is contaminated? How do we deal with that? How can we handle that so we can get rid of the ballast water in such a way that it does not present the environmental risks it may if it were disposed of recklessly? There is also community monitoring for marine pests. Many people talk about seeing unusual marine life popping up around their favourite swimming and diving areas, and that often is the first trigger that we have a problem. So that is a very important part of the package as well. I am hopeful the research proposals from tertiary students may lead to the next Jacques Cousteau coming from this country. There are also resources available in this package to tackle some research projects that should give us more insight into what we are dealing with here. In the few minutes that are left available to me, I would like to particularly celebrate the work of our Department of Primary Industries and Energy and this government in the development of the ballast water decision support system. This is world-class work going on in this country which is leading the rest of the world in the management of ballast water. The idea is a very sensible one and it is borne out of the quarantine strategy I mentioned earlier. It is about understanding the risks that costare associated with ballast water coming from different ships and from different parts of the world and then developing management strategies to ensure that problems associated with those risks are dealt with, that the ballast water is treated in such a way that it respects the likely nasties that are within it and that we can ensure. a cost-effective regime is around to protect our waterways, our ports and our exclusive economic zone. The decision support system seeks to identify what new marine species may be introduced to the port. There are the lessons of experience, being informed by the strategic research and development program I spoke of earlier, to determine what level of risk is posed by any particular vessel visiting an Australian port and the strategies to be put in place to deal with that. The decision support model has a risk assessment end point-that is, what is the likelihood of a nasty occurrence?-and it then sets in place a number of methodologies to deal with that prior to any release of the ballast water and the risks it may contain. This is world-class thinking. This is leading the world, and international bodies are looking at what this country is doing. They are celebrating our vigour in being prepared to do something about it, but also respecting those good people like Denis Patterson, Penny Lockwood and others from the department of primary industries who are putting a lot of effort into protecting our coastal waters and our marine environment. In this decision support system, there are ways of checking whether people have actually managed their ballast water in the way they said they have. If we have these guidelines in place, informed by the research we have done that says that shipping from point A to point B may bring with it certain risks because of the ballast water it accompanies, we can put in place plans and strategies to deal with that ballast water to guard against that risk. We are not out on every one of those 4,000 or more ships that enter our ports-we are not out there-so at times we have to ensure that the guidelines we have put in place, informed by the research that we and others are doing, are actually implemented. The beauty about the decision support system is that it actually has built within it a mechanism to validate that people have done the right thing-to verify how they have dealt with their ballast water and to test the water in the ballast itself to identify where it has come from, whether it has been taken on board in a manner consistent with the guidelines that seek to manage the risks and whether those risks have been overcome by ballast water that does not have those noxious organisms within it. This is very exciting stuff. Should we discover through this decision support system that high risk people are not doing what is required of them, then we have identified that and we can deal with it through those contingency plans. Moreover, if people are not being fulsome in their advice to our officials about what they are doing to manage their ballast water, they immediately become a high risk ship and the contingency plans kick in because of that. There are exceptionally exciting things going on that I would encourage all members to acquaint themselves with and also the pres's to get excited about, because this is world-class technology being developed in this country for our particular circumstances. The bills also seek to put an end life on the raising of this money. It is a two-year proposition, a million dollars a year for two years to carry out $3 million worth of research and development, including that extra million that the Prime Minister already announced from the Natural Heritage Trust. This is a package that has been supported by the industry and is being developed in consultation with the industry. The industry is actively involved in directing where those resources are spent under a strategic research and development plan. It is but one very important part of the coasts and clean seas package that this government is seeking to introduce. It is a package that recognises stormwater, effluent discharge and the way we handle our coastal areas-that their own popularity can be their worse enemy. The whole package that is embraced in the coasts and clean seas is about protecting the marine environment that I am sure all Australians love. When you see images of Australia overseas, you see bronzed Aussies associated with beaches and coastlines. Have a look at the map of Australia. We all want to live near the coastline. But also have a look at our responsibilities that come with the exclusive economic zone-the enormous area of ocean this country is now responsible for the management of. What you are seeing is a government putting in place a comprehensive program not only to deal with those responsibilities but to seek to address some of the problems that have occurred in the past. I commend these bills to the House. I am sure all the good folk of the electorate of Dunkley who like to go fishing on Port Phillip Bay and at Western Port would be delighted to know that there is activity going on here. So, when there is a bend in the rod and a tightening of the line when fishing off Mornington or somewhere like that, you will not bring up a European fan worm, called a sabella; you will have hooked a wonderful flathead or a snapper and can continue to enjoy that wonderful experience we all enjoy so much.",94
187,Mr HOLLIS,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"I am pleased to participate in this cognate debate on the ballast water bills. It has been a fairly wide-ranging debate, and I must say I am surprised that ballast water can be stretched quite as far as some of the speakers have stretched it. The legislation, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and other members, has long-term environmental consequences for Australia and is important to Australia. As others have said-including the previous speaker, the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson)-we all enjoy the beach, we are all very proud of the coastline around Australia and we all want to keep that coastline as pristine as possible. It is becoming an ever increasing fight to keep the waters off Australia in the pristine condition they are and the beaches as sparkling as they are, but that is a commitment we all should make and all should work towards. As has been pointed out, the purpose of the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 is to enable a research and development levy to be collected from certain ships arriving in Australian ports. The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 will introduce a levy on certain ships to provide funding for the strategic ballast water research and development program. This is to fund research and development aimed at minimising the risks and, in the longer term, possible prevention of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and diseases transported in ballast waters and on ships' hulls. The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 will provide a framework for the levy. I was interested in what some of the government members have been saying. I make the point, as other opposition members have, that the opposition have no difficulty with these bills. We approach them in a very bipartisan way. I think that what those opposite have been saying is a bit rich-although I am not taking anything away from the enthusiasm of the government membersbecause this legislation did not suddenly happen with a change of government. It has been a long time in train. Australia has over many years played a very leading part, through the IMO and other organisations, in the study of ballast water. Our marine environment is too important to us to allow it to be destroyed by any unwanted or damaging species in the ballast of ships. Currently about 80 per cent of ships coming into Australian ports are exchanging their ballast water at sea to try to halt the spread marine pests. We want that figure higher. We do not want any more imported species coming into Australia. It has been confirmed that at least 15 unwanted aquatic species and organisms, including fish, molluscs, worms and toxic algae, have been transferred to Australia and established here. The most likely source of transfer was ballast water. Whilst ballast water has been used by shipping for around 100 years, it is only recently that the extent of the problem has become known. Shipping traffic has increased, travel time between ports has become more efficient and, as many ports with which Australia trades become more polluted, the threat to Australian waterways has increased enormously. Not only the travel time has speeded up; the size of ships has also increased. I was particularly interested in what the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) had to say about some of the huge coal carriers and the amount of ballast water they carry. Sometimes over 100,000 tonnes of ballast water is in those ships and it often has to be discharged while the ships are loading. Australia has had a long history of importing unwanted species. You only have to look around the countryside to see the things that have been imported: rabbits, thistles, carp and various other things. Some have been deliberately imported and others have come in as pets. We have had a long history of things coming into Australia, settling very well here and expanding. Australia has very strict quarantine laws. People corning into Australia joke about the fact that when they are on the plane they get sprayed-various things like that. We have, quite rightly, very strict quarantine laws. If some of the unwanted land borne diseases came into this country, they would devastate our agricultural industry. It is a pity that over the years we have not paid the same amount of attention to unwanted species that are corning in here on the hulls of ships or in the ballast water. Some years ago a group of people came to see me and told me that the oysters in Twofold Bay were being wiped out because of diseases brought into the bay in the ballast waters of of ships when they were coming into pick up woodchips. Most of these ships, which were from Japan, were corning in with ballast water and letting it go in Twofold Bay, which was having a disastrous effect on the oysters there. Not only were we shipping woodchips out for very low prices-and that is another debate which I won't go into now-but, through that woodchip industry, we were also wiping out an important industry on the far south coast of New South Wales. Representing as I do Port Kembla, every so often I get a telephone call asking me to go down to the port to have a look at the dead fish floating around. I have never been able to bring them back to life;· nevertheless, I actually look at the dead fish. There has been debate for some time about the dead fish that tum up every so often in the port. Whether it is because of the amount of industry round there and the pollution that they sometimesaccidentally, I am sure-release into the harbour, or whether it is ballast that is being discharged in the port during the loading of ships, I do not know. There has been extensive consultation on this legislation. This action was proposed by the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council. The levy amount to be charged is $210 for bulk carriers and $110 for all other ships, including tankers with a length of 50 metres or longer. It will have a relativetween ly low impact on the industry when compared with costs of up to, say, $20,000 per day for a ship idle in a port. As I said before, Australia has played an important role in regard to ballast water. This is not surprising, given the amount of shipping that comes here and the amount of coastline Australia has. It does raise a serious question as to the condition of ships, especialhold. ly given current government policy to open up the Australian coastline to the rust buckets of the world by doing away with cabotage. I raise this issue because of the condition of some ships. They cannot withstand the ballast pressure. A case in point was the GIGA II incident-which my colleague the member for Shortland has referred to-which happened in my electorate of Port Kembla. What happened is that because of the defective equipment on the ship on No.4 hull, or rust there, it had increase in ballast from 14 to 18 metres. This resulted in more than doubling the maximum stresses within the bulkhead structure. The walls of the plate were insufficient to withstand the forces and the bulkhead buckled, mainly because of extreme corrosion. I will elaborate a little more, since I a little time. Early on 5 November 1996, the 140,000-tonne deadweight Malaysian flag bulk carrier GIGA II was nearing completion of discharge of a cargo of iron ore at No. 2 discharge berth, Port Kembla. Due to the vessel's light condition, the unloader could not be positioned over No. 1 hold to remove the 1,080 tonnes of cargo remaining in that particular hold. At the suggestion of the shift supervisor, ballast was pumped into No. 4 hold, which was permissible under the vessel's operations manual. Pumping of ballast into No.4 hold commenced at 5.30 a.m. After the lunch break, two terminal workers descended into No.5 hold, where the unloader was working, to clear iron ore from around the bottom of the forward spiral access ladder. The spiral ladder terminated at the top of the lower stool, six metres above the tank top. They had just completed this task and were about to climb the ladder when the bulkhead to the starboard side of the centre line beNo.5 hold and the ballasted No.4 hold collapsed. Both workers were immediately engulfed by the deluge and, although one was able to haul himself clear, the other remained submerged. The shift supervisor was working in his office ashore. Alerted by calls over the radio from the hatch man, he dashed on board and immediately descended the ladder into No. 5 Up to his neck in the swirling water and guided by the hatch man above, he was able to grab hold of the submerged worker. Assisted by another terminal worker who had followed him into the hold, he was able to haul the unconscious and apparently lifeless worker clear of the water. The shift supervisor then administered resuscitation, which was successful in restoring breathing in the worker. Very shortly afterwards, an ambulance officer arrived on the scene and administered oxygen an before the worker was lifted from the hold and taken to hospital. The point we are making by going into that much detail is that this happened because of the condition of the ship. It was the condition of the ship that caused the bulkhead to collapse. Also, the amount of ballast that was put have in that hold was much greater than it could accommodate. So after the bulkhead collapsed the vessel quickly developed a port list. To counter the list, the mate restarted the ballast pump to discharge water from No. 1 port ballast tank. It was found that, with the collapse of the bulkhead, two holes had been tom in No.3 starboard saddle tank, allowing much of the contents of the tank to flood into the now common 4 and 5 holds-because they had nothing between them. Once the vessel was upright, the mate continued to discharge ballast from both No. 3 port and No. 3 starboard tanks until the water level in No. 3 starboard had fallen below the holes. GIGA II then remained alongside, with cargo operations suspended for a further 24 hours, after which period it was moved to No.1 coal berth. Work was undertaken at No. 1 coal berth during the following days to make the ship safe for a ballast voyage to Singapore. The collapsed section of the bulkhead was cut away and it was landed onshore. And this is the point that the honourable  making when time beat him before he could get to his punch line. The contractors carrying out the work were instructed that the pieces were not to be sold or otherwise disposed of but were to be sent immediately to the furnaces of the BHP steelworks. This ship was chartered by BHP. It was in a disgraceful condition. The hold could not deal with the excess amount of ballast water that was corning in. What did BHP do? They have had a rough day today so I do not want to be too critical of them, but instead of having that bulkhead examined, as it should have been examined, they immediately instructed that those parts had to be put in the furnace of BHP steelworks and made into steel or some such thing. So important was what happened with GIGA II that an inquiry was carried out, complete with very graphic pictures in the report. If anyone wants to see what it is like in some of these holds and some of the rust conditions in there, they are welcome to have a look at this booklet afterwards. These ships were in a dreadful condition. The conclusions from this report identified that different factors contributing to the collapse of the starboard side of the bulkhead at frame 193 aboard GIGA II. The conclusions were: 1. No.4 hold was overfilled beyond its maximum allowable depth of water of 14 m. 2. The Mate relied totally on the remote gauging system for filling No. 4 hold, without physically checking on its accuracy. 3. An inaccurate reading was displayed in the ballast control room by the remote gauging system. 4. As the ""high level"" alarm was not independent of the gauging system, there were no effective defences, other than physical/visual checks, to ensure that the depth of water in No.4 hold did not exceed the safe level. 5. There was no clear explanation as to the critical nature of the limit placed on the depth of ballast water in No.4 hold. This was compounded by a lack of clear operating instructions, either in the native language of the ship's personnel or the working language of the ship. That is another illustration of what is happening on ships today which are multi-crewed and where there is a real language barrier between the bridge and crew and crew and shore. The conclusions of the report continued: 6. The increase in depth of water from 14 m to 18 m resulted in more than doubling the maximum stresses within the bulkhead structure. 7. The specified size of the welds joining the lower stool shelf plate to the structure beneath it was insufficient to withstand the membrane forces developed at the bottom of the bulkhead with the excess water level in the hold. Basically, there was too much water and the ship could not deal with the stresses. The conclusions continued: 8. The design and spacing of the webs within the lower stool, in relation to the corrugations of the bulkhead (and depending on the contribution made by the shedder plates), can result in high stress concentrations being formed within the area of failure at the stool shelfplate. 9. Buckling of the bulkhead, due to extensive wastage by corrosion, if not already started at the moment of failure of the welds, was imminent. 10. Extensive corrosion of the webs in the upper stool resulted in the bulkhead and the stool bottom plate being virtually detached from the upper stool. This would have facilitated detachment of the bulkhead along its upper edge during the failure but did not contribute to initiation of the collapse. 11. The quality of structural surveys of this vessel over a penod of time was not effective in addressing the problem of substantial corrosion as defined and detailed in the International Association of Classification Societies requirements for enhanced surveys or as recommended in the International Maritime Organisation's Assembly Resolution A.744(18). Some of that is a bit technical, but I have gone on at some length and in some detail about the incident of the GIGA II to show that there is more involved in ballast than taking on and discharging water: the buoyancy of ships, their condition and the condition of their structure and equipment are all involved in this issue. We all very much accept that Australian seas should remain clean; that they should remain in the pristine state that they are in at present. I have made speeches in this chamber many times about the threat to our natural resources such as the Great Barrier Reef from the rust buckets that go up and down the coast. I have often said that it is by good luck rather than by good management that we have not had an environmental disaster at our premier tourist resort. One of the previous speakers made the point-I entirely agree with that speaker-that it is very easy to imagine a greatly damaging oil spill. Much more insidious are some of the things that can be carried in ballast water and released into Australian waters. Such things could wipe out some of our natural resources-be they the oysters of Twofold Bay, the fish floating on top of the water in Port Kembla harbour, starfish or various things like that. These imported organisms do great damage to the natural resources of Australia and have a huge economic cost, especially because of our growing dependence on aquaculture. They can have a huge impact on the livelihood of so many Australians and, indeed, on our balance of payments. This is important legislation. It is important that we be aware of this problem. It is not as simple as it first appears. I commend the government for their initiative, always remembering that it was started by this side. Maybe they brought it to fruition-or surfaced it, seeing that we are using nautical terms. Nevertheless, it is important legislation. The opposition has no opposition to this legislation; indeed, we welcome it and we commend it to the House.",98
188,Mr JENKINS,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 seek to raise $2 million by a levy on all vessels entering Australian waters. It is intended that these funds will provide ongoing research into the prevention, control and management of the unwanted translocation of marine species by means of ballast water or fouling of ships' hulls. To get this problem into context, it is estimated that worldwide some 10 billion tonnes of ballast water are translocated annually. As has been suggested by a number of speakers in this debate, one must look at the reasons for the carriage of ballast water. I am indebted to Russell Reichelt and John Chapman for their article which appeared in the Maritime Studies in January-February 1996 for some of this more technical information. In the article the two writers outline that the reasons for the carriage of ballast water are to ensure that a ship embarking on a voyage carries sufficient extra distributed weight over and above its light-ship mass, that is, its empty mass: to maintain stability and limit hull stresses; to immerse the hull and propeller sufficiently to maintain propulsion efficiency; and to trim the ship to provide effective steering. So there are very real marine engineering reasons for the need to include ballast within the ship: to ensure that it operates effectively, efficiently and, of course, to take up the points made by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), safely. In olden days, ballast in wooden ships was usually any cheap or convenient high density material. It might have been stone or pig-iron or something like that. When iron and steel ships were constructed it was found effective to use spaces within the ship and have them filled with sea water to achieve the same ballast effect. The problem of translocation of marine species by the discharge of ballast water is something that has been written about since the early 1900s. The article by Reichelt and Chapman indicates that in 1908 Ostenfeld, the Danish scientist, suggested that organisms could survive during the translocation of ballast water in sediment carried in the ballast and other tanks in ships. This is a phenomenon which, it has been suggested, has been around for quite some time. It really is regrettable that it took so long for the world community to realise the extent of the problem. Of course, the major incident that brought it to everybody's notice was the infestation of the Great Lakes of northern America by the zebra mussel back in the eighties. If we look at this problem in the Australian context, it goes without saying that Australia is an island continent and a major user of international and domestic shipping and seaborne trade. Australia is also, therefore, a major importer of ballast water. In 1991, some 121 million tonnes of ballast water were discharged into Australian ports from vessels arriving from something like 300 international ports. Another 34 million tonnes were transferred between Australian ports. A ship's ballast has the potential to introduce marine species into Australian coastal waters. The literature, with some certainty, estimates that at least 19 unwanted aquatic species have been transferred to Australian waters via ships ballast. Some of these introduced species are having significant effects on native marine species and the marine environment and may, in future, impact on the seafood industry as well as on human health. Specifically, at least 12 marine species have invaded Victoria's Port Phillip Bay. All could have huge ramifications for the fishing industry. At present, there is an infestation of giant sea worms, the Northern Pacific sea star and various types of Japanese kelp spreading throughout the bay. The Northern Pacific sea star is a voracious eater of marine life and is responsible for devastating the fishing industry in Tasmania by depriving fish of food and nutrients. It poses a serious threat to Port Phillip Bay's $10 million shellfish industry. The giant sea worm, which originates from Europe, has infested Corio Bay and invaded the same places as scallops and mussels inhabit, posing a major thereat to the $15 million scallop industry and recreational snapper fishing. Moreover, it is suggested that ballast water introduced a toxic dinoflagellate which came to the attention of Melburnians in January 1988 when it bloomed in Hobsons Bay. Dinoflagellates are microscopic, single celled plants better known as phyto-planktonmeaning plant plankton. They propel themselves using their two flagella, which are whip-like structures, and they can swim like simple animals. The problem with the types of dinoflagellates that have infested Australian waters is that they are very toxic and, potentially, can cause dangerous paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans if the human were to eat fish or shellfish that had consumed the algae. This has been the cause of some concern in Tasmania. According to the literature, a ship arriving in the port of Eden was estimated to have over 300 million cysts, that is, dormant seeds of this toxic dinoflagellate. It was thought that this organism had been taken on board during a red algal bloom in the home port of the ship in Japan. Also, one of the problems is that the dormant seeds, the cysts, will rest and accumulate in the ballast tank sediment. So we are concerned not only with organisms that will be contained within the water of the ballast but also with the sediment that will drop out of the ballast. We have to be concerned that any infestation of a toxic dinoflagellate could be fatal. It is hoped that, through the stringent safety checks of the Victorian shellfish industry, we have ensured safety for consumers, but we cannot be complacent that the situation could not worsen. Once established in an area, marine pests, regrettably, are virtually impossible to eradicate. Prime examples of this are the Northern Pacific sea star and the giant sea worm. The sea star produces 19 million reproductive spores a year and the giant sea worm has the capacity to regenerate parts of its body. Trying to control the spread of such pests along the Australian coastline would be extremely difficult as the currents spread the spores of the marine plants and animals. It may be possible that long-term control could be achieved through using biological control by predators or specifically directed pathogens, although one of the things that needs to be done first is to stop any further translocation of non-indigenous species via the ballast of ships. This may be possible via the work of the levy that will be created by this bill. As has been indicated in the debate, the previous Labor government, through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, attempted such a feat. AQIS introduced guidelines whereby it has the power to prevent ships from entering Australian ports and discharging ballast water until samples of the water are taken, analysed and found to be free of hannful organisms. One of the real problems at present is that the form of testing that AQIS is undertaking is only on the basis of sampling various visiting ships-it is not total. One would have to ask whether any of the stringent budgetary considerations that have been forced upon AQIS will have an effect on the service's ability to properly carry out these inspections and testings at a level which is adequate. The guidelines that were set up encourage a range of practices. The major one is the exchanging of ballast water mid-ocean. It considered, if the ballast water was to flushed out mid-ocean, that it would therefore flush out any of the undesirable inhabitants. The guidelines also include the non-discharge of water in Australian ports and the recording of procedures of the ship's Deputy Speaker Hollis, I know that you are very interested in this topic: the article that mentioned before from Maritime Studies goes into the engineering aspects of this form of ballast exchange on the open ocean. Some of the problems-the honourable member for Throsby quite effectively discussed these matters in his contribution-that require consideration if that ballast exchange takes place on the open sea are the vessel's ability to undergo that exchange, the strength of its hull and the effect of the emptying the tanks. If the ballast exchange takes place in the middle third or half of the ship, it been considered that this increases the stress upon the hull quite considerably. Some ship owners are reluctant, because of this fear the safety of the ship, to undergo this ballast exchange on the open sea. Studies indicate that, in most cases, the structural design of vessels is sufficiently strong to allow such practices. But of course in other literature there are examples and instances that suggest that the design of these ships is not of a sufficient standard to allow this practice need to be taken seriously. Having said that, and given that in the marine industry safety considerations should be paramount-regrettably, they are not always paramount-these matters can be overcome. In the AQIS reports that I referred to earlier, there was concern that only about 80 per cent of bulk carriers exchange their ballast water at sea. In some of the ports in Australia, such as Port Hedland, the bulk carriers come into pick up cargo with their ballast full. There is therefore a need for discharge at the time of loading. It is to be hoped that the practice of mid-ocean ballast exchange is further encouraged. It is considered that, through the fund which would be set up to research these matters, it may be possible to further limit the spread of is organisms via the treatment of the ballast be water. But the methods under consideration are either of high cost or potentially have themselves significant environmental considerations. Let us look briefly at some of the favoured methods of treating the ballast water ballasting. Mr before discharge. It has been suggested that the water could I undergo a form of filtration. But one has to understand that some of the organisms involved with these infestations are very small. Some are about 0.1 micron in size. Another treatment that is being considered is heat treatment. It is suggested that through heat generated by engines, either as exhaust from engines or through auxiliary engines and boilers, the ballast water could be sufficiently heated. Again, this could pose a problem of because a lot of those things are used to ensure that the vessels are already energy has efficient. There is some suggestion that chemicals or methods such as ultraviolet' treatment and others like it could be used. for Again, they would require specialised equipment. Environmental considerations might rule them out as options because of the resultant changes to the water. Another alternative to open ocean exchange is the taking of the ballast water to a shore facility for treatment. This would require specialised equipment and specialised berthing facilities. It would also involve considerable cost. Unless we are able to find solutions that are satisfactory, it may be that the cost angle always will have to be revisited. While Australia set in place a comprehensive ballast water management program, this program only minimised the risk; it did not eradicate the problem. It should be noted that ballast water is not the only way that nonindigenous marine species can be transported. Other methods include attachment to ships' hulls and anchors and through imported fresh seafood, imported sea water and imported fish products. The world's oceans cover 71 per cent of the planet. The international nature of the shipping industry poses particular problems for the environmental management of these oceans. Australia is responsible for the management of 11 million square kilometres of marine flora and fauna and yet only around 80 to 90 per cent of the coastline has been surveyed for either indigenous or introduced species. This lack of information about our own marine environment places extra pressures on researchers attempting to achieve better marine water management strategies. Potential economic damage may result if Australia does not take action to further research ways to stop marine pests invading our waters. Briefly, it concerns me that this levy will be managed through the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council. This is a nonstatutory body. What I would seek from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) at some stage, if not in the summing up, are his ideas on how this council will be reporting back their progress and the management of the levy fund. While in the relevant annual reports AQIS rates a mention, there has been no mention of the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council or any reporting back by way of annual reports to the parliament of the Australian ballast water management strategy. We hope that that might be looked at so that it can be rectified. It is also of interest that in two reports, entitled Marine and coastal pollution by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee, ballast water rates a mention. Last month, tabled in the Victorian parliament was a report of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee entitled Ballast water and hull fouling in Victoria. They are two important reports. They highlight the fact that translocation can occur between Australian ports. This is therefore a problem for jurisdictions. The Victorian parliamentary committee report suggests that we need to decide whether this is going to be achieved through a national strategy or through the states. I would suggest that a national strategy is required not only because of our international obligations but also because the same solutions to be found between the domestic port translocations will be the same solutions that need to be found for the international translocations. We really need the minister to go to the relevant ministerial council and put this issue on the agenda. (Time expired)",102
189,Mr ADAMS,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"The purpose of the these bills, the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997, is to establish a levy to provide funds for the strategic ballast water and research development program. This will provide a framework for planning and implementing research and development projects to strengthen management of ballast water and shipping by risk minimisation. The bills will enable the collection of a levy of $210 for bulk carriers and $140 for all other ships, including tankers, with a length of 50 metres or longer. It is to be levied over a two-year time frame. It has been agreed that $2 million will be collected over that time. Once the $2 million has been raised, the levy will cease by proclamation. The opposition has no real problem with these bills as they cover some of the ground being considered during the last government's term of office. It was basically where the work started. The bills have come about as a result of one some work being done by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which have been instrumental in setting up the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council. At the advisory board meeting, the introduction of a levy on shipping to fund the strategic ballast water research program was recommended. Ballast water has been a problem for many years, and its control is seen as very much a quarantine issue-not so much the water, but the animals and the vegetation that are sucked up with the water and then released into a new environment. Sometimes that environment is hostile and they just die but a lot of the time they are released in a relatively watery paradise, with no natural predators or dangers. Many of these species get into the ballast water because they are colonisers-species that make themselves available by being easily transported naturally by ocean currents or by being mechanically moved. It means that they can survive in more difficult conditions than other species. If they can be moved right away from their natural competition, they will thrive in a new environment without predators. So ships that take on ballast water inadvertently play into the tentacles of some of these most notorious pests. When the ships release the water again after they pick up the freight, the process of colonisation gets under way. One of the pests that we believe was originally introduced in Tasmania through the discharge of ballast water is the starfish. My colleague the melhber for Denison (Mr Kerr), who is the shadow minister at the table, knows about this because it is a big problem in the Derwent River which is in his own electorate. In May this year I spoke of the problem of starfish in the port of Hobart, now in plague proportions. I said that it was becoming a sport to see how many starfish can be picked up off the harbour bottom in a single dive. Starfish have a serious impact on local marine flora and fauna. Their populations can expand at enormous speed and they consume all in their path. I understand that, once run out of food, they will continue to eat each other. They have no natural enemies except for what humans can do to get rid of them, and that is usually to collect them by hand. In Hobart, starfish now have to be cleared every few months to try to control the numbers. These animals were introduced through the release of ballast water. Another effect on local marine flora and fauna can be the development of algae blooms. 'Water that collects a high level of nutrients after sloshing around in the bilges and ballast tanks and being released in water temperatures conducive to blooms will suddenly produce an unexplained algae bloom. Such events can have dire consequences on local industries, such as oyster growers, because some of these blooms can be toxic either to the animals being farmed or to humans through the food chain. That has occurred on several occasions south of the Derwent River in Tasmania. The economic costs of that are just horrific to the farmers and to the regular people that they supply. This problem has enormous consequences and needs serious consideration, as I think these bills will give them. As I found out on the Internet tonight from a bulletin put out regularly by AQIS: ... it has been established that ballast water and sediment in vessels entering Australian waters has been contaminated with a range of organisms, including toxic dino-flagellate species known to cause paralytic shellfish poison in humanspretty horrific stuffThe introduction of diseases may also arise as a result of port water being inoculated with large quantities of ballast water containing viruses or bacteria, thereby posing health threats to indigenous human, animal and plant life. So it is a horrific thing that takes place. It changes the whole system of life where this stuff comes out. It can be a very dangerous situation. At times, I do not think we always know exactly what damage may have come from ballast water. In fact, AQIS has an excellent bulletin on the whole issue on the Net, which I am very pleased to see. AQIS has guidelines for ballast water management and even advice to ships' captains on how to they release water safely. Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, that may be a different sort of ship from the one you were talking about when you spoke on these bills. Tasmanians know only too well that, once something is let loose into the water, it is almost impossible to control. We have had this argument over quarantine in the salmon industry. We had concerns about the importation of other products getting mixed up in our waterways and contaminating that industry. We have had other problems in the oyster industry with blooms and things like that. There must be some mechanism by which ballast water release can be controlled. We also need to know more about how we can deal with the pests we inadvertently get. Funds for research and development, as is being sought by the levy, will be put into the Strategic Ballast Water Research and Development Fund, which will resource the strategic ballast water research. As the previous speaker, the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), said, it is very important that we do get some feedback to the House and to members in the future. I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will give us some indication of how that will occur when he sums up the bills. Tasmania has been at the forefront of research into ballast water because we have had the problem dumped at our doorstep. Waters in the Derwent River have been checked regularly for unwanted pests that arrive, and the CSIRO monitors these findings. A port surveys program has been established. Surveys for introduced species have so far been completed in five ports: Devonport in Tasmania, Albany and Bunbury in Western Australia, Port Lincoln in South Australia and Eden in New South Wales. I understand there are five ports in Queensland which are up for inspection in this survey next year. Out of this survey's program have come some studies in Tasmania. A survey in Devonport on the north-west coast, which was carried out in 1995, detected in the port a few species of the fanworm sabella. Luckily, recent surveys have indicated that the fanworm has not established a viable population but that the port is susceptible to this species. I can remember the difficulties we had in the early 1990s in getting the state government involved in this research and also in getting a national program looked at. People were talking about getting funding from the federal government and the state governments. Each of the states was holding off and the federal government was holding off to get something together on this. I can remember doing a radio interview on this in the early 1990s. I am glad the accumulation of that has resulted in these bills. Another study being undertaken on the east coast of Tasmania is on the impact of the green crab on native marine communities. A study of their population biology will be carried out and a program of control will be established. I am sure that many of the answers will be found by using the Tasmanian experience, building on the research that has already been undertaken. We have to be able to ensure that any water that is pumped out of visiting ships does not include unwanted visitors. That is exactly what the recommendations are aiming for under the AQIS ballast water compliance agreements. Once all vessels have complied, AQIS says it proposes to introduce a scheme of incentives for those vessels that have compliance agreements. I do not know any more detail on what the incentives are going to be, but it is an idea which is worth consideration. I wonder whether others know about that and whether the government knows about that. Another avenue that might be considered for research is to find a use for these pests that have been introduced. A number of seaweeds have been appearing lately and, if they reach plague proportions, the only way to gain some control is to harvest them for a specific market or in some way that one can tum them into an economic plus. Then we might have some control. I am not sure what one could do with starfish, but I dare say that if it were found to have, say, aphrodisiac properties, some of our problems might be solved almost overnight. We could tum that into a very profitable commodity. Joking aside, there are many pest plants and animals that used to be seen as weeds or pests that now have some economic value and can be brought under control by management of its distribution. Once something is established, it is far harder to eradicate it than it would have been to control it. So we have to make the effort to ensure that we limit the spread of unwanted species. These bills will go a long way towards supporting that goal. As I said, these bills will also add to the work that was done previously by the previous Labor government. Dealing with some of the work that has been done about ballast water, heating it up or discharging it at sea and the danger of that in some regards and the redesign of ships might be possibilities. There might be some cost in that, but the cost to the environment and to industries reliant seafood can be enormous. We really need to look at this in a very serious manner because of the costs that this can have, and I think already have had, on us economically in this country. I am, therefore, pleased that the government is going ahead with the processes. I look forward to seeing the recommendations of the research which comes out of these levies. I am sure they will be very interesting. I wish the people who are going to be working on that all the best. I am sure there will be a great deal of interest in the outcomes throughout the country.",105
190,Mr KERR,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"My colleague the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) has very perceptively addressed issues that would not only affect him as a strong and vigorous representative of the state of Tasmania in the federal parliament but no doubt be a concern to members on both sides of this House from all states. The issue my colleague raised of the Pacific sea star, which has become a very significant pest in Tasmanian waters, is compounded every time one looks at various ports and marine environments around Australia. Seaweeds, viruses and toxic materials that can affect human health have been discovered and continue to be discovered as a by-product of marine transport. The measure contained in these ballast water bills is but a small step towards a process of addressing the problem. The levy will collect some $2 million over two years. The money from the levy will be used to fund research and development of effective means of treating ballast water and ships hulls to render them incapable of transporting these exotic species from overseas and between ports. That is not in itself a complete answer to the problem. We already have very substantial unseen environmental degradation in our waterways. Even the best of processes, which no doubt will be supported by shippers who are committed to best practice, will do little if we enable Australian waters to be used by pirate operators. There are real fears about changes to maritime regulations that allow the end of cabotage arrangements and the like and the introduction into Australia of domeson tic services for vessels which have been properly labelled ships of shame because of the risk to human passengers-that is, the crews and those who serve on them. We all know the dangers of ships of shame because of the reports that this parliament itself has seen as a product of various parliamentary committees. We know that ships of shame do not just carry humans as their crew; they also carry marine micro-organisms and macro-organisms which, if released into the Australian marine environment, will cause very substantial damage. I do not think we need to do more than reflect on how various releases of non-endemic species have transformed the landmass of Australia. Probably the best example of that is the rabbit, which was brought over originally as a foodstuff by early European settlers. It was released into the wild and rapidly became a pest and a great destroyer of rural land and a tremendous cost to the Australian environment. We have seen this repeated on many instances-the cane toad, for example-where we have imported into the Australian terrestrial environment animals and micro-organisms which, once released into an environment in which they have no natural predators, continue to breed at a rate far beyond what they do in their own environment and ultimately become a very substantial pest, to the great detriment of the Australian community. The situation is no different under the water. Whilst there are fewer deliberate releases which have caused substantial damage to the marine environment, nonetheless there are some. We are very much aware, for example, in inland waterways of the damage that is being caused by european carp. European carp was presumably released deliberately or at least by negligence by those who thought that it would create a fishing stock or some decorative addition to the rivers. Soon we discovered the damage that that fish species does to estuarine banks and to river banks. It clouds the water. It generally became to estuarine and river waters what the rabbit is to the terrestrial environment. As my colleague Dick Adams mentions, we have the examples of the Pacific sea star and various seaweeds. We are not as fascinated with seaweeds as we are with things like sea stars; they do not move around and they do not seem to be a visible sign of environmental degradation. Nonetheless, once some seaweeds have been released, and once they take hold, they are very effective competitors against natural seaweeds and displace them. In the course of doing that they remove natural habitat from existing crustaceans and fish species and ultimately transform the marine environment in a very destructive way. The $2 million that is provided for in this bill will not do much to address the damage which has occurred in the past, and which undoubtedly, although it will be a matter of great regret, will continue to occur in the future by pirate emissions--emissions which are conducted against the legal regime in place. That is not to say that this measure is not an important one. It is an important one because it will sponsor research that will be undertaken for those who operate properly as international shippers and will put in place a framework which, if complied with, will make sure that we have a far better regime to protect our marine environment. The charge is quite modest. The bills will enable the collection of a levy of $210 for bulk carriers and $140 for all ships, including tankers, with a length of 50 metres or more. The levy is charged in accordance with the average amount of ballast water discharged by the type of ship in an attempt to establish equity. The measure has the support of the shipping industry. Obviously, levies of that nature and that size are hardly the kind of financial detriment that would be of significant consequence as against the cost of transport generally, but it does have the support of the shipping industry and it does have the support of both sides of this House. !ndeed, the measure was first developed, I thmk, by the former Labor government and legislation to give effect to it was being prepared when we lost government. I commend the present government for picking up the measure and bringing it forward in this legislation. Perhaps the one criticism that one could make is that it is hardly a rush response to an issue which the Australian community would have a great deal of concern about. Anyone who has an electorate which has any economic relationship to the production of products through fish farming or through other forms of marine exploitation, or indeed simply opportunities for recreation and for human enjoyment of beaches and waterways, would realise that this is an issue which has not actually been approached with any great degree of urgency. The measure could have been brought before the parliament much more quickly. But, that aside, it will be a valuable measure and we are very pleased to support it. One thing, however, we should be clear about is that the problems that now exist as a result of various non-endemic species becoming prevalent in Australian waters, as a result of a discharge of ballast waters, are not going to go away. We are going to have ongoing costs to deal with the problem of the proliferation of such non-endemic species in the same way as we continue to have problems with rabbit control and control of the cane toad. Many of these problems simply seem incapable of solution, despite very real concern being raised. Within the northern Australian community, for example, it seems nothing can be done to stop the inexorable hop forward across state and territory borders of the cane toad. It progresses each year, kilometre by kilometre, expanding its range and creating a very substantial environmental detriment wherever it goes. We do not seem to have mechanisms capable of stopping its onward march. How much more difficult it is to stop the onward march of marine species when we cannot see the animals above the ground, when we are actually confronting the spread of marine species in a habitat which is difficult for us to discern the reach and range of that spread. The $2 million that will be raised goes towards research into how we can stop future releases of more non-endemic species and is valuable for that, but it will go nowhere near addressing the already very significant environmental and economic costs that have been occasioned by the release of flora and fauna from ports all around the world through the release of ballast waters in Australian ports. As with rabbits and cane toads, the marine organisms which are caught up in ballast water, once released, if they are not sterilised or somehow made incapable of reproduction, may survive once they are released into new and different environments. If they find that they have no natural competitors, then frequently they become a rapidly growing population, creating very significant costs economically and environmentally to the native marine life and to the communities which depend on that marine life. This is a measure which we have no difficulty with, but we would want steps to be taken across the entire Australian community to give some priority to some measurement of the degree to which our coastal environment has already been afflicted by the spread of non-native marine flora and to develop abatement mechanisms capable of slowing the spread of some of the more vigorous species which currently are posing a threat to Australians' quality of life around their coasts. We in Tasmania are particularly sensitive to these issues, having developed a substantial aquaculture industry and a reputation Australia-wide and, indeed, internationally as a clean, green environment where people can come and explore some of the most spectacular waterways, both inland and coastal, of anywhere in the world. The reputation we have for inland waters for trout fishing and for other forms of recreational activities is very substantial. That is complemented by the economic value that is added to the state by fish farming along the coast and, I think, also by potentially very large interest which will emerge in the future in the substantial kelp beds and biodiversity off the east coast which offers some of the most spectacular diving that is available in the world. A couple of years ago I was very pleased to see the National Geographic magazine give a substantial front page article and a very long photo essay on the east coast kelp environment, which is said to be some of the most spectacular diving anywhere in the world. Whilst the waters of the east coast are spectacular and clear they are quite cold. So they are not sufficiently exploited at the moment. I would have thought that there are real opportunities for economic exploitation of those environmental and recreational resources simply because we are now building up quite a critical mass of Australians who have learned how to scuba dive. I am not exactly sure of the numbers, but I think there would be something in the order of half a million Australians who have, at least, the basic open water certificate in scuba diving. The next step for those who have really exhausted the potential of scuba diving and done the Great Barrier Reef and some nice warm tropical waters would be to learn the next stage of accreditation, which is drysuit diving. Drysuit diving would open up the very spectacular cold water environments off our southern coasts. As every responsible biologist will tell you, the amount of nutrients in the cold water is such as to support a great diversity of plant and animal life. Some of the sights available to people who are prepared to learn to drysuit dive, or to wear a thick wetsuit and brave the rigours of a Tasmanian east coast dive that way, are really very spectacular and very special. Those environments and the marine parks that have been established are important, but, regrettably, things like the Pacific sea star and various seaweeds which are now in Tasmanian coastal waters as a result of these kinds of ballast discharges. do not actually observe the lines on the map for the marine parks. Fortunately, thus far, the marine parks have largely been protected from those discharges simply because of the distance between them and the major ports where ballast water discharges have occurred. There is a growing spread of some of the non-endemic seaweeds and sea creatures such as the Pacific sea star. We should realise that we cannot take for granted that their natural state will be preserved forever without putting in place proper management regimes and indeed doing the difficult and mundane things that my colleague the member for Lyons mentioned-that is, basically trying to collect as many of these animals as possible and removing them from the environment. That is a costly, labour intensive process but one which, if not undertaken, is likely to lead to long-term environmental damage. The opposition will support this legislation. As indicated, it is legislation that had its genesis when Labor was in government. We would say that it has had an unfortunately slow labour. Its birth has been somewhat delayed beyond the normal length of time for the gestation of legislation, but nonetheless is worthy legislation and I am pleased to be present at the christening.",108
191,Mr TRUSS,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Mfairs) (9.44 p.m.}In summing up this debate on the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997, I thank those members who have contributed to the discussion this evening and this afternoon. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, mentioned in your contribution to the debate, on occasions members have strayed a little from the basic purpose of the bills. I think it has been interesting debate. I take up the comments expressed earlier by the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) that this debate has been very informative and that many people will have learnt a great deal about the importance of our marine environment from the contributions of honourable members on both sides. A number of members have, over the years, taken particular interest in this matter, not least amongst them you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Their expert knowledge has contributed greatly to the debate. I note also the interestboth ing information provided by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) which would be almost a textbook on some aspects of marine life. He had obviously researched in great detail matters of considerable interest. So my thanks go to members of the opposition and of the government for their contributions to these bills, and I acknowledge also the support that is coming from the opposition benches for this legislation. The debate has reflected the importance of research and development to the minimisation of the risks to Australia's coastal waters from the introduction of marine pests and disease pathogens via ships' ballast water. It has also recognised the significant contribution being made by the shipping industry to fund research and development aimed at more effective ballast water management arrangements. It is an indication of their support for resolving the risks posed by ships' ballast water to Australia's coastal environment. This support is to be commended and is testimony to the it important partnership between industry and the government. It complements the government's commitment to Australia's coastal environment through it- ocean policy and coasts and clean seas initiative. As we heard from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in his second reading speech, the legislation allows the collection of $2 million over two years for the strategic ballast water research and development program developed by the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council and administered by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The research and development program has several exciting a very projects, planned, the key one being the development of a risk assessment based decision support system which will provide a management tool for authorities to more effectively manage the risk of individual ships and their ballast water requirements. This will be particularly important when we have mandatory regulations in place through the International Maritime Organisation. It will also be a world first in ballast water management capabilities. Ballast water management is recognised domestically and internationally as an important global issue, and Australia was one of the first countries to recognise the impacts of uncontrolled ballast water discharge. In 1990, we were the first country to introduce national ballast water management guidelines for international vessels visiting an Australian first port of call. This government has endorsed a national ballast water management strategy and, in 1996, appointed an Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council to advise and assist it in implementing the strategy. The research and development program is a key element of this strategy. In addition, we are at the forefront of developments in the International Maritime Organisation. We have also been prominent in the IMO in securing a target date of .the year 2000 for the introduction of a mandatory international regulatory framework through new ballast water annex to Marpol, the . International Convention for the Prevention Pollution from Ships.

192,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (9.51 p.m.)a The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 is potentially one of the most of important pieces of legislation coming before it this parliament in this session because, from government's perspective, it is seeking to demonstrate to the small business community Australia its credentials in sticking up for small businesses, small businessmen and women who supported them so overwhelmingly in the election of 1996. Regrettably, however, the rhetoric which has often accompanied the comments made by the variety of individuals in the Liberal Party who have occupied the position of minister for small business since the election last year is, unfortunately, not matched by the actions, the be moved deeds and what has been advanced. I foreshadow that it is the intention of the opposition to move substantial amendments to the government's bill which is before this place tonight. Those amendments, which will be examined in some detail during the consideration in detail stage, will go to issues of great concern to small businesses in this country, small businesses who believe, having examined the government's response to the fair trading inquiry report, by my good friend who has just walked into this chamber, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), that they have been short-changed. We will be seeking at the appropriate time-and I will say a bit more about this in a moment-to amend the government's bill in respect of unconscionable conduct. We would to see the term which the honourable member for Bendigo and his committee sought to have included in legislation-that is, 'unfair'-applied here. We intend also to amend the government's limit of $1 million in terms of transactions for utilising unconscionable or unfair provisions. We also intend to do what the Reid committee sought in its recommendations to the parliament-that is, to introduce a uniform retail tenancy code. We also intend to amend this legislation to ensure that, upon lease renewal or extension, the uniform retail tenancy code require an independent market review jointly financed by both the leaser and lessee. Again, this is in line with the recommendations of the Reid committee report, and I will return to that shortly. I also indicate that it is my intention to move an amendment to the second reading, and I therefore move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that the Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled 'Finding a balance: Towards fair trading in Australia' does not reflect the intent or recommendations of the Committee; (2) recommends the Bill be amended to incorporate the recommendations of the Committee; (3) considers the Government's response is inadequate and its rhetoric does not match either its election commitments or the committee's findings; and (4) calls on the Government members of the Committee, namely the honourable Members for Bendigo, MCEwen, Paterson, Cowan, Mallee, Petrie, Canning, Aston and Lowe to support the Opposition's amendments which reflect the recommendations in the Committee's report"". Last Friday at the National Press Club, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) released the 'Draft platform of the Australian Labor Party'. That document is to form the basis of a platform to be considered by the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party in Hobart in January 1998. Included within the Leader of the Opposition's speech were two paragraphs which I think amply demonstrate in a very succinct fashion the commitment that Labor has to small business. I quote from the Leader of the Opposition's speech at the launch of that platform: A key part of Labor's agenda for industry must also be to harness the energy, drive and flexibility of small business to provide opportunities for as many Australians as possible. Labor recognises the enormous job creating potential of Australian small business. We believe in strategic intervention for small business, to guarantee a fair and competitive economic environment, and address the obstacles the small business community faces including their market power disadvantage, compliance costs and access to finance and justice. That, as I said, succinctly demonstrates the commitment which Labor has brought to the draft platform-not to our policies, as the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) would have us believe, but to our platform. As I have indicated, it does talk in terms that members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology would well understand, those members having been intimately involved in the inquiry into fair trading. I would also point out that in the document itself in the section relevant to small business-'Small business: Creating jobs and wealth'-there is a section dealing with fair trading which states: Market economies sometimes produce market failures. Ample evidence in Australia suggests that the small business sector has unduly suffered in some unfair trading environments. This is particularly the case in the areas of franchising, retail tenancies and misuse of market power. Small business must be appropriately protected from unfair business conduct. Labor will utilise mechanisms available to it, including legislation, to ensure that a fair trading environment exists in Australia. I read both the extract from the Leader of the Opposition's speech to the National Press Club and the extract from the 'Draft platform of the Australian Labor Party' because I think both ofthose passages demonstrate clearly the concerns felt by members on this side of the House-and I know by many members on the other side of the House-in respect of the fair trading environment, which presently is not as fair as it should be for small business. The view I have formed on this has not simply come from the last six or seven months I have been the shadow minister for small business. It has come not only from an association with small business over a very long time-from having a family tie in small business, with most of my family members being involved in it in one way or anotherbut also from an appreciation over nearly 13 years of being in this national parliament that the concern of the rights and the roles of small business should never be understated. I think there is a willingness within this place from both sides to get rid of the unfairness that perhaps has existed for far too long in an environment that does harbour small business and to try to address that imbalance.",112
193,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It didn't happen 18 months ago, though.",114
194,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"My colleague on the other side, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, said that 18 months ago it did not happen. He is dead right. That is quite true. It did not happen. Minister Beddall, in the former Labor government, did have as an inquiry reference an examination made of the same issue. He put recommendations forward and, as I am sure he will say in this place when he comments on this legislation, he was unhappy that the government of the day did not take them up. I regret that as well and I have said that in many places. Chris Schacht did bring legislation into this place in 1995, but it was not proceeded with because the parliament was prorogued. Kim Beazley on two occasions brought private member's bills in here which reflected exactly that legislation, yet the new government-of which the parliamentary secretary clearly is a member-did not choose to take up that legislation, although they went to an election saying they were going to protect small business. The Labor Party had already produced the documentation which could have overcome a lot of the difficulties that had existed for some time and which had been identified, but the new government chose not to proceed with that because it stood in the name of the Leader of the Opposition. Their response, through the then minister for small business, was to ask a parliamentary committee to conduct an inquiry into fair trading. I have to say, as I said when the minister brought down his response in this place to that report, to the chairman of the committee, the member for Bendigo, that I think he did a sterling job. I think he and his committee members showed compassion and interest. They actually showed that they were prepared to bring down some recommendations in this parliament to delve into those great concerns that the small business community in this country had for their future. The Reid committee's report, entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, is one of the better parliamentary committee reports that has been generated for quite some time. I do not think anybody could help but be moved by the stories which are contained in it. Whether it be in the area of retail tenancy, franchising, abuse of market power or whatever, the stories that are in this document are heart wrenching. Therefore, it is no wonder the honourable member for Bendigo and his colleagues on both sides of this parliament came to the unanimous view that changes were necessary. They brought down recommendations in that committee report that ran the gamut of those matters of concern to small business. If you tum to the document itself, you can see that the recommendations talk about establishing a body of precedence under which new provisions of amendments to the Trade Practices Act can be measured. It contains recommendations in respect of retail tenancy matters. There is a range of these that touch on things like underpinning a uniform retail tenancy code by changes to the Trade Practices Act. It talks about dispute resolution, security of tenure and the uniform retail tenancy code having disclosure statements in there. It talks about the disclosure of rents paid. It makes recommendations about rents and rent reviews. It makes recommendations about outgoings and promotions. It makes recommendations about leases and disclosure statements, tenancy mix, redevelopment and relocation and economic and social impact statements. And that is just in the area of retail tenancy matters. They are the substantial elements of this committee report that deal with retail tenancy matters. But did the government respond? Did the government listen to retail tenancy issues? Did they listen to the honourable member for Bendigo? Regrettably, they did not. The government's response on retail tenancies has been to say that some template piece of code will be developed in consultation with the states, but that the states have to sibility, not the Commonwealth, for picking up retail tenancy issues. That is the fact of the matter. No-one from the government side in this place can deny that the government has squibbed it in respect of retail tenancy issues. I am delighted the member for Bendigo is going to participate in this debate because he knows himself that those retail tenancy issues were at the core of the concern of many of the people that he has spoken to and that I have spoken to as I have travelled around Australia to retail rallies with 1,000 small business people in attendance. I have taken the Leader of the Opposition to those rallies. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman), who is at the table, was at one of those rallies in Newcastle, and I have to tell you that he wanted to get out of there very quickly when he saw just how aggro and aggrieved those people in small business were, because they were unhappy with what they perceived as this government's response to the plight of small businesses. It disturbs me greatly to think that, when the opposition tries to give additional assistance and guidance to the government on these issues by seeking to bring amendments into this place which reflect faithfully the recommendations of this all-party committee, we find the minister, either himself or through a spokesman, goes to the media and says that these proposals which I am putting forward are nothing more than a political stunt. The amendments that I am going to move when we get to the consideration in detail stage will, as I have said, touch on unfair conduct, have a better definition of 'small business' so that we can pick up all small businesses that need access to the amendments to the Trade Practices Act, introduce a uniform retail tenancy code and introduce an independent market rent review at the time of lease renewal or extension-faithfully picking up the recommendations advanced by the honourable member for Bendigo and his cohorts on that committee. And the minister turns around and says that I am engaging in nothing more than a political stunt! An article in the Financial have respon- Review of 24 November said: Mr Reith's spokesman said the proposals would create a ""plethora of red tape"" and was an opportunistic move to unravel the Government's fair trading package. Let me say now to the member for Bendigo, whose work and that of his committee I respect in their coming up with the recommendations that they did, that all this is not in any of those charges that the minister has levelled at me or the opposition. This is an attempt to assist the government to faithfully bring forward the recommendations of this all-party parliamentary committee, which were universally accepted. All we are trying to do, as ever, is help. The minister has run around in the past and said, 'You can't really do this on retail tenancy matters'. The minister has said, 'It's not possible because it offends against the Australian constitution.' I a m sorry to disappoint him on this. I know the member for Bendigo is absolutely delighted that I am taking this view. As he knows, an opinion in a submission given by Mr Dennis Rose QC, on behalf of Blake Dawson Waldron, lawyers to one of the major lobbying and constituent groups in small business-the Motor Trades Association of Australia Ltd-to the committee and subsequently to the government categorically states that, constitutionally, it is possible to bring down a uniform retail tenancy law which can be underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, which will give effect to this implementation of a uniform retail tenancy code. The opposition will seek to do that. I go to some of those issues now. As I have said, we have to clear up once and for all the fact that this is perceived by the minister as a political stunt, that we are not being fairdinkum to try to help the small business environment, that we do not want to work with government to try to improve on their legislation-because we do. I said at the time the minister brought down the response to the fair trading report, which was this nice little splashy handout called New deal: Fair dealGiving small business a fair go, that the minister had achieved far more than I had anticipated he could in getting it through the cabinet. I said that at the time and I stand by it again. I said that the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was out of the country at time might also have something to do with it; nevertheless, the minister for small business was very successful in getting some of the issues raised by the member for Bendigo his committee through the cabinet. However, I also said at the time that devil is often in the detail in legislation which this government brings in, and that is exactly what we have discovered. Rather than put in place changes to the Trade Practices which reflect unfair conduct in a business environment-as the Reid committee recomclearly mended-the government chose in this bill to use the more difficult test of unconscionable conduct.",114
195,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,More predictable.,116
196,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"No, more difficult. I am seeking interested that the Parliamentary Secretary the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is saying 'more For the life of me, I cannot understand why he says it is more predictable, because there is no case law. One of the things that this government suddenly decided it needed to do was to put some money forward so that law could be developed in many of these cases of unconscionable conduct. The simple fact is, Parliamentary Secretary, that minister said that the government will put in $400,000 so that case law could be advanced. There is none now. So how can you stand here and tell me there is more predictability? There is not. We believe-as the Reid committee beSo lieved, because they recommended it-that the simpler test of unfairness is should be in the legislation. So our amendments are going to reflect that unfairness test. They are not going to be the harder ones of unconscionable conduct because, quite honestWe ly, how many cases have we seen today where a small business person-let us say, a major shopping centre-has a beef with the landlord in that shopping centre and it has gone through to settlement in the court? None. Why? Because, firstly, the market power so inverse that normally the small business is driven out of business before they get to the courts for a final settlement. Secondly, the the large business is quite prepared to spend squill ions so that it does not get that far. Or, thirdly, the large business settles on the steps of the court long before it happens. Parliaand mentary Secretary, you would know from your legal background in parliamentary the committees-not that you are a lawyer-that the simple fact is that $400,000 ain't gonna buy you a lot of case law. With the lawyers that are in this country these days it will not Act buy you a lot of case law. Our view that we have expressed quite is that this 'unfair' term needs to be put in place in line with recommendation 6 of the Reid committee report on fair trading, widening the catchment of small business to enable them to utilise the legal mechanism of redress because, at the end of the day, to one of the real problems for any small business is using alternative legal mechanisms to predictable'. seek that redress. What was the government's response to that. New deal: Fair deal simply said that they support the idea of alternative dispute mechanisms-but said nothing else. It is like case the access to the Banking Ombudsman scheme. What was the response by Minister Reith? He said, 'We support widening the your Banking Ombudsman scheme so that small business could have access to it,' but nothing else. There has been no talking to the private banks that run the scheme to ask them to let small business into it. Nothing has happened since this report came down to try to do that. we believe that that lack of access to justice is something that needs redressing and the one that we think that can happen. We are also seeking at the appropriate time to amend the government's limit of $1 million transactions for utilising the unfair provisions. would replace that with the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of a small in business. Why? We have been in discussion with some of the major corporations in this country that have small businesses· as part of their tenancy arrangements. We have been talking to Lend Lease and to Westfield. They is think that the $1 million proposition as it exists at present in the legislation the government is putting forward is not the appropriate way to go, because that excludes quite a number of very small businesses from having access. We want to change the legislation so that the people that can get access are those that are small businesses as defined by the ABS. And Lend Lease and Westfield do not think that that is such a bad idea. In fact, other people think it is a great idea too. I had a fax today from Mulhern Waste Oil Removal Pty Ltd on this very issue. In that fax they say: The Fair Trading Bill makes reference to small business protection for contracts of less than $1,000,000 and as none of our contracts are anywhere near this amount, we will have no protection from the large multi-national companies, as their contracts are far in excess of $1,000,000. I question the legitimacy of placing any monetary limit on the protection of small business in relation to this Bill, as this serves no purpose but to protect, unfairly, the large multi-national companies maintain their monopoly in the market place. That is exactly the problem that we are identifying. We believe amending the legislaor tion to use the ABS definition of small business will more fairly represent what people the small business sector want-not someand so on. thing that this government believes is going to be important. The next thing that we are seeking to do, I have said, is to introduce a uniform retail tenancy code. As usual, it is Labor that is leading from the front in respect of this. It here in the amendments that we are going put forward. The member for Bendigo knows this in his heart of hearts. Your Minister Workplace Relations and Small Business refuses to put any piece of legislation in of this place in respect of retail tenancy familiar? matters. You cannot deny that. It is not here. We will. We are going to make it easy for you, because we are going to introduce the docutenants, ment itself by way of amendment. We are going to introduce for you the uniform retail tenancy code, utilising the Commonwealth's corporations power under section 51(xx) the Australian constitution. To avoid duplicaprotect. tion, we will move that the code be integrated with existing and developing state and terridispute tory legislation and create a federal safety for small businesses. That is what small businesses want, as the member for Bendigo knows. They want uniformity across the states and territories. They do not want a mishmash. They do not want this nonsense that Louise Asher in Victoria is on about. They do not want something that is different in New South Wales. They do not want something that is different up in Queensland. They want uniform retail tenancy legislation. We will be advancing that in our amendment. We are also, as I indicated a little earlier, going to move amendments about lease renewal or extension in line with recommendation 2.5 of the Reid committee report. The member for Bendigo knows quite well that one of the major issues outstanding with many small businesses is lease renewal. When lease renewal time comes around there is a lot of difficulty for many small businesses. They do not have access to a lot of the disclosures about what is going to be in shopping centres in retail complexes, they are not told about .some of the changes that major developers in perhaps have in mind for shopping centres We will be moving as an amendment that the uniform retail tenancy code require an as independent market rent review jointly financed by both the lessor and the lessee. The code would include a pre-contract disclosure is statement in line, as I have said, with recomto mendation 2.5 in the honourable member for Bendigo's report. Disclosures would include for disturbance to trading, retail tenancy mix, consultation with merchant associations and front statement of outgoings. Does that sound Of course it does. It is a lift straight from the report of the honourable member for Bendigo. The code would be prospective and only apply to small businesses, not to anchor so the likes of Woolworths, Coles Myers and those sorts of businesses would not be affected. Those affected would be the small businesses that your legislation, Parliaof mentary Secretary, supposedly is trying to The code would provide for a step-by-step resolution mechanism and would also net cover service stations. There is a real issue associated with service stations and the petroleum industry. Service stations are subject to some fairly outrageous decisions and business conduct by multinationals in this country. I know the member for Bendigo heard evidence from people from Shell and from other small service station proprietors about what was going on in respect of that situation, the closures that are taking place and so on. We believe that there is an opportunity to protect some of those people. This is not, as I think we all agree in this place, about trying to prop up those people who really should not be in small business in the first place. It is not about that at all. It is strategic intervention to try to assist, in an small business environment, by taking what the Reid committee report recommended to this parliament, making the necessary changes to what the government wants to bring forward and putting it in legislation. We can then say to that small business community, as a unified parliament, 'We agree that, as a result of what is happening in small business today, there is a need for protection to equalise this imbalance in market power that presently exists out there in the community. We are of one mind in this place: we want to see a uniform retail tenancy code in place.' The changes to the Trade Practices Act will give access on the basis of unfair conduct, not on the basis of some ill-definable concept of unconscionable conduct. I believe that if we can get some certainty in that approach, if we can get all sides of this parliament marching forward to the same tune in respect of these amendments that I am proposing-which will fit in with the other elements of the government's own legislation that we are debating tonight-we will have something that is useful; we will have actually made progress for the small business community in this country for once in our lives. I think that that should be a goal that we look forward to. If the opposition had come into this place saying, 'Look, we'll make all this up because it really is going to embarrass the government in some way,' then I would say that the government would have every right to bag it out. But what we are proposing in this series of amendments faithfully reflects what the Reid committee found on behalf of small business. The committee handed down a report which everybody has praised. People have said it is a hallmark, a landmark, piece of committee work. Are we perhaps going to turn it around and say, 'But we really didn't mean what was in it. The recommendations really weren't right at all. They got it wrong'? They did not. The members of this parliament who sat on that committee got it right. The member for Bendigo knows it and the parliamentary secretary knows it. He has been to small business meetings with me and he has spoken to those small business people. I will give him his credit: he has spoken to small businesses in the flesh and he knows in his heart of hearts that what I am saying is dead right. I will make an offer tonight: in this bipartisan sense, support what we are proposing here, which is a direct reference to and lift from the Reid committee report, and we will finally get something which will be worthwhile for small business. Don't play politics in here, Parliamentary Secretary. We are fair dinkum about this. We have put a lot of time and effort into putting these amendments together based on the member for Bendigo's report. It is worthy of support and, at the appropriate time, I will be moving those amendments. (Time expired)",116

198,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,118
199,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill. As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which brought down the report Finding a balance towards fair trading in Australia, I found the contribution of the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) to this debate this evening quite extraordinary, because the Mr Martin-Thank you.",118
200,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Extraordinarily bad I think might be the best description. When the committee brought down this report it felt compelled to make some strong recommendations to set some ground rules for what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in Australia. I am pleased to see that the member for Cunningham is remaining in the chamber. On the balance of the evidence to the fair trading inquiry which was conducted right throughout Australia, the committee concluded that small businesses were regularly being confronted with combative and unfair commercial conduct in their dealings with powerful companies. One thing about this inquiry was that small business did not ask the fair trading inquiry for protection. What they wanted was a fair go and a fair deal and what they have received from the government is a new deal and a fair deal. The biggest problem for small business in this country has just been exhibited by the member for Cunningham. In 13 years of office, the Australian Labor Party could never make up their mind what they were prepared to do for small business in this country: 13 years of procrastination, of reports-17 in all-fair trading reports, reviews, all sorts of inquiries, white papers, green papers, pink papers, any sort of paper you like to mention. Here again tonight we have seen another about-face by the member for Cunningham who purports to represent the opposition. In fact, what he is saying is diametrically opposed to his own leader's position on this issue. I will quote the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The report was tabled in the parliament on 26 May. In August and September of this year the Leader of the Opposition, in a speech to the Western Australian Retailers Rally in Perth on 31 August 1997, made these statements which were repeated on 17 September 1997 )It the Camberwell Civic Centre, at which the honourable member for Cunningham also appeared and which met with retailers in Victoria. Mr Martin-It was a good night.",118
201,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It was a very good night. I am delighted to have the transcript of the Perth meeting of the Leader of the Opposition because what he said was: In the interim we have a very important report to respond to. And the great thing about that report that it was unanimous at the Federal level. All the people who signed up to it were from both sides of the House and their credibility is on the lineThat is a very important point, 'credibility on the line'as far as the content of that report is concerned. WeReferring to the oppositionafter 13 years of officeAt least he had the honesty and decency to say that they had failed for 13 years with the Schacht report, the Beddall report, 17 other inquiries, et cetera, changing every couple of years, every couple of monthsfinally in our last year got around to a piece of legislation on unconscionable conductWould you believe, 'unconscionable conduct'and I'm just going to talk about the Federal Act, the Trade Practices Act related to your problems. You have many others that go to the heart of town planning, that go to various pieces of tenancy legislation and the like at the State level. I'm not going to talk about that, those are matters that Geoff Gallop can consider or are things that you'd raise with Doug Shave. Since we did not manage to get through before we leftI presume that means before you went into oppositionthe Unconscionable Conduct legislation that we put in placeThe unconscionable conduct legislation that your leader put in placeI've put it down as a Private Members Bill on my own behalf twice since we've been in Parliament to keep up the pressure on the Federal Government. I'm not silly enough to think they'll pass a piece of legislation moved by Kim BeazleySo he is not supporting the position that was released in the report entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia which was tabled in the parliament on 26 May. Now he is responding and saying that he supports the unconscionable conduct provision, again both in August and September, and he said: I'm not silly enough to think they'll pass a piece of legislation moved by Kim BeaZley, but at least while it stands there on the books it stands there as is a challenge and in any case the bulk of it has been picked up in that Fair Trading report that was referred to a little earlier. So there is a clear admission that he supports the position that we have in the government response. Then he moves on further: Well, I want to just give you a couple of guarantees on our behalf. We need that Unconscionable Conduct legislation in relation to the Trade tices Act. Mr Martin-When did he say this, September?",119
202,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"August and September. He said: We did not get it through in our last term in Government but if you want to take a totally cynical view of politicians, if you want to see politicians as marching to the tune of the loudest drum then it does say something. However, it is there as a challenge and it is there as our policy. Here tonight we see, yet again, a backflip from the member for Cunningham following 13 years and 17 changes. Here I have his media release dated 23 November 1997. Mr Martin-November is after September.",120
203,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,They change. That is the trouble; they keep changing. How on earth could small business survive in an environment such as that 13 years under the previous government when they kept changing their mind? They have changed it again. Now they are saying that they want to utilise the term 'unfair' instead of 'unconscionable' in line with the recommendation. Every time they come into this House and they have something to do with small business they change direction. Debate interrupted. NA,120
204,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being to.30 p.m., I put the question: That the House do now adjourn. Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board",120
205,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"In this adjournment debate, I would like to speak about the work of the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board. This newly appointed board was launched by the New South Wales Treasurer, Michael Egan, last Friday. The new board's chairman is Jim Bosnjak, a director of Westbus. Jim was a member of the previous board and there is in the new board a strong representation of large and small business as Prac- well as government and the community. Jim Bosnjak, in an address given to launch the new board, expressed concern about major traffic problems in western Sydney. He said: A major concern is the current strain Western Sydney is under from constant movement of freight on our roads. This activity is intensive and expensive and we believe it is crucial that freight movement is minimised without delay. There is no reason why freight can't be moved by rail. It's cost effective, safe and the best answer to what is fast becoming a major issue for greater Western Sydney. Jim Bosnjak went on to further state: We plan to lobby hard for the Western Sydney Orbital regardless of whether or not the new airport goes ahead. I will be making further representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) for funding to complete the Orbital project. I am sure that this new board will continue the great work in developing the economy of greater western Sydney started by the previous board: I would like to pay tribute to the inaugural chairman of the greater western Sydney board, Bill MCNamara OAM, for his drive and commitment to western Sydney during his business career, and particularly during his three years as chairman. Bill MCNamara has been chairman of the western Sydney Red Shield Appeal and a member of the Blacktown TAFE advisory board, to mention just two of the many community organisations that Bill has been involved in during his long career. I wish Bill and his wife Pat all the best for the future. To give members of the House an indication of the area mass covered by the board, I note that greater western Sydney occupies about 8,000 square kilometres. It extends from Granville in the east to the Blue Mountains in the west, from Hawkesbury in the north and through Liverpool to Picton in the south. Currently 1.4 million people live there, which is approximately 43 per cent of Sydney's population. The population of the region is diverse, including people from almost every culture in the world, over 30 per cent of whom were born outside Australia. This includes a growing Asian community, with strong overseas commercial ties. These many different cultures have provided local manufacturers with a better understanding of the product needs of the various export markets. I have with me an investment profile which advises that the gross domestic product of the region is $34 billion, which is almost a quarter of the entire GDP of New South Wales. The area represents about 20 per cent of the state's labour force. By the year 2011, it is projected that the greater western Sydney economy will grow to $46 billion with the creation of an additional 350,000 jobs. Greater western Sydney's principal economic links are, firstly, with the rest of Sydney, next with New South Wales and then as an export partner with Asia and Europe. Almost 20 per cent of Australia's top 500 exporters, including three of the top 10, are located in this region. In the board's newsletter published in October, two major success stories were mentioned arising out of the current board's program. One success story related to advice given by the board to Mr Khin Aung, the marketing manager of Bosco Manufacturing, an Ingleburn manufacturer of office furniture. This advice helped Bosco to win a $300,000 contract for the Olympic Games. The other success story relates to an import replacement expo, where four major western Sydney corporations exhibited over 100 items currently being imported. BHP's Sydney steel mill, Integral Energy, 11 Case and Otis elevators exhibited metal and metal intensive products that cost them over $2.5 million per year. This is just a fraction of their total annual import bill. Over 140 business visitors came to the expo. Sixty expressions of interest were immediately received. Mr Speaker, I can claim some knowledge of the development of this import replacement expo. The idea came from a labour market committee I chaired called the Blacktown Regional Employment, Education and Development Committee, which was funded by the OLMA program of the previous Labor government. (Time expired) Essay Competition",120
206,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT,"Today I had the great opportunity in this House to speak of the winning entry for the MCMillan competition for essays. I was able to read out an essay by Ms Rowlings, aged 11, in year 6 from Elizabeth Street Primary School at Moe, entitled 'Why I like to live where I live'. I am now able to read the essay by Alyson Beasley from Traralgon Secondary College entitled 'Why I like to live where I live: country life': The black turns to grey and the first ray of sunshine hits the top of the Strezlecki ranges. At this same moment I hear a chorus of voices, like a bush alarm clock. The magpie sings to welcome the morning, while the kookaburra laughs at the night's efforts to defeat the rising day. The air is clear and crisp. A fresh pine breeze runs through the hills from a plantation nearby. Dew clings to the cobwebs hanging from the hayshed roof. The morning mist disappears as the sun moves over the hills, higher into the now blue sky. ""I""re morning of the city is so different. It's hard to believe the country hills share the same sun. In the city you don't wake up to the song of native birds, but the sound of electrical alarm clocks or the busy traffic outside. A dark smog lays like a blanket over the city and the smell of pollution fills the air. The sun never seems quite as bright here, maybe because it has to force its way to the earth's surface. These are reasons why I like to live where I live. I admire the beauty of the Callignee hills, the place I have always called home. There is no place on earth I would rather have lived my childhood. But these aren't the only reasons why I love my home. It's when the sun has fully risen, my bedroom becomes full of warm light. I squint my eyes as I open my window to breathe the cool fresh air. It's another beautiful morning in the country, like them all. After I'm fully awake, I dress in my most daggy but comfortable clothes, knowing I'm safe from the prying eyes of next door neighbours. The closest house is two paddocks away, so there's plenty of privacy, something that's lost living in the city. I emerge outside, taking notice of my pet dog jumping to her feet ready to follow my path. We walk up the track to the paddock, passing through the old gate which divides the property. The cows greet me letting me know that they're hungry for hay. My dog takes the pleasure upon herself of chasing them away, grabbing their tails as they run from her. There's a group of kangaroos grazing on the green grass, still wet with dew from sunrise. They look up and decide I'm too close. With that they hop away, bounding over the wire fence in one great leap. I sit at the top of the hill, stopping to appreciate where I am. It's so peaceful here, the only sound is from the creek at the bottom of the hill running briskly down stream. It's hard to imagine that not far from me lays a golden sand beach in one direction, and in the other the beauty of a rainforest. Something that truly makes this the best place to live on earth. When this young lady Alyson Beasley wrote this essay, I think she was giving it straight from the heart. I appreciate Alyson's efforts. Alyson and Melissa spent two days with my wife and me here in Canberra. We appreciate their persistence in putting up with us in Canberra while we are here. Coombs, Dr Herbert Cole 'Nugget' Berlin, Sir Isaiah",121
207,Mr BARRY JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to pay a brief and belated tribute to two of the greatest men I ever met, Dr H.C - better known as 'Nugget'-Coombs and Sir Isaiah Berlin OM, who died within a week of each other. Herbert Cole Coombs was born in Kalamunda, Western Australia, on 24 February 1906 and died in Sydney at the age of 91 on 29 October 1997. Isaiah Berlin, of Russian Jewish parentage, was born in Riga on 6 June 1909 and died in Oxford on 5 November 1997 at the age of 88. I was overseas when Nugget died and missed the brief parliamentary tribute but was able to attend his funeral at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. The funeral was typical of him. He gave instructions: it had to be announced that he had accepted the funeral at St Mary's, first, because they put on a good show and, second, because it would please his wife and daughter. But it had to be made clear that he had not changed his party line on the question of belief. He had three other requirements: it was to begin with Bach, to end with Waltzing Matilda and to have no 'God bothering' in the middle. His instructions were carried out to the letter. Nugget came up the hard way, became a primary teacher and worked as a wharf labourer-surely the smallest in industrial history-while he studied economics at the University of Western Australia. He then went to the London School of Economics for a brilliant PhD. He returned and joined the Public Service. His range of achievement was extraordinary: he directed rationing during World War II, postwar reconstruction after it, then became a central figure in central banking and also contributing to establishing the framework for international banking and credit arrangements. Artie Fadden, long-time leader of the Country Party and Menzies' Treasurer, coined the phrase 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' to describe seven extraordinary men, all vertically challenged, who dominated policy formulation from the 1940s, especially when Ben Chifley was Treasurer, then Prime Minister. Ben Chifley, of course, was Snow White. The seven dwarfs in descending order of age were: Frederick Shedden, Roland Wilson, H.C. Coombs, John Crawford, Allen Brown, Richard Randall and Henry Bland. All were knighted except Nugget, who turned it down. He handed back his AC in 1976 when the Order of Australia temporarily included knighthoods. Nugget Coombs devoted himself to the arts, to building up the AND and to the cause of Aboriginal rights-the cause that he came to commit himself to most passionately and that, in the end, he felt the greatest frustration and sadness about. I came to know him well when he was first Chairman of the Australian Council for the Arts and I had the privilege of serving as his deputy chairman from 1969 to 1973. I learned a great deal about public finance and administration and chairing meetings just by watching him. In his last years, he was crippled by a stroke and he lost his power of speech, but he understood everything. He was an inspiration for two generations of Australians. The Australian Magazine for 22-23 December 1990 invited a panel of 14 gurus to name the 20 greatest Australians since Federation. Nugget Coombs was on nine of the lists, followed by Howard Florey, Robert Menzies, Patrick White, Macfarlane Burnet and Essington Lewis. Isaiah Berlin was a political philosopher and historian of ideas. He was the greatest talker I ever heard-a polymath who could tum out impeccably shaped sentences at more than 400 words per minute. He observed the 1917 Russian Revolution as a child, came to England at the age of 10, became an Oxford teacher, a wartime diplomat in Washington and Moscow, a professor of political theory, first President of Wolfson College and President of the British Academy. He had a genius for friendship and incredible generosity with his time. I happened to be a beneficiary. In his famous book The Hedgehog and the Fox, (1953) Isaiah Berlin took up the idea of the Greek poet Archilochus that 'the fox knows many things and the hedgehog one big thing'. Berlin was a fox. He rejected the idea that there was a single or central dogmawhether it was Christianity, the Enlightenment or Marxism-which was so self-evidently true that it could compel belief and punish dissent. This led to his concept of 'value pluralism' and the idea that every life was a plurality of values. I quote the words of his editor Henry Hardy: Berlin's pluralism justifies his deep-seated rejection of coercion and manipulation by authoritarians and totalitarians of all kinds: Communists, Fascists, bureaucrats, missionaries, terrorists, revolutionaries and all other despots, levellers, systematisers or purveyors of ""organised happiness"". Like one of his heroes, the Russian thinker Alexander Herzen, many of whose characteristics he manifested himself, Berlin had a horror of the sacrifices that have been exacted in the name of Utopian ideals due to be realised at some unspecifiable point in the distant future: real should not have to suffer and die today for the sake of a chimera of eventual universal bliss. He was a genuinely great man. Greenpeace Protest",122
208,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express my shock and anger, and that of many of my constituents in my electorate of Robertson, at a decision handed down by Magistrate Scott Mitchell in the North Sydney local court last week. Magistrate Mitchell was hearing a case against 17 Greenpeace protesters who invaded Kirribilli House-the residence of the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard)-in a protest against the Australian government's very sensible stand on greenhouse gas emissions. Magistrate Mitchell deemed the attack was 'not wanton or destructive' and let all the protesters off without conviction. According to an article in the Daily Telegraph, dated 19 November, the magistrate praised them for having acted properly, heroically and certainly sincerely. Magistrate Scott Mitchell then went on, according to the Daily Telegraph, to say there were heartfelt intentions in the raid on Kirribilli House on 20 October this year. He told one defendant, according to the Daily Telegraph, that he would be freed on a bond which reflects Australia's commitment to free speech. These comments and this lack of action from this magistrate send entirely the wrong message to the Australian community. Once again, this shows that many in our judiciary are out of touch with community opinions. These comments and this decision not to find a conviction in this case send a message to all protesters, to all people who are opposed to a decision, that it is all right to invade the homes of public people, to put at risk those people and their families. Remember that at the time of the invasion of the Prime Minister's residence-and it certainly was an invasion-his daughter Melanie was in the house and, of course, would have been distressed and concerned by the events. Actions such as this and the lack of action by our courts only serve to further isolate our public· figures, our politicians and our Prime people Minister from our community. Australia is one of those rare communities where public figures, politicians, members of the government and the opposition alike can move through their communities in relative freedom, giving those communities almost unparalleled access to their representatives. Do we want to get to a situation where there is an isolation zone around KirribiIli House-such as there is at No. 10 Downing Street in London or at many other places of residence of the leaders of countries throughout the world-where the general public cannot proceed within a number of kilometres of the residence, where the Prime Minister does not have an opportunity to talk to the general community and to understand their feelings and to get to know what is happening in the community? Decisions such as those by Magistrate Scott Mitchell only serve to heighten that isolation and further lock our public figures away from the general community. Australia has one of the greatest democratic systems anywhere in the world. Every Australian has the access to free speech, has the opportunity to protest in a peaceful manner and has the opportunity to put forward their views on any issues in many forms. I can only agree with the editorial in the Daily Telegraph of 19 November, which is headed 'Free speech is not the issue'. The editorial said: This is not a matter of freedom of speech; this is a case of a group of people invading the privacy of the Prime Minister's home. He and his family are entitled to feel, as the rest of the community that their home is a place of privacy, a place in which they feel safe. This is not a case of politics because, regardless of who the Prime Minister was, I would be standing here today expressing my concern, whether the Prime Minister was former Prime Minister Paul Keating or, in fact, our current Prime Minister, John Howard. I believe the decision sent entirely the wrong message to the Australian community. I have been contacted by many people in my electorate of Robertson on the central coast who represent both sides of politics. They have expressed their concerns at this decision. I am pleased tonight to have had the opportunity to highlight those concerns.",123
209,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish tonight to first congratulate the Australian soccer team on the result which they achieved in Teheran a few days ago. It was a one-all draw, which puts them in a good position to hopefully succeed at the MCG on Saturday night. I intend to be amongst what is likely to be a very large crowd on that night. I would also like to add some observations with respect to the atmosphere that has developed, particularly in the media and amongst some leading commentators, in the lead-up to that game. It was particularly unfortunate that expressions of ignorance and prejudice and extreme views about Iran were allowed to be very prominent, including from some people who should know better, in the lead-up to that game. Teheran was described as the 'worse place in the world'. There were intimations that players were at risk of food poisoning, that they could not eat food there, that the crowds there would be incredibly threatening. The whole spectre of images of terrorism and mad mullahs and the like was ever present in the media coverage of this. As I have indicated, this was unfortunately fanned by a number of prominent figures who should have known better. It was also indicated in the reporting of the game that a number of features were there that were clearly highlighted to Australians as does, if they were peculiar. It was pointed out that it was an all male crowd. I had the privilege of going to an English soccer game a few years ago to watch the team that I support in English soccer, Arsenal, and about 95 per cent of the people at that game were men. It was also pointed out that silence greeted the Australian goal, as if this was somehow peculiar. I would suggest to people that they go and watch a game with the West Coast Eagles over in Perth and see what happens when the visiting team kicks a goal. The poor pitch surface was raised as if, in some way, this was indicative of something terrible on the part of Iran. Of course, nobody thought to mention that it has not been beyond the realms of our country, or many others, to prepare pitches that happen to suit our team, Soccer be it in soccer or in cricket or in other sports. This reporting and these comments do indicate a broader prejudice and ignorance about Iran, which is a diverse and ancient society. People focus on issues such as the covering of women or the high level of sex segregation but they ignore the fact that many societies, including our own, have customs which may be seen in some respects as equally strange or irrational if viewed from a different point of view. For example, the fact that all males in this room are deemed to be undressed if they do not wear this silly piece of fabric around their necks, which performs no useful function, might be seen by people in other societies as equally bizarre as having the face covered. Iran is, in fact, a much more diverse, vibrant, effective and progressive society than is commonly portrayed. Yes, it has many restrictions on democracy but far fewer than exist in many other countries in the region. There is a lively tension between the conservative forces within that society and the more liberal progressive forces, as manifested in the recent election of the new more progressive president in Iran. I think it is very unfortunate in our society that people in another country of this size and stature should be vilified in this way and should be portrayed in the one-dimensional and very prejudiced way that has occurred in the lead-up to this game. I hope that, in the lead-up to the game on Saturday, the Australian media and major figures in the sport will be a bit more broad minded and realise that we are playing against a team from another society that is quite different from Australia, but nonetheless is equally valid in terms of its cultural expressions and should not be vilified or portrayed as a group of subhumans, people who are all mad terrorists or the like, as there is a tendency for the media to do. I wish the Australian team all the best. I hope to be there cheering them along with a crowd probably in the vicinity of 90,000. I look forward to the World Cup next year as a person who had his interest in soccer first kindled by Australia's performance in the World Cup in 1974, the one other time we managed to make it to the finals. I am very hopeful that we will be there again. I would like to see our performance in the sport, the reporting of it and the presentation of it as a means of reaching out to people in other cultures and building bonds and bridges to other people, not as a vehicle for mindless vilification and repetition of ridiculous prejubusinesses. dices, as has been the case in this instance. Native Title",124
210,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I have a letter here from Peter Wales, who is a parish priest at the Charleville All Saints Anglican Church, Queensland, that I wish to read into Hansard. He starts off by saying: Recent comments in the media by some representatives of farming groups have been unhelpful and ill-informed. They abuse the Churches for their position on the Wik decision and the proposed Native Title legislation. Their comments contain a number of factual errors, and may well undermine existing support for their own position. There are a number of Church groups and individual Church members who have been deeply sympathetic to the. pastoralists' concerns. The Archbishop of Brisbane, Peter Hollingworth, was in Charleville on Tuesday the 4th of this month. The purpose of his visit was to identify and understand the concerns of bush families. Attendance at this meeting was disappointing. Apparently there are a number of people who would rather complain about the Churches than tum up and make their views known. Nonetheless it is the case that a few extremists within the Churches have succeeded in gaining a large share of media attention. This is particularly so of the Archbishops of Adelaide and Perth. There are three words that could describe the comments made by these leaders. The first word is ignorant. By this I mean that they have been wilfully ignorant of the genuine concerns of country people. For example, there are real and legitimate fears over the security of women and children on remote properties. City residents would be most unwilling to allow groups of strangers, possibly with alcohol and firearms, into their home or business premises. If this would be a concern in the city, it is even more so in the country, where the nearest neighbour or police station may be some hours away. The issue of security is just one of many. Others include questions of privacy, of liability in case of accident, use of existing property infrastructure, and interference with property owners' ability to run their businesses. These difficulties may be overcome, but to deny that they exist helps no-one. The second word is uncaring. Church leaders have justified their singleminded opposition to pastoralists by their obligation to defend the marginalised and the underprivileged. But in doing so they have seriously misrepresented the situation of bush families. Most pastoral leases are small family The families who run them are a tiny and largely forgotten minority of the Australian population. They are marginalised not only by geographical remoteness, but by low income. The Archbishops and others who have criticised pastoralists have done so from a position of power and influence, and with an income some four times higher than the average net income of most farming families in my parish. The third word is hypocritical. The Churches right to speak on moral issues does not consist in pointing the finger at others and telling them what to do. In particular it does not consist in telling an already disadvantaged group of people that they are greedy and sinful. Christian ethics finds its clearest expression in a Willingness to listen, and to help bear the cost of forgiveness and renewal. Farmers have paid the full value of the land for their properties. They have done so in the reasonable expectation that they would have the same rights to tenure and security as other Australians. If this expectation is now to be denied them, then their fears and disappointment at least deserve a hearing. But Churches must not only be willing to listen. If they are serious about this being an issue of they must be willing to help bear the costs by doing what they are asking farming families to do. In other words, they must make their own properties available for use by aboriginal people. If the Church leaders and members of ""Australians for Native Title"" have not invited local aboriginal people to have free use of their own church properties, homes and business premises, then any suggestion from them that the pastoralists must do so must be seen as sheer hypocrisy-an attitude somewhere between ""Blow you, I'm all right Jack"", and ""Anywhere but not in my back yard"". There has been some suggestion that the farmers' point of view is unnecessarily alarmist. Legal claims by aboriginal people asked for ""use and enjoyment of the land, to the exclusion of all others"". Some aboriginal leaders have given undertakings that they will not seek exclusive possession. The advice to farmers and their families is that they should accept these undertakings. (Time expired) Vietnam Veterans",125
211,Mr BILLS ON,ADJOURNMENT,"In the short time available to me, I would like to pay tribute to the veteran community in my electorate of Dunkley and also acknowledge the recent visit of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott). During the Hon. Bruce Scott's visit to my electorate, we were fortunate enough to meet with representatives from the Mornington RSL led by Vin Duffy, President; the Seaford RSL led by John MCKenzie, President; and the Frankston RSL led by Len Streets, President, and Geoff Walker, the SecretarylManager. We also had the good fortune of meeting with the Prisoner of War Association representative in my area, Bill Coventry, who does an outstanding job for the electorate and for the prisoners of war who live on the Mornington Peninsula. I would particularly like to mention the representations made by the Vietnam . . veterans' community. We had the Frankston community represented by the state MP the Hon. Peter MCLellan; Southern Peninsula Vietnam Veterans' Support Network represented by Michael Sifos; the Vietnam Veterans' Motorcycle Association represented by Tombstone, Wanderer and Stevo; and also the Legacy network. I would like to put on record my undying respect for those people who represented this justice, country in the Vietnam War. I was not born when the conflict started or when conscription was introduced, but for me they are all heroes and they all deserve our respect. I will always be available to support their needs for having put themselves in harm's way for what the nation thought was right at the time.",126

The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Service Medal (Question No. 1787) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 3 June 1997: (1) How many applicants for the Australian Service Medal will be affected by the decision relating to double medalling. (2) With which awards could the Australian Service Medal conflict. (3) What would have been the estimated cost to provide medals to those now ineligible because of double medalling. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The honourable member's question has been overtaken by events and I refer him to my response in the House on 24 September 1997 to a question without notice from Mr MCDougall, which was published on page 8326 of Hansard No. 14, 1997. My response announced this Government's decision to create and award an Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 for eligible personnel who served in the Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Indonesian Confrontation and Vietnam War. Medicare Cards: Proof of Identity (Question No. 2137) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) What proof of identity and proof of relationship is required to be produced by Medicare card holders when applying to add a child to their card. (2) What safeguards are in place to determine that the applicant is the custodial parent or legal guardian of the child. (3) Are applicants asked to state their relationship or legal responsibility for the child; if not, why not.",126
213,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Health Insurance Commission (HIC) makes provision for children to appear on two NA separate Medicare cards. The children's names can appear differently on each card if necessary. The purpose of this flexibility is to ensure children have access to Medicare and to. ensure that various caring arrangements are accommodated. General guidelines exist concerning requests to copy or transfer children onto a second Medicare card. Each case is considered on its individual merits. A Medicare card is simply an administrative convenience to establish eligibility and enables benefits to be claimed under the scheme. Proof of identity and relationship is not always sought when applying to add a child to a Medicare card. In most circumstances it is clear that Medicare is dealing with a parent. This is apparent from Medicare records. Usually a child is added to a parent's card at birth. If the HIC receives an application to have a child copied onto a second Medicare card, the consent of a parent is required. The consent of both parents is required to have a child removed from one card and added to another card. Consent may be given verbally or in writing. (2) Where there are doubts about the right of the person to have a child on their card because, for example, the surnames differ, or there is no record of the adult being on a family card or at the address recorded for the other card, the HIC will require production of appropriate documentation such as an Order of the Family Court, adoption papers, a letter from the other parent or a birth certificate for the child.2. (3) In most cases, relationship and legal responsibility are not sought as it is clear from the Medicare history that the person requesting to have the child on their card was previously listed on a family card with the child, and surnames are the same. The fact that a person has sole parenting responsibility or sole guardianship does not necessarily mean that another party does not have some formal or informal contract. Non-Australian Pilots (Question No. 2163) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, 28 August 1997: How many non-Australian pilots (a) are working at 27 August 1997, (b) have worked since 1 July 1997 and (c) worked between 1 July 1996 and 30 June 1997 in the Australian aviation industry. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Neither the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority nor Airservices Australia collects information on the numbers of non-Australian pilots. St George Hospital Emergency Procedures (Question No. 2235) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) Further to the answer to question No 98 (Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 3288) concerning St George Hospital emergency procedures, were emergency exercises planned for Sydney Airport and held on 5 June, 19 June and 18 September 1996; if so, what were the results. (2) Which organisations took part in each exercise. (3) Were defects in the system detected; if so, (a) what and (b) what action has been or is being taken to correct the defects. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation has provided the following information: (1) Yes; A tabletop exercise was held on 5 June 1996 to test the Airport's emergency plan. A tabletop exercise is a scenario developed around a conference table as opposed to out in the field. Field exercises to test the Airport's emergency plan were held on 19 June 1996 (Exercise Penguin) and 18 September 1996 (Exercise Falcon). After tabletop exercises, participants discuss the response from all agencies and any errors in those responses are corrected. For field exercises, referees from each of the participating agencies prepare a written report on the performance of their organisations then reviews and amends, if necessary, Standing Operating Procedures. NSW 35,387 VIC 21,343 QLD 13,019 SA 8,564 WA 5,065 TAS 2,568 ACT (2) Participants for the exercises referred to above were: 5 June 1996: FAC Staff, NSW Police, NSW Ambulance Service, NSW Fire Brigade, and Rescue and Firefighting Service (RFFS, Airservices Australia). 19 June 1996: FAC Staff, NSW Police, NSW Ambulance Service, NSW Health Department, NSW Department of Community Services, Salvation Army, FAC ""Carers Group"", Australian Protective Services, Airlines (QANTAS, Ansett and Eastern Airlines), and Customs. 18 September 1996: FAC Staff, NSW Police (including Water Police), NSW Ambulance Service, NSW Health Department, NSW Fire Brigade, Airlines (QANTAS, Ansett and Singapore Airlines), Sydney Ports Corporation, and RFFS. (3) The Airport Emergency Plan (AEP) is under continual review to ensure its effectiveness. Whilst no defects in the system were detected during the exercises listed above, minor improvements were made to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the AEP. This is a primary function of exercises. Legal Aid Funding: Criminal Cases (Question No. 2264) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Attorney General, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) How many defendants in criminal cases received legal aid funding in (a) each State and (b) Australia in each year since 1992.

Greenhouse Climate Change: Health Studies (Question No. 2342) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Has the Government commissioned studies, or sought advice, on the public health impact on the Australian community if greenhouse climate change was to cause global surface temperatures to increase by 2°C; if so, (a) what were the results and (b) will they be published. (2) If work has not been commissioned, nor advice sought, why not.",130
215,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The public health impacts on the Australian community from the predicted increase of global surface temperature resulting from greenhouse climate change have been addressed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). In 1991, NHMRC published the results of the research in the document ""Health Implications of Long Term Climatic Change"". Studies have also been completed on the effect of climate change on pollen allergens, and an assessment of heatwaves and mortality in Australia between 1979-1990. In addition, the Government has developed a draft report on the geographical assessment of vector-borne disease distribution in Australia. The outcomes from this public health research further support the conclusions in the 1991 NHMRC report. These reports will provide information for the public health impacts component of a consolidated publication on the environmental effects of greenhouse climate change. The full report is to be published by Environment Australia following completion of other research addressing the environmental impacts of greenhouse climate change. (2) Answer (1) refers. Public Hospital Beds: Western Australia (Question No. 2373) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: Year (at 30 June) 1997 1996 1995 1994 (I) Excludes day hospital facilities Number of beds is, of course, not an appropriate appropriate indicators include total bed days in public Year (at 30 June) Total bed 1997 Not available 1996 1,347,954 1995 1,442,590 1994 1,451,540 (b) The Commonwealth does not hold this data.

(2) Is the number of beds available in Western Australian public hospitals at an acceptable level with regard to the Medicare agreement between the Federal and Western Australian Governments. (3) How many beds does the Western Australian Government need to make available for it not to be in breach of the Medicare agreement. (4) What are the minimum requirements the Western Australian Government must achieve with regard to the provision of public health services to meet the requirements of the Medicare agreement.",130
216,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Available beds numbers in recognised public hospitals under the Medicare Agreements are supplied to the Commonwealth by the State and Territory health authorities. The following table shows bed numbers supplied by the Health Department of Western Australia. Available recognised public hospital beds(1) in Western Australia Not available 5,158 5,058 4,889 measure of access to public hospital care. Other more hospitals where the Western Australian figures are: days in Western Australian recognised hospitals (c) The Commonwealth does not hold this data. However, it should be noted that waiting lists are a poor indicator of hospital and health system performance which do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of problems relating to access to elective surgery. Many hospital admissions, including elective admissions, occur without the patient ever being on a waiting list. Some period of waiting may be appropriate, depending on the clinical urgency of the case: waiting lists provide a mechanism for scheduling admissions so that the most urgent cases are treated first; and the clinical urgency of cases on the waiting lists is therefore more critical than the number of cases. Because of these factors, it is accepted by both Commonwealth and Staterrerritory health authorities that it is more appropriate to focus on admitting people to hospital within clinically appropriate times than on the number of people waiting at any point in time. This is reflected in the arrangements introduced under the Medicare Agreements in 1995-96 whereby States have access to bonus funding if they achieve bilaterally agreed performance targets. Four areas were targeted initially: admitted and nonadmitted patient activity; and waiting times for elective surgery and emergency departments. For elective surgery, the incentive is not based on the number of people on waiting lists but on the length of time people wait on the list before admission to hospital. The National Health Data Dictionary defines three categories of clinical urgency for patients requiring elective surgery: . category 1 admission within 30 days desirable for a condition that has the tial to deteriorate quickly to the point that it may become an emergency; category 2 admission within 90 days desirable for a condition causing some pain, dysfunction or disability but which is not likely to deteriorate quickly or become an emergency; and . category 3 admission at some time in the future acceptable for a condition causing minimal or no pain, dysfunction or disability, which is unlikely to deteriorate quickly into an emergency. (2-3) The Medicare Agreements negotiated by the previous Labor Government do not stipulate public hospital beds numbers and do not link funding to the number of public hospital beds. Rather, funding is provided to the States who, under the terms of the Medicare Agreements, agree to ensure that eligible persons have access to a comprehensive range of inpatient, outpatient and accident and emergency services free of charge in both metropolitan and rural areas on the basis of clinical need. The only funding under the Agreements which is directly related to activity levels is, as previously mentioned, some bonus funding which is linked to performance in the areas of admitted and nonadmitted patient activity and waiting times for elective surgery and emergency departments. (4) There is a range of other detailed provisions contained within the Medicare Agreements. Copies of the Medicare Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States are available in the Parliamentary Library. Apart from the bonus funding arrangements mentioned in (1)(c) above, the previous Government did not link funding to specific outcomes or performance targets. Public Hospital Beds: New South Wales (Question No. 2397) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 22 October 1997: (1) Is he able to say how many beds were available in New South Wales public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994.

Department of Health and Family Services: Charities (Question No. 2427) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: (1) Has the Minister's Department provided funding to charities in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-96 (c) 1996-97: if so, (i) to which charities and (ii) what sums were provided.",132
218,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Health and Family Services provides funding to a range of organisations for the provision of various goods and services and for grant payments. Recipients of this funding may include non-profit and charitable organisations. Many of the Department's program administration systems do not separately identify payments to non-profit and charitable organisations. To obtain information on payments to non-profit and charitable organisations would require resource intensive manual searches of data bases. I am not in a position to divert resources for such an intensive manual search. Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Charities (Question No. 2430) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: Has the Minister's Department provided funding to charities in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-96 and (c) 1996-97: if so, (i) to which charities and (ii) sums were provided. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DlMA) provides funding to community organisations under the Community Grants Program to assist humanitarian entrants, refugees and migrants settle in Australia. The list of organisations funded between 1994-95 and 1996-97 is available from the House of Representatives Table Office. DIMA has no record of whether any of these organisations were registered with the Australian Taxation Office as charities, as that is not a consideration in determining funding. Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation: Funding (Question No. 2444) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 2097 (Hansard, 23 September 1997, page 8270) concerning the cessation of funding to the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation under the Community Sector Support Scheme, (a) what reasons were given for the cessation of funding and and (b) were the reasons provided to the Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation for comment prior to cessation of the funding; if not, why not.",134
219,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The decision to cease funding to the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation (AP&SF) was made following consideration of the outcomes of a recent major review of Community Sector Support Scheme (CSSS) national secretariat funding. (a) The AP&SF was advised that, in considering the outcomes of the review, there was a need to more clearly define the funding basis for organisations under the CSSS and to provide a greater focus on new priority areas for the Government. In this context the range of competing demands for limited CSSS funds had to be balanced, resulting in cessation of funding to some national secretariats. (b) The AP&SF was advised of the decision to discontinue funding and the reasons for this decision on 12 June 1997. Funding to the organisation ceased on 30 September 1997. This more than three month notice period was provided to enable the defunded organisations to investigate other avenues of funding. Upon commencement of the review in October 1996, all organisations funded under the CSSS were formally advised of the review terms of reference. what These included recommendations on appropriate funding arrangements within existing resource allocations and consequently whether currently funded organisations should continue to receive funding from July 1997. Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorder (Question No. 2447) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 2094 (Hansard, 20 October 1997, page 9276), has there been further research or opinion as to the efficacy of electroencephalographic services where the service involves quantitative typographic mapping using neurometrics or similar devices since the question of Medicare benefits for diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder was last considered in 1995; if so, what. (2) Will his department further investigate the issue with a view to restoring Medicare benefits such services.",134
220,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) report on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was endorsed by Council in December 1996. The report concludes that the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative topographic mapping techniques using neurometrics in relation to ADHD have been investigated in a number of research studies but at present such techniques are still experimental and are not necessary in routine clinical practice (p. 31). The Report also recommends that investigations such as neurophysiological tests are not recommended as part of the routine assessment of ADHD. This advice from the NHMRC is consistent with the advice previously given to my Department by the Australian Association of Neurologists and the Australian College of Paediatrics. Although electroencephalographic techniques in this area seem to show some promise they are still considered a research tool rather than an essential part of the routine clinical assessment of children with Attention Deficit Disorder. (2) The Australian College of Paediatrics has for advised my Department that new research is being undertaken on the use of neurometrics for the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder. The College has also reaffirmed its previous advice on this procedure. If the current research leads to additional new evidence on the value of this procedure in the investigational management of Attention Deficit Disorder it will be appropriate to refer it to the Medicare Services Advisory Committee for assessment and advice on the strength of evidence relating to safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness. This Committee is an initiative of the Government's 1997-98 Budget package aimed at strengthening the evidence base of the Medicare Benefits Schedule.",135
