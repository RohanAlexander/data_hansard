1,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Ronald Edwards) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. SUPPLY BILL (No.3) 1992-93 Second Reading [COGNATE BILLS: SUPPLY BILL (No.4) 1992-93 LOAN BILL 1992] Debate resumed from 18 August, on motion by Mr Willis: That the Bill be now read a second time.",10
2,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"Curtin) (10.01 a.m.)Supply Bill (No.3) 1992-93 seeks additional interim appropriations of $65m for recurrent Commonwealth Government expenditures, while. Supply Bill (No.4) 1992-93 seeks additional interim appropriations of $105m to meet capital works expenditure, payments to the States, and similar non-recurrent outlays. We are also debating cognately the Loan Bill, which makes provision for the financing of the prospective 1992-93 Budget deficit of some $13.389 billion. This year's Budget deficit is expected to give rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of around $6 billion greater than the Budget deficit itself. As is the usual practice, this deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be met from the Loan Fund as provided for in the Bill. Each of these three Bills is quite unprecedented own way, and together they reflect the disastrous state that the Commonwealth finances have fallen into under this Government. Supply Bills 3 and 4 are unprecedented in that they are additional to Supply Bills 1 and 2, which were passed by Parliament as recently as 2 June this year in the usual way. In past, Supply Bills 1 and 2 have almost always been sufficient to provide for the ongoing annual services of government up until 30 November when the Budget Appropriation Bills are usually passed. Supply Bill (No.1) provided $12.4 billion for this purpose, which was $32Om or 2.7 per cent more than the equivalent Bill for the year before. Supply Bill (No.2) passed earlier this year provided an additional $4 billion, which was $600m or 17.3 per cent more than that provided for the previous year. Supply Bills 1 and 2 reflected the additional 'One Job' statement expenditures which were made over and above those outlays provided in the 199192 Budget and which have contributed to the continuing blow-out in the Commonwealth Budget deficit. But now we find the Government is coming to us again and asking for even more money to tide it over until November-shades of the banana republic we heard of a few years agol This is at the same time as the Government's Appropriation Bills have been introduced in the usual Budget context. The amounts sought in these two Supply Bills are relatively small but the small sums involved beg the question as to why they could not be met in the usual way out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which for the sake of brevity I will refer to as the AMF. The AMF is the usual financing mechanism for unforeseen expenditures that cannot be met out of the appropriations already approved by the Parliament. In his second reading speech on Supply Bill (No.3) the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) claimed: Reliance on the Advance to the Minister for Finance for these purposes would run the very real risk that there would be insufficient funds available to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements. This is despite the fact that Supply Bills Nos 1 and 2 from earlier this year allocated $17Om in its and $14Om respectively to the AMF for exactly these contingencies. The additional Supply Bills before the House also seek additional funds in areas of expenditure that were already generously provided for in Supply Bills Nos 1 and 2principally 'One Job' pump priming and porkthe barrelling. These Bills and the Government's actions can have only one possible explanation: the Government is clearly making provision for a huge increase in Government expenditure in the early months of this financial year for the purposes of softening up the electorate in advance of the next general election. The Government is gearing up for one almighty pork-barrelling campaign while it cloaks its intentions in the rhetoric of speeding up the budgetary assistance to the ranks of the unemployed that its own policies have created. Not only are these Bills a clear indication of the Government's intention ahead of the next election, but they are also indicative of the Government's continued mismanagement of the Commonwealth's finances. It was only a few months ago, in March this year, that the Government resorted to an additional Appropriation Bill in the form of Appropriation (No.5), at the same time as Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 were still before the ParliaNowhere ment. In that instance we had the Government tacking an additional Appropriation Bill to a cognate debate for Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4, which already included the appropriations to be authorised by Appropriation Bill (No.5). The Government then had to go to extraordinary lengths to move amendments to delete the relevant expenditures from Bills Nos 3 and 4 to reflect the fact that they were now included in aill No.5. That Bill was then shoved through the Senate ahead of Bills Nos 3 and 4 to provide the Government with funds that it argued could not be provided through the Advance to the Minister for Finance. There is absolutely no end to this Government's incompetence. Rather than learning from its mistakes, the Government is presenting us with the same lame arguments for a second time with these two additional Supply Bills. This is the second time this year that the Government has been forced to introduce additional legislation merely to meet its ongoing spending requirements. But the Government's incompetence in this regard does not stop·there. It would appear that, in the schedules accompanying these Bills, the Government has transposed the figures sought by it through the Bills. The result is that in Supply Bill (No.3) the Government is authorised to spend $105m but only $65m is supplied, while the reverse holds true for Supply Bill (No.4). Of course, this error can be dealt with in a number of ways without causing undue difficulty, but it points to the way in which Ministers introduce legislation in this Parliament with scant regard to and absolutely no knowledge of the details of the Bills. The Government's Budget legislation is already in a mess, in large part due to the Government's financial ineptitude. This has been brought on in part by the recession we had to have, but also because the Government has presided over a blow-out in expenditure to finance its corning re-election campaign. The Government is going to try to buy the next election with money it does not have, Bill which ultimately means buying it with money conscripted from the Australian people. is this better indicated than in the provisions of the Loan Bill, one of several such Bills introduced during the life of this Parliament since the Government gave up the ghost of trying to realise a Budget surplus during 1990-91. The deterioration in the Commonwealth Government's finances over the last 12 months has been nothing short of spectacular-a monument to its fiscal ineptitude. The Government went from an estimated Budget deficit for 1991-92 of $4.732 billion to an actual Budget deficit outcome of $9.339 billion. This represents a change in the outcome of more than $11 billion-the Government was out by $11 billion. We should not forget that the 1990-91 outcome was a reversal of the 1989 outcome by more than $6 billion. Since 1989-90 we have seen a turn for the worse in the Commonwealth Government's finances totalling more than $17 billion. We now have before us the 1992-93 Budget which proposes as its starting point a Budget deficit of some $13.4 billion-a prospective change on the previous year's outcome of some $4 billion. The starting point deficit for 1992 is estimated at 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Total outlays in this year's Budget will increase by 4.1 per cent in real terms. As a percentage of GDP, outlays are expected to rise to 27 per cent as a result of this year's Budget. However, the real Budget deficit is concealed by the Government's usual Budget fiddles, as are the real increases in the Federal Government's own purpose spending. When one takes into account the $1.6 billion proceeds from asset sales and $1.1 billion in abnonnal profits from the Reserve Bank of Australia, the deficit blows out to $16.1 billion. According to Alan Kohler, writing in the Australian, the real deficit is more like $21 billion when one discounts for some of the more dubious Budget transactions which serve to obscure the gap between the Government's operating expenses and tax receipts. But the major concern with this Budget is the financing requirement it generates. This year's Budget deficit implies a financing requirement of $18.5 billion in this financial year alone. But between now and 1995 there is more than $50 billion in unfunded spending proposed by Labor which must be financed by issuing new debt. We all know that new debt raised on domestic capital markets ultimately means higher interest rates. It is of course higher interest rates which are responsible for killing off the business investment we need so desperately to get the economy going again. It is higher interest rates which attract capital inflow, which in turn contributes to the current account deficit. It is not surprising, therefore, to see private sector forecasts that the current account deficit will nearly double from $11.8 billion in 1991-92 to more than $21 billion by 1993-94. It is little wonder then that the Government was forced to mention at least the possibility of increased taxes in the Budget Speech. Without such a reference, the markets would have been totally spooked by the question of where the money for all of this so far unfunded expenditure was meant to be coming from. So we have the markets to thank for confinning the coalition's exposure of the Government's secret tax agenda before the next election, part of which will undoubtedly include an expansion of the wholesale sales tax base to bring about a de facto consumption tax, but with none of the advantages of a goods and services tax. This is undoubtedly part of the rationale behind the sales simplification exercise, the legislation for which the Government is trying to push through the Senate ahead of the next election. The Government has already flagged that it will be slugging us with a domestic interest withholding tax, an expanded prescribed payments system and a broader fringe benefits tax base. On page 4.41 of Budget Paper No.1, the Government says: To maintain the structure of the revenue base and reduce the prospective deficit for 1995-96 the Government is prepared to consider reforms to the domestic interest withholding tax, the scope of the PPS arrangements and the FBT system ... if nearer to the time the prospective deficit is as now projected. We have known 'for some time that the Government would like to see withholding tax applied to all interest payments made to all Australian taxpayers. This would mean that people on lower marginal income tax rates would be forced to reclaim overpayments of tax from the Tax Office at the end of the financial year, at the miserable interest rates for which the ATO is notorious. Too bad if people need those interest payments to live on during the financial year. People on higher rates of income tax would he denied the option of paying their tax in one lump sum at the end of the financial year. Instead, it will be a requirement that tax be deducted automatically from their interest payments before they are even made. In theory, a withholding tax should not raise any revenue, since it is only meant to bring forward provisional tax liabilities. However, the Tax Office claims that such a tax would bring in revenue by eliminating some of the possibilities for avoiding tax on interest payments. The point to be made about that is that we already have a tax file number system which was meant to close down most, if not all, of those avenues for avoiding tax. Any additional revenue the Government expects to collect from the imposition of a domestic withholding tax can only be indicative of a serious failure in the tax file number system to do the job it is meant to be doing. The tax file number system poses numerous threats to the privacy of all Australians, but we tolerate it in the belief that it is a necessary evil that will help protect the revenue and protect against social security fraud. But it would appear that the tax file number system is not working effectively in the former case, in which case we probably need to re-evaluate the costs and benefits of this intrusive system of surveillance. The Government's Budget Paper No. 1 anticipates raising $2 billion to $3 billion from these proposed new tax measures alone; never mind the secret tax agenda of expanding the wholesale sales tax base which the Government has in the bottom drawer for after the next election. What is also disturbing about this Budget, apart from the Government's prospective new taxes, is the extent to which recurrent outlays are to be paid for by borrowing or through asset sales. Ten per cent of the Government's recurrent outlays are to be paid for in this way. So what this Budget means is that we are going into debt to pay for totally unproductive consumption spending by the Commonwealth, with only the promise of higher taxes in the future as a JI.leans of repaying the debt. not surprising, therefore, to see that this Budget presides over a blow-out in gross Commonwealth public debt interest payments. Public debt interest will become the largest contributor to the real growth in Budget outlays between now and 1995-96. The Government has been arguing that the various measures of public sector debt and expenditure are relatively favourable compared with those that prevailed during the 1982-83 recession. Apart from· the essential irrelevance of what happened 10 years ago, these figures ignore the fact that public sector investment is much lower now than it was at that time, which is enabling the Government to get away with a smaller public sector borrowing requirement. Furthermore, the deterioration in the Commonwealth Budget outcome between June 1990 and June 1993 is expected to total some $21 billion. This is a turnaround that is more than double the size of the deterioration in the Commonwealth's finances during the 1982-83 recession, and it is 20 per cent larger than the 1982-83 turnaround relative to gross domestic product. Those figures provide a far more realistic assessment of the magnitude the budgetary blow-out than has occurred under this incompetent Government. The Government is also fond of regaling us with figures showing that Australia is one of the lowest taxing countriel\ in the OECD. This ploy simply ignores the fact that the OECD standard in this case is not a very high one. Most OECD countries have oversized public sectors. Some, such as Sweden, have some of the highest rates of taxation in the world. What the OECD comparisons ignore are some of the fast-growing economies in the Asia Pacific region, which are not members of the OECD and which have very low rates of taxation and very lean public sectors. If we want to make these sorts of comparisons, we should compare ourselves with the best in the world, and not with countries which have many of the same problems of oversized government as we have in Australia. What all these figures add up to is a government that cannot deliver on either its promised personal income tax cuts or its It is promise to return the Budget to surplus by 1995-96. At the very least, one must give way to the other, but it is more likely that neither could be realised, assuming the Government were in office long enough to give it a try. The Government is in the position of making promises it manifestly cannot keep. The money simply is not there without higher taxes, much higher than the Government has been prepared to concede to date. The best the Government can come up with is totally unfunded consumption expenditure aimed at the few months before the next election, with absolutely no regard for the consequences that will stem from rising Commonwealth and public sector debt levels. If the Opposition put forward such a program instead of the Fightback package, we would have been rightly crucified for it. All these budgetary problems are being pushed out until after the next election, when it will undoubtedly be left to the coalition to pick up the pieces. The Government is throwing money at a host of dubious projects that create short term jobs at taxpayers' expense, but longer term unemployment as we find ourselves struggling of to cope with the public sector debt that this Government is foisting on us. The Government simply has no concept of acting responsibly in times of economic crisis. It is obsessed with winning the next election, and anything that it thinks will help it towards that goal is worth a try, as far as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is concerned. It has not even occurred to the Government to try cutting business costs to elicit more productive investment from the private sector. If the Government really wanted to bring forward economic recovery and job growth associated with it, there are a host of responpolicy, sible measures that it could take to achieve those two worthy objectives. It could begin by abolishing a whole raft of taxes on business and consumers alike, such as the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise, along with the training guarantee levy and the superannuation guarantee levy. Reducing the overall tax burden, particularly the high incidence of personal income tax, would be an excellent way to get the economy moving again. The compliance and collection costs of the taxation system and the waste generated through the administration of government programs can be short circuited by allowing taxpayers to retain and spend their hard earned dollars directly in the way that suits them best. The Government could continue to phase out tariff protection and other non-tariff barriers to trade so that Australians could access imports at world prices. An accelerated privatisation program would enable the Government to use the proceeds from asset sales to retrench public sector debt and thereby reduce the debt servicing burden plaguing the Federal Budget. Instead of this approach, which the coalition will be taking on assuming office, the Government will spend some $3.4 billion over the next two years to create a miserable 27,000 jobs. This pales into insignificance alongside the two million jobs that can be created by Fightback while we rein in government spending at same time. Matters are not helped by the fact that the Government is increasingly hamstrung in its budgetary policy by the accord process with the ACTO. In order to secure wage restraiilt from the ACTO, the Government has found it necessary to offset lower real wages with budgetary concessions which have greatly reduced the flexibility of fiscal policy. This has been one of the causes of the GovernI ment's excessive reliance upon monetary policy to achieve its objectives, a reliance which will only increase with this Budget. One of the many failures of the accord process has been the fact that whereas accordsponsored wage restraint was meant to lessen the Government's reliance on monetary the impact of accord deals on fiscal policy has meant that this Government has been more reliant on changes in monetary policy settings than just about any other government in living memory. It is difficult to conceive of a Budget more irresponsible than this one. The Budget is the exact opposite of what is needed at this point in time. The Government has opted for what it considers to be the tried and true solution to electoral difficulty. The Government is to continue to try to spend its way out of trouble. It is a thoroughly discreditable political ploy, but one which the Government is prepared to try anyway. From an economic point of view, however, the Government is just trying to buy our way into more and deeper trouble.",10
3,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (10.27 a.m.)-It is with a great sense of pride that I join this debate because Supply Bill (No.3), Supply Bill (No.4) and the Loan Bill are a great example of what is different between the Opposition and the Government. In these Supply Bills the Government is seeking funds to implement new programs to further address the adverse effects arising from the current economic recession. It is not that these programs have not been funded through the Budget; they have. It is simply that we care about real· people with real problems. If we left these programs to be funded totally through the normal Budget Appropriation Bills, we would have to wait until December to help the people out there who have been hurting because of the recession. I can imagine how the dreary procession of depressing and negative speeches, such as the one we have just heard, will come from the other side over the next 12 months, telling us over and over again how we should not be spending our way out of this recession. The inference, of course, is that we should not be helping the multitude of taxpaying Australians and their families who need our help during these hard times. If I hear another speaker opposite talk about this being Paul Keating's recession I will be sick. If it is Keating's recession, he must rival Gandalf the Wizard for his ability to be in many places at the same time. Many countries are suffering from this recession. Is Paul Keating that powerful? I know the Opposition would like the Australian public to believe so, but somehow I do not think the Australian public is quite that gullible. Yes, we are spending our way out of this recession and we are proud of it. These Supply Bills will enable us to start spending as quickly as possible on programs that will help those Australians who are most disadvantaged. We will not have to wait until the end of the year to help them. If we see someone in need we do not feed their particulars into a cold computer model to see whether they are expendable or to see whether they are lucky enough to be helped. In the Labor Party we are old-fashioned; if people need help, we help them. On the contrary, those on the other side only feign help. They talk in macro terms. They talk always of the big picture. They talk about their mighty new god called Fightback, but Fightback shows no mercy. He would have suited well the lofty heights of Mount Olympus, or have been comfortable in the halls of Valhalla looking down on mere mortals with derision, arrogant in the knowledge that Fightback was all wise, all seeing and all knowing, and that the people who inhabited the earth below were his playthings, things to be experimented with. For Fightback is an experiment, let there be no doubt about that. There is no guaranteed outcome. It could create chaos. It could make Australia a better place, but at what cost? No-one really knows. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is asking us to take one big gamble. I do not mind a gamble myself, but this is one bet I would not take. And as the form guide becomes more clearto Joe and Jane Public, I do not think they will be willing to take a punt either. The opinion polls over the last few days are already showin& that fact. But even though there are no guaranteed outcomes in regard to Fightback, we can get some indication as to how things might be. These two Supply Bills are good examples. Paul They are designed to fund programs to help people who are disadvantaged by the recession, and to help people as q)lickly as possible. That sounds a noble motive, but do honourable members think that those opposite will be applauding our swift call to arms to try to get these programs up and running as quickly as possible? I doubt it very much. As usual, those opposite will be negative. Their speeches will paint gloomy pictures of a country with no hope unless we put a 15 per cent tax on food and clothing, which are currently untaxed. Then for some reason, a reason that totally escapes me, everything will get better. It is a wonder that Fightback does not have another chapter about the fairies down at the end of the garden. In Supply Bill (No.3) the Government is seeking interim appropriations of some $65m, while Supply Bill (No.4) is seeking interim appropriations of some $ 105m to last until 30 November, when it is anticipated that the Budget Appropriation Bills will be finally enacted. Naturally, this is after being constantly verballed by the doom merchants opposite. This $170m package has a specific purpose of creating jobs with the shortest possible lead-up time. But those opposite would rather not have those jobs. According to them, one does not spend one's way out of recession; one cuts and slashes. There was a good cartoon in one of the papers recently that depicted an emaciated Australia lying on an operating table with the Leader of the Opposition, gloved up ready for surgery, looking at his new patient. The other doctors, the interns-they might have been his shadow ministry-were looking up at their spiritual leader with a look of eager hope in their eyes. The good doctor finally had his chance to operate on poor old Australia,his long sought after patient. I think the implication was that he was already the Prime Minister by this stage. Poor old Australia was there wasting away to nothing, panting its last gasps on the Leader of the Opposition's operating table. 'What is the cure?', chanted those who followed him blindly; 'How will we fix this country?'. The good doctor's solution to this pathetic image of Australia, looking like one of those awful Bangladesh magazine photos of a starving child, was, 'It's obvious. This patient needs a crash diet'. This is what Australia will be getting from Dr Hewson: a crash diet. A patient comes into a hospital and says, 'Doctor, I think I have anorexia nervosa'. 'Good', says the doctor, 'Stop eating. That will fix you up'. The whole point of this year's Budget, these Supply Bills and the Appropriation Bills-the whole kit and caboodle-is to nurse Australia back to health. We have looked down at the same patient on the operating table and sensibly inserted a drip in the patient's ann. It is a drip that will feed money back into economy; a drip that will lessen the feeling despair that envelops too many Australians; a drip that will boost consumer spending which, in turn, will lead to an increase in business confidence. In the long run, this lead to more Australians getting back to work, something that everyone on this side of the House is working towards. One wonders whether those opposite really want people to get back into employment as quickly as possible. It does not make much sense, I know, but if this had been their Budget there would be no Supply Bills such as these. The Leader of the Opposition and the blind mice that follow him would have allowed no job creation programs. In Supply Bill (No.3) the Government is seeking $50m for labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry. I know from personal experience how these programs can help people. We on this side do not lose sight of the faces of human beings behind the figures that are fed into the Leader of the Opposition's hungry computer. In my electorate a mineral sands operation, run by a company called Consolidated Rutile Ltd, has been laying off workers since the beginning of the year due to weak world markets. I know those opposite would love to blame the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for this also, but even Gandalf the Wizard has no influence over the laws of supply and demand. This would have happened, recession or no recession. The mining operation is in a very special location in my electorate, a place called North Stradbroke Island, quite a beautiful place, largely unspoiled and unbridged to the mainland. Apart from being a holiday retreat for envious Brisbanites at various times throughout the year, it is also a home for a small number of families who were born on the island and who largely rely on jobs from Consolidated Rutile Ltd for their livelihood. Some of these families were shattered when the breadwinner in the family was made redundant as the plants began to shut down. On behalf of these families, I made representations to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), the a Minister with a sharp mind and a fairly of compassionate heart. As a result, Stradbroke Island was declared a region of employment disadvantage under the Office of Labour Market Adjustment. This meant that will Stradbroke Island unemployed people were given increased access to government labour market programs. We are not talking about a great deal of money or a great number of unemployed. Last month the Federal Government Department of Employment, Education and Training approved a $110,000 package to create jobs for 10 people on Stradbroke Island under the job skills program. To me, 10 people are not a cold statistic; they are 10 human faces with 10 families who have fallen on hard times through no fault of their own. It makes me feel good that this Government can help them-help them keep their families intact and help them stay on the island that has been their generational home. Under coalition policies, the Leader of the Opposition would put the knife to a lot of these job creation programs. He has to if he is going to save the amount of money he is talking about. He says that we cannot afford it. What he means is that people such as those on Stradbroke Island cannot afford it. The 'we' is not inclusive. How does he know this? Because his computer model tells him so. This Government has introduced many great labour market programs over the years. These two Supply Bills are designed to make sure that the funds for these programs are on hand for those in need. I have seen with my own eyes how unemployed people change, gain dignity and develop self-esteem after doing Skillshare courses. I have two Skillshares in my electorateWynnum Skillshare and Redland Skillshare. Recently I had the pleasure of representing the Prime Minister at the Queensland Skillshare awards and handing out the top State awards. Many of the graduates I spoke to waxed lyrical about the programs. If one tried to tell them that their training courses were a waste of time, a constant allusion by the Opposition, one would probably get a punch in the nose, and deserve it. The best part of that night at Brisbane Hall was that Wynnum Skillshare won the top graduate award for the second year running. People in my electorate were, as I was, very excited and very proud. To put it on the record because she deserves it, the top Queensland Skillshare graduate for the year is a mother by the name of Kerry MCKey who lives in Wynnum West in my electorate. Kerry is a wonderful person who, even with a hearing impairment, was able to obtain work within two weeks of completing her course in clerical and computing skills. What would the Opposition do? It would denigrate her achievements by mouthing its constant gloomy platitudes about these training courses being a waste of time. Maybe Skillshare should organise a few courses for those opposite on the power of positive thinking. For some, it would have all the appeal of making their first visit to the Betty Ford Clinic. Their negativeness has become an addiction. Thank the Lord that not all people of conservative politics are so negative. Recent- community. ly, again in my electorate, the Redland local employment network was established. This was not a point scoring push from either side of the political fence, but a genuine example of a community coming together to work collectively and positively towards solving a problem-the problem of unemployment. The objectives of the Redland local employment network are to increase employment and training opportunities in the Redland Shire by maximising the outcomes achieved through linking government, industry, and community resources to meet real business needs. Already the management committee has had two monthly meetings, which I have attended, where the enthusiasm can be felt in the air. All sections of the community are represented. There are people on the committee such as Eric Shaw and Harry Houston of the Capalaba Lions Club; Albert Benfer from Golden Cockerel Chickens; Peter Matthews from Ingham Chickens; Victoria Martin, President of the Bay Islands Chamber bf Commerce; Graham Martin of the Queensland Small Business Corporation; Don Lonie from Mad Barry's and Rotary; Greg Watson, the chairman of the management committee, from City Regional Publishers of Queensland; Brian Hurst, editor of the Redland lImes and Bayside Bulletin; Robyn Murphy of the Redland Chamber of Commerce; Gaye Withanage and Margaret MCFerran of the Cleveland CES; Billy Cupples, Aldo Raineri, Greg Harper and Janette Elson of the Bayside Community College; Len Keogh and Rosemary Skelly from the Redland Shire Council; two very good friends of mine, Jim Elder and Darryl Briskey, who are two hard working State members of parliament and who will be re-elected with massive majorities in a couple of weeks time; and, last but not least, Mr Roger Cooper of white goods manufacturer Fisher and Paykel. I must specifically thank John Perry, Alison Stanley and Jeff Green of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, who have been instrumental in the establishment of the Redland local employment network. They have worked untiringly on this and many other projects, and have gained respect and support across all levels of the This is an exercise by the community for the community, made possible through the use of funds that will be made available via the enacting of these two Supply Bills. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if you went through these people name by name you would find that most of them are certainly not people who would vote for me. So this is not a political point scoring exercise. We are trying to do something to help people. For the immigration, local government and ethic affairs portfolio, Supply Bill (No.4) has $68m for grants to local councils for social and economic infrastructure and $2m for grants to local government associations to assist the development of local economic activity. These initiatives will create jobsjobs that some members opposite obviously do not want, judging by the way they moaried and groaned when this initiative was announced by my good friend the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons). The Bill has allocated $25m for the Treasury portfolio as general purpose capital assistance to the States and Territories to facilitate works under the very popular building better cities program. It is popular with everyone except those opposite. Anything that improves Australia's current economic situation appears to be unpopular with the good members opposite. Those opposite are more intent on knocking successful training schemes on the head and pulling the trapdoor on people after nine months on the dole. To Opposition members, bad news is good news. Every time we get a good indicator, they wince; every time we get a bad economic indicator, they cheer. But an election cannot be won by trading on negatives alone. The Opposition is treating the people of Australia like dumb cattle but, unfortunately for those opposite, the herd is starting to get nervous. Those opposite are driven by pure self-interest, there is no doubt about that. In Monday's Australian the Leader of the Opposition said that he is not concerned at all about any electoral backlash in regard to the current hard line policies he is pushing. He forgets that an electoral backlash translates in real tenus to people, people that he would hurt and is willing to sacrifice in pursuit of his own agenda. Some of the Government's spending on labour market programs goes to group training schemes. I have a lot of time for group training schemes. They can create an apprenticeship position on a full time basis by acting as a broker for one, two or three employers. They do not offer only training, they offer employment, and they are doing a tremendous job right around the country. I have met with several managers of group training schemes within south-eastern Queensland, and my office has regular contact with Mr Tom Quinn, the President of Group Training Australia. Currently, I am having dealings with the Queensland housing and construction group training scheme, which is based at Acacia Ridge in Brisbane. As most honourable members will know, group schemes are jointly funded by federal and State moneys and the majority of these schemes work towards the day when they become selfsufficient. The success of the Queensland housing and construction group training scheme is due entirely to its conducting live work exercises, particularly through a joint venture with the State Department of Housing and Local Government, which has generously provided a unique facility which allows an unusual emphasis on developing hands-on skills. In short, this means that apprentices in this scheme help build houses. How much more practical can you get? The most significant achievement of the Queensland housing and construction group training scheme, as proudly stated by its manager, Don Row, is that practically all the scheme apprentices are finding suitable employment on completion of their indentures, many with their former host employers. What will the spending cuts proposed by the Leader of the Opposition do to a successful group scheme such as this? What will happen to the 189 apprentice carpenters, the 12 apprentice bricklayers, the three apprentice tilers and the two apprentice gyprock fixers, who are currently employed through the Queensland housing and construction group training scheme? This is an example of the productive government spending hitting its target. The only target the Leader of the Opposition has set is to tell-not even ask-all Australians to tighten their belts if he wins. The people who will be tightening their belts are those who are already down to their last notch, those who can least afford being slugged with extra charges, such as getting the plumber to fix the drain or the local handyman to fix the stairs, both of which would cost an extra 15 per cent in tax that was not there before. That is not even counting milk, bread, butter, meat, shirts, blouses and other clothing that were all free from sales tax before the Leader of the Opposition's vision of a computer model society became a reality. A little old lady came up to me at a fete the other day and said, 'Me Sciacca, your Government is very unpopular. My husband and I were going to vote against Labor for the first time in years, but now we are not so sure. Maybe it is better to have the devil you know'. That is what it comes down to. We have made mistakes over the years-it is impossible not to-but in the end to a lot of people we are like a warm though somewhat tattered glove. It feels snug, it is comfortable; they know where the holes are, they know where the fingers may get a bit chilly; they know what to expect and, what is more, they know that a glove can be mended. What will Dr Hewson's glove look like? Before modem film technology, there was a strict adage adhered to when making monster films: never actually show the monster. Let the audience see the shadow, perhaps a claw or maybe a bit of slime left on the floor, but never let them see the monster. The reason was that an individual person's imagination is far more fertile and can imagine far more grotesque images than could ever be achieved by showing a studio model in the first five minutes of the film. For the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite their campaign to win the 1993 election is like one of those old monster films. People are not being given the full details. They are becoming aware of them and their imaginations are becoming stimulated. They are seeing only traces of slime and those traces of slime frighten them as to what the real face of this GST monster called Fightback might look like if it is ever allowed to be brought to life. They see images of cold shearers huddled in tents outside Parliament House while over 100,000 New Zealanders vote with their feet, get out of that GST strafed country and take jobs in Australia under the protection of the trans-Tasman agreement and the closer economic relationship. They see top business people concerned about the Leader of the Opposition's rabid attacks on tariffs with little thought for the industrial wasteland his policies may leave in their wake. They see family friends unemployed through no fault of their ownknocked off social security support after nine months. They see the possibility of industrial relations chaos and mass strikes. Of course, our very good friend the honourable member for Farrer (Me Tim Fischer) travels the country telling anyone who will listen that everything is going to be all right, that this creation of the Leader of the Opposition called Fightback is not really a monster. How does he know this? He knows this because petJ;ol will be cheaper. One can ask any service station owners in Australia-most of whom are on the breadline now-whether they envisage snaring any of the profits that the abolition of the fuel excise will create. Too right they do! Only someone who does not understand business would think that all the savings would be passed on to the customer. (TIme expired)",14
4,Mr MCGAURAN,Unknown,"I am very glad to make a contribution to this debate on the Supply Bill (No.3), Supply Bill (No.4) and the Loan Bill. I am particularly glad that a number of students, some 53 in all, from St Annes and Gippsland Grammar School from the City of Sale in my electorate are present in the gallery this morning. It is a very good school and I happen to know that these are particularly good students of that school. After those introductory remarks I would like to confine my comments to the scientific and technological features of the Bills. In themselves these are issues of great significance for the future competitiveness of the national economy. The community well appreciates the great task that lies before us of rebuilding the economy. This task involves reforming a vast array of traditional practices, of overcoming entrenched structural obstacles and exorcising an array of government driven disincentives which have historically blocked Australia's opportunity to create a genuinely competitive international economy. In the setting of this framework of change, science and technology plays an important role. The capacity of the Australian economy to draw on knowledge based processes and products is central to the task of reform. central not just as a means of winning unexpected breakthroughs in marketable products-probably too much is made of thisbut through developing a business culture which is bent on upgrading constantly its technical base and stimulating company practices which are committed to continued improvements. This is an underestimated process crucial to any aspirations we have of achieving global competitiveness, and it is often overlooked as a consequence of R&D spending. But we are a long way from pulling this off, from making any marked gains on this front. Let me give an indication of just where matters stand at present. On the basis of prerecession figures, Australian business expenditure on R&D is still about half of the OECD average, and we have been lapped a few times by the top eight R&D performing countries. If the business sector talks amongst itself about these matters, we can well realise what shape the current figures are in. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics survey for 1990-91 signals a 3 per cent fall in private sector investment in R&D. According to the ABS, we are the second lowest of the larger Western economies in regard to business investment in R&D as a share of output. On top of this, the number of business enterprises conducting R&D has fallen by around 13 per cent, as have the human resources devoted to research and development activities. In the late 1980s there were improvements, as there were in other small OECD states with traditionally low levels of investment in research and development. There has also been a good deal of reshuffling of definitions of R&D activities for statistical and other reasons. But Australia is well off the international pace regardless of how the figures are twisted and contorted. Those honourable members familiar with the R&D' activities of the manufacturing sector would grasp just how gloomy the news really is. In all but one of the 17 major manufacturing industries in this country we have failed to reach OECD average levels of investment. In 11 of these, R&D intensities have fallen off in recent years. Similarly, the It is take-up of advanced technology in manufacturing is at a low ebb. Reports to the Prime Minister's Science Council confirmed that Australia's manufacturing technologies are relatively basic and that even local investment in machine tools was 15 to 18 per cent that of regional countries as well as the OECD states. But enough of the figures. Suffice it to say that this trend cannot continue its unsustainable path for the Australian economy. As a nation we cannot afford any longer to have a media circus celebrating the technological hype and forgetting market realities. Some simple cOnlmonsense is called for. If commercialisation strategies are to be discussed, then they have to be locked into an analysis of what kind of across-economy settings are most advantageous to their success. We have to heed the type of economic environment which fires successful companies, drives innovative managerial practic-s and creates the effective manufacturing, supply and marketing networks which surround them. We need to face up to the types and quality of interaction between the public research sector and the private research sector, which are needed as well. The debate and commentaries about science and technology policy are getting to be a bit like a soap opera. There is a belief that Australia has just about got the technology right, but that business has lost the plot. It is a regrettable assumption which predominates in public debate. The fact of the matter is that this country does not possess an integrated technological and industrial base. Similarly, it has not moved to integrate its skills development patterns with its industrial needs. It is the odd nation out in the OECD in this regard, and this is a telling observation on our international competitiveness. I cannot emphasise enough the need for the business sector to weigh into the debate about how best to utilise the available technological resources. It has a heavy responsibility to get its point across about what needs to be done with the existing research resources and infrastructure base. There are grave problems. The university sector has about half the level of industry related research activity as is the OECD average; 2.6 per - nt of research funds come from industry against a 5 per cent average for the OECD. This is despite the frequent boast that we possess amongst the best educational infrastructure and training in the world. As I said earlier, research and technology acquisition have a vital role in building on mature production processes, sponsoring a culture of continued improvement across companies, and breaking into areas of new product design and development. But the bulk of the spending which takes place in respect of these roles is in the private sector itself. such, they are extremely sensitive to cost and supply factors which soak up profits and choke investment. The Bureau of Industry Economics surveys demonstrate this. It is common sense to the private sector, but it is absent from the public debate about commercialisation strategies. Given the structural characteristics of Australia's economic history, we do not have a long experience in the role of high technology applications in business strategies, production planning or marketing. Some points are obvious enough. Increased rates of technology transfer will not be significantly altered until overall economic conditions are conducive to promoting conventional, competitively driven sources of change. Companies do not work on the basis of goodwill, to state the obvious. They need to have confidence in their economic position in both the short term and the long term and they need to have confidence in technology and how it is packaged and geared to the market. We should not expect the capital markets. to move a centimetre towards high technology stocks until they see this process in train. It should be understood that the creation of intellectual property in itself is a vastly less expensive process than is its further product development and marketing stages. These latter,.stages of research and development are therefore directly influenced by: concerns arising from the cost and availability of capital; rates of capital stock replacement within the manufacturing sector which determine the capacity of companies to swing into new processes; cash flow; company size and managerial expertise; input costs in production processes; barriers to entry to markets; and the relative efficiencies of supply and transport networks. In this wider context it should be possible to identify those areas in which action is needed and by whom. My point is that commercialisation, in larke measure, is part and parcel of a wider economic and industry debate. It is also important to notice in all of this that it is obvious that the issue of communication and dialogue is critical to developing any practical or genuine national effort in respect As of capitalising on opportunities. Research, developmental and marketing efforts must be organically linked processes. There is no substitute for dovetailing research at the project stage with company capabilities and needs and international market intelligence. Given the depth of international technology reservoirs and the speed at which market opportunities open and close, as well as the extent of the existing technological gap, if you like, between ourselves and our trading rivals, there can be no other effective means of building a competitive technological capability than this. . If we look at countries which are serious as to their technological base, we will see a high level of interaction between business and researchers. We will also see greater understanding as to how resources are allocated across the totality of that effort. No doubt industry and the research community will both need to tilt their perspective or give some ground if this level of organisation is to be achieved. But I think the days of allowing sectors of our technological and research activities to run too far ahead of our business priorities have come to a close. We do not have a great deal of understanding of the nature of the interface between technology and established industries. So debates about science and technology policy often turn out to be a string of homilies. But this belies the seriousness of the problems we have on our hands and the scope of the change we must pursue. For example, we have got a real problem on our hands with the smaller company base in the economy which is geared to high volume, low technology, domestic sales strategies. That is an area in which, in the current circumstances, there is not even a murmur of substantive interest in technological applications. It is in this area that new opportunities, for example, for interaction with the public research base should be provided. The smaller, dispersed manufacturing belt in this country needs to reorganise itself around research and development facilities, and it needs to be put in a competitive position to want to make use of those resources. If it is to make use of those resources it must be able to do so in circumstances in which it is confident its priorities will drive its investments. The ultimate goal of government policy, the final policy settings, must be to aggressively create a new environment in which Australian businesses can build a serious commitment to research and development. We are going to have to claw our way into the game. There is a long way to go and some innovative thinking is desperately needed. It is in this regard that I bring to the tion of the House the attack on the coalition's consultation process with the science, technology, business and industry groups. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) last week seized on one dated set of the Federal Opposition's working documents which were being discussed with the science constituency. What did he do with them? He manufactured a puerile scare campaign which has even drawn the criticism of the largest representative professional body of the scientific and technological communities, FASTS, whose membership now comprises some 70,000 active researchers, academics and scientific administrators across Australia. This is what FASTS had to say about the scare campaign which the Minister for Science and Technology tried to whip up: The scientific and technological community is working closely with the Coalition on their policies. FASTS Board at its meeting in June, in· fact, considered the papers which have now been leaked. The Minister for Science and Technology, Ross Free does his cause great hann by suggesting the scientific and technological community is being hoodwinked by the Coalition. We do not need him to tell us what is going on in the Coalition. Particularly when he only finds out three months after we do. The nickname ""agenda-Free"" which, frankly, I have to claim credit foris perhaps unfortunate but it would have less currency if we had some constructive ideas from the Government rather than misinformation about what the Coalition will or will not do. ""We strongly support the Coalition's direction for research which will massively improve private sector investment while maintaining the integrity of the public sector. We do not believe that the Coalition will dismantle the CSIRO if they win the next election; It is scaremongering of the Minister to suggest that it would. The Minister has also tried to whip up a bit of hysteria about ideas the coalition is seeking formal advice on regarding Australia's marine science effort. He is telling the people of Townsville that we will close down and dismantle the Australian Institute of Marine Science, AIMS, and rip funds out of the marine science base. As the scientific community well knows, attenthat is another embarrassing and utterly misrepresentative accusation by the Minister. The coalition is actively working with the research commw,lity on developing new ways to better utilise Australia's marine science resources based in Townsville. It may well be the case that the retention of AIMS is the best outcome for marine science but that will depend on the advice of those active in the field-those in the relevant marine science research and industry groups with whom the coalition is conferring, regularly and systematically. But there are other recommendations. Some suggest that, with two bodies of marine science research expertise sitting alongside one another in Townsville, there is scope for an ambitious initiative-an initiative which would create an integrated, internationally competitive marine science research with a natiQnal charter operating through James Cook University. This is an idea that the coalition wants to test. It is not a policy setting, but it is an option that needs to pursued and investigated, not for political purposes but in the expectation that it could yield a real national benefit. Before the Minister for Science runs off cynically manipulating the community with countries, his pathetic scare campaigns, perhaps he and would like to take this option and' consider Indeed, I would like to extend to the Minister for Science an opportunity to work with the scientific community in the universities and the industry groups as I have. He should go and ask them to evaluate the option of creatthem ing an international-sized, competitive, intedemonstrated grated marine science research and teaching facility at Townsville, operating through national charter. He should ask James Cook University whether it has the resources and the enthusigiving asm to make something as prospective and exciting as this take place. The Minister, despite the departmental resources at his command, has never been able to generate an idea for the future, so I am throwing him from the coalition. This is the Minister's chance in his portfolio: a chance to investiries gate and evaluate a real policy option in honest and open way with the marine science community and industry and university too constituencies. The Minister has never dore this before. might feel a little apprehensive and a little sea but, if he chose to work with the constituremains ency which he is meant to represept, he might-as I do-find it a thoroughly rewardin ing experience. On this basis, I to reading of the Minister's announcement that he intends to investigate the prospects further development of Townsville's marine science base. I look forward to seeing him do this in an honest and open way. As I said, I have no wish to drag AustThese ralia's marine science community into worthless and unnecessary political debate, despite what the Minister has done of late. will happily work with him on this issue in the interests of the marine science community facility based at Townsville.",19
5,Mr LANGMORE,Unknown,"Fraser) (11.04 a.m.)This second reading debate on the Supply Bill (No.3) 1992-93 and cognate Bills gives us a be chance to have an overview of some aspects of economic policy. I want to use that chance to discuss the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is an influential coordinating body of the rich the Western industrialised countries, it has considerable influence over national it. economic policies. Every 15 months or so a report is prepared on each of the 24 member countries, including Australia. Those reports are taken seriously both here and in the other countries, so the ideas that are expressed in are important. Those ideas have been to be misjudged in a number of ways, in the, last two or three years particulara ly, and to show a lack of balance. Those are ,the themes I want to take up in my remarks. Before I begin that analysis, it is worth a little background on the organisation, because it may not be well known to everyone. It was founded in 1961. It now has 24 member countries, mostly in western Europe but also including Japan, the United States, one Canada, Australia and New Zealand. A big number of what used to be developing counthave so increased their per capita incomes an that their incomes are higher than those of some of the members of the OECD and they are considering applying for membership. I refer to countries such as the Republic of He Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. at Whether they will be admitted to membership to be seen, and they have not yet formally applied, but it does show a change the global economic situation since the look forward organisation was formed. The aims of the OECD are threefold: to for achieve the highest sustainable rate of economic growth while maintaining financial stability, to promote free trade, and to support development in poorer non-member countries. are three unexceptionable aims which a it has contributed towards achieving in a number of useful ways, but which it has not I achieved as well as could have been possible. It is those kinds of analyses that I want to tum to in a moment. I expect that the organisation's main value is through the way it becomes a centre for the distribution of ideas. Ministers from member countries attend ministerial meetings and committee meetings. We have an ambassador there, as do ,other member countries. There are a number of committees looking not only at economic policy but also at social, employment and development policies. There is a particularly useful development assistance committee that meets once a year, normally in December, and. which I attended two or three years ago. One of the tasks for which the OECD is best known is its economic forecasts. It publishes these forecasts every six months in the OECD Economic Outlook. The most recent was for June 1992. These forecasts are a valuable assessment of the economic prospects for the, next year or two of the industrialised Western countries. There has been some criticism of the accuracy of the forecasts. I think it is very difficult to be too trenchantly critic-l of any organisation for not getting its forecasts right, because it is an extremely complex and difficult task. The OECD's record for the area as a whole tends to be not too bad, but its record for particular countries is not quite as good. That is to be expected because it is not as directly or closely in touch with member countries as are the economic forecasting agencies in those countries. My central point concerns the somewhat critical comments about the OECD's stance during the 1980s. The OECD could be described as a group of economic rationalists. It is a term we now often hear used about the Australian Treasury, and I think the same sorts of orientation exist in the OECD. For example, an article in the Financial TImes some time ago talked about: . . . the dictates of those passionate free market economistsworking at the OECD; the name of the principal economist was mentionedwho ceaselessly preach a gospel of deregulation and Iiberalisation. The article in the Financial TImes went on: Time and again, the neo-classical OECD of the 1980s has emphasised the dangers of 'structural rigidities' and made a trenchant case for microeconomic reforms. How dispiriting 'it must be to discover that such policies have only limited relevance in the real world. Countries, such as the UK and US, which have deregulated with gusto, are in an economic mess. Those, such as Japan and West Germany, which have been wary of free market prescriptions, are doing brilliantly wei\. I think that is a point well taken. It is not to say that micro-economic reform is not important or relevant, but that the benefits of microeconomic reform are limited and we should keep those benefits in proper perspective. Some of the principal characteristics of the attitudes of the OECD could be expressed as including restrictiveness of public expenditure. It wants always to minimise public expenditure, regardless of the economic or social objectives for which that expenditure is takillg place. It tends to have a greater concern about inflation than unemployment. That is particularly evident at present and I will come back to this point in a few moments. It neglects the goal of equity. It seems to be entirely preoccupied with goals of efficiency, but goals of equity are also important. If one looks at the Economic Outlook one does not see any tables assessing equity or inequity in various countries. It is not an issue which is a central concern of the Organisation. There is a pervasive confidence in the efficiency of markets. The OECD frequently advocates deregulation, privatisation, corporatisation and so on, regardless of whether that is really the appropriate course of action to take, whether market failure is embedded in the area it is talking about and whether deregulation would simply lead to increased market failure and loss of efficiency rather than improvements in efficiency. Deregulation does not always lead to improvements in efficiency by any means. The OECD tends to be quite sceptical of centralised wage fixing systems and argues against them. It favours the deregulation of labour markets. It has been pretty scepticalalthough I must say not entirely-of incomes policy. A stream of thought amongst a minority of staff in the OECD has recognised the benefits of incomes policy. Of course, the Australian' experience increases the attention that is given to incomes policy in the OECD because it has been so successful here. Nevertheless, the broad orientation of the Organisation has been scepticism of centralised wage fixing systems. It is generally opposed to government intervention in most ways in the economy. It is also sceptical of medium term growth strategies. An article in the Economist from a couple of years ago said: The OECD has followed the fashions of academic economics and of conservative policymaldng and switched its attention to the supply side of the economy. In its various appraisals it typically urges governments to look for micro-economic measures to make markets work better. Two of its favourite themes are reduction of the role of government in the economy and the elimination of what it calls labour market rigidities, regardless of whether those rigidities are contributing to achieving the goals of income restraint which are so important in reducing inflation and unemployment. A good example of the policies of the Organisation is contained in its report on Australia. Its report on Australia is really very disappointing because it emphasises policies which have been used overseas and, as I have said already, have caused such problems in Britain and the United States, regardless of whether that fits the institutional structure or the state of the Australian economy. An excellent article by Tim Colebatch from the Age commented on this report on Australia. It said: Like Federal Treasury, the OECD was once a broad church, but its economic perspective has narrowed markedly over the 1980s. Its mission now is to spread the orthodoxy of the textbooks: move to free markets as quickly as possible, minimise government ownership and regulation, keep monetary policy and fiscal policy tight, and decentralise bargaining . . . its policy recommendations differ little from those advanced by the Federal Opposition in its Fightback package. So the OECD does, in effect, take a rather political stance although it would deny it is doing that. Colebatch concludes his article by saying: Seeing its patients' condition worsening, you might think the OECD would be reviewing its treatment. Instead, it is telling both countries to increase the dosage. We deserve better. That is certainly true. 'Bqth countries' refers to Australia and New Zealand; he also discusses the OECD report on New Zealand. That is not to say that there is nothing of benefit in the report. A number of recommendations are of benefit. For example, it talks about the need to increase education spending and spending on training and research and development. It talks about the benefits that would have for economic growth in Australia. That is absolutely right. I am glad to say that the Government is increasing its spending on education, training and research and development in this Budget, but that process needs to go considerably further if we are going to have a skilled work force and the innovation that is required to make Australia as creative and competitive as we can be. In conclusion, many of the emphases of the OECD at present are overstated. Its preoccupation with the free market and its neglect of market failure are weaknesses, as· is .its lack of balance in achieving the goals of efficiency and equity. It is preoccupied with efficiency. That does matter; that is very important; but it needs to be balanced with a concern for equity. Reducing inflation is important; it does matter. Of course, countries would perform better with lower inflation rates. But that has to be balanced with a concern for unemployment. The central concern of the OECD at present ought to be unemployment. Not only in this country but also throughout most of the OECD area-not, I am glad to say, in every country; Japan, Sweden and the Netherlands have lower unemployment, as countries which have an effective balance between the public and private sectors-and in many countries wage which are regarded by OECD economists as having adopted the policies that they would recommend, such as Britain and the United States, unemployment is high and is rising rapidly. So the OECD's central preoccupation at present should be unemployment. It should be putting a much more creative effort into the development of fresh policies which it could recommend in relation to unemployment. It does not do so in its report on Australia, for example, to nearly the extent that it should have done. If it does that we will all be better off. One interesting piece of research that it has generated shows that if the government of any member country increases its spending by $1, output will rise by $1.50 at home and by almost the same amount abroad, so that total OECD output expands by almost $3. An extra dollar here generates a total increase in output here and in other member countries totalling $3. The article in the Economist continues: In other words, if all countries reflate together, the increase in activity may be far greater than each had bargained for. Surely that indicates the kind of strategy that the OECD should be recommending at present. Throughout the area unemployment is very high and in some cases disastrously high. If all member countries combined to rellate together, that unemployment problem would be significantly reduced. I am not saying it can be resolved simply by rellating, but that is the first and principal requirement to easing unemployment. That is what they should be concentrating on now.",23
6,Mr ALDRED,Unknown,"The first and possibly the last Budget brought down by the Treasurer and honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), of which these Supply Bills are an integral part, is characterised by a deficit of $13.4 billion after asset sales of $1.6 billion. Direct funding is provided. to local councils for job creation. The Government has thereby endeavoured to create a fiscal stimulus for the economy that will llow through rapidly for job creation projects. In doing so, the Government has predicted a modest growth rate of 3 per cent in GOP over the next 12 months. Even so, unemployment is estimated to average 10.5 per cent, compared to an average of 10.4 per cent for 1991-92. Surely any industrial development strategy to benefit the people of Australia should aim at lower unemployment, and decisions that preserve present jobs, as well as encouraging new enterprises, should be sought. This is particularly necessary if recent figures published in the Melbourne Herald-Sun of 25 August 1992 are taken into consideration. The figures, based on the supplementary Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released ron 24 August, found that 1,971,800 ,peoplethat is, 21.2 per cent of the work force aged 15 to 69-were unemployed and looking for work at some time in the year leading up to March of this year. The President of the Australian Council of Social Service, Merle Mitchell, commented that the figures were 'closer to the real picture' and that the Council hoped the Government's Budget initiatives would help , turn the comer. There is the rub, Mr Deputy Speaker. How do temporary job creation schemes organised by local councils for a year or two solve the intrinsic economic problems facing Australia? The solution to our chronic economic malaise clearly lies in the creation of real jobs in industry, which requires a determined affmnation of faith and action in the three main productive sectors of manufacturing, farming and mining. Not only do these three key industry sectors directly employ over one-fifth of the work force, but their buoyancy, or lack of it, heavily affects the level of activity and thus employment in the various services sectors. The naive notion presently abroad that Australia's future can be built on services alone while our manufacturing industry is left to fade away is an economic nonsense-a nonsense made obvious when attention is focused on how Australia's exports pay its way in the world. During 1990-91 mining and mineral processing contributed 37 per cent of exports; manufactures, 22 per cent; and agriculture, 21 per cent; while all services accounted for only 20 per cent. Moreover, total manufactured exports grew at an average annual rate of 10 per cent over the three years to 1991, with exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, such as motor vehicles, fabricated metal products and machinery and equipment, increasing by 20 to 30 per cent. I will now deal with the difficulties of preserving our manufacturing industries at the present time. Firstly, let me point out that, although the relative significance of manufacturing to our economy has decreased in the years following World War II, when encouraging manufacturing was a deliberate government policy, it is still a significant part of the Australian economy. It accounts for 17 per cent of GDP, which is well in excess of the combined output of agriculture and mining, which together account for 12 per cent. Very importantly at this time of crisis unemployment levels, manufacturing also remains .a significant employer of labour, employing 15 per cent of Australia's labour force. Among the Australian Bureau of Statistics sectors of the economy, only wholesale and retail trade and community services employ more Australians than manufacturing. Dr Michael Deeley, former Managing Director of ICI Australia Pty Ltd, summed the situation up very simply in a paper given to the Deakin Breakfast Club in my electorate on 23 April this year, when he said: Manufacturing represents about a sixth of our economy. If we no longer produce manufactured goods, we are going to have to buy those goods from other countries and find jobs for people who no longer produce those goods. Dr Deeley agreed with the economic rationalists that our industry must achieve international competitiveness, but differed on the means of achieving it. Dr Deeley is joined in this opinion by an increasing number of people in academia, industry, business, government and the community who are questioning the sterile economic rationalist line perpetrated over the past decade. The incredible disasters that followed Labor's ineptly implemented financial deregulation are the most classic illustrations of the discrediting of this body of thought. Not even economic rationalists are admitting to being economic rationalists any longer,  New South Wales, in a letter to the Australian Financial Review of 24 June this year. Mr Apps, while researching for his book on what he calls 'policy stuff-ups of the 1980s', failed to find any economic rationalists in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury, the Finance Department or the Industry Commission. Apparently all have disappeared, but there are instead creatures answering to the name of 'pragmatic promarket economists' - according to Mr Apps, the same bird, a different name. Increasingly the argument is being mounted that we in Australia must have some form of protection for our industry if we are to survive as a nation, and the \lrotective measures need to be put into action very quickly. Closely linked to unemployment as our major problem, arguments continue to proliferate around interventionist versus free market industry policy. Perhaps the picture of industry in Australia is put more clearly in a chief executive briefing from the Metal Trades Industry Association: For industry managements, working as never before to raise the level of their competitiveness, orders are harder to come by as costs go up and tariffs go down. Later on, referring to members of the MTIA National Executive, who are themselves active managers of large and small businesses, the editor writes: Above all, their objective will be not the ascendancy of one particular economic theory over another, but to arrive at a common sense middle way which will produce the kind of business environment Australia needs in a rapidly changing, highly volatile and shrinking world. Where do we go from here to encourage our steadily diminishing manufacturing base? Certainly we cannot afford as a nation to go back to the days of heavy protection of all industry. Our industries must be competitive in world terms. The shake-out of the mid1980s was, to a degree, necessary. However, there must be a balance. It would appear that Australia is one of the few countries in the world, if not the only one, pursuing policies to achieve what some here call a level playing field, to the detriment of its industry base, particularly in the southern manufacturing cities of Melbourne and Adelaide. I am reminded of a brilliant cartoon by Nicholson in the Melbourne Age of 10 August this year. The cartoon appeared on the day of the 150th birthday celebration of the City of Melbourne, symbolically during this year's particularly bleak mid-winter weather. The heading of the cartoon was '150 Years Later'. To a background of skyscrapers depicting modern Melbourne, a boat plied the Yarra River. The boat's name was Economic Rationalists, and it contained a number of dark-suited gentlemen answering that description. The satirical comment from one of them appeared as a caption underneath the cartoon. 'This is the place for a village', he said. For the thousands of people who have lost their jobs due to retrenchments, industry restructurseen ing or business failures, it was a bitter Anyone in this place familiar with the city which was once the manufacturing heart of Australia would understand fully its implications. Australian manufacturers are currently burdened with a range of imposed costs which markedly affect their competitiveness. These include a range of taxes on business inputs, a number of which are imposed by State governments. They include payroll tax, wholesale tax and others. We also have a centralised industrial relations structure which has institutionalised outmoded work practices and inflated costs; for example, high penalty rates for weekend work and a 17112 per cent loading on holiday pay. Australia is the only country in the where people are paid more to go on holidays than they are to work normally. Fightback will go a long way towards reforming these particular practices. However, we also have taxation structures relating to investments which are unattractive compared with those available in competing countries. In Australia we have a long history of higher inflation than other OECD countries, requiring more cash in working capital and reducing the real value of depreciated cash flows. Good progress has been made recently in reducing inflation, and it is to be hoped that these gains will remain stable. We also have a considerably inferior anti-dumping regime compared with our competitors. At this stage I would like to spend some further time illustrating the dumping problem as it applies to some of our businesses. Mr Laurie Ford, the managing director of the Caford group of companies in Box Hill, Victoria, which is close to my electorate, thinks the performance of the Australian Customs Service could be much improved in respect of dumping. Caford is a family company which was started by Mr Ford's late father in the 1940s. It manufactures a range of products, including specialist metal and plastic castors for furniture, which were invented by Mr Ford's father. It is the major Australian castor producer; it is efficient and modem. But over the last few years it has the share of the local market supplied by joke. domestic producers shrink to 20 per cent. In 1983 imports of castors, principally from Taiwan, at dumped prices 'supplied 25 per cent of the market. Now they have 80 per cent and the figure is still growing. Apart from Caford, there are only two small local producers left out of all the ones that existed previously. Like many other efficiently run businesses swamped by dumped imports, Caford has incurred heavy losses and has reduced its work force. It has subsequently had to refinance at high rates of interest. Yet, after three attempts, which started five years ago, to claim material injury from dumped imports, it has not been able to convince the ACS of the merits of its case. Under existing legislation, which is now world under review, the domestic producer must prove dumping. What is needed now is to shift the onus of proof from Australian producers to the importer. Dr Bill Weekes, Visiting Fellow of Management at the Faculty of Business at RMIT, commented on the Caford case. He said: United States penalty rates of duty are imposed to support domestic producers claims until importers can prove their products are not being dumped. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade clearly states that you can restrict the quantity or value of imports to safeguard your external financial position and balance of payments. It is about time that Australian policy makers did something to safeguard ours. Although growing numbers of developed economies are widening their use of non-tariff barriers such as anti-dumping laws and standards testing to stymie competition, the tariff issue is still a very difficult one. The economic rationalist line of drastic reductions of tariffs, or even zero tariffs, is coming under more and more criticism from business people and the general public, particularly in manufacturing centres such as Melbourne. We hear any number of options from advocation of immediate tariff freeze for two years to zero tariffs by the year 2000. Professor Geoffrey Blainey, in the Australian Business Monthly of January this year, put the point strongly. He said: Lower tariffs will initially bring more imports than we can pay for. The crisis in the balance of payments will be aggravated. In 1995 the Federal Government, Liberal or Labor, will probably have to restore or increase some of the import duties. By then, hundreds of our factories will be closed ... other nations will have the factories, we will have the unemployed. Professor Gregory Clark of Sophie University, Tokyo, wrote in the Australian: Even if Australia carries out all the reforms the rationalists want, it will still not be competitive-it will end up sacrificing its manufacturing sector and creating massive unemployment-for nothing. Mr Colin White, Senior Lecturer in Economic History at La Trobe University, wrote recently in Quadrant: Unhappily, all the evidence suggests that such a policy (of dismantling tariff barriers) has accelerated, if not initiated, a process of de-industrialisation. Mr Robert Manne, senior lecturer in politics at La Trobe University and well-known editor of Quadrant since 1989, believes that the economic rationalist experiment has failed. In the Melbourne Age of 29 August, he wrote in these compelling terms: The evidence of our economic failure is visible in every city and country town, in collapsing businesses, mounting unemployment and families in crisis. It is seen in the ruin of great institutions like the State Bank of Victoria which took a hundred years to build, three to destroy. It is in the billions squandered in constructing city skyscrapers that stand today like giant tombstones, empty; or in the building of dozens of luxury resorts. It is in the impoverishment of rural Australia, where farming families have been driven from land they have worked for many generations. It is in the overseas debt statistics . . . Finally, let us not forget the most telling comment in the 1991 World Bank report on global economic prospects and the developing countries. One part of that report says: 1\venty of the 24 aEeD economies are, on balance, more. protectionist now than they were 10 years ago. In addition, I draw the attention of the House to the growing number of regional trading blocs around the world-including the recently established North American group, NAFTA, about which we have had much debate in these last few days-the conversion of ASEAN into a trading bloc and the continuing barriers inherent in the European Economic Community. All of this, together with the current stalemate on the Uruguay Round of the GAIT negotiations, exacerbates our difficulties as a trading nation. It would seem that Australia's Rambo-like obsession with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position in the world at large. Above all, under a coalition government, industry will require certainty and common sense in policy . formulation and implementation in order to successfully play its part in rebuilding our country and in creating lasting jobs for Australians.",26
7,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I am not sure whether the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) was addressing his comments to myself and those of us on this side of the House or to the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who is sitting at the table. It is very clear that there is a massive gulf between the views of the honourable member for Deakin and those of the shadow Minister for industry and commerce. Having listened carefully to what the honourable member for Deakin said, it is very clear that he opposes the ..eductions in protection and it is very clear that he believes that Australian industry needs support and assistance from government to ensure that it thrives, prospers and grows. It is also very clear-if one has been following what the shadow Minister for industry and commerce has been saying, especially over the last few weeks-that the shadow Minister has a very different view. The shadow Minister is a member who has firm beliefs and he stands by those beliefs. He argues his beliefs and elicits some respect from those of us on this side of House for the fact that he does not give ground; he states his position. Having listened to the honourable member for Deakin, we hope that the shadow Minister at the table would listen to some of the arguments that have been put by one of his own· backbenchers here todayarguments that perhaps suggest that the Opposition could reconsider its policy of advocating a zero tariff level for the car industry and many other industries. We on this side of the House believe that the Australian car industry will not survive if we have a zero tariff policy, as advocated by the conservative coalition. The number of people employed in Adelaide in electorates such as Makin would simply be decimated if the Opposition's policy of zero tariffs were ever applied in this country. On this side of the House, we have said that industry had to reform and get leaner and more efficient. In a package negotiated with the Australian car industry, this Government has reached agreement for a reduction in tariffs down to 15 per cent. But it is very clear that, if one does not have some tariff protection for Australia's car industry, it will not survive. The Australian car industry does not have the massive volume throughput that they have in America, Japan or Europe. Unless we offer some protection to the Australian car industry, it will perish. . That is why it is very reassuririg to hear a speech Sllch as that made by the honourable member for Deakin from the Opposition side of this Parliament making it clear that within the Opposition a number of members are very concerned about the Opposition's zero tariff policy. If one read this morning's papers, one would have seen that a former Premier of South Australia-the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall)-has questioned the Opposition's wisdom in the way it has sold its policy of zero tariffs. I have to say it is pleasing to see that members of the Opposition are raising these issues in the privacy and confidence of their party room. I think it is very important for Australia that we work out what is best for an industry as important as the motor vehicle industry. In yesterday'S paper a spokesman for Mitsubishi said that a future investment of $500m for the next Magna sedan could be placed in jeopardy if the Opposition is elected at the next election. That is a $500m investment for the city of Adelaide that will not go ahead if the Opposition introduces.a zero tariff regime for the Australian car industry. The Leader of the Opposition accused Mr Bill Johnston, the head of Toyota in Australia, of being a liar because he had the temerity to criticise the Opposition's view that a greater number of used Japanese cars and used Japanese motor vehicle engines should be allowed to come into Australia, undermining our own domestic production plants and our own domestic engine rehabilitation industry. Because Mr Johnston had the temerity to raise that one issue he was branded as a liar by the Leader of the Opposition. Toyota is a company which is investing over $750m in Australia in a new plant to be built I think in Altona in Victoria-a plant that will create a lot of jobs for Victoria, for Australia and for the Australian car industry. And for his efforts the general manager of Toyota Australia, Mr Bill Johnston, gets branded a liar by the Leader of the Opposition. I think it is very important for. people to realise that there has to be. negotiation between governments and industries as important as the car industry. The Opposition seems to have the view that it has determined its policy-it is a zero policy-and that no further discussion will be entered into. It is very clear what the outcome of that will be. lt is very clear that companies such as Mitsubishi, Toyota and Ford simply will not be investing money in the Australian car industry. Why should they bother when the Opposition is running around and saying that we should be entering NAFTA? The Opposition is saying we should have absolute free trade in motor vehicles between Australia and the United States, Australia and Canada, AUstralia and Mexico. What would be left of the Australian car industry if the Opposition policy were implemented? I will tell honourable members what would be left: we would have a Commodore designed in Detroit and made in Mexico. We would have a badge with the name 'Commodore' placed on a car that was designed in the United states and made in. Mexico, and very few Australians would be working in the car industry. I cannot believe that the Opposition is running around with a proposal that we should have free trade with North America. It is very clear that the United States Secretary of Trade believes that this free trade area should be extended to the entire AmericasNorth and South America. Yet the Opposition is saying that that is a regional trade bloc Australia should be getting involved with; that there should be open slather trade between Australia and every country in North and South America. That would decimate not just the Australian car industry but many other industries. That is why I am very pleased to hear a contribution such as the one from the honourable member for Deakin, and the reports of statements and questions by the former Premier of South Australla-a well-respected member of this House, the honourable member for Boothby-about this issue, because it is very important for our country. If people drive a Ferrari or own a Rolls or a four-wheel drive Toyota it does not really matter much to them if Australians lose their jobs making Magnas, Commodores and all the other vehicles made in Australia, because they are only used to a Ferrari or a Rolls or a Mercedes or something like that. I am often amazed to hear members of the Opposition say that the big benefit from their zero tariff policy is that cars will be cheaper. That is the catch-cry from honourable members opposite and from the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Barker. They say that cars will be cheaper; do not worry if the Australian car industry is decimated; do not worry if no-one is employed in manufacturing motor vehicles in Australia; do not worry, because the Ferrari will be cheaper, the Rolls will be cheaper; we will be able to import Korean cars more cheaply. Yes, cars will be cheaper, but no-one will be able to afford to buy them because there will be less employment in our country. We should remember that it is not just the people· employed by Ford, Toyota and General Motors in Australia who will be affected; there are also the Australians employed by the companies that manufacture the components that go into those motor vehicles. Their jobs will also be placed at risk by the Opposition's zero tariff policy. I welcome the fascinating contribution made by the honourable member for Deakin. I will ensure that other members on my side of this House get a copy of that speech, because I think it is a very important signal to all of us in this House that there are divisions on the other side of the House. It is good to see that there are some members on that side of the House with reservations about what will happen with the Australian car industry. The debate today has demonstrated once again that the Opposition has no fiscal policy for seeking to encourage economic recovery in Australia today. The day after the Budget we had the Leader of the Opposition and shadow Ministers saying that the Government· was wrong to increase government spending and that the Government was wrong to provide a fiscal stimulus to give the economy a kick-start. Their knee-jerk reaction, as reflected in the grab that was put out on radio and television, was to say that this was increased government spending clocked up on Bankcard. I think that was the 20or 15second grab, whatever it is down to now, that the Opposition gave to the media. It said that this is extra government speI\ding on Bankcard. We at least have to say that the Opposition is consistent. It has been arguing for economic policies that would have driven this country into a deeper recession for the last 18 months or two years. Mr MCLachlan-Rubbish!",29
8,Mr LEE,Unknown,"The shadow Minister says, 'Rubbish!'. I have a quote for the shadow Minister at the table. When interest rates were at their peak in January 1990, what was the Opposition's policy? When the Labor Government started to reduce interest rates, what was the Opposition saying? I will tell honourable members. The current Leader of the Opposition, the then shadow Treasurer, was asked by a journalist on 21 January 1990: Can we say that cutting interest rates then was not justified? The shadow Treasurer replied: I think there is little doubt that the Treasurer is pushing the pace on interest rate reduction to meet his political timetable. _ Mr CADMAN - Yes-State elections.",31
9,Mr LEE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Mitchell agrees, along with the shadow Minister at the table. The then shadow Treasurer, the Leader of the Opposition, criticised us for reducing interest rates back in January 1990. Honourable members opposite criticised us every time there was a reduction in interest rates. Had their policies been implemented, the. economy would have been in a bigger recession. Certainly there would be no way we would be in a recovery, because today the Opposition is still arguing that one does not give the economy a kick-start; one applies the brakes even harder. The Opposition's policy as outlined in Fightback says that one does not provide a kick-start to the economy by increasing government expenditure in an intelligent way; it says that government expenditure should be cut back by another $3 billion. So at the very time the economy needs a kick-start, the Opposition says, 'Put the brakes on as hard as you can'. It is absolutely economically illiterconsumption ate. To make it worse, Fightback then says that, the brakes having been put on in the first year by reducing government spending by $3 billion, one then applies a GST which blows inflation out. Interest rates will have to go through the roof. In that year, in year two of Fightback, it then provides a massive fiscal stimulus. At the very time inflation will be getting out of control the Opposition says one should then provide a fiscal stimulus. It is ridiculous that the Opposition does realise that its policy is to slam on the brakes at a time when we are trying to get the recovery going. It would put on a GST, blow out inflation and interest rates and then provide a fiscal stimulus, about two years too late. I am amazed that some of those opposite, probably with more economic degrees behind them than me, would argue something that even the honourable member for Mitchell, who I am sure has read R.J. Brown's Student Economics, would understand is the opposite of what should be done at a time like this. In the One Nation statement and in the Budget, this Government announced national projects in rail, road and local capital works programs that will provide jobs and provide the kick-start that businesses need. The Opposition's response is: 'We don't think the Government should spend any more money. We don't think the Government should give the economy a kick-start. Our view is that the Government should sit on its hands and do nothing until we get elected and we put on a 15 per cent consumption tax. That will solve everyone's problems'. Blowing out inflation and blowing out interest rates is a recipe for disaster for this country, especially for Australians who are looking for the economic recovery to gather strength. In the minutes that remain I cannot let the opportunity go past without examining, once again, the Opposition's proposal, its economic solution, its alternative: the consumption tax. Opposition members argue that this is the miracle cure for Australia's economic ills; this is the 'miracle cure that will solve all our problems. It will abolish a number of taxes and pay for it by imposing a 15 per cent tax on food and clothing, bread and milk-the necessities of life-telephone bills and parts of council rates. We do not know how much of the council rates will be subject to the tax, but, at the very least, it will apply to garbage services and to water and sewerage if they are provided by the council. A 15 per cent tax will be applied to restaurant bills and food from takeaway milk bars. You name it, it will be slugged by the 15 per cent consumption tax. Opposition members say, 'Don't worry, not we're going to abolish wholesale sales tax. The prices won't actually go up 15 per cent; they will go up somewhere between 4 per cent and 8 per cent, or 15 per cent. But don't worry because by abolishing wholesale sales tax it won't be as bad as it sounds. Don't worry, it won't quite be 15; it will be a bit less than 15'. When similar proposals have been brought in in New Zealand and Canada, the prices of those products that should be cheaper when the sales tax is abolished have never fallen. The prices of those products where the consumption tax forces the price to go up by the maximum amount actually go up by the maximum amount. We have no mechanism for forcing retailers to pass on the reductions that should be there through the abolition of wholesale sales tax. I will bet all those retailmanufacturers ers will make sure the prices go up by the full 15 per cent on things such as bread and milk. I find it hard to understand how the OppOsition can argue that its system will be fairer when we have a system today, under the wholesale sales tax regime, in which the necessities of life, such as food and clothing, are not taxed. Swimming pools, luxury cars and all the other areas",32
10,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,Don't tell us about swimming pools after the mess you made.,33
11,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I am talking about swimming pools because I think there should be a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on swimming pools. I can tell the honourable member for Mitchell that the battlers in his electorate who are watching this debate today, and those who will read it later, probably cannot afford to put in a swimming pool, but I bet they can afford to buy bread and milk. That is why it is ridiculous to hit swimming pools at 15 per cent and bread and milk at the same rate. A wholesale sales tax that varies the rate according to whether an item is a necessity or a luxury is the right way to go. It is much fairer. It is also a much more efficient way to collect the tax, because wholesale sales tax is collected at the wholesale level. Who is going to collect the consumption tax the Opposition is putting forward? Every retailer and every person in every factory. Every person who adds value to any product anywhere in the country will have to fill out pieces of paper. We know that there will have to be an extra 1,000 people in the Tax Office to process these bits of paper. Opposition members are trying to tell us that this will be a help to small business. Then they say, 'Don't worry, small business, we'll abolish payroll tax. That will be a big boost for you'. The only problem is that most small businesses do not pay payroll tax. Most small businesses earn less than the threshold to pay payroll tax. Mr MCLachlan-Somebody pays.",33
12,Mr LEE,Unknown,"The shadow Minister at the table, being the big businessman he is, says, 'Somebody pays'. I will tell him who pays payroll tax: it is the middle-sized and large .. Payroll tax is a competitive advantage for small business. Compare the corner store with Grace Bros. The comer store does not pay payroll tax; Grace Bros does. To remove payroll tax is to remove the competitive advantage that the small businessman has. That is why I find it so hard to understand why the party of free enterprise is trying to force small business to fill out endless pieces of paper-more bureaucracy-and to remove the competitive advantage that small business has over the large retailers by abolishing payroll tax. I do not understand why small business is not throwing a few more questions at people such as the shadow Minister at the table, because there are a few questions to answer. The other feather in the Opposition's capthere are not too many feathers left-is: 'Don't worry, we're going to cut all the taxes on petrol'. What Opposition members do not tell us is that they will cut the taxes on petrol and then apply a 15 per cent consumption tax to it. Then, hidden in the fine print, there is the imposition of a road user charge. They will not tell us how much that will be. It is a recipe for disaster. They do not understand that what the economy needs now is a kickstart, as this Government has proposed. I do not understand why the members of the Opposition are against these road and rail projects. Why are they against giving local councils a bit of extra money to try to create jobs now? Why are they doing everything they can to frustrate this Government's attempts to boost the recovery?",33
13,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"Mitchell) (11.56 a.m.)We have just heard a most incredible conglomeration of excuses and back outs for the failures of the current Government. I will flick past payroll tax because it is a tax on employment. The Government has one million people unemployed and it is arguing in favour of a payroll tax, which is a penalty on the number of people employed. Companies which employ people pay a payroll tax. It is purely geared on the number of people they employ. It is crazy. I think it is an example of the way in which this Government lacks vision and has lost its way completely. It is a reactionary government and it is not going anywhere. It is propping up problems and trying to solve problems on the run. It has no clear direction of where it wants Australia to go. It is offering no clear opportunities for Australians. It is not giving the, average Aussie a ch-ce. Australia is lost because of a lack of leadership. There is a reactionary government trying to solve political crises that it has created. has no clear view of where the end of the tunnel is or where it wants us to go. After 10 years, what has it done? It has created one million unemployed people and increased the level of family break-ups. Tragically, the statistics are now showing the level of people who cannot face this world's problems and are taking their own lives. These things are all created by government policies. It is a dreadful situation. We hear claptrap and recycled phrases from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being presented as solutions. What Australia needs is a vision. We have a debt of $150 billion and a gross debt of over $200 billion. We owe money around the world. We have a greater debt than the whole of the Soviet Union, and the whole world is racing to bail out the Soviet Union. We have created this debt. We have borrowed money and, at the same time, to try to balance our trade situation we have been selling our inheritance. Throughout Australia there has been a program of managing the Australian economy so that investment in Australia is attractive. People are scooping up what are attractive offers: Australian businesses, Australian manufacturers and Australian real estate. We have opened the doors to the rest of the world because we are in weak circumstances. We cannot protect ourselves. We cannot maintain our own impetus. The Government's solution, after 10 years of work, has been to sell the farm, say we are going further into debt and hope that that gets us out at the end of the day. The Government is content to deal with the Packers, the Bonds, the Sir Peter Abeles and the ACTU and forget the rest of us. That is not the way to run a country. The country is the people. That is why the Government lacks vision. It has no thoughts for the people. It has no vision; it has no plans. Australians are crying out right at this moment for more incentive so that they can say to the Government, 'Get out of our way and let us go on'. I have a great deal of confidence in the average Aussie, who is well educated and well informed. Australians are goers, they like It to see a challenge, and they like to solve problems. But they are not offered any opportunities by this Government. All the Government offers in this Budget and the Supply Bills that we are debating today is that it will take more money from those who are working. The Government is running up the debt, and we all the pay interest rates on the money the Government is borrowing. The Government is creating programs to help people who are unemployed-unemployment created by itself and its policies. It has more money out on all sorts of projects, basically so that it can say, 'We care about people'. That is not the way to produce solutions. Australians need incentive and want a fair go. The Government is not prepared to give them a fair go. Australians are saying that families with children need greater support because they are facing difficulties. Australians feel that those in retirement or facing retirement deserve a fair go and a predictable future. The Government is not prepared to give them a go. It is also felt that small and medium size businesses deserve a fair go so that they can feel a challenge and a future and in that way create more business and more jobs. Australians feel that the Government's migration program is hopeless. The Government has opened to the world Australia's welfare policies and for 10 years it has conducted an immigration program that is an absolute shambles. The Aussies are saying that we need more incentive, that families with children need a go, that the elderly deserve a chance, that small businesses need to have a chance to employ, and that the Government needs to do something about immigration because people are sick of the way the system is operating. What has the Government offered in these Supply Bills and in the Budget? As with similar Budgets the Government says, 'We are on track, everything is going okay, the champagne glass is full, and this Budget will bring home the bacon and go for more jobs'. The Government is going for 23,000 jobs, which will all be paid for by those who are in work or will be put on tick. Future generations will have to pay for this through the interest charges and the repayments that the. Government will impose on people by way of taxation. The Government is saying to the Australian people, 'To solve the problem we have created, we will sock you guys harder so that we can have some fancy program that employs 23,000 people and that will get us through the election'. The Government has no vision; it has lost its way. It is not looking the future. It has no plans; it has no prospects. It is managing the political difficulties that confront it, and that i- all it is doing. The Government has taken the unemployment problem completely out of the context of what is happening with bankruptcies and the closures. It has taken it out of the context of family circumstances where there is trauma and distress. It has taken it out of context of the education system. Instead of having a rational approach, looking at what the problems are and dealing with them, the Government has offered a series of bandaids to Australia's national problems. There is no prospect of Australia succeeding under the proposals in this Budget. It hit the deck in Australia when it was first announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 18 August and nothing has been seen of it since. People do not believe that the Government has done anything in its Budget to help the average Aussie, and they are right. There is no direction to assist the average Australian. The various aspects of the desires and , aspirations of Australians have to be dealt with; Australians have to be offered a chance. Most Aussies think that if the Government let them have more of their own money back, instead of taking so much, that would be an incentive for day-today living. The Government has not looked at what will give people an incentive to do more, to produce more, to work more, to work smarter and use their talents. The Government has felt that it is better to lock all of that up with the Acru. Martin Ferguson then gains prestige and position as king of that heap, but it haS no benefit for the average worker. The deals have been dope but the results are not beneficial. The Government needs to reduce personal income tax. A 30 per cent cut to begin with would be about right. That is what the Opposition is proposing in Fightback. We will supply incentive to the average workers by cutting their tax. We will get out of their pockets. I had a look at how New Zealand has to reorganised its workplace relationships. It is interesting because Martin Ferguson and previous speakers have said, 'Well, if you let the employer and the employee actually get together and negotiate what is reasonable, wages will fall'. They have done that in New Zealand. Ninety-two per cent of wages have stayed the same or have increased. In Australia we have the shackles of set smokos, set rostered days off, set overtime, penalty rates and all the rest of it. In New Zealand the workers have scrapped all of that junk and have said, 'We want to work harder. We want to get this company or little business going'. They are getting more money from that process. They are not on the .never-never for some training scheme or superannuation scheme run by the uruon movement. They have got down and sorted it out for themselves, right there where they were. Australians need an incentive to know that their work is valued and that they are being paid for their work. That is what Fightback offers. Families with children who are dependent on the income of one main breadwinner and supplemented by another income need incentive too. Of course, reduced taxation is of great assistance to those families. But their expenses need to be acknowledged. The expenses they incur with children should be acknowledged by increasing the spouse allowance. Money for family allowances should be doubled. That has been thought of by the Opposition and is contained in Fightback. We will take care of families and give them a balanced approach. They are the group in Australia that is penalised at the moment. They are the group where there is trauma and break-up because they cannot manage their finances. They are saying, 'There is not enough to go around, we cannot pay the house off, we cannot keep up rental paYJnents. The cost of living is going up, the standard of living has fallen and we do not know how to manage our personal affairs'. That is what is happening in Australia today. But the Government does not acknowledge that either. We need support for families with children. The Government has not even given any attention to the families of Australia. There was not one word in the Budget Speech about Australian families. The Government is prepared to let them rot, go to the wall and lose their jobs. It is prepared to let them lose their houses and downgrade their standard of living. The Government does deals with Martin Ferguson and leaves families off its Budget agenda altogether. What about the elderly? The Government has made eight changes to superannuation retirement benefits over the past six or seven years, and people are at a loss to know where they stand. They do not know where they are going; they do not know how to prepare for their future. All their lives people have been planning and setting aside funds or making arrangements for their retirement, and the Government comes along and makes change after change after change. People have been penalised by the Government taking more and more of their funds and they feel insecure about their future. The Opposition has thought about this matter. We feel that the first thing a person should get on retirement is access to a pharmaceutical benefits card. We think that people need to be sure about their health requirements in retirement. We have said that those people shOldd have that phannaceutical benefits card so they can feel certain that health needs will be attended to. After that, there is the issue of entitlement to funds, and people are run through a-whole series of tests to find out whether they have income, assets or whatever, but the first requirement is a consideration of their health needs. The Opposition has also proposed a 30 per cent reduction in personal income tax for people who are living on their savings. We will pay compensation if there is an increase in costs. We will increase pensions and benefits by 8 per cent, which is double what the Treasury calculates the impact of a goods and services tax will be. Our increase is to make sure that people are properly compensated and so there can be no argument that the Government is dudding them. It is double the amount predicted in the price increase. There is also compensation for people who have savings. A one-off cheque will be sent to them to top up their savings, because the value of their savings has been slightly diminished by the introduction of a goods and services tax. When that is put together with a superannuation package that gives incentive and taxation relief to people who are superannuating, when we remove the lump sum tax and make provisions for people to take part of .their superannuation in a lump sum and some as annuity to be put in roll-over funds, there is greater certainty. The Opposition is building a program for the next 10 or 20 years. It is not a prop-up process, which is what the Government is into. It props the situation up, deals with the crisis of the moment and hopes to get through and win the next election. It is all about winning elections, it is not about Australians. Australians are the people that make this country. I do not think that we on this side of the House are proud of the fact that Australia's living standard has dropped from the highest in the world at the beginning of this century to No. 23 or 24. In the last three years, its placing has dropped from 17 to 23. That is where we are going. This Government has created that and now it is trying to so fudge the issue that it does not take any responsibility for its actions. It is blaming everybody their else and saying, 'Yes, but we can introduce these expenditure programs, sell Qantas and take the proceeds of the sale of that wonderful corporation and turn it into job creation programs'. One billion dollars would be put to no use. It does not retire debt. I acknowledge that it helps those who are unemployed, but there are better ways and more successful ways of helping people who are unemployed than selling Qantas. Once sold, that one big asset cannot be recovered, nor can the funds from it be recovered. Australia is not getting any permanent benefit by the proceeds of this sale, whereas to retire some of the debt that the Government has chalked up would have a long lasting and permanent effect. What about the small businesses of Australia? They are the big job creators. The Government has got them for this tax, that tax and 101 other taxes. We in the Opposition are going to take seven taxes off them. We are going to say, 'You ought to have a fair go, because you are going to create the jobs'. That is where incentive comes from. If people can be offered jobs, at least they can make a living. They do not have the prospect that 30 or 40 per cent of our school leavers have at the moment of going onto the unemployment queues. Once they get on the unemployment queue, the Government starts a job creation program to train them a bit more to stay unemployed for another period. That is no vision. That is not a future for Australia. does not offer us a prospect. The Government is just managing a crisis, it is not giving us solutions. There need to be solutions. So the businesses that will benefit from Fightback are the small businesses. Imposts, such as payroll tax, will be taken away from them. A small business may not pay payroll tax but it buys from a big business that does. Payroll tax is instigated by State governments on the value paid in wages. It is a penalty on employment. Why do we have it? We should not have it. Why not remove it? There is nothing in the Budget about job creation by removing payroll tax. What about the crazy situation facing honourable members? Last night, we dealt in this chamber with the terrible mistakes that the Government has made in its wholesales sales tax regime. It is so complex, it takes a genius to rea- the Act. The Government made a mistake with swimming pools. The High Court said that the Government was wrong, and now money has to be paid back to the people who built swimming pools. Nobody knows where that money is, who has got it, who is going to receive it, or even who the pool builders were. But, somehow or other, the. court has declared that people have to get their money back. We are going to sweep away that silly system where we pay wholesale sales tax on a Kit Kat because some Treasury official says that it is confectionery, but we do not pay it on Amott's biscuits because they are considered to be a food. Those are the definitional problems of the wholesale sales tax. So much of what we payout is grabbed up in a wholesale sales tax. We are going to reduce tariffs. Seventy per cent of Australian manufacturing industry actually buys stuff from overseas to add value to it. The reduction of tariffs will help Australian manufacturing industries which depend on components brought in from overseas. The reduction in personal income tax is another thing that will help small businesses. Seven taxes will be removed from them. That That will create an impetus for them to employ more people. I was in a Tip Top bread factory recentlybread is the essential staple of life-and I asked how the factory would be affected by the changes in Fightback. They said, 'We pay about half a million dollars in payroll tax a year just in making bread. We pay for the fuel that our delivery vehicles use, and also the oil burnt in our plants for energy. We pay about $800,000 in excise duty a year'. So that one bread making plant will be relieved of taxes worth $1,300,000. (llme expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1992-93 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 August, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the Bill be now read a second time.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (12.21 p.m.)-I am pleased to speak on the Budget. It is a very important Budget. As a Labor representative-and particularly as the honourable member for Chifley-I often listen to people commenting about what Ben Chifley's reaction would have been to this or that matter. It seems to me that this Budget has been framed· from a traditional Labor perspective; that is, there are certainly measw-es to assist pensioners, in terms of the increases that they have received; there are infrastructure proposals; and there are further measures to train those who are unemployed. These are all very traditional Labor Party things, and I am very pleased to be associated with them. In my electorate, we certainly have a significant problem with unemployment. The general rate of unemployment for the March quarter in the Blacktown local government area was 13.9 per cent, which is well above the State and national averages. Of particular concern to me is youth unemployment. I must confess to the House some frustration in this aspect. Getting the Blacktown figures alone is impossible as they are aggregated with Baulkham Hills, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), represents. I mentioned that our general rate was 13.9 per cent. The figure for Baulkham Hills, incidentally, has shot up to 3.5 per cent. But 1).. when it comes to the full time rate of youth unemployment for the two local government areas, the figure is 43.1 per cent. This is bad enough, but I suspect that the figures are significantly understated. It is only natural when government programs are put into assist people that this understatement of the youth unemployment rate in my electorate causes concern. I should qualify those figures. When measuring the youth unemployment rate, we take out, of course, all of those students who are in years 11 and 12, or who are undertaking a university or TAPE course. It is the unemployment rate amongst the residual population. Be that as it may, we need to have. reliable statistics and, in this instance, I do not have any. I must confess my bitter disappointment, after having written to the Australian Statistician of the ABS, at having got a reply that is totally unsatisfactory. Whilst I agree that there are always going to be difficulties aggregating different local government areas, it is absolutely critical that the figures are by and large similar. I think the demographics of the Baulkham Hills local government area are dramatically different from the demographics of Blacktown, and the figures severely understate the position. Having raised this issue of youth unemployment, I think it is important that I mention youth summit. I am very pleased to say that by and large the summit that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) called here in Canberra went particularly well. Rather than politicians seen to be completely unresponsive, I saw the exercise as being one in which the Government could listen to a variety of different people who were brought together to make their contribution as to how we might overcome the difficulties of youth unemployment. In response to that summit, the Government made a major announcement. We should bear in mind that prior to the youth summit the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), in negotiations with the States, had already allocated some $700m towards bolstering TAPE. I have in my electorate a very large college, namely, the Mount Druitt TAPE. By and large in the western suburbs of Sydney the take up rate for TAPE courses is high, which is all for the better. So a government commitment that pours in Australia-wide an extra $700m is indeed good news for my area. The youth summit initiatives related to more than just TAPE. A further 12,000 prevocational places are to be created in TAFE for 1993. The pre-vocational courses that were run at Mount Druitt and in Blacktown were highly successful. They were only discontinued when-and this was not so long ago-record places in apprenticeships and traineeships were being achieved. Prevocational courses are an anti-cyclical measure and it is most appropriate that we should be introducing them at this time. I felt that the most exciting thing in the youth summit announ.cements by the Prime Minister was this Government's commitment to the Carmichael report. I remain an unabashed fan of what will be revolutionary changes for young Australians in what will be offered to them in years 11 and 12 in terms of vocational courses. I have said in this Parliament many times that, unfortunately, whilst we can take a great deal of pride in the dramatic increase in retention rates in years 11 and 12 from about 33 per cent to 70 per cent, it remains a disappointment that the majority of young the Australians-some 60 per cent of those attending years 11 and 12-are offered courses which do not really meet their needs and aspirations, which are very legitimate. They being aspire to enter the world of work and see those senior years as preparing them for that. The Carmichael report advocated a number of initiatives. In summary, it believes there should be a commitment to senior high schools or secondary colleges. I regtet to say that I cannot see that particular recommendation being picked up at this time. However, the report believes that vocational courses should be offered to these young Australians, which they may undertake at school or at TAFE or at a combination of schools and TAPE. Carmichael also says that these courses ought to be rigorous, challenging and demanding, that they should be certified and esteemed. Most important of all, Carmichael suggests that we need to involve industry or bus- and that a significant part of this training will be carried Qut on the shop floor. He also advocates the collapsing of apprenticeships and traineeships, the modulising of these apprenticeships and traineeships and the rapid expansion in the number of occupations that are covered. These Carmichael changes will be very revolutionary and will point the way for young Australians in the 1990s and beyond the year 2000. We will wonder why we did not adopt them earlier. A figure of approximately $100m has been allocated to the Australian vocational certificate and $53m over three years to get pilot projects and new Career Start traineeships under way. I nan electorate such as mine, and in particular in the western suburbs of Sydney, these changes will be profound and they will benefit young people in my electorate. I was very pleased that Laurie Carmichael visited my electorate. I regret that the latest version of the Trotskyites took a great deal of interest at the meeting, I suppose to everyone's discomfort and displeasure. But it is important that Laurie should go around the country preaching the message about the Carmichael report. I sincerely hope that in this aspect of the Budget we would have bipartisan support, because young Australians are certainly deserving of the Parliament's consideration in a non-political way. There are other aspects in the youth summit statement that will benefit young people who are unemployed. These include giving them six months training, Jobstart at the end of that, developing new Career Start traineeships and the expansion of Skillshare and Jobtrain. In my electorate I have a number of Skillshare programs, including the Sydney City Mission at Mount Druitt and the Holy Family program at Emerton. Unfortunately, I have lost one of the two Mamre Plains Skillshare projects to my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), but I know he will value the good work that is carried out there. There is one at Blacktown and one at North St Marys. I want to place on record that every time. I have visited these programs and spoken to the participants, they are all very grateful for opportunity to learn new skills and better prepare themselves for the world of work. I am delighted at the success rates. They either lead people to seek employment or, more particularly, they equip individuals to undertake some more formal courses that may be available at TAPE, which possibly they would never have had the confidence or ability to tackle. Perhaps I have said enough on the youth statement, but in an electorate such as mine it has been important for so many young talented Australians. Having served in local government, I want to talk about one of the initiatives that I am particularly pleased about, and that is the local government capital works program. As the House will be aware, the Government is spending some $345m on the initiative of the previous Minister for Local Government, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), and it is a very worthwhile initiative for government. Often in this Parliament we hear criticism of mickey mouse government programs that will not benefit anyone. The city of Blacktown will benefit from this program to the tune of $7 1hm. It was enthusiastically received by the local council and aldermen and very enthusiastically received by the people. As is sometimes difficult with· Federal programs, people could actually see a measure targeted to the local area. These programs that the council has developed are widespread and involve, for example, the construction of a bridge at Power Street at a cost, from memory, of $1.6m. This bridge is very close to an industrial site and industries wishing to locate there have pointed out that the lack of a bridge is a weakness, so it is an infrastructure project that has direct economic benefit. Another allocation is $500,000 towards an Aboriginal cultural centre at Nurragingy Reserve, and indeed Power Street runs through the reserve. This is a 90-hectare program where the Federal Government previously had committed some $3m to developing an outstanding regional passive recreation area for the city of Blacktown but with regional significance. Through Danny Eastwood, the Aboriginal the artist of the year, the Gamilaroi Dance Troupe has been involved and quite a number of other Aboriginal community members have come up with the idea, which they have worked through with council, of developing an Aboriginal cultural centre where tourists and local residents can see the Gamilaroi Dance Troupe actually performing. There would be an arts and craft centre associated with it and, apart from its construction, its objective would be to make the centre a fully commercial operation. Lest some honourable members suspect that we are sticking this project out in the middle of nowhere and have no chance of attracting any tourists, I might say that it is located a couple of kilometres away from Featherdale. Featherdale is a natural animal reserve in Doonside which attracts some 900,000 paying customers every year, 350,000 of whom are Japanese tourists. It is a local complementary development, and I am frankly very excited. I must congratulate not only Danny and the team, who had the vision for it, but also Blacktown City Council, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the councillors of ATSIC on the very positive way that they have responded and are considering the proposal. I am looking forward to the day when we actually get it going. The Council has allocated out of its local government capital works program $500,000 towards this project. In a nonnal year, there would probably be-and I mean no disrespect-a riot amongst the aldennen if so large a sum were allocated out of their nonna! capital works program for such a project. The Council is speaking as a community in allocating this money, but it is able to do so only because of the initiative within this Budget. I think it is an absolute shame that the Liberal Party in my State appears to be out to destroy this local government capital works program. I find the comments of the Minister  solutely reprehensible in threatening local government that he is going to hold up the money that is going towards these very worthwhile projects. In effect, in a project aimed at stimulating the local economy, providing infrastructure and providing jobs for those who are unemployed, he is directing pain. and anguish at those who are least able to bear it. This program overcomes many of the objections that have been raised-not always accepted by the Opposition-about previous programs; This program is devoid of objections. It has the support and enthusiasm of local government, but the Liberal Party in my State is saying 'No, we are going to take the opportunity to hold them up'. I think in the city of Blacktown, voters in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gonnan) and my own electorate have 7 11z million reasons why at the next election they ought not to vote for the Liberal Party. It would be remiss of me if I did not mention some aspects of the defence budget. I apologise that I have little time, but I must say from my own responsibilities that I am delighted that the Government has been able to preserve intact our major capital equipment procurement program. It is valued at over $2.300m this year, in contrast to the paltry $476m in 1982-83. If one wanted to calculate it in constant dollars for the previous year, it is about $1,45Om. So this Government has made a major commitment to equipping the armed forces so that they have the capability of defending this country. The easiest thing for governments to do is to cut the capital equipment procurement program and keep the manpower on, thus making huge savings but at the extreme price of undennining the capability of the armed services. We have announced an extensive new program. The total new investments announced in this Budget total some $916m, not all of which will be spent. The major elements of that are the P3C Orion updates, the Boeing 707 simulator, the naval communications station, the FA18 radar evaluation facility and, probably the biggest of all, the coastal minehunter program. I am very pleased that we have continued our commitment to the major capital works and our commitment to industry whereby about 70 per cent of these dollars stay in Australia and 30 per cent go overseas, whereas the ratio of the previous Government was quite the reverse: about 30 per cent stayed in Australia and 70 per cent went overseas. My role is to increase those percentages. (TIme expired) Debate (on motion by Mrs Bailey) adjourned.",33

16,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown," Mr Acting Speaker, I seek your indulgence to raise a matter of privilege.",41
17,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may proceed.,42
18,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations has been preparing a report entitled Australia s Refugee and Humanitarian System: Achieving a Balance Between Refuge and Control, based on an inquiry spanning a period of nearly two years. This report will be tabled in the Parliament next Monday. Unfortunately, in. yesterday's Age there appeared an article on page 3 entitled 'Call for Chinese students to lose special status' by Margaret Easterbrook. This article in the Age purports to be an accurate representation of the contents of the parliamentary report. This article was considered at a meeting of the Committee held today and in the opinion of the Committee it constitutes a breach of privilege of the most serious kind. I was instructed by the Committee at that meeting to raise with you what action can be taken in relation to this matter. This article has created considerable angst and confusion in the Chinese community which is, to say the least, unfortunate. The article has also presented a distorted picture of the general thrust of the parliamentary report. The comprehensive nature of the report and the importance of any recommendations in it have been overshadowed by this journalist's decision to select and emphasise one issue discussed in the report. It has also undermined some of the hard work of the Committee in carefully preparing the report on such an explosive issue. I want first to ask that no-one prejudge the report on the basis of this mischievous article and, secondly, that you consider referring the actions of the Age in publishing the article, and of the journalist in writing. it, to the Privileges Committee. I also ask that an investigation be made as to the source of whatever leaks have occurred.",42
19,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for raising the matter. Under standing order 95 the honourable member has an obligation, if he believes that a matter of privilege has arisen, to raise it at the first opportunity; he has done that. In September 1990 the Speaker outlined the procedures to be followed in such cases, and I will outline these to the honourable member because the Speaker also reminded the House of these procedures on 7 May this year. The House should be informed at the first opportunity; so the honourable member has met that obligation. The Joint Committee itself, which is the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, will now need to give further consideration to the issue, in particular the need to do two things: the first is to consider whether there has been substantial interference with its work, with the committee system or with the functions of the House. That is the first thing. The second criterion is for the Committee to take whatever steps it can to ascertain the source of any disclosure. The House will then need to be informed of the results of the Committee's consideration of the matter so that any appropriate action can be taken. So, in a sense, the advice to the honourable member for Calwell is that it·is back to him and the Committee and then for him to come back to the House. He has given a prime facie outline and understanding order 95 he has reserved his place to raise it at a future time, but he will now need to go and meet those criteria. NA",42

24,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"The responsibility for taxation rests with me. I will respond to questions asked about taxation, to whomever they are directed-except, of course, the Prime Minister. The first point is that it is an absolute outrage for the honourable member for Forrest to suggest that there is anything like a secret tax agenda being pursued by the Government. We have indicated in the Budget Papers-they are not hidden-and also in the Budget Speech some measures that we were prepared to look at. In our good time we will let you know which of those measures we intend to retain on the table. The honourable member refers to the prescribed payments scheme. The prescribed payments scheme was an invention of the last Howard Budget, and no doubt he was advised on this matter by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me give you Me Howard's definition",43
25,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The Treasurer should refer to the honourable member by his appropriate title.,43
26,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"I am sorry, the honourable member for Bennelong, the then Treasurer's definition. Under the heading 'Implications of the New Scheme'-this was a discussion paper issued in his name on 17 August 1982-he said: The measures outlined in this paper are cerned solely with the reporting of income and collection of income tax correctly payable 'by persons who receive payments to which the system will apply. In fact, the honourable member for Bennelong was at pains to make clear, and has been at pains to make clear ever since, that this is not a tax as such; it is an alternative method of collecting a tax which is otherwise duly payable. The honourable member should realise that the honourable member for Bennelong also said: The Opposition has never resiled from the position that sensible legislation in this area of the type we originally foreshadowed was absolutely necessary. In other words, the honourable member for Bennelong has never resiled from the question. of the PPS being an appropriate mechanism for collecting tax which would otherwise be payable. So he should not come here saying that this is a new tax, because to do so ,he will only be contradicting his own member, the former Treasurer, who announced this particular measure back in 1982-83. Mr Thckey-Me Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. It appears that the Treasurer has concluded but I was going to raise the matter of relevance.",43
27,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The Treasurer has concluded his answer. There is no point of order. Tariffs,43
28,Dr CATLEY,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is' the Prime Minister aware of alternative tariff policies being promoted as a method for increasing job opportunities in Australia and increasing the likelihood of investment in Australian industries? Can the Prime Minister say whether the Government agrees with these alternative policies and explain what impact they would have on the car industry in South Australia and the sugar industry in Queensland?,43
29,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The Government has, in the interests of a more competitive trading economy and fairer prices for Australians, sought to induce into Australian industry a more competitive structure by a planned phased reduction in tariffs to certain end con- points which the Government believes, and believed at the time of announcement, to be appropriate for particular industries. Those phase-downs began in 1988 and have continued to this point. They will finish in 1997 at the nominal rates of 25 per cent for textiles and apparel and other TCF products, 15 per cent for motor vehicles and 5 per' cent for general manufacturing. Mr Tim Fischer-Are you going to back flip on that next Tuesday?",43
30,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"After your performance the other night I would shut up, if I were you. The ,end point nominal tariff for cars at 15 per cent in 1997 is an effective rate of 36 per cent. The current effective rate is 113 per cent and it was 243 per cent. The Opposition is proposing to take what was an effective rate of 243 per cent in 1988 to zero. The effective rate of 36 per cent which would obtain from a nominal rate of 15 per cent would, of course, be abolished. I noticed a report in the Adelaide Advertiser today concerning the shadow spokesman on industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker. The article stated: Later Mr MCLachlan said it was not in dispute that the new investmentthis is by Mitsubishiwould be highly unlikely under the coalition's policy. In other words, he is not di-puting that it would be highly unlikely. On radio this morning the honourable member was questioned by Pm Goward, who said: So you accept that under a 5 per cent tariff he is correct in saying their investment is highly unlikely? The honourable member replied: Yes, that is what he told me. Here is one of the key motor vehicle industries of South Australia with an investment of $600m-a major investment in world terms-about to go into this city, Adelaide, and this State, South Australia, and the honourable member says that he accepts that the investment is highly unlikely. When asked by Susan Mitchell on South Australian radio, 'What if you are wrong?', the honourable member replied, 'Okay, if we are wrong it will be a tragedy-. Too right it will be a tragedy if you are wrong. How would they expect an industry to come from a 243 per cent effective rate of protection to nothing and have it survive, and then try to induce a $600m investment by one of the world's major companies, Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan-that is, have the Australian company seek $600m of investment from the parent company? This policy would simply put asunder the future of the South Australian motor industry. What is more, the honourable member for Barker has admitte4 that it is highly unlikely that the investment would go ahead and that it would be a tragedy if it did not. But still he presses on with his determination to go to zero levels of protection. This morning an Opposition backbencher, the honourable member for Deakin, said: ... Australia's Rambo-like obsession with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position . . . He said: Above all, under a coalition government, industry will require certainty and common sense in policy formulation and implementation . . . That is exactly what he is not getting from the Leader of the Opposition or his spokesperson on industry matters. If it is not bad enough on cars, on sugar we have a nice little press statement from the Deputy Leader of the National Party saying: The Coalition's new anti-dumping laws would be more powerful in - ping dumped sugar out of Australia than tariffs could ever be.",44
31,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,That is correct.,44
32,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"That is correct, he said. Let me tell you this: imports of sugar are well under 2 per cent of our market. So how could procedures-whatever procedures-on dumping for imports under 2 per cent have any kind of impact similar to the impact",44

53,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,No. I suggest to the honourable member for Murray that he is trying the patience of the Chair. It is not a matter for debate. There are other forums in which to do that; Question Time is not the appropriate time. The honourable member should not try the patience of the Chair again.,45
54,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"To make matters worse, in the press statement he also said this: Labor's current policy does not even allow an application to be made against subsidised sugar coming into Australia until our producers have lost at least 20 per cent of the Australian market. That is absolutely wrong, totally wrong; it is not even technically correct. Here is the National Party tied to the manic policy of the Leader of the Opposition of zero tariffs on sugar. You may have noticed, Mr Acting Speaker, that we have not heard one wo,d about NAFTA in two sitting pedodsyesterday and today-and no word about trade, which was the issue last week in the smokescreen created to avoid scrutiny on sugar and motor cars. We find this sham press statement by the Deputy Leader 'of the National Party arguing that some dumping procedure to protect a market where less than 2 per cent of sugar is being imported would be more important than abolishing the $55 a tonne' tariff on sugar. The fact is that the National Party of Australia is hell-bent on destroying the sugar industry of this country-that is the truth-the North Queensland sugar industry. It is being in bringing it down by the Leader of the Opposition with the same manic determination with which he is supporting the shadow spokesperson on industry in relation to cars. There is no attempt to rationalise these industries' problems or to talk to them. All they get is the same reply: abuse from the Leader of the Opposition. They are branded as liars, as Mr Johnston from Toyota was the other day, and dismissed as people who are always coming to the Government for han- . douts but who do not have legitimate' complaints. The fact is that the National party is hoist with the petard of zero tariffs and it will not get out of it. Prescribed Payments System . Mr CONNOLLY - I direct my question to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services. In view of the Treasurer's response to a recent question, can the Minister rule out the extension of the PPS to pharmacists and other providers of medical services? Would the extension of the PPS mean that pharmacists will have 20 per cent of their gross returns deducted by the Health Insurance Commission? Will the extension of the PPS mean that physiotherapists will have 20 per cent of their gross returns deducted by the accident compensation authorities? Perhaps he could also tell the House what the overall effect of the PPS will be on health services in Australia. Why will the Government not come clean on its secret tax agenda?",45
55,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"Mr Acting Speaker. Opposition members-Oh, oh! Mr DAWKINS......,.Well, you might as well save a lot of time and direct them all to me, because I am gomg to answer them. I want to reassert what I said before, that the prescribed payments system was foreshadowed in the 1982-83 Budget. It was implemented by this Government and includes a number of industries. I notice that the author of this scheme from the beginning always said that it was not a tax; it was simply a method of collecting tax which was otherwise payable. Whether or not we decide to extend it will be made perfectly clear in due course. On the question of secret taxes, I have noticed a publication in the name of Senator Campbell being distributed to the good electors of Canning, in which he purports to give an outline of the Liberal Party's approach to taxation. He talks about Fightback and says there are seven taxes which are to be abolished-and he goes through themincluding one which has already gone, the coal export duty, and including one which Opposition members now say they are not quite sure whether they want to abolish or not, and that is customs duty. They are not quite sure whether it is zero or negligible",46
56,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,It's zero.,46
57,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"Oh, Captain Zero says it is zero. Is that right-zero for everything? Mr Thckey- Mr Acting Speaker,'I rise on a point of order. The Standing Orders require that honourable members refer to other honourable members by their appropriate titles. We do not need that sort of comment.",46
58,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The honourable member for O'Connor is correct. The Treasurer should refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his appropriate title,' who should also assist the House by not interjecting across the table. I ask the Treasprer to withdraw the comment.",46
59,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"I withdraw the comment. One of the other taxes is the training guarantee levy, which is not a tax anyway, and is paid by Mr Costello-Yes, it is.",46
60,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,46
61,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,It is paid by Mr Costello interjecting,46
62,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I warn the honourable member for Higgins.,46
63,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"It is paid by 1,400 taxpayers and the total amount collected is about $3m. So this is one of the great things that the Opposition is to abolish. Where in this document are we told there is going to be a GST? Nowhere. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I have a point of order.",46
64,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,46
65,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"order! Members of the Government will restrain themselves. Mr Tim Fischer-Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I take a point of order understanding order 145. Whilst the Minister may be in order in digressing and adding to his answer on a completely separate subject, on the matter of Senator Campbell's pamphlet, he is not allowed to go on at length. It is not relevant to the original question. I ask that he be brought back to the original question or asked to resume his seat.",46
66,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I am sure the Treasurer is concluding his remarks on the matter of tax.,47
67,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"The question proceeded on the basis of secret taxes. Of course, Senator Campbell would like to keep secret, for very obvious reasons, the fact that they intend to impose a GST on everything, including many of the items which are sold by pharmacists. So if there is a question to be answered here, it is not by us. It is a question which has to be answered by the Opposition and a question which I am sure pharmacists throughout Australia would be fascinated to have answered. If we look at exemptions under the current wholesale sales tax we findMr Tim Fischer-Me Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. Clearly, the Minister has now moved even further away from the original question. You should ask him to resume his seat.",47
68,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The question related to tax, and the Treasurer is answering the question.",47
69,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,These items are exempt under the wholesale sales tax.,47
70,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"Me Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order.",47
71,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,I am telling you your secrets.,47
72,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,I have no problems with the truth. My point of order relates to standing order 145. The question was not on tax; it was on prescribed payments taxes-nothing else. It was that narrow.,47
73,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The Treasurer is in order.,47
74,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Me Acting Speaker, I wish to speak to the point of order. That was not a point of order against anything the Treasurer said; it was a direct attack on your ruling, that is disorderly.",47
75,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"Me Acting Speaker, I raise a further point of order. The Leader of the House has just wasted this Parliament's time. Let me repeat the question. The question asked on behalf of the pharmacy profession of Australia was whether the Government is going to impose prescribed payments taxes on its income.",47
76,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order.,47
77,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"Amongst the things that the pharmacists sell are bath seats for disabled or elderly persons, cotton wool, bandages, first aid kits, toothbrushes, contraceptives, sun screen preparations, sanitary pads, babies' nappies and so on. These are all exempt under the wholesale sales tax. But are they exempt under the GST? No, no, no! Senator Campbell should come clean and not only say that he intends to have a GST on everything but also tell the honourable member for Bradfield that it will apply to half or more of the things that the pharmacists sell so that the pharmacists become a tax agent for any Liberal government. Trade",47
78,Mr NEWELL,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. Can the Minister inform the House how the Government's trade policies have contributed to the dramatic increase in Australian exports over the past nine years?,47
79,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"What an intelligent question, Me Acting Speaker. Australians have a lot of difficulty believing they can be successful. Except for on the sporting field where we believe success is essential, Australians tend to doubt success stories. The Opposition does not believe we can actually be successful in Australia. Mr Broadbent-Tell us a joke.",47
80,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"You are the biggest joke I have seen in this place for a long time. The Leader of the Opposition traipses around the country telling Australians that we are lazy and that renters do not even mow their lawns. and He abuses people in interest groups that disagree with him; he thinks that no-one should live in a world beyond the fence of St John of Friedman and his econ'omic textbooks. Meanwhile this Government has been working hard to tum the economy around by encouraging Australia to do what we do best, and the success is real. Our export volumes have doubled since March 1983 when the Labor Government first took office. Growth in manufacturing exports in 1990 and 1991 has been the fastest in the OECD. In 1990 our export volumes grew twice as fast as the rate of growth of world trade. In 1991 our growth was four times the growth rate of world trade. So on the export front we are growing faster than the world; we are moving ahead of the world; we are catching up with our competitors. The sleepy decades of coalition government are behind us. The export-led recovery is real, and the cultural change in Australia that wi111ead us to even greater export growth is also real. This is a success story that all Australians own and can be proud of, which is why it is absurd that the Opposition has decided to deny the success and promulgate the kind of rubbish it has been putting around ever since the Leader of the Opposition went to Queensland. All this was done without any real policy basis. It was done purely to divert Queensland's attention away from the Opposition's two most embarrassing problems: its suicidal zero tariffs policy and the National Party. All it succeeded in doing was embarrassing itself even more both here and overseas. It has done nothing about the coalition split that is slowly widening in North Queensland sugar country and will spread through the coalition like the San Andreas Fault. This morning Bob Katter, that great man of the National Party, said on Country HourDr Hewson interjecting",47
81,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"He used to be a Minister there. He said: All of the Members of Parliament north of Brisbane-every single one of them, and as far as I know every single candidate north of Brisbane, has come out trenchantly opposed to any further reduction in the sugar tariffs. Certainly it's the National Party in Qld-they are trenchantly opposed to any further reduction in the sugar tariffs. How is that, Mr Zero?",48
82,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Minister should refer to the Leader by his appropriate title, and I ask him to withdraw.",48
83,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"I withdraw, Mr Acting Speaker. Of course, all this nonsense on trade we have been hearing in the last week comes from Queensland. The Opposition Leader was desperate to divert attention) away from this split, away from the sugar tariffs. He probably felt the earth moving as he spoke. So he attacked Japan. Mr Thckey- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. When we consult Pettifer we find that one of the responsibilities of Ministers is to answer questions according to their own responsibility, and to do so briefly and succinctly. The Minister has come in here with a handwritten answer for a dorothy dixer. He is far away from the relevance of the original request. This drivel is an insult to the Parliament.",48
84,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order. I am sure the Minister is close to concluding his answer.,48
85,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"If members of the Opposition do not think that the question of the sugar industry, which is one of our great export industries, is relevant to my answer, it shows how completely out of touch they are. The Leader of the Opposition engaged in all this nonsense on trade last week because of the embarrassment of the Opposition about its zero tariff policy and the way it would affect the export sugar industry. They had a little going for them. They could not believe their luck-out comes President Bush's EEP announcement. They almost thought that they had a trade policy. They could not believe their luck. They thought they had a policy within their grasp; that is, to attack everybody, retaliate, talk tough, and. not take no for an answer. It is totally negative, of course, but better than nothing. The problem is that there are no real ingredients in the souffle; there is nothing there, just hot air and wind. 'Retaliate', said the Leader of the National Party on Lateline. He said he wanted: . .. a degree of sensible retaliation without hurting yourself which is, I can see, not going to be an easy path. Mr Thckey- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order.",48
86,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for O'Connor is taking a succession of points of order. I remind him that the Chair is losing patience.,48
87,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,I am certainly being encouraged by the activities of the Ministers of the Government in answering questions.,49
88,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Get to your point of order.,49
89,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,I will. My point of order is on the matter of relevance. The Minister has just said something about sugar. His reference - o a souffle was about as close as he has got m the last five minutes. He is now talking about wheat.,49
90,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order.,49
91,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Acting Speaker, this is about the third time during. this answer that the honourable member has come up with an irrelevant point of order on relevance, and debated the subject in the course of it. A point of order is a highly specific technical discussion, not a debate. That is the third debating point that the honourable member for O'Connor has come up with; that is the third disorderly intervention.",49
92,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The Opposition should not misuse the system of points of order to disrupt the procedures of the House. The Minister will assist the House if he concludes his answer.,49
93,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"On the point of order Mr Acting Speaker: I thought there was qdite a bit of sugar in a souffle. Maybe the honourable member for Kooyong can help me. When asked how he would retaliate, the Leader of the National Party said: - ell then you cross that bridge when you come to It. This is the alternative Deputy Prime Minister proposing a tough trade policy: he will cross that bridge when he comes to it. The real shadow Minister for trade is not stupid. He is the one who told us on television last Sunday that he will have a sophisticated trade policy. Since then he has been quoted in the media as saying that he rules out retaliation against the United States. That is sophisticated. It is about time he took his country cousins aside and showed them some of his smooth ways. The reality is that the Opposition has no trade policy. s- it has to resort to bluster and bully, and this IS where the shadow Minister comes into his own. I invite the shadow Minister to cross Tim's bridge now before we come to it because we need a sophisticated approach to trade policy. .",49
94,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,I am sure the Minister has concluded his answer.,49
95,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"Mr Acting Speaker, I want to make one more point. . Opposition members-Come on, Ron!",49
96,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,I am sure the Minister has concluded his answer. Prescribed Payments System,49
97,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"I refer the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to the Budget announcement that the Government's hidden tax agenda could include the extension of the prescribed payments system to rope in other industries. Can the Minister rule out the extension of the PPS system to farmers and fishermen? Will the extension of PPS mean that fishermen have 20 per cent of their gross returns deducted? You basically said that in the Budget. Will wheat growers, dairy· farmers, wool growers and every other form of farmer also have 20 per cent of their returns deducted? That has been stated in the Budget. Why will the Government not come clean on its secret tax agenda?",49
98,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"This is a pathetic display on the part of the Mr L1oyd- Mr Acting Speaker, I asked my question of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, not of the Treasurer.",49
99,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the honourable member for Murray and I will name him next time he transgresses.,49
100,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"This is a pathetic display b- Opposition members. First of all, they raIsed the prospect of PPS on taxi drivers. I wonder whether these are the same taxi drivers on whom the Opposition is to impose a GST on 15 per cent of every fare they charge. Are these the same taxi drivers? In relation to farmers, is the Deputy Leader of the National party suggesting that farmers are tax dodgers? Mr Lloyd interjecting",49
101,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"I have not mentioned farmers. What I have done is quote from what your colleague sitting next to you said. I will repeat what the chap sitting next to you said: The measures outlined in this paperthat is, his measure, PPSare concerned solely with the reporting of income and collection of income tax correctly payable by persons who receive payments to which the system will apply. Is the Deputy Leader of the National Party saying that all the people he alluded to are the people they have identified to whom the PPS might be appropriate because they are not paying tax? You are the ones who have identified them. We have identified no-one. We have not even said that we are going to do it. We have said that we will tell you in due course, sooner rather than later. The other issue which the Government raised was the possibility of interest withholding tax. The shadow Treasurer has been running around saying that this was a secret tax which was going to be imposed on all kinds of people in respect of their interest. I thought I might remind the Opposition of a press release put out by the Leader of the Opposition in April 1990, when he said in part: Finally, Mr Reith is to examine a number of aspects of taxation policy. He is to investigate a numbl:lr of proposals to simplify tax system, in particular the collection of tax with a view to providing for many Australians not having to file an annual tax return. These proposals include the withholding tax on interest income rather than the present system of declaration. . . That was in April 1990. We have heard nothing since about this measure. What the Opposition has to say is what its plans are in response to the investigations by the honourable member for Flinders of the interest withholding system and what it proposes to do about it. Motor Vehicle Industry",50
102,Mr SCHOLES,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I remind the Treasurer that recently the Ford Motor Co. and Backwell IXL in my electorate have announced substantial export orders, particularly in respect of the automotive industry. Is the Treasurer able to infonn the House, particularly in view of recent attacks on the industry, of the perfonnance of the automobile industry in advancing Australian exports?",50
103,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question and acknowledge his diligence in promoting the interests of a manufacturing industry in the Geelong area. Geelong is a well-known centre. for the motor vehicle industry. He rightly refers to the success on the export side of that particular industry and, in the case of Geelong, Ford, as part of the very successful enterprise that Ford has been involved in in exporting Capris, the components of the panels being, in fact, made in Geelong. The honourable member for Corio also refers to the fact that Ford has recently been successful in gaining its first export order to Japan-approximately $30m worth of engine blocks-creating about 50 new jobs. He also refers to Blackwell IXL, Which is now going to invest a little under $lm to employ more people in order to fulfil another export contract which it has been able to achieve. This is the industry which has been singled out for special attention by the Opposition, to the point where the industry is unclear about where its future lies. It is important to realise that there are people who know about this industry, not just those who are vilified by the Leader of the Opposition-those people whom he says are system part of a wicked conspiracy with the Government to undennine Opposition policy. There are others who have actually investigated this industry and have some knowledge of it. I refer particularly to Bill Scales when he was the Chief Executive of the Automotive Industry Authority, not in the lap of the industry, but independent and responsible for the implementation of the Button car plan. What did he say when confronted in an interview in which he did like a dinner the honourable member for Barker? He said, 'The Opposition's zero tariff policy would result in the loss of 40,000 to 45,000 jobs now involved in automotive manufacture in Australia'. Unless Mr Scales is going to join the Hewson hate list, he could not be said to have had any vested interest in making a comment such as that. He was concerned about the future of this industry and how it developed. The Opposition Leader has been making all kinds of crazy accusations about the Government and the chief executives of motor companies. I want to confess: I did have a discussion with the head of Robert Bosch, Mr Hans Hugendubel, at a dinner in Melbourne with a number of other business people. He said to me on that occasion that the company had decided to put on ice an investment plan involving $40m to $50m in the electorate of Hotham because it was unclear about whether there would be a car industry here at the end of this decade.",50
104,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,Hotham will have a new member.,51
105,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"I name the honourable member for Murray. Motion (by Mr Beazley) put: That the honourable member for Murray be suspended from the service of the House. A division having been called and the bells being rung Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I am wondering whether you might entertain, with indulgence, an apology from the Deputy Leader so that this matter might be dealt with in a proper way.",51
106,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Murray had previously been warned and was defying the Chair, and he proceeded to interject yet again. The Leader of the House has moved a motion.",51
107,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"Mr Acting Speaker, it is not my intention to go against your wishes. I made a comment. Surely I am allowed to make some comment. It was not an interjection in that sense. I had no desire to interfere with the exercising of your responsibility.",51
108,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The Chair considered it an interjection.,51
109,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,I apologiSe if I did.,51
110,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"In which case, if the honourable member for Murray wishes to take that course of action, the Chair would not wish to proceed. But I now depend upon the Leader of the House.",51
111,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I withdraw the motion. Motion withdrawn.,51
112,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,I thank the honourable member for Murray. The matter is dealt with.,51
113,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Why didn't I think of that?,51
114,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"Some of us has have had more experience with these things than others. The Chief Executive of Bosch said that it is producing to the local market and wants to continue to do so. It wishes to invest $40m ()r $5Om in order to continue its operation. I said to the Chief Executive, Mr Hans Hugendubel, 'What do you need? What assurances do you need to ensure that you go ahead with that investment?'. He said, 'I need only one assurance, and that is that there will be a continuity of the current car plan in Australia'. A continuity of the current car plan in Australia is all he needs. This would provide the basis for that investment to proceed in 1994 or 1995 in order to extend the operation of Bosch in this country. The Leader of the Opposition is always keen to set hurdles for other people. Only the other night, he thought he would set some targets for the Prime Minister in terms of his forthcoming visit to Japan. I set a target for the Leader of the Opposition. Why does he not remove the one obstacle which would prevent Robert Bosch Australia, a leading German company, investing $4Om or $5Om in Victoria in a manufacturing industry in order to extend its operation here? He can remove that barrier by simply making one statement, and that is, 'The car plan, as it exists, will remain'. That is all he has to do in order to ensure that investment proceeds and the employment that goes with it extends. Employment",51
115,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I am happy to take up the challenge to get rid of the Prime Minister and the Government, and that will solve the problem.",51
116,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition should ask his question.,51
117,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister, and it relates to jobs, the issue that was addressed in the Treasurer's last answer. The Prime Minister would be aware that the latest ABS figures show that employment in the private sector has plummeted to 1987 levels. Is it a fact that nearly 180,000 private sector jobs-just to set his comments in context-were wiped out in the last year? How many more Australians are in work today because of your One Nation promises? How many more Australians are in work today because of your Budget promises? When will the Government admit that it really has no plan to create one million jobs for the unemployed in Australia?",52
118,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"That is 180,000 jobs off the 1.8 million since 1983-180,000 too many, but 180,000 off the 1.8 million since 1983. In 1983, the labour market was around six million. By late 1989, early 1990, it was 7.8 million. It has since declined. It is a pity that it has, but we had five times as much employment growth in those nine years as we had in the seven years of the previous Government. That is, almost a million of those jobs would not have been there had the economic performance of the then Government continued. In other words, if we had kept the same rate of employment growth as the honourable member for Bennelong was able to generate-advised by the honourable member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition-there would be about one million fe-er Australians employed today. We have participation rates in this country of around 63 per cent. In countries like the United States it is 56 and 57 per cent. If we were comparing their participation rates with our unemployment rate, it would be well in the middle single-digit numbers. Or, indeed, if we were even comparing our participation rate of 1982 with that of today, unemployment would be well under 10 per cent. It is a matter of great pride to us that Australians are encouraged to look for work and that the participation rate is high, because people want to find jobs, particularly for women who, under these policies, found so many jobs throughout the 1980s-policies which put a focus upon employment growth and economic growth in particular, which were not run by some sort of anti-inflation objective solely but as a result of which we had declining and decelerating inflation as well as accelerating employment. Does the Leader of the Opposition really think that a 15 per cent addition in tax is going to help employment? The total income tax raises $49 billion in prospect for this year. The GST raises $27 billion. That is over half the income tax. Does the Leader of the Opposition believe that such a huge tax impost across the economyDr Kemp interjecting",52
119,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Goldstein!,52
120,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"These must be the only people in the world who believe that one can actually improve employment, make employment better, by whacking a 15 per cent great tax on value adding. If you believe that employment is important, why do you want to put 15 per cent on the employment content of Australian product? Why do you want to put 15 per cent on the value added in Australian product? How by any warped, twisted sense of logic do you believe that, against a record of three times the OECD average employment growth, of five times your own, you can put a 15 per cent tax on all products in the economy and that that, by some black magic, is going to produce more employment? You have got to be joking! You regard the unemployed as a buffer at the end of the station. They can take the impact of your crazy economic policies. They can take the impact of your so-called adjustment-just like they did in Britain, just like they have throughout other parts of the developed world, but which they have not done in Australia under Labor. The fact is that the economic stimulus that we now have in place with the One Nation package, with the youth package and with the Budget is about twice the 1983-84 stimulusbut still it is about half the stimulus that has been put there by Japan. It is a responsible level of support for activity in the economy and it will produce a growth in output and a growth in employment-something that the current Opposition has no interest in whatsoever because it believes, foolishly, that remedy is to put a 15 per cent tax on all goods and services in the economy. This can be a recipe for only higher unemploymentand, of course, with it, six to seven percentage points addition to inflation, six to seven percentage points addition to interest rates and, with that, a slower low growth economy. Reserve Bank of Australia",52
121,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can he tell the House whether the Government is satisfied with the current charter of the Reserve Bank of Australia and whether he believes a so-called independent Reserve Bank is consistent with parliamentary democracy? .,53
122,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"There has been a debate in this country about the role of the Reserve Bank, about its supposed independence or otherwise. I have said on a number of occasions that Mr Thckey-I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. The second part of standing order 144, on page 43, states: Questions should not ask Ministers(a) for an expression of opinion; The Prime Minister has just been asked to express his opinion on how the Reserve Bank should operate in a democracy.",53
123,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order.,53
124,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I have said in the Parliament on a number of occasions that governments and parliaments should be the supreme and accountable bodies to the public of Australia and that the right balance exists between the powers of the Reserve Bank under its legislation and the prerogatives of the government. That is an appropriate balance between the prerogatives of the government and the rights and entitlements of the Reserve Bank board. I have said that the existing arrangements work well, that the Reserve Bank Act is crafted well to encourage the board and the government to agree, and that price stability and full employment are the dual objectives. They were well the constructed when the Act was written and they remain well constructed. Against that view, we have had a view put by the Opposition that the Reserve Bank is not independent, that it is politically manipulated, as the Leader of the Opposition has said. In his Fightback! document on page 38 he says: We will also legislate to give the Reserve Bank effective independence and a clear mandate to achieve medium term price stability. There is no mention of full employment-just medium term price stability with a clear legislative mandate for effective independence. He then says: But all changes to monetary policy will be decided by the Bank Boardnot by the government and the bank board. That is in the official document. He went on to say, in remarks, that I am attacking the issue of the Reserve Bank, et cetera. I discovered a very interesting article in the economic papers of the Economic Society of Australia and New Zealand, published in February 1980. There is a long piece-18 pages-by'the Leader of the Opposition about the Reserve Bank, its independence and its charter. It makes very interesting reading because if ever the charge 'erratic' could stick, it will stick here. The article is unbelievable. It says: In simple terms, it needs to be decided whether such an institution would be undemocraticthat is, an independent central bankIs it realistic or tolerable to contemplate the - tablishment of an independent central bank in a parliamentary democracy as exists in Australia? However, I would suggest that a fully independent central bank would be inconsistent with our system of parliamentary democracy. At the risk of oversimplification and idealism, the fundamental concepts of our system are those of accountability and responsibility. The Parliament is elected and is responsible to the people. The Executive Government is responsible to the people. The essence of this process is that responsibility and authority go together. Against this background, it would seem to be intolerable to establish an organisation to conduct monetary policy whereby such control could be vested in the hands of a few people, who would not be subject to supervision by either government or parliament, and who would need to take no account of the views· of the electorate. Furthermore, I doubt whether making such an institution free of politi<;:al control would sarily depoliticise that institution. It goes on to say: To summarise, as the elected government must bear the ultimate responsibility for economic policy formulation and execution, the central bank should, in the limit, be subservient to governments. There is no talk about independence; there is no talk about Reserve Bank charters and there is no talk about legislation. The article says: We cannot seriously contemplate a situation where the Bank could set out to negate the economic policies that have been settled on by the government and/or the parliament. Let me read some of the pearls in the conclusion: To conclude, I feel that it would be difficult to improve upon the drafting of the existing sections of the Reserve Bank Act dealing with the Bank's relations. Talk about erratic! Talk about immature! It continues: As a statement of principle, they are adequate. The key thing is how they work in practice and, at this level, the relationship seems, on the whole, worked reasonably well. There are a few examples of the Bank having ""gone off on its own track"" for extended periods. The Bank has generally accepted that the Government carried ultimate responsibility for economic policy formulation and execution and seems to have generally established a reasonable and helpful working relationship with successive governments. There has been no change in the constitutional arrangements since then and, if anything has happened since then, by moving to a quantity-based system with the float, the bank has more institutional independence. But, still, the Leader of the Opposition wrote this in a careful and serious way for a major book on papers, an IS-page printed document. During his period as adviser he wrote this and then he went on with the bile against Bernie Fraser while proposing that Mr Tim Marcus Clark might be the Governor of the Reserve Bank; that is, the career bureaucrat I had never met before I became a Minister-he was recommended to me by Mr Stone, was supported by Mr Howard for appointment as Secretary to the Treasury and was properly appointed as Governor of the Reserve Bank-has been berated, attacked and politicised by you while you propose the neceslikes of Tim Marcus Clark to replace him. What a disgrace! In addition to that, when you talk about giving the Reserve Bank independence, a right to construct monetary policy absolutely and alone without reference to the Government, and when you simply tum over all of the sensible tenets reflecting every view I have put in this place, and that the Governor has put in his remarks-every sensible view existing around the current Reserve Bank Act-what do you do? You simply make a cheap political point, saying that the Reserve Bank has been manipulating interest rates. The whole of the Fightback policy is constructed basically on a policy that the Leader of the Opposition does not believe in, a policy which at earlier stages he said had worked well with an appropriate balance between the bank and the Government where the elected people of Australia should have authority. This is the erratic, immature behaviour of to have a person who has known better and will now do anything to attract attention, anything to be different, anything to be malicious. That is why Australian business, that is why the Treasury, that is why the Reserve Bank and all these people take no notice of him. They regard him as an extremist but most of all regard him as irrelevant. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",53

Whatever the Advertiser said about it, I did not say that. I said that Mr Quinn had told me that and I do not accept Mr Quinn's explanation. I want to make that explanation and say, in answer to the Prime Minister's allegation, that Mr Quinn from Mitsubishi has not made any determination as to whether that new investment will take place, even under the Government's policy.

148,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The parlous state of Australia's private sector job market. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",56
149,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I think there would be common agreement across this House, as indeed across the whole country, that far and away the most important problem that faces Australia at the present time and far and away the most important political and economic challenge facing all of the men and women that represent the people of Australia in this Parliament is the issue the parlously high level of unemployment in - ustralia at the present time. Every single lssue that we discuss in this Parliament and every single debate that we engage in in this Parliament ought to be related back to what contribution it might make to a solution to Australia's unemployment problem. Over the past few weeks, and most intensively over the past two days, this Parliament and the media of this country have been subjected to a debate about the issue of tariff protection. Tariff protection is of course an age old debate in Australia. It is always easy to run an emotional debate about tariff protechave tion at a time of high unemployment. We have high unemployment at the present time and of course the Government is going for broke on the issue of tariff protection. As I address the matter of public importance which is before the House, I want to take a moment to say something about the absolute humbug and hypocrisy of this Government with regard to tariff protection. The simple, unassailable fact is that when it comes to the pure issue of tariff policy there is no difference between the policy of the Government and the policy of the Opposition. It is an absolute travesty by that master of misrepresentation, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for him to parade around this country and this Parliament and say that the Government's policy on tariffs is over here and that our policy on tariffs is miles away the other side of the argument. Our. policy on motor vehicles, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has pointed out on numerous occasions, is a tariff of up to 5 per cent by the year 2000. The Government's policy is 15 per cent. Does anybody who understands anything about the functioning of the Australian economy, and most particularly the man who was Treasurer when the Australian dollar was floated and this country embraced a floating exchange rate, deny that in an era of floating exchange rates the difference between 5 per cent and 15 per cent is absolutely immaterial? For all practical purposes, they know, he kngWS and anybody who understands the way the Australian of economy operates ought to know that there is absolutely no difference of substance in any way, shape or form between the tariff policy of the Government and the tariff policy of the Opposition so far as a pure comparison of our attitude towards tariffs is concerned. There is, however, one overwhelming difference when we look at the totality of our approach to this issue:· unlike the Government, we are going to rip away billions of dollars of costs that burden Australian business and Australian industry through the introduction of our Fightback package. We are saying to the manufacturers of Australia, 'Yes, you will negligible tariff levels by the year 2000, but years before that you will have benefited to the tune of billions of dollars of removal of your cost burdens'. So let us have none of this puerile humbug from the Prime Minister, puerile humbug from Senator Button, and puerile humbug from some of their acolytes in the Australian media about there being some chasm between the Government and the Opposition on the pur.e question of tariffs, because if people beheve that the Opposition's tariff policy is one of negligible levels by the year 2000, they must also believe the same thing of the Government in an environment of floating exchange rates. The Prime Minister is no stranger to the art of misrepresentation; he is no stranger to deliberately distorting the facts in an aron gument; he is no stranger to sweeping aside the relevance of fact and the relevance of truth when it comes to confronting a political or economic issue in this country. On the subject of the matter of public importance-that is, employment-we had another example in Question Time today; The Prime Minister actually stood there at the despatch box and said that, unlike other countries, the Australian Labor Government does not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of the railway track. They were his words: unlike other nations, we do not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of the railway track. Let us have a look at those other countries. I think that, if most Australians were asked to compare our economy with four other nations, they would instinctively say America, Japan, Britain and Germany. Others might have a different mix, but I think the majority of Australians, when they think of international comparisons, would still probably grab those four countries. Honourable members should remember that, unlike the rest of the world, we do not use the unemployed as a buffer; we are pure; we reach out, put an arm around them, bring them forward, look after them and are compassionate towards them. What is the unemployment level in Japan? It is 2.1 per cent. What is the unemployment level in the United States? It is 7.2 per cent. What is the unemployment level in Germany? It is 6.8 per cent. What is the unemployment rate in the dreaded Thatcherite Britain, that scorched earth relic of all these terrible policies that they inveigle against? 11te unemployment rate in the United Kingdom is 9.8 per cent. In other words, we, the nation of Australia, whose Government does not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of the railway track, have a lamentably worse unemployment record than countries such as Germany and Japan, .a markedly worse unemployment level than the United Kingdom and a dramatically worse unemployment level than the United States. If we look at the scale of world comparison, we see that the Prime Minister of this country is the world's greatest disemployer. He really takes the cake, the prize, for having put more people out of work, comparatively, than any other country with which it is reasonable to compare the Australian economy. The Leader of the House, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who is sitting opposite me, can talk all he likes about participation rates, he can talk all he likes about those sorts of comparisons, just as I can talk all I like ,about the number of unemployed people in Australia. Those of us who represent Australians in this place would know quite well that, as well as the 11.1 per cent of our fellow country men .. and women who cannot get a job, there are probably another 8 or 9 per cent who are working a two-day week, a three-day week or a four-day week as an alternative to losing their jobs. So the true unemployment and under-employment rate in this country is probably around 20 per cent, or one ,in five. That is the measure of the despair, and that is the measure of the achievement of this disemploying Prime Minister. This is the man who takes the prize as the great disemployer of the 1990s; this is the man who will use the legitimate fear of those people to stir up' an emotive argument on the issue of tariff protection. I know that the issue of tariff protection is capable of emotional distortion. I remind the Prime Minister that when we made announcements on· tariff changes in 1988 he had the support of the Opposition. We did not play politics with the issue, as the Government shamefully is at present, to its great condemnation. It is playing blatant politics with the issue. It is distorting the situation because it is trying to divert attention away from its total failure on the issue of unemployment. The Government is trying to take the focus of the Australian people away from the fact that a Labor Government of almost 10 years standing has presided over the worse unemployment level in this nation since the years of the Great Depression. That is something-and the Minister who is at the table, is probably quite proud of this-:that would make Labor predecessors such as Curtin and Chifley spin in their graves. It is an achievement of which anybody who is dedicated to the interests of working men and women in this country would be absolutely ashamed. Rather than confront it; rather than try to debate the issue in an intelligent fashion; rather than try. to explain to the House why it is that 180,000 people in the private sector have lost their jobs over the last 12 months; rather than try to explain to the Australian people why there has been a decline of 4.2 per cent since the middle of 1989, which was the employment peak, in the number of people employed in the private sector; and rather than trying to acknowledge and attempt to embrace some long term policies to improve the Australian economy, the Government is to its great shame engaging in a disreputable fear campaign and trying to generate a policy difference that Government members know deep down in their hearts does not really exist. 1 could believe the Prime Minister if he up and said, 'I have changed my mind and am now in favour of high tariffs'. But this prime hypocrite, this great destroyer of Australian jobs, has stood up in this Parthe liament and tried to generate a difference that he, better than most in this Parliament, must know in his quieter moments simply does not exist. He is doing all of this in the name of grubby game. diverting the gaze. The old injunction about bread and circuses is very true about the Prime Minister. We have had lots of circuses, but probably not a lot of bread over the 12 months. We have had flags; we have had republics; we have had constitutional debates. Now we are having a great phoney, diverting debate abou- a non-existent difference betmillions ween the Government and the Opposition on the question of tariff protection. All of this being done in the name of diverting public gaze from headlines about private employers losing 180,000 jobs, and from the fact that Government's unemployment record is disp.m.)-It gracefully worse than the unemployment record of countries with which it is. fair make comparisons. The.. Minister for Employment, Education and Training will no. doubt reply to this debate. 1 personally have some regard him. 1 do not need to remind hiril that he on a razor's edge in his seat of Swan Western Australia. If my reading when 1 was last in Perth is correct, this will perhaps the penultimate matter of public importance that the· honourable member for Swan takes fact in this place. 1 say to the Minister that the Australian people are seriously interested down in hearing from those men and women opposite about this fundamental problem of unemployment. The Government should not try to address it by generating phoney disputes that do not exist. The Leader of the House knows as well as 1 do that there is no difference of substance between the attitude of the two parties in this Parliament on the issue of tariff protection. One of the things this Parliament has achieved over the last few years, and something which should be supported and extolled and not dragged into the gutter of point· scoring politics, is that on a few national interest got issues we have been able to reach a degree of 1 bipartisanship. The Government got those tariff cuts through in 1988 without political flak because we supported it. We did not play grubby game of trying to exploit fear and loathing on a difference that did not exist, and it is a great disgrace that on this occasion the honourable member has decided to play that But he is doing it for one reason: he is in deep shame about the Government's record on unemployment. The Labor Government is in last deep shame about what it has done on the issue of unemployment. It deserves to be condemned not only for the slump in private sector employment but for the hopes of of Australians that it, through its reckless economic policies, has destroyed and is sent to the depths of dismay and despair.",57
150,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Swan-Minister for the Employment, Education and Training) (3.21 is a very significant speech that we have just heard from the honourable member to for Bennelong· (Mr Howard), the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations. It is significant not because of its argumentS, all of which can be readily countered, but because of the honourable member's position. We for have here the man who is undeniably the sits most effective conservative spokesman in in Australia and the only real conservative politician, as opposed to ideologue, on the be other side of the House, attempting desperately to correct a positioning that in reflects real differences but is politically extraordinarily foolish-that is, a political deep positioning by his Leader and other inexperienced members of his front bench. With all the skills he has developed over the years in this place, and they are considerable, he is unable to achieve that outcome. He undoubtedly comforted, to some degree at least, members on the back bench opposite who have been looking extraordinarily glum over the last couple of days as they have had to confront the consequences of the exposure of the real positions and real differences of our two political parties. They have relied here on a man they spurned so disgracefully a couple of years ago and who, on any reasonable criteria for party leadership, ought to be the leader of their party now. They sought comfort from him, but there is no comfort to be had. The simple fact of the matter is that now we and the Opposition in this country, on the management of economic policy, the direction in which we want this country to go at any level-be it on tariff policy, on taxation policy, on industry policy, on education policy, on labour market policy generallyare as chalk and cheese. There has been no point in the history of this country, except perhaps at its very formation, when the differences between the political parties on these issues, and the philosophies underlying them, have been so diverse. For anyone who is in the business of real conservative politics, properly defined, that is a disaster. It is a disaster more for the honourable member for Bennelong, who comes from a different generation of real conservative politicians, than it is for those on the front bench who are here not for the long haul but to experiment with the lives of the people of this nation. They include some extremely wealthy men-and that is not to be held against them, but it is held against them when they are seen as short term players in the political life of this country who will walk in, experiment, fiddle around with the system and, if their activities fail, will of course 'That is a tragedy, but we are off'. We had - example of that recently when the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) was pinned with the obvious in his argument about who was telling the truth, he or a car manufacturer in South Australia, about what that particular car manufacturer had to say to him. At the end of the day, when presented with the unassailable evidence of the person who said he simply would not invest and that therefore logically there would be a certain consequence as far as employment was concerned, all the honourable member for Barker could say was that that would be a tragedy. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in different places and at different times, has likewise expressed himself as a comet flashing across the firmament of Australian politics to disappear on the other side. That is not a conservative politician's attitude to political life in this country. That is the attitude of a vandal. That is exactly what we now have in Opposition policy: vandal politics. There is a very substantial difference between us on tariffs and on the car plan. Let us look at the features of the car plan John Button put in place. It was to go through a phased reduction in tariffs with a set of objectives in place to make the car industry more export oriented and rationalised. It was a classic ministerial-governmental-industrial plan to make that industry more effective and competitive. It was interventionist; there is no question about that. It was not a product of laissez faire attitudes; it was a product designed to ensure the survival of the Australian car industry. At the conclusion of the process, we had a rationalised but surviving car industry in this country. It was interventionist. It was the type of policy that conservative politicians would have found readily acceptable in the 1960s and 1970s; one that people whom the Liberal Party is always prepared to hold up as icons of conservative leadership in this country would have understood, and one which could have been readily accepted by those folk, in a bipartisan way, back in 1988, but cannot be say, accepted by the Liberal Party front bench now. I suspect the honourable member for Bennelong would dearly love them to be able to do that. The simple fact is that Opposition members are indifferent to the survival of the car industry. Their view to take that 15 per cent to. nil or thereabouts is fundamentally based on that. Opposition members cannot get.away with the repeated comments that have been made by their leader, that if the car industry is capable of hacking it, that is fine; if it is not, it does not matter all that much-or they do not care. That is the position that has been adopted repeatedly by their Opposition leader. People in the car industry know it because he has said to them, directly and openly, that their survival is it matter of considerable indifference to him. If they can hack it in the system he sets up, good; if they cannot, too bad. In that attitude alone, the differences between us are like chalk and cheese, and there are employment consequences of that. Opposition members cannot come into this place and argue concern for employment in the private sector and at the same time reject a plan which both the car industry and the Government which has planned it agree will maintain a particular level of employment in the car sector and additional investment, then say that that central planning and that attitude is absolutely an anathema to them. Opposition members cannot say that, as far as they are concerned, whether or not the outcome of their policies is survival of the car industry is a matter of complete indifference to them and then claim that there are similarities between our policies. There are no similarities between our policies on the matter of tariff and the way in which Government relates to the car industry-none whatsoever. Trying to pretend, as the Leader of the Opposition does, is smart politics to try to get the conservative party back on· its traditional road in this country, but it is smart politics that conceals the facts of the matter, which are increasingly being exposed as the press, the car industry and the working people in this country come to understand the real agenda of the Leader of the Opposition. I agree with one· thing that the Opposition spokesman on employment matters said; that is, all members of this House view the situation of the unemployed· people and the levels of unemployment in this country as a national tragedy which has to be corrected. We are all agreed on that. There is no question about that. But we are in total disagreement about how that is to be done. As far as statistics are concerned-and 'the honourable member for Bennelong argued statistics in supporting his case-one or two things should be said. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, in mentioning the statistics we do not in any· way resile from the fact that it is anything but a tragedy that 180,000 people have lost jobs this year. We are not arguing that point, but since the Opposition has introduced the. statistics into the debate there are one or two things worth saying. Since we have been in office our job creation rate has been five times that of the Opposition's. In this recession the jobs that have subsequently been lost amount to some 12 per cent of the jobs that were created in the period that we have been in office. Jobs' lost during the 1982-83 recession constituted some 40 per cent of the jobs that had been created in the period of the Liberal-Country Party Government from 1975 to 1983. We cannot escape from those statistics; they happen to be facts. The Opposition leader-well, the honourable member for Bennelong, who should be Opposition leader-spoke about the comparisons between the United Kingdom and us. We were told, 'Let's not talk about participation rates'. But let us indeed talk about participation rates. That massive job growth that we have seen in this country over the past decade has been accompanied by a set of increases in participation rates. It reflects the fact that more people in this country believe they have more of an opportunity to work than has ever been the case before. More people in this country believe that they have that opportunity to work than is the position in most countries with which we compare ourselves, including those that the honourable member for Bennelong mentioned, The fact is that in those circumstances the actual basic unemployment rate-figures such as 9,8 per cent, 11.1 per cent, 10.3 percent and all the rest of it-are calculated against an assessed participation rate. If the participation rate is low, the figures go down. If it is high, they go up. Unless we get a strict participation rate comparison between the two, we do not have a comparative picture of what levels of unemployment are like country on country, or era on era. It is no surprise that the Liberals take that view, because in 1982-83 some 60 per cent of our people regarded themselves as participating in the work force. That figure is now about 63 1/2 per cent. Therefore, the Opposition's figure of 10.3 per cent unemployment at the peak of the period of recession under the Liberal-Country Party, Government roughly equates with a figure of about 14 per cent unemployment now. So our 11 per cent figure ought to be compared with a figure of 14 per cent at that point of time. There is nothing that excuses it, but since the spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition introduced these statistics as points of comparison, it is legitimate for us to argue them. Let me take the position in Britain. Britain is two or three percentage points behind us in participation rates. Hence, if the United Kingdom had our levels of participation in the work force, if it had encouraged women into the work force in the way in which women have been encouraged into the work force since we have been in office, the British unemployment rates. would be somewhere between 13 and 14 per cent. I am cheerful enough about the proposition of the Opposition spokesman to make comparisons between those countries because Thatcherite policies have produced very much larger Budget deficits than we happen to be operating here as Britain seeks to correct the particular problems with which it has to deal. It is necessary to keep those things in mind to understand the extent to which we are relating our unemployment situation to the position in other countries. Mr Broadbent-It is 14 per cent in Victoria.",59
151,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"That is an interesting comment. If Victoria had New South Wales's participation rate, the level of unemployment in Victoria would be about 9.8 per cent. If, on the other hand, New South Wales had Australia's participation rate, the level of unemployment in New South Wales would be about 12 per cent. New South Wales has one of the lowest rates of participation in the country, but there will be more about that in another debate. We have talked about the fact that we arrive at tariff policies from totally different ideological positions. Our Party contemplates it, can accept it, wants to keep it within reason, but acknowledges the fact that we do not operate internationally on a level playing field. The Opposition has an alternative point of view to that. We come to the area of taxation policy. The Opposition hopes to remove billions of dollars in taxation from business. It will not. The Opposition's position on taxation is fundamentally a tax on labour and on business. That is what a value added tax is. In other countries that have introduced value added taxes it has had nothing to do with improving industrial efficiency and everything to do with revenue raising. I refer to countries with much larger public sectors than ours that have exhausted their capacity to levy income taxes on people. That is basically all there is to it. So those countries introduce consumption taxes. A consumption tax is to be introduced in this country and it will be paid in the first instance and, in many cases, the last instance, by business. It will be $27 billion. When the Opposition makes that shift-make no mistake about this-it cannot afford any sliding around the edges. This tax has to be ruthlessly enforced on business. The Opposition cannot allow deductions or anything like that. If it allows a hole like that to develop in its revenue raising, it will be in deep trouble. There can be none of the slip-sliding that sometimes takes place on things such as payroll tax and wholesale tax. There cannot be any slip-sliding on this one. This has to be a doozey. The Opposition has to get straight into it. Mr Broadbent-Petrol tax.",62
152,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The question of payroll tax is quite interesting in that regard, because some 60 per cent of businesses in this country do not pay payroll tax. The other interesting thing-and here we come to the Liberal Party's secret tax-is: how does it get rid of payroll tax? It can get rid of payroll tax only by persuading the States to do it. It can persuade the States to do it only if it gives them at least some level of control-and adjustable control-over some area of taxation currently levied by the Commonwealth. That tax is 30 per cent of the taxation base of the States. They are not simply going to hand 30 per cent of their taxing powers to the Commonwealth. Of course, once it is adjusted, another tax is imposed. There is either a State GST or a State income tax effectively in operation. These are anti-business policies; they are antinor employment policies. Like the tariff policies, they are anti-employment policies. We are debating in this place not just the tragedy of unemployment, but also what we intend to do about it. The Opposition is proposing to oppose the pump-priming measures that we, and any other common sense government, would put in place and proposing instead a massive shift in taxation arrangements, which must massively dis-benefit business and disbenefit employment.

153,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I could not agree more with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that the difference between the Government and the coalition on the labour market is like the difference between chalk and cheese. The Government has one million Australians out of work and 11 per cent unemployed. I do not blame him for leaving the chamber. He would not want to hear what I am saying about the Government experimenting with the lives of Australians. The Government has indulged in the greatest experiment of all with the lives of Australians by putting one million Australians out of work The Leader of the House sought to denigrate as unworthy those serving in this place who happen to have been commercially successful. In that respect, he had some specific things to say about the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). I would have thought that the people of Australia, considering the performance of this Government, would be pretty happy to have some people in this House who have some demonstrated commercial success. If there is one thing that Australia needs, it is some decent, commercial and economic management. In Question Time today, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was asked a question-as my friend the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has said-in relation to what the One Nation package did and what the Budget did about the creation of jobs. Did he answer either question? No. Why not? Because the One Nation statement did nothing about the creation of jobs. The Budget has not done, will it do, anything about the creation of jobs. The Leader of the House, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, made oilly a glancing reference to the 180,000 jobs that have been lost. He said, 'It is not that bad anyway, because it is only 12 per cent of the jobs that were created'. But let me tell the House what the ABS statistics for the March 1992 quarter say about employed wage and salary earners in Australia. They say that at the peak of employment, jobs in the private sector totalled 4,570,000, and that figure is now down to 4,090,000. That is a drop, not of 180,000 jobs as he inferred, but of 480,000 jobs. In 21/2 years",63
154,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,It is only 35 per cent.,63
155,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"That is right. Nearly half a million jobs have been lost in the private sector in the last 21/2 years-an absolutely disgraceful performance by this Government. The question now is: where are we with jobs overall? The answer to that is that we have an employment rate of 11 per cent. Let me give some of the quotes. One article began: The Federal Government was cautiously optimistic It later continued: The Prime Minister, ... remained 'very unhappy' It went on to state that the unemployment benefit figures issued by the Department of Social Security showed a continuing increase in the number of long term unemployed. It also stated that the number of Australians out of work for a year or more rose to 340,000 in July, an increase of 18,000 over the month of July from June. The article continued: The ABS said that its seasonally adjusted estimates put the national unemployment figure in July at 959,600 ... On top of that we now have the ANZ Group job ad series. This came out a couple of days ago. What does that say? The first thing that it shows is that we have had a 1.1 per cent fall in the number of job as over the last three months. The ANZ economist said: The . . . series suggests the employment market remains virtually static Where is the hope for the unemployed when the job market is virtually static? He continued: It seems clear from recent trends that employment growth during this recovery cycle will be weaker than during past cycles, reflecting the weakness of business sector activity . . . That is, weakness in the perfonnance of the private sector. Incidentally, the two bad perfonners over the past 12 months in job as have been Queensland with minus 2.4 per cent and South Australia with minus 10.1 per cent. Other headlines have been, 'Job ad figures dampen hopes of recovery', 'Job as survey bad news for labour market recovery' and 'Data shows labour market remains weak, job as static'. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in relation to the whole question of unemployment, which is worse in the private sector than in the public sector-three or four times worse-said that he did not expect a substantial lift in new jobs until the end' of this year or early next year. We can get a lift in employment in the private sector only if something happens about private sector investment. I quote from an observation on business investment by Syntec, published in the 3 July edition of Business Review Weekly: Chart 1 presents the core of this malaise: a and continuing slump in business investment, quite unlike the short slump in investment in 1982-83. The present deep hole in business investment . . . Nothing can be done about that deep hole while our balance of payments continues to run at tragic levels because, as the balance of payments continues to run at these high levels, so we will get a tendency towards an increase in interest rates. Government members should watch the pressure on interest rates over the next six months before the election. They will not do anything about them, for political reasons. But, if they watch the market, they will see those long tenn rates edge up and up. What business will invest when it sees long tenn interest rates in the real market creeping higher and higher? All this is bad for investment and hence bad for the whole question of job creation. There has to be an answer for the private sector job market. But it is not the Labor Party with its former deliberate and brutal high interest rate policy. It is not the Labor Party with the recession that we had to have. It is not the Labor Party with one million unemployed or with the collapse in private sector jobs-and it is not the Labor Party with its One Nation and its Budget. The answer is Fightback, because Fightback presents a whole series of steps designed to improve job creation. Fightback is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to fix Australia. Central to that plan is the whole question of industrial relations refonn-the ability of employers and employees to meet with each other and reach enterprise agreements so that productivity and competitiveness can be improved. Fightback will also give us the kind of micro-economic refonn that we need in order to make the Australian economy more competitive. Finally, I wish to say a little bit about privatisation because privatisation will create jobs. Removing the government business enterprises from government controls and removing government interference for political purposes will increase competition, with the benefits that will arise for consumers of lower prices, better services and more deep competition. If the Government would just get out of the business of interfering with the airlines, we could have a more competitive airline sector. If it would get out of the business of being in the airports, we could create wholesale retail training and education at airports. If it would get out of the business of communications-and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) calls Telecom a basket case-we would have a more competitive economy and Would be able to create more private sector jobs.",63
156,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (3.46 p.m.)-It is of interest to note the crud that seems to continually come from the Opposition. It is of no consequence to the contribution of the previous speakerMr Hicks-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is that a parliamentary term?",65
157,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,Crud is a word that exists in the dictionary. It means 'nonsense'and the honourable member ought to understand that.,65
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Riverina-Darling' has a point of order. The honourable member for the Northern Territory may' explain the word if he wishes,65
159,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,In the OXford Dictionary it says that 'crud' means - nonsense'-and it is nonsense that comes continually out of the mouths of those opposite. Crud is an appropriate word to use in this context.,65
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the term offends the Opposition, it may be in the best interests.' Mr Hicks-We just wanted an explanation, Mr Deputy Spe,aker. If the honourable member is speaking crud, so be it.",65
161,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"We understand the crud that comes out of the mouths of those opposite. The most crud has come out of the mouth of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale). He has told us about the advantages of 'Frightpack'. He stood there and said, 'This is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to fix Australia'. Well, fix Australia it will! It will fix it right Send us to the cleaners-that is what it will do. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in Question Time, what those opposite intend to do is to impose a 15 per cent value added tax. What attraction does that hold for small business, or any business in Australia-a 15 per cent value added tax which will be a tax on labour inputs into production? He also said that the GST will seek to raise $27 billion of new' tax. What sort of attraction is that for small business, or any business in Australia? He also pointed out the impact that that would have on inflation and prices. I ask the previous speaker: what attraction do increased interest rates .have for small business,or any business for that matter? What attraction does an increased rate of inflation have for any business ih Australia, let alone small business? We heard the contribution of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who sought to pillory the Government on the issue of tariffs. We heard the response by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). He made it very clear that there is a chasm between the policies of the Opposition and the policies of the Government in relation to tariffs, just as there is a chasm between the policies of the Opposition and the policies of the Government in relation to employment, education and training issues. In the course of this debate we have heard a great number of figures bandied about. What those opposite ought to understand, and what needs to be repeated, is what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said about the creation of new jobs and participation rates. But those opposite cannot stand it; they do not like the fact that this Government has been extraordinarily successful in the creation of new jobs. As the Minister said, we deplore-everyone in Australia deplores-the unemployment that has resulted from the recession. Let us not be led down the path that the Opposition would take us when it suggests that the recession was unique to Australia. That suggestion is absurd and untrue. As the up. honourable member for Bruce ought to know, we are not on our Pat Malone in terms of the recession. In terms of the OECD we are a middle order country in the way the recession has impacted upon our economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia's aimual report said that by mid-1992 about half the OECD countries had experienced a recession. What the honourable member also needs to understand in terms of the recovery about which he spoke is that the lack of synchronisation of the cyclical movements in the major economies, while moderating the downturn, has also acted to prolong the recessionary activity. He ought to understand that, and so should the honourable member for Bennelong. Those two Opposition members should have been honest enough to address the fact that that lack of synchronisation in the international economy is also evident in the Australian economy. It is something which they should accept and which they should have acknowledged in their contributions. On that lack of synchronisation within the Australian economy, the Reserve Bank said: The recession was characterised by greater than normal dispersion in performance among different areas of the country. Victoria and South Australia have been particularly hard-hit but the effects on confidence of the difficulties of some financial institutions . . . have flowed across a range of industries. On most indicators the downturns in those two States have been more severe than elsewhere. The Reserve Bank also said: The sluggish recovery also reflects the adjustment to lower inflation and the other structural changes occurring in the economy. Periods of weak activity often provide the catalyst for change, which takes time to run its course. Business, for example, needed to alter their strategies, and have been so; they have been concentrating on reducing costs, raising productivity and lowering their gearing. All these have slowed their recovery but they will help to sustain a robust expansion through the years ahead. I point out that the estimate for jobs in the Budget is about 160,000. The Government has approached these difficulties with responsible and appropriate policies. There has been a responsible counter-cyclical fiscal injection by the Commonwealth. Again on the issue of jobs, it is estimated that the counter-cyclical injection of $350m allocated by· the local government financial assistance program will create an additional 30,000 jobs. By contrast, the Opposition would run a pro-cyclical fiscal position. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said on 27 August 1992: Recent claims by the Opposition Leader and his Shadow Treasurer, that the Opposition's policies would produce jobs ""immediately"" and ""from day one"" are complete garbage . . . The Opposition's policy of cutting the deficit by $6-$7 billion, mainly through slashing Government expenditure, would have a devastating effect on employment. It would mean that they would be taking up to 1I 1h off GDP at a time when the reason for low economic growth has been low growth in aggregate demand. The inevitable consequence would be to pull economic growth back from the budget projections of 33/4% through 1992-93 ... It would create an additional 125;000 unemployed. That would be the product of the Opposition's policy. But nowhere do we hear acknowledgment of that fact. Instead, those opposite make statements about the car industry and try to disown their contribution to the tariff debate and the statements which have been made to them by people involved in the motor vehicle industry. What absolute gall for the Opposition to talk about the state of the job market! The day after its mention, Mitsubishi said that the Opposition's zero tariff policy threatened to force it out of manufacturing. Mitsubishi employs 4,200 people, most of whom would lose their jobs under the zero tariff lunacy of the Opposition. In answer to a question during Question doing Time, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) referred to the statement made by Bill Scales, the Chief Executive of the Automotive Industry Authority, on Lateline on 5 May. Mr Scales said that the Opposition's zero tariff policy would result in the loss of 40,000 of the 45,000 jobs involved in automotive manufacture currently. In other words, there would not be 5,000 more jobs; there would be only 5,000 jobs left in the automotive and manufacturing industry in Australia. We plan a 90 per cent tariff cut. By contrast, the Opposition plans a 90 per cent job cut. The differences between the Opposition and the Government could not be clearer. On the one hand, it is proposing that we should accept this 'Frightpack' package which, as I have pointed out, will cost 125,000 jobs in the first couple of years. It will impose upon businesses around Australia the extraordinary impost of the GST as a value added tax. That will cost thousands of jobs in the public sector. That will mean for Australians wherever they live-in the remote corners of northern Australia or even the urban areas of Sydney and Melbourne-a cut in services .unprecedented in Australian . agreed to: history. We know that the Opposition is not prepared to accept the debate on the question of tariffs. We know that the local car manufacturing industry would be under threat. We know that in the tariff debate the Opposition has gone to water on the issue of sugar. We know that this is not the only area where the Opposition has been shown to be false and wrong. The honourable member for Bennelong is concerned because the Government has had the impertinence to debate the issue of tariffs-a debate which was started by the Opposition and which has demonstrated that the Opposition will cut 125,000 jobs out of the Australian work force.

163,Mr BEDDALL,Unknown,"I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.9 (1992). The tariff proposal which I now table contains an alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. This proposal, which is operative on and from 1 July 1991, corrects an anomaly caused at the time the UNESCO agreement on the importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials was implemented in the Customs Tariff Act 1987. It provides a free rate of duty for instructional books for games in subheading 9504.90. A summary of alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Rocher) adjourned. NA Discharge Motion (by Mr BeddaIl)-by leaveThat Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 3 to 13 (1991) and Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 1 to 3 (1992) be discharged. NEW BUSINESS AFTER 11 P.M.: NA",67
164,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I move: That sessional order 48A, Adjournment of House, and standing order 103, 11 o'clock rule, be suspended for the remainder of this period of sittings. I move this motion at this early stage in the sittings as I am mindful of the enormous business program that the Government has before it. I also have in mind the desire of all members to beable to participate in debate on the legislation which will be to hand and which already is to hand. In particular, I am concerned that we should have an opportunity to debate reasonably extensively the Appropriation Bills which, if we continue to operate under the 11 0' clock rule, we will not be able to do. . The fact is that there are some 120 items of legislation around. About 30 pieces have already been introduced and the bulk will be coming in over the next sitting weeks. We will be obliged to debate quite a substantial number of packages of that legislation. A fair bit of the debate will be cognate but there will nevertheless be a substantial number of packages. The intention is not to keep this House sitting to absurd hours night after night but to conclude matters around 12 midnight and, if sensible, enable adjournment debates to take place from time to time. Again, it is not our intention to preclude honourable members from their normal rights in that regard. We on this side of the House will not exercise this rule on the second' week Wednesday evening when in this long sitting week members get away at 8 o'clock or thereabouts. It is not in the interests of anyone that at the end of that week we have a completely insane House. Therefore, we will continue to have that night off. But otherwise we will be required-if the House carries this motion-to undertake quite extensive sittings. By starting this early with allowing the odd hour extra a night, we will effectively build up the equivalent of a week's extra sittings-certainly of Government business time-by the time the normal course of this session concludes. It is for. those reasons that I have moved the motion.",67
165,Mr SMITH,Unknown,"On behalf of the Oppo- .<:In, I indicate that reluctantly we will agree t(he motion that is being put. However, I sa, . to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that it is probably appropriate that he has come to the chamber a little earlier than usual. We have all been witness to some incredibly late night sittings and some lously long hours in past years. Whatever the reasons might be for the build-up of legislation, it is better to start early in trying to determine the sitting patterns of the House to make sure that we do not get into that crazy situation where we are threatened in the last week of sittings for the year with the fl' of having to come back for another p Jd. I notice that the Leader of the Hom; Iys that there will be about 120 pieces of - lS­ lation coming into the chamber and thu.. we have about 30 before us now. There is obviously quite a deal more legislation to come in. As' - have said in the past, it is a matter for the legislative committee of Cabinet to take account of the workings of Parliament. Whilst there seems to be this incredible bunching of legislation towards the end of a session, one would have to ask why it is that Ministers are unable to get to the legislative committee of Cabinet earlier with their proposed pieces of legislation. It could well be that the Government is moving quickly to prepare for an election. Who knows? In any event, this would be one of the things the Government would need to do, if that was the case. Maype that is a matter for the Leader of the House to respond to, but I know that he would not, in any event. By agreeing to this motion we will have the equivalent of an additional week's sitting-an extra week's work-to deal with Government business. However, in so doing, we are not going to negate the right of members to be able to participate in adjournment debates. That is particularly significant. I go back to the reports by the Standing Committee on Procedure to the Parliament. I think the 1986 report was the most extensive one done about sitting times and patterns and the effective 'use of the Parliament's time. One of the things that were made clear at that time was that members wanted to make sure there was ample time for private members' activity. The adjournment debate is extremely important, and we would not countenance for one moment any move that would lessen that time. I welcome the statement by the Leader of the House that during this period where the sitting of the House is extended to midnight ridicu- that time will still be available. I notice from that report back in 1986 that a recommendation was made that there be a business committee to facilitate the programming of the business to the House. I do not have an appreciation of what took place at that time, but my understanding is that that - pect recommendation was rejected by the Government. I am not aware of what the reasons were, although there has always been a recognition of a need to streamline the activities of the House. In the time that has passed since 1986 to the present, and given that I am giving a speech that my predecessor has given and his predecessor has given about the management of business in the House, it might well be a signal to all of us in here to take a closer look at how we might manage business in the chamber. I am still of a strong view that it is a matter for the Government of the day to determine its priorities much e&rlier in advance so that we do not get a bunching of legislation at the end of the session. That is obviously what will occur on this occasion. I wish to make a comment about the Appropriation Bills. The most important legislation that goes through this Parliament on a regular basis is the legislation which authorises a government to spend taxpayers' funds. There ought to be ample opportunity for all members, regardless of which party they represent, to pursue matters of interest to them and to their constituents. That is a fundamental role for the Parliament. Any matter which gives ample time for those matters to be pursued should be supported. But if it is a trade-off to limit time for debate on the Appropriation Bills as against time for Government business, I think the balance should be in support of making sure that there is time for the appropriations debate. The Leader of the House said the fundamental reason is that he wants to have that time for the appropriations debate. We in the Opposition will ensure, as we watch the hours unfold, that that does take place and that we do not start to transgress on that time, professed reason for putting forward this motion is not removed, and that the Government's business gets priority. On the final matter of the Governinent's business, the swimming pool tax matter has ping-ponged backwards and forwards around this place today, but I understand it is coming back to the chamber. It might be that the amendments proposed by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) are a direct result of having had some extensive debate in this chamber yesterday about that matter. That is an indication in itself of the success of allowing time for debate about contentious matters, particularly matters that raise revenue. The Government has benefited from the detailed scrutiny given in this chamber to the confusion that it has got itself into. We will not divide on this motion. We would want the matter to proceed. But we will watch to ensure that time is given to debate the Appropriation Bills and that members' private time on the adjournment is preserved. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Griffiths, and read a first time. Second Reading",68
166,Mr GRIFFITHS,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to implement a reform package for the Pipeline Authority to enable it to achieve a more commercially orientated approach to its operations. In just over 20 years, natural gas has grown from a small base to become Australia's third most important energy source, accounting for 17 per cent· of primary energy demand. The recent supply-demand study by the Australian Gas Association indicates that the Australian gas industry is now on another threshold of growth, not only as a major, reliable supplier to the domestic energy market but also as a major exporter of liquefied natural gas, or that the LNG, in the 1990s and beyond. The AGA study indicates market opportunities for natural gas are expected to grow strongly in the years ahead, with new market opportunities, including greater use in power generation, particularly co-generation, and in the transport sector. Australia has already made an impressive entrance onto the world LNG stage. Exports from the North West Shelf project are forecast to grow to seven million tonnes per annum by 1995. At these levels, the export value of LNG, oil and condensate from the North West Shelf could approach $3 billion per annum. The project is already making a significant and sustained contribution to our balance of payments, and there are excellent prospects for further major expansions of the industry. Shell Australia, for example, has identified a $6 billion to $8 billion expansion opportunity for Australia's LNG industry over the next five years, based on growth in Asian markets. The Federal Government strongly supports LNG exports and, as a major element in the natural gas strategy, has assisted future growth of the industry through removal of volume controls on LNG exports. This move has been welcomed by the industry as a positive step to assist the development of LNG export opportunities. Industry responses to the national gas strategy have been unanimous in supporting the Government's view that a truly national approach is needed to help develop our natural gas reserves fully. The promotion of free and fair interstate gas trade is one of the key points in the national gas strategy. I share the industry's belief that it is tial to free up markets to provide the incentive for future development of Australia's domestic and export gas industry. In particular, unrestricted interstate gas trade is essential for the exploration and the development of markets and related infrastructure. Th-re can be no compromise on this point if we are to move towards an efficient national market in natural gas. The AGA gas supply and demand study reinforces the need to move towards a national gas market and provides a timely warning of the costs involved if parochial attitudes and self-interest by the States and Territories prevent free and open interstate trade in gas. The AGA estimates that the cost to Australians of higher prices due to restricted interstate gas trade would, over the period to the year 2030, be in the range $1.5 billion to $4 billion in net present value terms. Producers are already seeking additional markets for gas from areas such as south-west Queensland and the Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory. These, and other reserves, are likely to remain underdeveloped unless State and Territory administrations lend their support to unrestricted gas trade. An additional plank in the national gas strategy was reform of government instrumentalities. The Government's direct role in natural gas operations is restricted largely to its ownership of TPA. In turn, the Authority owns and operates the natural gas transmission pipeline that extends approximately 1,300 kilometres from Moomba in South Australia to Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney. At Wilton, the natural gas is delivered to the Australian Gas Light Co., AGL, whose subsidiaries are responsible for gas reticulation throughout the Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle regions. Lateral pipelines supply natural gas to regional markets, including the Cootamundra, Wagga Wagga, Young, Junee, Canberra and Bathurst-Orange regions and, soon, to the Riverina. The Government announced in late 1989 that it would develop a reform package for TPA as part of the Government's wider agenda for micro-economic reform. In essenNovember 1991, as part of the national gas strategy, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to implement refonn of TPA to make it more efficient and competitive. In the 1992 Budget, the Government announced the inclusion of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline system in its program of asset sales. The sale of the pipeline system is unlikely to be completed before the 1993-94 financial year at the earliest. This was recognised in the Budget statement. In these circumstances, the Government believes that reform of TPA, including putting its commercially based operations into a government business enterprise-style subsidiary, is essential and should not be delayed further. These reforms will enable the return on TPA's assets to be optimised in the leadup to the proposed sale. The reforms proposed in this legislation will enable TPA, through a subsidiary corporation, to compete on a more equal footing with other participants in Australia's natural gas industry and to be involved in a wider range of commercially based activities than its present Act allows. The reforms will provide the means forTPA to become a more effective operator in the gas sector and to take advantage of commercial opportunities as they arise. This approach will ensure optimal returns to the Government and the Australian people from the activities of the TPA. The central feature of the reform package is to provide for the creation of a subsidiary of TPA to undertake those operations of TPA that are based on a commercial rate of return. This will include the Canberra and Oberon laterals and the proposed Riverina pipeline extension to Griffith. TPA has contracts with AGL covering the carriage of gas through these pipelines. The Government has consulted with AGL on the proposed transfer of assets and has taken that company's concerns into account in the preparation of the legislation. There is no element in the refonn proposals embodied in this legislation which would be prejudicial·to AGL's existing contracts. The proposed legislation requires the approval of the Minister for Resources before a subsidiary can be created. The Minister's approval will outline the reporting requirements whereby strategic ministerial control will be exercised over the subsidiary consistent with the guidelines for government business enterprise accountability. TPA has, in the past, been significantly constrained by its Act in the type of activities it can undertake. The current Act limits TPA to constructing, owning and operating pipelines within Australia. It cannot be involved in other activities, such as operating a pipeline it does not own, and it has been limited to providing consultancy services within Australia, and then only after obtaining ministerial approval. The new subsidiary will be able to undertake any of the activities related to the design, construction and acquisition of petroleum pipelines. In addition, the subsidiary will be able to operate and maintain pipelines throughout Australia and provide consultancy and transmission support services relating to petroleum pipeline construction, design and operation for clients in Australia and overseas. The new subsidiary will be subject to taxation and will be required to make dividend payments. To all intents and purposes, it is designed to behave as a private company carrying out the business of a government enterprise and be subject to corporate law and regulations. While the subsidiary will operate as a commercial government business enterprise, TPA will continue to operate the Moomba to Sydney mainline and the laterals to Lithgow and Wagga Wagga on the cost recovery basis determined by existing contracts between TPA and AGL. The reform package that has been developed is consistent with the Government's latest guidelines for government business enterprise accountability. These guidelines emphasise strategic ministerial control over the enterprise, while enterprise boards are responsible for development of business strategies and the handling of day to day management policies. With this in mind, ministerial control over the subsidiary will be imposed by ministerial oversight of the subsidiary's strategic corporate plan, annual operating plans and financial targets. Any major changes to these plans, and other major issues and opportunities identified by the subsidiary's board and management, will be reported promptly through the Authority to the Minister for Resources for consideration and action as appropriate. The subsidiary will be required to provide, on an annual basis, a strategic corporate plan covering a three-year period for ministerial consideration and response. Information on any material variations in the corporate plan, and any other changes in circumstances that would require disclosure under the Australian Stock Exchange or Australian Securities Commission rules, must be reported through TPA to the Ministerimmediately. In addition, the subsidiary will be required to provide more regular reports outlining progress towards meeting the corporate plan and any proposed changes to that plan. The subsidiary will also be required to work to an annual operating plan, including a financial target and dividend policy approv!!d in advance by the Minister for Resources in consultation with the Minister for Finance. As at present, TPA will be required to produce an annual report which will be tabled in parliament. This report will include coverage of the operations and performance of TPA's subsidiary, so there will continue to be full disclosure of TPA's pipeline operations. The assets to be transferred from TPA to the subsidiary are to be revalued prior to approval of the first corporate plan associated with the establishment of the subsidiary. Assets of the subsidiary and TPA will subsequently be revalued every three years in accordance with normal commercial practice. A key factor in establishing the appropriate capital base for the subsidiary is to enable it to borrow in the commercial market without government guarantees and maintain an A credit rating. To achieve this aim, it may be necessary to transf-rsome retained earnings from TPA to the subsidiary along with the designated assets. The capital and financial resources provided by TPA to the subsidiary in exchange for share equity, plus the revenue earning capability of the Canberra and Griffith pipelines, should permit payment of dividends by the subsidiary to the Government, via TPA, at an early stage. Subject to passage of this Bill and completion of the necessary legal formalities, the Government envisages the early reorganisation of TPA. The legal separation of TPA's commercial and non-commercial operations will facilitate assessment of the subsidiary's performance against the criteria outlined in its corporate plan. It will provide the correct commercial incentives for the management of the sllbsidiary and ensure the financial and operating results of each organisation are separate and transparent. The proposed reforms highlight the need for TPA board to include an appropriate mix of qualifications, abilities and business acumen. Given the greater requirement for financial and corporate expertise, it is proposed to expand TPA's board by two new directors. The Bill allows for TPA's chief executive officer to be appointed by the Authority and be subject to dismissal by the Authority. TPA directors will also now be appointed by the Minister for Resources rather than the Governor General in Council; and be subject to dismissal on grounds which have been expanded to include ongoing underperformance. The board of the subsidiary will be appointed by the Authority. The reforms that I have outlined today have the potential to provide substantial benefits. They will provide a sound basis upon which to improve the overall performance of TPA. The reforms will allow the management of TPA and its proposed subsidiary greater flexibility in their day to day operations range of issues that previously required ministerial approval, whilst retaining adequate accountability under the guidelines for government business enterprise operations. This will enable TPA, through its subsidiary, to take advantage of a range of commercial opportunities that are emerging in Australia and overseas as a result of growing demand for natural gas. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Simmons, and read a first time. Second Reading",69
167,Mr SIMMONS,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Social Security Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 will give effect to a change in the payment arrangements for family allowance. Family allowance will be called family payment from 1 January 1993. Following the outstanding success of the family allowance bonus paid earlier this year, the Government has decided that payments of family allowance should be more flexible. The family allowance proposal contained in this Bill will enable recipients of that payment as at 1 January next year to request an advance of the payment covering a period of up to six months. The person requesting the advance would be able to receive up to half of the amount that would be paid in respect of what is known as the first child rate$20.90 per fortnight as from 1 January 1993-as a lump sum. The remaining half of the family allowance entitlement would continue to be paid fortnightly. The advance is not to be paid in respect of a particular child, rather as an advance of an amount otherwise payable to a family in receipt of on a family allowance. One advance only would be allowed for each six-month period. If a request for the advance was received, say, in December this year, the person would be able to receive six months of half of the family allowance first child rate that would have been paid up to 30 June 1993, which will be valued next year at $135.85. At the time of the request the person can opt to have the lump sum advance paid only in respect of the following six months period or on an ongoing basis. If the ongoing option were chosen the person could still contact the Department of Social Security at any time to resume full fortnightly payments which would then recommence at the beginning of the next six months family payment advance period. This new system of advance payment of family allowance recognises that some families may wish to receive family allowance payments in a lump sum to assist, for example, in family budgeting. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA .BILL 1992 In Committee Consideration resumed from 8 September. Proposed new clause 3A.",72
168,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"La Trobe) (4.27 p.m.)When debate on the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill was interrupted last night, it interesting that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) came into join us because of some consternation on his part engendered by remarks made by Opposition members opposed to the way that this Bill would handle the issue of sales tax for the swimming pool industry and specifically on the mechanisms for refunding pool builders and pool owners in that regard. Following the adjournment debate last night, the Treasurer moved to the corridors outside where we held further discussions on this issue. Accompanying him were two members of the Taxation Office advising him on this matter. It became clear to me that real problem generated by this Bill arises because of a misunderstanding on the part of the Treasurer, probably the Government, and certainly on the part of certain Taxation Office officials. That misunderstanding is basic to the understanding of the role of business and industry in Australian society. I remind honourable members that one of the main reasons that brought me to this place was that the Taxation Office held a view of Australian business and commerce and industry that the only reason people were' in business was to rip other people off, and that business and industry are not there to produce goods and services desired and required by the community. The tax officers made it clear last night that they misunderstand the pool builders in this regard. Earlier in this debate, I made it clear that, between 1986 and February 1992, there were two issues relating to the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. The first of those issues relates to the period from 1986 to mid-1990. During that period pool builders tried to charge their clients tax. In some manner or other they collected tax from pool owners and remitted that tax to the Government. That· period of tax collection has now been deemed by the High Court to be of an unconstitutional nature. One of the problems engendered by· this Bill is the fact that it is the Treasurer's view that we still have to use the wholesale sales tax mechanism for refunding that so-called tax collected by pool builders from pool owners was and remitted to the Taxation Office, but because the tax was found to be of no effect-that is, a nil tax-it is not a tax and it is clear that refund mechanismS which exist in the Income Tax Assessment Act are no longer applicable and do not necessarily need to be followed in the refund mechanism associated with this Bill. We must make it clear to the Treasurer, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), who is at table, and the Taxation Office officials here that they can use mechanisms outside the tax Act to refund the tax to those pool owners. One of the problems the we have is that this recession has brought with it the demise of many pool builders. A great number of pool owners out there are due a tax refund but, under this Bill, they will never get it. While the Bill talks about windfall gains for pool builders, what in fact will happen is that there will be a windfall gain for the Tax Office because it will not legitimately refund tax paid by pool owners to pool builders who no longer exist because they have either gone into liquidation or simply, due to lack of business, ceased trading. The period from 1986 to mid-1990 is half of the problem with this legislation. The other half of the problem started in mid-1990 when those legitimate pool builders, who were paying their tax but believed that there were some less honest pool builders not collecting or remitting the tax and placing the legitimate pool builders in an uncompetitive situation, obtained legal advice. That legal advice said that the Government had imposed' a tax which was not a tax and that, if they mounted a High Court challenge, it would be found to be unconstitutional. It turned out that that advice was correct and in February this year the High Court so found. In the interim, in 1990, the pool companies made a decision 'regarding the funds which they thought they might have to remit to the Taxation Office. They decided that, if they lost the case, they would place the money in an escrow fund to keep it out of harm's way, but it was their money. The Tax Office, in negotiations with the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia, made an agreement that the pool builders should send those theoretical tax moneys to the Tax Office and, if the Tax Office lost the High Court challenge, it would refund the moneys to the pool builders together with interest. The Tax Office, as recently as 6 August this year, confirmed that those moneys were due to the pool builders and not necessarily to any pool owners, as the majority of pool builders between mid-1990 and February 1992 paid money to the Tax Office without charging tax to their clients because they were in an uncompetitive situation, as compared with those builders who were not collecting the tax, and this precluded them from charging and collecting tax. It is clear to me that the Tax Office fails to understand that it has an obligation to business, through its agreement with business, and that it is no longer willing to honour that obligation or, if it is, the Minister and his representative here are imposing it through this Bill. That is what is inequitable. It is all brought about by the fact that this Labor Government and the Tax Office have no concept of how business operates, what its objectives are and what it attempts to accomplish. We have heard a great deal in this place about tariff policy, about understanding business and micro-economic reform. But the basic issue is that, if one understands how business people think, one knows that it is the paperwork burden and the imposts that this Labor Government has placed on business that are causing the major portion of our problem in terms of recovering from this recession, which was also brought on by this Government. If the Labor Government understood business and industry, we would never have had 24 or 25 per cent interest rates in Australia. Surely it would have known that it would have to drive thousands of businesses to the wall, which is what happened. The swimming pool industry that we are discussing today is a case in point-and a very dramatic one. 1 remind those opposite that it is the Australian public that wants swimming pools, otherwise there would be no industry. These people are not in business to rip off home' owners; they are in business to build swimming pools for people who want them. We should commend them for having the initiative and the foresight and for taking the action to risk their own' money to go into business to provide facilities wanted by the public. This Government fails to understand the risk-taking involved in business; it fails to understand the competitive nature of businessi it fails to understand the dramatic cost that it puts on business on the input side of the equation. Now, through this Bill, it is refusing to honour its honest obligation to business and the swimming pool industry in Australia by refunding the money that it had agreed to refund if it lost the High Court challenge. ,I say again that I wish the Treasurer would take notice of this debate. 1 suggest to the Committee that we adopt the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher).",73
169,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"As my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) has mentioned, there is an amendment before the Chair. The amendment, which relates to proposed new clause 3A, reads: Nothing in this Act applies to the agreement constituted by conversations and letters in Novemare ber 1990 between representatives of the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia Limited and the Australian Taxation Office relating to in pool tax, or to any payment that the Commonwealth is liable to make to any person pursuant that agreement. In my speech during the debate on the second reading, and perhaps at the committee stage last night, I said that I understood the Australian Taxation Office was responsible for reneging on that agreement. Since then there has been at least a suggestion-and I think it is stronger than that-that it was the Government's decision, not the Taxation Office's decision, to go back on that agreement. If that is so, I tender my apologies to the ATO and the officers involved. I certainly do not offer my congratulations, though, to the Government if it were responsible. The Bill effectively sets out to nullify the agreement between the SPASA and the ATO, even though it is not referred to expressly in the Bill. It is not referred to in the Bill, the seconding reading speech or the explanatory memorandum; nevertheless, the result of the technique used in drafting clauses 4(1) and 6 has that effect. Naturally the SPASA raised an objection that the Bill has the effect of retrospectively depriving those builders party to the agreement of their rights under that agreement. As it is germane to the point I am making, I wonder whether I might have leave to table the copies which are in evidence of that agreement. Leave granted.",74
170,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"SPASA has asserted that on the basis of legal advice its High Court challenge would be successful and, therefore, its members would receive a refund of moneys paid to the Australian Taxation Office. The sales tax was not passed on to members' customers during the period that the agreement was in effect. I might say that agreements with the ATO are not uncommon. In fact,. we hear every day 'of the Commissioner reaching' a settlement with an individual taxpayer or a group of taxpayers to interpret and treat the tax laws in a particular way. If these agreements between the ATO and taxpayers to settle outstanding tax issues a regular part of the Australian tax system-and they are-it is a very serious step and is full of implications for the adsitu ministration of the tax system in this country to if an agreement freely entered into is to be abrogated. That is what the. Bill effectively does, and that is what our amendment seeks to overcome. Should the Bill be allowed to nullify this SPASA agreement, it will be the first time to my knowledge that the ATO, either in its own right or at the behest of a government, has reneged on a deal. If that precedent is to occur, taxpayers will never again have confidence that agreements with the Australian Taxation Office would not be unilaterally revoked-in other words, they would be meaningless. I would like to ask the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) whether jn his response he could confirm whether it was the Government's decision to abrogate the agreement or a decision made by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation or his delegate. For these reasons I suggest there are strong grounds to amend the Bill to exclude the SPASA-ATO agreement from its ambit. The Australian Taxation Institute confirms that the Bill appears to abrogate pre-existing rights of persons to seek refunds under the agreement, but it goes on to say that it appears to abrogate the pre-existing rights of persons to seek refunds at common law. That is a very important matter that I do not think has been raised before. I am advised, and it is usually very reliable advice, that the precedent set in Werrin's case is to be specifically attacked in this legislation. That case stipulated that for someone to be entitled to a refund at common law, payment of tax has to be made involuntarily. The Tax Commissioner in ST2456 indicated that this common law principle would not be followed where a specific statutory provision allows for a refund of sales tax, and that is the situation we are in here. This Bill also will act to deprive pool owners, builders, or whoever it may be, people who have borne the tax, from rights at common law. It does that in the wording of clause 4(1) which states: Except as provided by this section, the Commonwealth is not liable to make an in situ pool tax refund payable to a person. So there it is. I might add that the interest payment provisions in clause 5 of the Bill are a bit dodgy too, but as that matter is not under consideration in this amendment I do not intend to go into that now.",75
171,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"I want for the third time to enter into this debate, albeit briefly on this occasion, and to indicate once again my very strong support for the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. When the matter was put back this morning to a later hour this day or another day there was some glimmer of hope that we had actually prevailed in debate. But· one has the impression that perhaps one is wasting one's time. Of all the legislation that has been debated pay. in this House in recent times, I have never felt so strongly that we are totally right in the point of view that we are putting to the Government on this occasion. Therefore, was optimistic in thinking that we may have prevailed in the debate we were putting. amendment is perfectly reasonable. I will very interested. to hear the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) address the issue of our amendment. Last night in his response to the debate his remarks were dismissive and perfunctory. I thought that more could have been expected. I ask the Minister to respond and to tell us and the people of Australia why the ATO, on instructionsJrom the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) or from the Government, has reneged on the agreement-which it confirmed in writing to the Swimming Pool and Spa Association as recently as the end of July of this year---.:.that had been entered into in respect of the quagiven rantining of the tax that it had been paid since 1990 and has turned its back on that particuour lar agreement. We want to know that. There are two other questions which once again I ask the Minister. Why has the it Government not addressed the two other totally major concerns that we have expressed about this legislation? Very simply, what happens answered. to the many people in my electorate whose pool builders are no longer in business? The Treasurer now tells me-and this compounds the error-that the High Court did not determine that money needed to be refunded in that situation. So the Treasurer, in effect, is hiding behind that decision and that seems to me to be most unfortunate. In respect of those people I am now being told that the Government now has no legal Yet I reqrlnd the Treasurer of what was said. In the Budget Papers it is clearly said that as a result of that case $50m or $6Om of sales tax would be refunded. That is patently now not true. The Government has a responsibility-if not a legal one, then surely a moral responsibility-to do what it said it would do, and that is to give money our back to the people who built pools and who paid sales tax illegally, who paid money to the Government which they did not have to The other question which remains unanswered, which the Minister Assisting the I Treasurer may be able to answer, is the question that has been posed by all speakers Our in this debate. On the mechanism that is be proposed, surely it is totally inadequate to expect small business people, pool builders, to go out and borrow hundreds of thousauds of dollars to refund to their customers and then apply to the Taxation Office for reimbursement, a process that could take months. That surely is a most unsatisfactory and unreasonable way to approach this matter. Those three questions remain totally unanswered. I hope that when the Minister Assisting the Treasurer responds we may yet get some reasonable response. If we can get some answers, perhaps we will be satisfied, but as yet in debate the Government has not us a· satisfactory answer. That is the reason for our opposition to this Bill and for amendment. That is not because its . objectives are not laudable. The Government has an obligation to give back the money that got illegally and we support that, but we refute the proposed mechanism. I hope that these questions might yet be adequately",76
172,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"I will make "" a number of points. Firstly, I think the basic principle underlying the Government's po:,-don on this legislation stands. We feel it is important to have a refund mechanism to ensllfe that the pool owner stands to benefit. The problem with the Opposition amendment, which seeks to give effect to its interpretation of the SPASA agreement, is that it would lead to a situation where a raft of pool builders, members of SPASA, would gain an unfettered right to receive a refund without necessarily passing it on to the individual pool owner. Our legislation tries to protect the pool owner. The Australian Taxation Office does not purport to be abrogating the agreement. It maintains that it is disputing the content and meaning of the agreement that was entered into with SPASA, and that matter is currently before the Federal Court. I do not intend to go into detail as to the Tax Office position on that because that would contravene sub judice conventions. However, I simply note for the information of the House that the interpretation of that agreement between SPASA and the Tax Office is in dispute and is currently the subject of litigation before the Federal Court. It is important also to stress that, under clause 4 (2) (c) of the legislation, if a pool builder claims to have absorbed the tax and not passed it on to the pool owner, an entitlement is provided for the pool builder to receive a refund. The pool builder obviously needs to be in a position to substantiate that claim, but the legislation specifically makes provision for that. We are not in the business of providing a windfall gain to pool builders and providing an entitlement to a refund irrespective of whether the pool builder has made a refund to the pool owner for any tax passed on. That is the essence of our position. I do not pretend that this mechanism is totally perfect. In a situation such as this very difficult to see what sort of perfect mechanism there could be. The case of pool builders who have subsequently gone bankrupt is obviously a difficult one to deal with. Since it is the pool builders who in the first instance pay the tax, it is very difficult to see how we could refund the tax directly to the pool owner, given that the pool owner would scarcely be in a position even to know the amount of tax that w- implicitly passed on. I do not see what alternative mechanism thereniight be to the one the Government has outlined. The effect of the Opposition's proposal would be to provide a windfall gain to a range of pool builders. In the process,the ultimate bearers of the tax-in most cases the pool owners-would be denied a refund. Proposed new clause negatived. Clause 4.",77
173,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"I move: Clause 4, page-, omit subclause (1), substitute the following subclause: ""(1) Other than pursuant to the agreement referred to, in section 3A, the Commonwealth is liable to make an in situ pool tax refund payment to a person as provided in this section."". This matter, which has been dealt with in particular by my friends the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), goes to the issue of refunds. I subniit to the Comniittee that the, requirements contained in clause 4 will ensure that many pool owners in practice never receive the benefit of these sales tax refund provisions. It follows, as night follows 'day, that many pool builders are unwilling to and will never provide the declaration required pursuant to clause 4(2). Alternatively, they have gone out of business. Where this is the case, the pool owner has no basis' to obtain a refund, even though, as it is clearly stated in the explanatory memorandum, the introduction of this legislation was intended to benefit pool owners. The only place where there is any benefit to' pool owners is in that explanatory memorandum, because in practice it will never materialise. Under existing law,' where payment of sales it is tax has been made under protest, a taxpayer may rely on section 12A(2) of the Sales Tax Procedure Act 1934 to bring an action. Under section 12A(2), the taxpayer does not have to prove that the tax is not being paid on or refunded. The Government has set out to reverse a long-held tenet in existing legislation. In a way, although it is not strictly way lawyers would use the tenn, the onus of proof has been reversed once again. This might all prove to be academic for at least one party who is now before the Federal Court. To save the Government looking an absolute goose,- I propose a procedural action. It is predicated on the fact that we have been infonned that the Federal Court is to hand down a judgment tomorrow on the enforceability of the very agreement which we have sought to have excluded from the ambit of the Government's legislation. That judgment is due tomorrow. If we go ahead and make a decision and are found by a venerable judge to have acted hastily, let that be on the Government's head. I am going to give it an out and move that the Committee report progress, the effect of which will be that this matter will lie on the Notice Paper and can be attended to in the fullness of time, after the judgment of the Federal Court has been made available to us. I move: That the Committee do report progress and ask leave to sit again.. Question resolved in the negative. Amendment negatived.",77
174,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The question now is that the clause be agreed to.,78
175,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"I made a bri-f contribution to the debate last evening when the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill was before the chamber, and I have listened with some interest to the discussions in committee. It seems to me that the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) has raised a couple of very interesting points. I think there is some case to be argued that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) needs to take on board some of the comments that have been mentioned, in particular the difficulties and constraints now confronting those people who have a pool which was built by a contractor who is no longer in operation. The point raised by the honourable member for La Trobe in identifying that that collection has now been determined by the High Court to be of no effect seems to be an avenue the worthy of consideration. I take this opportunity in committee to seek that consideration by the Treasurer and the officers of his Department in looking to ensure that the intent of the Government, which was clearly set out in the Budget Statement, is given effect.

177,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"The Budget and Appropriation Bills before the House are critical pieces of legislation, but the Dawkins Budget has failed. It has vanished across the horizon, after it was launched with great fanfare a couple of weeks ago. Of course, the Budget contained some major political blunders. I plan to highlight those in the course of this consideration. Ford, F. A. I say at the outset that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a political animal first and an Australian citizen second. I will not forgive Prime Minister Keating for that. He is prepared to place at risk the economic recovery and the social fabric of this nation, /' and not look after the true national interest. He does that day after day in the way he revisits a range of issues in his divisive economic policies and in his Budget framework itself. I think it has been well exposed in the aftermath of the Budget when one looks at some of the editorial comment. The Australian Financial Review had this to say about this year's Budget: It's a 'she'll be right' Budget all right. It's too stimulatory too late in the economic cycle, and too darn political. And it's Labor's fifth PAIRS attempt to get it right in the last eighteen months. This Budget fails to foster private sector confidence. Instead, in a low-key way, it echoes Me Dawkins' verbal delivery, it offers a somewhat facile, somewhat world-weary optimism that new government spending, nicely targeted for once, will win the day . . . if that ugly deficit is handily accepted as a fixed, Uluru-like part of the Australian landscape. 'She'll be right'. The Financial Review got that comment right in relation to. this particular-Dawkins's first and last-Budget. The Sydney Morning Herald had this to say: To start with, the real Budget deficit is not the $13.5 billion announced by the Treasurer. It is at least $15 billion. Max Walsh cast it at $21 billion. The Canberra Times stated: . . . if the deficit blows out so early next year, the Government will face a crisis (and an economic credibility· problem) at about the same time it has to go to the polls. Mr Keating may not like it, but he seems destined to live in interesting times. Editorial after editorial said this Budget failed. It is the Budget that backfired; the Budget that failed to give Australia the real leadership, the real advance forward, the framework to carry Australia back onto the rails, and this is totally and absolutely unacceptable. It is a bitter disappointment to the one million Australians unemployed, and there are more unemployment statistics to come tomorrow. It is a bitter disappointment for many people that, at a time when they felt they could get a Budget and leadership from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), they got this extraordinary Dawkins Budget. As well, they got massive deficit, tinkering on the Titanic and, also, some hidden tax agendas-which the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders and Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), has well exposed-that came from the Budget Speech. The Treasurer said: But in the absence of new measures, revenues are also likely to decline. If the fiscal position nearer to· the time is no stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. There, honourable members, is the clear pointer by Treasurer Dawkins that there is a series of secret Budget tax initiatives that, in the very unlikely event Labor is re-elected, will make the funds add and balance the Budget settings of Australia. Today in a very penetrating Question Time, which included questions by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as well as by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd), we exposed the Treasurer's Achilles heel, not only in relation to prescribed payments but also in respect of fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and provisional tax. These are the secret taxes which this Government is going to bring back if it is given half a chance. Clearly, the people have had enough and they are not even going to give the Government that half and becomes apparent, a chance. I tum to the issue of tariffs and trade in relation to the Budget. A lot of humbug is being spoken by the Prime Minister on the issue and by that famous six-pack which held a press conference at high noon today in relation to the issue. It included the chairman of the Prime Minister's Government task force, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). It is very interesting that, while he is calling for a series of resignations, during the last up period the Cattlemen's Union, which met in Toowoomba, carried a motion of no confidence in the honourable member for Hinkler. That reflects his standing. That strong, relevant, independent thinking body-the Cattlemen's Union-is hardly in the pocket of the National Party. Indeed, on many occasions it has attacked the National Party. It has attacked previous coalition governments, it has attacked Labor governments and it has even carried motions of no confidence in honourable members on the coalition side of the House. But what did it do at its 1992 annual conference in Toowoomba? It carried a motion of no confidence in the honourable member for Hinkler and said it had had enough of the chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force; it had had enough of the chairman of the sugar task force. The honourable member for Hinkler no longer enjoyed the confidence of that key organisation which, of course, is very significantly spread across Queensland, especially in the electorate of Hinkler which has a great, thriving beef industry. On the tariff and trade issue, buried away in the Budget Papers is a very interesting statement which puts into perspective this whole argument over trade and tariffs. I quote: In the May 1988 Economic Statement, the Government announced a broad program of phased tariff reductions, which reduced most nominal tariff rates to 15 or 10 per cent. The exceptions were the passenger vehicle and textiles,clothing and footwear industries, which were subject to special industry restructuring plans. The Government announced further tariff reductions in March 1991. Tariffs at 15 or 10 per cent on 1 July 1992 will be phased down to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996. Tariffs on passenger motor vehicles will be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent in 2000. Tariffs on textiles, clothing and footwear will be phased down from a range between 15 and 51 per cent in 1992 to a range between 5 and 25 per cent in 2000, and quotas will be abolished on 1 March 1993. At 1 July 1992 it is estimated that the average effective rate of assistance to manufacturing per cent. By the year 2000, the average effective rate of assistance to manufacturing will have declined to around 5 per cent. It has been estimated that the reductions in tion announced in 1988 and 1991 will result in a permanent real increase in GDP of about 1 per cent. The actual effect will be higher as factors such as better management, innovation and greater competition come into play. That is the Government's charter on trade and tariffs. It is a series of ugly tariff reductionsthe types of tariff reductions that one has when one does not have tax refonn, industrial relations refonn or genuine micro-economic refonn. These are stand-alone tariff cuts of the worse kind. They come without any of the Fightback reforms-without the abolition of payroll tax, sales tax and fuel excise tax. They are very ugly tariff cuts. They are legislated for by this Labor Government and they are ones that it is now acutely embarrassed about because of their impact on industry. I want to spell out very clearly that the coalition alternative is all about a gradual and graduated reduction in tariffs over a period of years through to the next century-not overnight, not without front end loading, but a range of benefits to industry. Of course, the benefits of industrial relations refonn, taxation refonn and micro-economic refonn will be delivered in conjunction with those industries. We will deliver big figures. For example, for Australian agriculture there will be a $1 billion benefit. Mr Snowdon-Hal",79
178,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for the Northern Territory sniggers. These are Federal Treasury figures. The Federal Treasury released a document saying that a $1 billion benefit for Australian agriculture will flow from Fightback. It also says that $S billion will flow to manufacturing industry from Fightback. Those are the benefits that we will front end load in getting a right and relevant trade and tariff policy in place. I know that the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) will have more to say on this issue when he speaks in the debate shortly. But I want to add that in all of this it was 12 is our absolute commitment to seek to retain a manufacturing industry and to provide the framework which will retain a manufacturing industry, a passenger motor vehicle industry protecand a decentralised Australian agricultural industry, including a progressive sugar industry, a progressive beef industry and a progressive wheat industry. Against all odds, we will set an agenda and do the sorts of things that other countries have succeeded in doing-to provide a finn basis and refonn framework so that these industries can develop and expand and be viable against all odds, given the fact that there is no such thing as an international level playing field. I have said very clearly and repeatedly that we on this side of the House recognise that there is no such thing as an international level playing field. But we will address it in the correct way-not in the hocus-pocus, back flipping, backsliding way of a Prime Minister desperate to inject some hope into his re-election stocks-a Prime Minister who is a political animal first and an Australian citizen second. I hesitate to use that terminology but I am afraid that I, my colleagues and thousands of Australians have had enough of the rhetoric of the Prime Minister. They have had enough of a government which has failed to deliver the right sort of leadership to lead this country out of the recession. So, in terms of tariffs and trade, there is a second dimension that I want to put on the record of the House. It is all about a sensible, tough and fair trade strategy which is not about backdoor protection but is about establishing a framework for Australian industry, especially our food producing and processing industry, and giving it a fair go. The first leg of that is adequate anti-dumping laws. They are not adequate by virtue of amendments that this Labor Government has brought into slow down the various procedures under the imti-dumping legislation. Well, we have had enough of that. We are going to toughen up and tighten the anti-dumping legislation in a purposeful and practical way which will put some balance into the anti-dumping effort. Secondly, there will be completion of the elimination of the many labelling law anomalies which have existed for years. Of course I do not blame the Federal Labor Government entirely for this. It is a matter both State and Federal governments, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party has pointed out on many occasions. It is not good enough to have jam from, Jamaica come to Australia, be rebottled in Brisbane and put out on the shelves as product of Australia when it is jam from Jamaica. At long last the Australian Customs Service has established a task force to crack down on misleading labelling. It is long overdue. But we need to do more than that. There is still a series of anomalies which have to be addressed. With the importation of Canadian pork, for example, the label 'Canadian pork' should be clearly visible so that that fact can be addressed accordingly. The labelling requirements involve a cycle of meetings between officers at State and Federal level. That process is bureaucratic in its nature. I understand that the recommendation on Canadian pork just missed the most recent round of meetings so it could be another six or 12 months before we have any labelling requirement. That is not good enough. We have to have tougher labelling standards and police them. A third leg of a fairer trade strategy is a revamping of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The operation of that service has failed in many ways. Until recently it still had 60 meat inspectors at towns and cities where there are no longer operating abattoirs-a cost tag to the taxpayer and to the meat industry which is unacceptable. AQIS has to be far more aggressive in terms of carrying out its role legitimately. We have a number of plans for credentialling and restructuring which make a lot of sense. Interestingly enough, a number of European countries are now moving down the credentialling path rather than having all meat inspectors employed by a central authority. So we have anticipated credentialled meat inspection; it is the correct way forward. The National Food Authority is a new organisation trying to carve out its niche. But it is judged by the fact that until recently there were only seven food inspectors looking at imported food. I want to tell honourable members what the State of Victoria found for when in 1988 it did a comprehensive inspection of imported food. It found that 59 per cent of foreign food imported into Victoria in the year 1988 was non-complying. Since that time, we have been known as a soft touch for the dumping of substandard food imports and the like. So let us have a sensible and fairer trade strategy in relation to Australia's overall trade and tariff approach, and let us combine that with a sensible, gradual tariff reduction process over a number of years. Of course, the Government has the Courtice committee wandering around to mislead the sugar industry. The 'Industry Commission report is there for all to see. The Government can keep saying, until it is blue in the face that it will not reduce sugar tariffs. But watch this space, because the Industry Commission recommends zero tariffs for the sugar industry by 1998. I want to make it very clear that, if this Government legislates to that end, we will relegislate to make it a softer and fairer schedule of reductions by kicking it out to the year 2000-no ifs, no buts. I place that on the record.",81
179,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,And 5 per cent in the year 2000.,82
180,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"It 'will be a negligible level in the year 2000, not zero. Of course, exchange rates will have a big impact on the practical level of protection available at that time. At the end of the day, Australia has little choice but to go down that path if it wants to build up its trade links with Asia and to remove barriers. Those who would like to continue to snuggle under the blanket rather than to get out in the cold air can do that for a period but, ultimately, they have no choice, they have to get out from under the blanket. Fortress Australia, with 150 per cent protection walls right around Australia, is exactly the wrong way to go. We have had the courage to state that. The Prime Minister previously had the courage to state that, but he has now walked away from that entirely with his rhetoric in a way which makes him the political animal that he is, and I concede that. He is not an Australian citizen determined to get the economy back· on the rails. He is going to pay an awful price for the damage he is wren king by making this an extrem(Jy partisan policy area when the policy differences are minutiae in real terms, if one examines them, a lip on the cup argument, and the like. Finally, I will turn to another area of the Budget. I refer to petrol and diesel fuel excise taxes which are reaffmned in this Budget and which, for the first time, will extract over $7 billion from the motorist. This is a rip-off of some 26c a litre across Australia. It is a tax on decentralisation across Australia. It is a tax on the quality of life of retirees and pensioners especially in many towns and cities where they simply do not have access to public transport. Mr Deputy Speaker, many pockets of your own electorate are a long way from extended public transport. Therefore, as one moves up through Warringah, the people there are also placed at a disadvantage by this horrific tax level of fuel excise and so little it comes back to the roads. This Budget, for the first time, extracts $7 billion from the motorist. Only about $1.4 billion of that will come back to the roads. Is it not time that we had a more honest approach to the whole business of transport in this country? Bob Hawke got one thing right in his last year in office: he told the road transport forum in March of last year that the transport industry pays 3112 times more tax than any other industry in Australia. We are addressing that problem. We are abolishing all petrol, diesel and avgas fuel excise tax. Those opposite, and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) in particular, are supporting a Budget that maintains those horrific tax levels which hurt especially the citizens of the Northern Territory in the process. I condemn this Budget for the inadequate document that it is. It fails to provide the leadership that Australia requires at this critical time. Effectively, it will be rejected by the people at the next Federal election. . Mr SNOWDON (Northern TerritoryT Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (5.33 p.m.)-I am pleased to be able to follow the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), the would beDeputy Prime Minister of Australia who was described by John Laws as making Dan Quayle look like the President of Mensa, and he has done that. Let us consider what was said, and the context. in which it was said, by the Leader of the National Party. He spent a full seven or eight minutes of his speech lambasting a Government backbencher and his role in a government task force on the sugar industry. One has to ask the Leader of the National Party what his priorities are. We saw the Leader of the National Party on Monday evening on Lateline being questioned by Kerry O'Brien. The subject of that questioning related to the Opposition's policies on NAFTA. The honourable member, who is leaving the chamber, would remember NAFTA. It is interesting to note that it has not been addressed once in the last two days by members of the Opposition in the Parliament, of so embarrassed have they been by the dreadful performance of the Leader of the National Party on Lateline on Monday night. It is worth looking at an article in today's Age by Michelle Grattan. It is headed 'Gunslinger shoots himself in the foot'. Honourable members will recall that this is the bloke who was described by John Laws as making Dan Quayle look like the President of Mensa, so it is a pretty high class act. This is the person who would be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. In Question Time in the Senate yesterday, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) had this to say about the questioning of the unfortunate Leader of the National Party on Lateline: . . . he was like a rabbit caught in a spotlight. He has done it again today. He has exposed himself as the rabbit caught in the spotlight. Later in the article Michelle Grattan says: It was strange that the coalition, which has been under sustained attack over advocating that Australia consider applying to join NAFrA, did not ask one question about one-time support of the Treasurer ... some trade agreement with the US. Members of the Opposition do not want to discuss NAFTA any more, so embarrassed are they about the strategy which they adopted in trying to attack the Americans on the one hand and crawl to them on the other. They did not know the facts of the situation, as was exposed very clearly in Kerry O'Brien's Lateline program. This is the person who would seek, in the course of his address, to condemn the Government's Budget. On what basis did he lay this claim? Did he examine the Budget? Not once in the course of his address did he look at the detail of the Budget. It was a thinly disguised attempt to defend himself and to try to re-establish his position as leader of a now outdated, corrupted National Party. That was the exercise here this afternoon.",82
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member should withdraw the word 'corrupted'. I think we should try to raise the level of language.,84
182,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,I use the word 'corrupted' in the sense that some of its members have made the National Party look stupid.,84
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Would the honourable member withdraw the word 'corrupted' in response to the request by the Chair?,84
184,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"I will withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I said, and I do not apologise for this one bit, they are seen as absurdities and as a joke in Australian politics. They are made a joke even more by the Leader of the National Party who would see himself as a future Deputy Prime Minister. He is working in concert with zealots, and he accompanies that zealotry with his own ignorance and, at times, his lack of knowledge and lack of preparedness to investigate the issues that are at hand . Yet he attacks the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Conrtice) for his legitimate role in the sugar iebate, as leader of the Government's '! Igar task force, carrying out in a very m{'dsured and appropriilte way an examination of the Industry Commission's recommenuations on the sugar industry. We do not click our heels and jump every time the Leader of the National Party says 'jump'. We have a very measured approach to policy development and policy implementation in the country. I am pleased that the honourable member for Hinkler has come into the House. He has done a great deal to advocate the cause of the sugar industry in this House, in this Parliament, and in Australia, and he has done a great deal overseas in advocating the cause of primary industry in Australia. On more than one occasion he has represented the interests of primary producers in this country in Europe and the United States. He has done that well, and now he is representing the interests of those people in the sugar industry. Yet we are seeing him blackguarded by an inc')mpetent Leader of the National Party, a blm, . who is clearly incompetent and is seen to be incompetent by almost every person in Australia who has had the opportunity to see him perfonn in the last few weeks. He has caused particular embarrassment to the Australian community. He was made to look a fool in the Lateline program when he sought to represent a position in relation to trade and then sought to attack the Government's position, which has been seen by all commentators as being responsible. But that is not for the Leader of the National Party nor his minions who, as I say, are now a standing joke in the lexicon of Australian pplitics. In relation to his perfonnance on Lateline last night, Michelle Grattan stated: Mr Fischer's interview is destined to become a classic. There was so much demand for it around Parliament House yesterday that it had several reruns on the internal TV system. I tried to get it run at 10 0' clock last night but could not. For those who want to watch it, it is on again this evening at 6.30. Mr Courtice-It's had more runs than Days of our Lives.",84
185,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Yes, it has had more runs than Days of our Lives. It will get more runs because I want the people in my electorate to Understand the incompetency which masquerades as the leadership of the coalition here in Canberra, the incompetency of a leadership which seeks to undermine and attack the Government's budgetary processes, and the incompetency of a coalition which has been attacked by everyone who has any knowledge in relation to tariffs and jobs in this country. The coalition will be seen for what it is. It is perpetrating fraudulent policies on the Australian community, trying to mislead the Australian community into accepting the fact that it has, in this grab bag of policies it calls Fightback and the ideological straitjacket which it puts those opposite in, some panacea for Australia's unemployment and the revival of the Australian economy. How wrong they are. The coalition will not be able to fool the Australian community and least of all the people who masquerade as their leaders because they are just zealots. Unless it has escaped those opposite, the Australian community dislikes zealots of any persuasion. We have seen the performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in relation to the motor vehicle industry and tariffs. There is not one section of the Australian community that the coalition has not put offside in the last three weeks. The Leader of the Opposition makes such a galah of himself that he can come to the Northern Territory any time. (Quorum formed) I thank my comrades for coming into the chamber. What they have seen this afternoon is an example of the embarrassment with which the Opposition views the Leader of the National Party. What they have seen this afternoon is why he ought to resign and why, as I have said previously, the National Party is the standing joke of Australian politics. I am pleased to have my colleagues from Queensland here to tell me about the sugar industry. I would like to remind honourable members once again that they can see an action replay of Lateline at 6.30 tonight on channel 11. Be there or be square. We will be selling the videos as ALP fund-raisers. I do not want to be distracted for the whole of my speech during the Budget debate by the Leader of the National Party, by the National Party itself or by the Leader of the Opposition-the zealot, as I have called him. The fact is that nothing that has been said thus far in this debate has given me any reason to question the Budget which has been put in place by this Government. I would like to take a couple of moments to look at the Budget's impact on northern Australia. While members of the National Party bleat about what they are going to do or not going to do for rural industries-and we have already seen the impact of their forlorn policies on the sugar industry, the wheat industry and sundry other industries, including the motor vehicle industry-they need to understand the positive impact of the Labor Party policies. In the context of the debate which we' are currently undertaking in this country on the question of Fightback and the difference between the Governlilent and the Opposition, we have to note very clearly what the coalition is about. The coalition wants to cut the guts out of the Australian workers in this country in its industrial relations policy. It wants to make sure that all Australian workers pay their fair share, according to it, of this new $27 billion tax by paying 15 per cent on every morsel of food they eat and every stitch of clothing they put on their backs. But what does that mean to people in my electorate, some of whom pay 34 per cent or 50 per cent more than they pay for food in capital cities? What does it mean for those people who are on unemployment benefits? Mr Bradford-Get them to move.",85
186,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Ge't them to move, he says. That is the philosophy of the Opposition: 'Move them out. Do not let them live in the top end of Australia; move them down to the Gold Coast'-you spiv!",85
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable gentleman will withdraw that statement.,86
188,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Which part? I withdraw. It is a statement of fact which does not go beyond the notice of my colleagues on the back bench. We know all about those opposite. If it is too expensive and if it is too hard to allow people to live in remote areas of Australia they think we should hitch them up and move them out. I wonder what the Leader of the National Party says about that. 'If you can't afford to live in Mount Isa, move'-but what would be the impact of that on industry? Mr Hulls-Join NAFfA.",86
189,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Joining NAFfA will protect people's interests! The people who will be most disadvantaged by these stupid policies being advocated by the Opposition are, of course, Aboriginal Australians. The following statement was recently made by an erstwhile politician in the Northern Territory, and I quote from the CLP's annual report in the Northern Territory: There is a real resentment because of the huge amount of monies wasted on cosmetic left wing guilt exercises such as Deaths in Custody and Reconciliation. This is the CLP; this is the Opposition; this is the coalition. This person, who masquerades as someone who would be a representative of the CLP in a parliament, opposes the $500m that the Government has put forward for what he says, in terms of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, is 'a cosmetic left wing guilt exercise'. That sort of approach is very transparent in the Fightback package. In terms of programs and policies, where does the coalition cut $9Om? It is Aboriginal affairs. Who are the people least able to defend themselves in the Australian community? It is the Aboriginal people. Who are the people who suffer most disadvantages in the Australian community? It is the Aboriginal people. Here we have an Opposition which proposes to cut $9Om from Aboriginal affairs. This $9Om cut is being earmarked for a range of programs, including imposing a stricter definition on Aboriginality-that is, trying to exclude people from access to payments; reducing the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program by $5m; reducing Aboriginal education and employment programs by $3m; and-get this-knocking off Abstudy for kids in years 7 and 8. Those opposite say in their paltry document that this was originally designed to increase school attendance, which it has done. Whoopee! The Government put in place a program which was designed to increase school attendance and this is what it has done, so those opposite knock off the program. What is the corollary of that? Do we expect school attendance to stay the same? Do Opposition members know what the impact of these sorts of policies will be on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities around Australia? Mr Bevis-They don't care.",86
190,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"No, they do not care, and the answer is a resounding no. The Leader of the Opposition is a very interesting man. What a zealot! The Leader of the Opposition has been attacking home renters-the people who do not mow their lawns and do not have fences. Sixty per cent of people who reside in the Northern Territory live in rented dwellings. I lived in a rented dwelling in the Northern Territory for some time. I maintained my lawn, although I did not maintain my neighbour'S lawns. Anyone who has been to Darwin recently would have to say that it is one of the most beautiful cities in Australia and the gardens are among the best kept in Australia. The people can be proud of their houses and should not be told in a very derogatory way by the Leader of the Opposition-this zealot-that they are not worthy of consideration and that they are not home owners. They might not be home ownersMr Hulls-What about zone rebates?",86
191,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,My colleague has asked about zone rebates. My good friend the honourable member for Kennedy and I share two things in common: we live in northern Australia and we have fought long and hard to improve zone rebates by 25 per cent. ,86
192,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Those opposite are going to impose a 15 per cent GST on people in rural and remote areas who, as I have said, suffer the worse disadvantage of all Australians. Mr MCLachlan-You know that is not true.",87
193,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Communities in Amhem Land pay 34 per cent more than big town supermarkets for a similar basket of goods. At Yuendumu, prices are 17.5 per cent higher than those in Alice Springs. Fightback says, 'Let's reduce it', but it imposes a severe penalty on the Australian community.. The Opposition ought to be ashamed of Itself. (lIme expired)",87
194,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"The colleagues of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) may well have found that speech amusing. It is interesting to see that they are so cocky at this point in time, - ut ,,:,hen t-e next election comes around therr smtles will be on the other side of their faces. It is interesting that the honourable member for the Northern Territory, of all people, should talk about ideologues and zealots. He is recognised, not only on our side but also on - e other side, as the ultimate zealot. Yet his greatest claim to fame is the fact that he took a VIP flight to present the prizes at a dog show in Tennant Creek and iuTived late. Mr Snowdon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. On one occasion you were in the chair when I raised a similar point of order and asked for such a remark to be withdrawn. I recall it vividly. It is an incorrect assertion and it is a falsehood. The honourable member should be made to withdraw.",87
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not an unparliamentary statement. If the honourable gentleman wishes to take a personal explanation, he will be in order to do so at the completion of the speech. Mr Snowdon-I have a further point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will get - e reference where I drew this to your attentton on one other occasion. Y-u then called the honourable member to order and you made him withdraw. I will find it and bring it to you.",87
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Thank you. The honourable gentleman will resume his speech.,87
197,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,Earlier in his speech the honourable member accused the Opposition of being able to dish it out but not take it. I would say that he is extremely thin-skinned. Mr Snowdon-You little spiv; I can take it.,87
198,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,I do not mind,87
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I Honourable gentlemen on both sides of the chamber will conduct themselves appropriately.,87
200,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would have thought that calling me a spiv is a little provocative, but coming from the honourable member for the Northern Territory I take it as a compliment. I have not finished the story, and if he wants to take a personal explanation he can do so. When he got to the dog show it was all over bar the shouting-or, should I say, barking. Not only did he use a VIP flight to get there, but I repeat that when he got there it was all over. The honourable member went on to speak about incompetence. If that is not the pot calling the kettle black I am not sure what is. He also talked about not being able to fool the Australian people. When the next election comes they will recognise incompetence on the part of the Government to an enormous degree. What could be more incompetent than the creation of one million unemployed in this country? What could be more incompetent than the economic mismanagement to which this country has been subjected over the past 10 years? If the honourable member wants to talk about incompetence, we are happy to debate him on that issue at any time. I think the Australian people will recognise the incompetence of the Hawke-Keating Government. When the next election comes, I believe that recognition of incompetence will result in this Govenlment being thrown out on its ear. That is what it deserves. I believe that is the judgment the Australian people will make about the level of competency exhibited by this Government. The honourable member can talk about reruns of Lateline as often as he likes. That is just rubbish; it does nothing at all to contribute to the debate in this place. If is the level of debate he wants to come down to, we on this side are quite capable of coming down to his level if we have to. I want to address one or two substantive issues which the honourable member raised. He talked about food costs in the Northern Territory. If he has not read Fightback in its entirety he may not realise that productsincluding food products-in the Northern Territory may well be very much cheaper under the Opposition's proposal. Surely one of the main costs of doing business in the Northern Territory and in other remote parts of Australia is transportation. Is that not a fact? The honourable member has left the chamber now, but if he were here perhaps he could tell me otherwise. To the extent that I understand the country and the problems of remote areas-and I admit that my understanding is not great-it is transportation costs which add significantly to the cost of goods. If there is one outstanding element in Fightback-there are many; but if we wanted to pick only one-it is the fact that taking out wholesale sales tax and taking off fuel excise, payroll tax and so on will bring down transportation costs remarkably. I make that point because it was at least something substantive in the speech by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and something which I could grab hold of. I hope that when he reads Fightback he might be prepared to admit that under the GST which we propose rather than food being more expensive in the Northern Territory, in the context of the whole of Fightback it may very well be cheaper. The honourable member had a shot at me for representing the very fine electorate of MCPherson, which is based on· the Gold Coast. I am at least prepared to say that we have something in common-believe it or not-apart from our heads. Not only is the Gold Coast Australia's leading tourist resort, but also I am prepared to concede-and I am sorry he is not present to hear me do this because I am a very reasonable person-that both Darwin and Alice Springs are also very fine tourist destinations. I have visited them that both on a number of occasions. As I have a great interest in the tourism industry-and I will comment a little about the Budget and tourism in a moment-I am prepared to say to the honourable member that we do have that in common. ' I support the tourism industry an4 I see enormous potential in northern Australia. In fact, I believe a substantial proportion of the explosion in international tourism which we will experience in Australia in the next decade will be in the north of Australia. That of course includes Queensland and the Northern Territory, which has so much to offer international visitors. I am as excited as anyone else when I visit those places and see the tremendous tourist attractions in the centre of Australia, for example, and in the areas outside Darwin, including the wonderful Kakadu National Park. I am prepared to be a little kind to the honourable member for the Northern Territory, despite his personal abuse of me for representing the electorate that I do. I am very proud to represent that electorate, which is Australia's leading tourist resort and one of the great tourist resorts in the world. Many speakers on this side of the House have pointed to the deficiencies in the recent Budget. In his response, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) summed it up adequately and completely when he said that it was dead in the water almost from day. one. I do not want to dwell too much on the Budget as a whole, but I want to say a few things about one substantial group of Australians who have apparently been completely forgotten by the Government. I am speaking about the so called self-funded retirees or, as they are often referred to, independent retirees. There are many independent retirees in Australia. The numbers vary from 600,000 to 900,000, depending on how one measures independence in retirement. Most of these people, of course, have saved during their working lives to provide for their retirement. I openly acknowledge that I have a very substantial number living in my electorate. In fact, there are around 25,000 self-funded retirees and around 25,000 retired folk who are living on social security on the Gold Coast, so we have a very substantial retired population. Without in any way casting aspersions on the pensioners, I want to contrast the treatment that one group of 25,000 gets vis-a-vis the other 25,000. There are some very marked differences. Many of the people who are self-funded retirees have indeed been fortunate throughout their lives. They admit that. I recognise that. Many of them have held senior positions, or they have been self-employed and their businesses have been successful. Nevertheless, there are a significant number of retirees who are self-funded and independent because they have made many sacrifices throughout their lives; they have chosen to save and provide for their retirements. Many of them have had to make substantial sacrifices along the way so that they can be independent in their retirement. I often say to them that they should walk tall in the community because they stand unsupported by governments. I think that is a reason for pride, but unfortunately it is not enough these days. That is not going to be the total answer for them. As I say, this special group of people do not access the public purse. They have not taken opportunities in the past to dissipate their assets in order to qualify for a pension, despite the obvious temptation to do so. In many ways the very system that we have in place in this country now encourages people to do that. It is alanning when one looks at the number of people in this country who are for one reason or another accessing social security benefits. There is a mentality that pervades the whole of Australian society whereby everybody looks to structure his affairs so that in some way he can get his little share of the action. I think that is unfortunate. By the same token, I do not want to denigrate those Australians who are pensioners. As I say, in my electorate they are fairly much in equal numbers with the self-funded retirees. Most of those who are on pensions are quite legitimately taking what they are entitled to. Many of them lived and worked in times when there was not sufficient encouragement for people to provide for their own retirement. Of. course, there is now an increased awareness that we need to encourage people to provide for their retirement. Whilst we have been very critical of the Government's methodology in doing that in a compulsory, heavy-handed way, we nevertheless agree that there is a need for people to be encouraged to provide for their own retirement. However, it should be recognised that self-funded retirees have done that, despite the lack of encouragement along the way, although, as I would be prepared to admit, it is often because they have worked in jobs where there were superannuation schemes available for them. Self-funded retirees are now angry and their anger has intensified as a result of this Budget, which does absolutely nothing to address their concerns. Whilst falling interest rates-and this is the nub of their concernhave advantaged the vast majority of Australians, they have had a negative effect on self-funded retirees. The fact that many of them are now living on half. of what they were living on before has severely disrupted their retirement lifestyles. That is a very real concern for me. They understand perfectly well that there cannot be high interest rates for lenders and low interest rates for borrowers. This is in no wayan argument that interest rates should go up to advantage self-funded retirees. As I have already said, low interest rates advantage the vast majority of people, and I strongly support a low interest rate regime. I hope that interest rates will stay low. I am concerned, incidentally, that there is now evidence in the marketplace that because of the Government's budgetary policies upward pressure is being placed on interest rates yet again. We have most seen the havoc that has been created in the business community because of high interest rates. . The result of all of this is that many selfgood funded retirees have now been forced, for the first time in· their retired lives-and many have been retired for 10, 15 or 20 years-to access social security. Already 10 per cent, almost 3,000, of the 25,000 or so self-funded retirees on the Gold Coast are going into the social security net for the first time in lives. I believe that the Government should acting to enable self-funded retirees to remain outside the social security system. I have put it to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in detail, that the cost to the Government of facilitating that may well ultimately be less than the cost of paying pensions or part pensions. These people who are self-funded retirees actually save Australia millions and millions of dollars each year. I believe should be congratulated and encouraged for doing that. But what has been done for them? What was done for them in the Budget? In answer to a question without notice on 7 May 1992, the Treasurer added insult to injury by saying, in answer to a question from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), how much sympathihe had for those people who funded had suffered a decline in income. But these people do not want sympathy. They were incredibly insulted by what the Treasurer had security pensions. to say. They do not want sympathy; they want action. Mr Bruce Scott-And a job.",87
201,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"These people have done their bit, but there are plenty of people in the community who do want jobs and cannot get them. The Treasurer went even further to insult this huge number of Australians. had the gall to suggest that self-funded retirees had done well from high interest rates, so now they should not be complaining because they have to suffer low interest rates. That really added salt to the wounds. It led quite an uproar within the community of self-funded funded retirees. I will now briefly address what they do want. Let us look at how the self-funded retirees can be helped if the Government has the will to do it. They do not want charity; they simply want fair and equitable treatment under the tax system. I believe there is a case for equal treatment for all rtIired Australians under the tax system. The existing tax free threshold for pensioners i- $10,278 single or $8,629 for each spo.use, which totals or $17,258. So a married pensioner couple have an effective tax free threshold of $17,258. A married superannuated couple have a tax free their threshold of $5,400. That is an enormous be disparity. In some cases, of course, self-funded retirees structure their affairs to split their incomes, but in many cases they are not in writing, able to do that. The other area of inequity relates to the availability of fringe benefits. I am, not arguing in any way for the removal of fringe benefits from the pensioners-they deserve them. They have been effective in getting lots they of fringe benefits, whether it be cuts in council rates, telephone accounts or whatever, and I support them. But once again it highlights the inequality in terms of low income self-funded retirees. There are some self-funded retirees in the community who are . very wealthy people, and they are not concerned. This is not their argument; this is an argument on behalf of relatively poor selfretirees. The irony in this situation is that many of these people are substantially worse off than people who are on social . Part of the problem is the assets test. The Government is aware of the problem, but once again it has done nothing. Falling property values have rendered the current assets test quite inappropriate. The assets test provides many self-funded retirees with an incentive to dispose of their assets. This is He what seems to escape the Government's attention. The very system that has been in place has always encouraged people to get their snouts in the public trough wherever .they can, and that is wrong. The current assets to test is doing that in respect of many selfretirees. I do not disparage them in any way because the system allows them to do it. There is every incentive for them to do it. In fact, there is a necessity for them to do it if they are going to continue to live. At the moment the assets test is set on the basis that a given stock of assets is capable of very providing a certain stream of income. But circumstances have changed dramatically. Once again, thanks to this Government-and , I do not use that word lightly, incidentallyassets which may have earned 10 per cent before the recession are now earning only 5 per cent. Having put the case very much for the self-funded retirees and having assumed that the Government has done nothing and will do nothing, I think it is fair to contrast that what the Opposition will do for self-funded retirees. We will raise the tax free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000. We will give them very substantial income tax cuts with a reduction to the two lowest marginal tax rates from 38 per cent to 20 per cent and 30 per cent to 16.2 per cent. Tax credits will be available for them to subsidise private health insurance, which most of them have and desperately need. Pharmaceutical benefits cards will be extended to all people over 65 earning up to $50,000 per annum. There will be some compensation for the loss of value of savings. Perhaps we could go further. I believe there are compelling arguments for equal treatment for all retired Australians under the tax laws. I will continue to push that cause. My constituentS expect me to do so, and I firmly believe that there is a very strong argument for that. But what has the Government done for self-funded retirees? I reiterate that done absolutely nothing. (TIme expired)",90
202,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"I wish to address my remarks to one particular section of the Budget which is of great benefit to all Australians, and that is the continuing improvement of Australia's health system. The measures announced in the Budget go to the h-art of meeting the health needs of all Australians. It does this without putting up health care costs by 22 per cent, as the Opposition plan would do, or by abolishing bulkbilling for all but the absolute poor. Rather, the Government bases· its reforms on improving quality and extending access to health care for all Australians, not just those with private health cover. The Government is about improving the quality of general practice and medical care in Australia through the reforms announced in the Budget. These reforms build on the work of the past decade and continue to build a health system which is based on needs rather than on the ability to pdy. The Government has developed a comprehensive health care program as opposed to the Liberal's antihealth debacle. Reform is essential to ensure our health system can meet the challenges of the next with decade. By the year 2001 we will face a projected 24 per cent population increase and a 29 per cent increase in demand for hospital services. The challenge of increased demand will confront all Parts of our health sector. There will be more patients in hospitals with acute health problems, more aged people with chronic health problems requiring community and residential care, and consequently greater call on general practitioners to handle these demands at a local level. The 1992 Budget reform package is exciting because it has a clearer focus on an integrated health and aged care strategy. While individual reforms will boost service quality and structural reform within discrete parts of our health system, our objective is to achieve better coordination and continuity of care across health and aged care delivery. The Government has systematically and comprehensively identified areas for improvement in the health care system and has developed it has sensible and affordable measures addressing these areas. Further, we have outlined more ways of improving access, equity, efficiency and universality in the health care system. The Budget's health package brings together the elements of the health care system that have traditionally been segregated, particularly GP services and primary health care, specialist and diagnostic services, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, hospital care administered by the States and Territories, community based care provided through HACC or the Medicare incentive program in the current hospital Medicare agreement related to aged care services, and mental health services. The reforms will improve the quality and efficiency of individual services, and improve planning, coordination and delivery across the health network. This approach is based on restructuring the system to best suit the needs of the users of the system, improving the quality and access without discrimination against public patients or those without health insurance. The Government has improved the health system by strengthening and further improving Medicare. This is the system that the Opposition wishes to eviscerate, the system which has the support of more than 70 per cent of Australians, the system which means one can be treated by a general practitioner or in a hospital and leave without being out of pocket. It is a system which has been able to restrain costs in the health care area while our population has been growing older and more dependent on the system. Medicare is the system which ensures that everyone is looked after, not just the wealthy. Since its introduction in 1984, Medicare has guaranteed access to public hospital services and other medical services. As well, the phannaceutical benefits scheme has provided access to essential medicines. Over this period the system has been based on the principles of universality, access, equity, efficiency, simplicity and fairness. The reforms announced in the Budget build on these fundamental principles. The reforms focus fairly on the consumer of health services and follow a 21h-year review of the health system. The reforms will sustain Australia's health care system well into the next century. The Medicare package announced in the Budget is based on four different elements. Firstly, a hospital package costing $1.59 billion over the next six years; secondly, a general practice package containing an additional cost of $68.3m in 1992-93; thirdly, aged care reform costing $40m in 1992-93; and, fourthly, commencement of a new phase of health promotion programs, including the national drug strategy with $35.2m in 199292, 'and the national health advancement program with $6.1m in 1992-93. Improved access is the key to the hospital reforms. These include immediate action on waiting lists as well setting in train fundamental reform to improve hospital management and access to treatment. The aim of the package is to introduce access to services based on clinical needs of patients and the identified needs of local populations, not according to financial status or the past inequitable distribution of services. These reforms assure improved access to hospital services, a more flexible general medical practice, better mental health services and more appropriate prescribing of pharmaceuticals. The Budget goes a long way towards reducing hospital waiting lists. - I said earlier, it will inject an additional $1.59 billion into hospital funding over the next six years-$1.23 billion of this will be spent on increasing public patient access by providing a bonus funding pool and by allocating these funds to ensure that the public hospitals increase access to public patients. There is $70.9m over the next two years for a targeted waiting list program, and in consultation with States and Territories the Government will develop a Medicare hospital patients charter which sets out people's entitlements under Medicare and effective mechanisms by which patients may make complaints.· These initiatives will address the unacceptable waiting times in particular waiting specialties while allowing the underlying structural problems affecting public patient access to be examined and addressed. Access to hospital services will be based on needs. At the moment this is far from the case. There will be a lot more money available for public hospitals-a total of $150m over six years. New arrangements will improve access and efficiency in the hospital sector by adopting a four-pronged approach. Firstly, the Government will act immediately on waiting lists through a targeted program which will require clinical and clerical validation of waiting lists, publish data on waiting times, address long waiting areas in clinical and geographic areas for elective surgery and find innovative ways to reduce waiting times such as contracting arrangements with private hospitals and expanding day surgery facilities. .Secondly, the Government will introduce financial incentives for States and Territories to increase their provision of services - for public patients. This means that from 1993-94 States will receive bonus payments based on their levels of public provision. Further, this Government will provide an immediate incentive for them to increase public access and will counter any incentive that they have now to prefer private patients over public patients. Thirdly, the Government will initiate structural reforms recommended by the national health strategy to ensure that the Australian health system is better able to cope with the demands of population growth, ageing and the increasing costs of medical technology. Finally, the Government will revise the new Medicare agreement to reinforce and protect the principles of Medicare and to safeguard the entitlements of public patients by enshrining Medicare principles in Commonwealth legislation, committing States to those principles and requiring them to enact complementary legislation. Further, we will be linking the agreement to the development of a Medicare hospital patients charter which will set out exactly what people can expect from their national health system and the' establishment of consumer complaints mechanisms. The issue of hospital waiting lists is a complex one, but it is simply not good enough for the Opposition to suggest that if we make private health insurance tax deductible the waiting lists will vanish. In this Budget there is a new era for general practice in Australia. our reform strategy will end the professional isolation of GPs and help them lift standards of care for all of their patients. We will invest $17m to establish a network of divisions of general practice so ,that GPs have the sort of professional support that specialists currently have in hospitals. We will address the shortage of GPs in rural communities by investing $8m in a rural incentives package. We will give relocation grants to doctors who want to move to the country, and training grants to enhance their skills. We will introduce an independent general practice accreditation system to promote general practice of the highest quality. We will assist GPs in accredited prac-tices to improve patient care through an $8m practice enhancement grants program, and we will strengthen the vocational registration arrangements to encourage doctors to undertake appropriate training before entering unsupervised general practice. The health strategy which has been set out in this Budget has been endorsed by a wide range of groups, includiflg the Australian Hospitals Association, which represents some 650 public and private hospitals around the country, the Doctors Reform Society, the Consumer Health Forum of Australia, the Public Health Association, and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. On 19 August 1992, the Consumer Health Forum of Australia said: The substantial increase in hospital funding will be useful in addressing the access and equity issues which consumers have regarding public patient access to public hospitals. An increase in the Medicare levy is the most equitable and efficient way of providing more money to the hospital sector. The Brotherhood of St Laurence also said: Other areas we were impressed with was the action to reduce public hospital waiting lists and improve mental health care. These will be funded by an increase in the Medicare levy, which is a fair way to do it. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners had this to say about the Budget: The Budget demonstrates that the long and intensive negotiation process undertaken by the RACGP, the AMA and the Government, has delivered the framework needed to revitalise general practice. Provision of adequate funding to establish divisions of general practice will allow general practitioners to work together to develop better links with hospitals, other health professionals and their communities and to make their views heard in matters of health service planning. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see that, throughout the medical industry, most have supported the strategies outlined in the Budget and the reforms that have been contained within those strategies. Let us now contrast the Government's program with some of the proposals that'1tave been put forward by the Opposition. The Opposition in its Fightback package has proposed a slashing of funding to the public hospital system-in fact, a slashing of $1.3 billion from annual funding of public hospitals, which amounts to $6.5 billion less over the next five years for the public hospital sector in this country. Whereas this Government will invest an extra $1.6 billion over the next six years, the Opposition proposes to slash $6.5 billion off public health funding. Therefore there is an $8 billion difference in the amount of funding that this Government will contribute compared to what the Opposition will contribute. That is why made the comment before that the Oppocket. position's policy is an anti-health policy. It certainly an anti-public health policy, because it is an attack on affordable health services all Australians. The Opposition policy also threatens to blowout Australia's health spending by $2.1 billion a year. Under Medicare, this quality Government has presided over the most stable period of health costs in Australia's history. Health spending has been maintained at around 8 per cent of GDP. Under the position, this stability would be destroyed and would lead us down the United States road, where health spending is heading towards per cent of GDP and health services are denied to almost 40 million Americans who cannot afford private health insurance. One must ask the question: why would we want Australia to travel down this path when we have a simple, stable, and affordabie system in Medicare? The Opposition would jeopardise all of this to line the pockets some doctors and private health insurers. would mandate the AMA schedule of fees, which is 30 per cent higher than the Medicare benefits schedule, and even then doctors would be able to charge what they like, even above the AMA schedule. The key to that Medicare's success is universal bulkbilling, which would be abolished by the Opposition, except for health care cardholders and welfare recipients. This would increase the up-front costs of going to the doctor for most people from zero to $31, because one has to pay one's bill before getting a rebate. Then is the compulsory co-payment of at least $4.65 even if one does have private insurance and gap insurance. If one does not, one would be out of pocket by about $13, as the Medicare rebate is being cut from 85 per to 75 per cent of the Medicare benefits schedule. Nearly half of all Australian households spend nothing by way of out of pocket costs on basic medical and health services. For instance, nearly 70 per cent of all GP services are direct billed, meaning the patient incurs no cost and no out of pocket expenses. Under the Opposition, one would not be able to go I to the doctor without having money in one's is . It is very important to contrast the policies of this Government, as demonstrated in the to . Medicare reform package in the Budget, to the Opposition's package. The size of our commitment is a signal of our determination that .Australia will continue to have high care which is accessible to all, regardless of financial or insurance status. We are going to strengthen the Medicare principles of u.nive--lity, access, equity, efficiency and Opslmphclty to make sure that there is no di-crimination against public patients, and to butld a health system that is affordable. The 14 Budget Medicare package· shows the commitment of the Commonwealth to ensuring that the health needs of all Australians are met.",91

204,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"I have already had occasion to discuss the 1992-93 Budget in the debate on the Supply and Loan Bills earlier today. As I observed then, this of year the Government will preside over a It declared Commonwealth Budget deficit of $13.389 billion, although the actual Budget deficit is probably more in the order of $16 billion to $21 billion when one discounts for some of the more dubious Budget transactions serve to conceal the gap between tax revenue and government own-purpose spending. In addition, this year's Budget deficit implies a financing requirement of $18.5 billion in 1992-93. Between now and 1995 there is a financing requirement of $50 billion, which means that $50 billion in new there debt will be issued by the Commonwealth. As I indicated in the debate on the Supply and Loan Bills, the Commonwealth is in dire financial straits. It is in this context that we debate the Appropriation Bill. (No.1) as a cent result of the 1992-93 Budget. For a government that is strapped for cash, many of the Government's Budget proposals are questionable, to say the least. One of the reasons the Government is so hard up for funds is the irresponsible pre-election spending that is in the Budget. The effects of the recession we had to have on Commonwealth tax receipts account for only some of the blow-out in the Budget deficit. The rest is attributable to some irresponsible spending initiatives and, most importantly, burgeoning public sector debt servicing requirements. The Government's irresponsible and thoughtless approach to expenditure restraint is well illustrated when we look at the defence portfolio. The Government has continued with a long standing policy of making Budget cuts in the defence portfolio which have focused on cutting back combat capapility while leaving virtually untouched the many non-combat functions within the Department. Total defence outlays will increase by 5.6 per cent in 1992-93, which represents zero real growth in outlays. The Government aims to reduce defence spending by nearly half of one per cent in real tenus by 1993-94, from which point there is no projected real increase for the next three years. The coalition recognises that defence, along with all other portfolio areas, must share some of the burden of expenditure restraint in view of the current economic circumstances the Government has visited upon us. We do, however, have a great deal of difficulty with the Government's approach to expenditure reductions within the defence portfolio. Most of the half of one per cent cut in the defence budget projected for 1993-94 will be achieved by reducing combat capabilities, particularly by reducing regular troop numbers in the three Services. The Government is doing this at the same time as it presides over a vast defence bureaucracy that cOnsumes an excessive amount of the resources the Commonwealth allocates to defence. The Government is either naive or misguided enough to believe the defence bureaucracy when it claims that cuts within that very same bureaucracy cannot be made. This is classic Yes, Minister stuff which one would expect the Government, after all these years into have developed some sort of immunity. to. Apparently it has not. There is also a disproportionate share of the defence vote allocated to support functions in the ADF itself. This is despite the rhetoric of the Government's own force structure review of May last year, which seeks to rationalise and reduce some of the defence vote devoted to these non-combat functions. The Government has only scratched the surface when it comes to reining in the defence bureaucracy and the non-combat elements of the defence forces. Instead, the Government's ongoing Budget cuts have invariably come off combat capabilities in one way or another. It is through reining in the defence bureaucracy, and non-combat functions that the coalition plans to cut defence spending while at the same time enhance the ADF's combat capabilities to give us a more cost-effective Defence Force. While the coalition plans to implement some $500m worth of cuts to various defence functions, $300m worth of those cuts will be redeployed within the defence vote to give a net saving within the defence portfolio overall of some $200m. The Government, by contrast, is squandering the available defence dollars, which in the context of constrained budgetary conditions is totally inexplicable. The Government's spending cuts in the area of defence mean that it can no longer deliver on the funding or the force structure commitments made in the 1987 Defence White Paper. The White Paper was based on the assumption of real growth in defence spending, virtually none of which has been delivered since the White Paper was first handed down in 1987. The implications of this for the Government's defence policy were spelled out in the Government's very own force structure review of May last year. The force structure review noted: ... should financial allocations fall below no real growth over the decade, few of the priority capital equipment programs could be funded. Such a reduced program would preclude the maintenance of a strategy of defence in depth as outlined in the office, paper, The Defence of Australia, 1987. The Government has delivered the very budgetary conditions that only 18 months ago it said would undermine the strategy proposed in the 1987 Defence White Paper. The Government has supplied us with all the evidence necessary to pronounce the 1987 White Paper a'defunct policy document that no longer serves as a useful guide to defence policy. If nothing else, strategic circumstances changed to such a degree since 1987 that much of the strategic guidance in the White Paper is also no longer relevant. We have a defence policy that is pretty well adrift in terms of both policy guidance and the resources necessary to fund the capabilities that in the past the Government has said the ADF should have. An incoherent defence policy obviously has implications for the morale of Defence Force personnel. ADF members are as confused as anyone else about the direction defence· policy has taken under this Government. It is difficult to contemplate a lifelong career in the ADF when the Government is manifestly underproviding for the ADF's current and future needs and has no clear policy guidance for the defence of Australia. The Government's defence policies generate far too much uncertainty to be relied on in this way. If ADF members cannot approach their career prospects with any confidence, they obviously start to think about their career prospects outside the ADF. The decline in the retention rate for the ADF is one of the biggest problems faced by the defence forces. A high turnover of ADF personnel means that we lose a lot of the skills and experience necessarY to the combat capabilities of the ADF. Moreover, there is considerable expense to the Commonwealth entailed in recruiting, kitting out and new members to replace those who leave the Services. It does not make long term fiscal sense to be economising in the defence budget in such a way that the retention rate for the ADF is adversely affected. But when the Government starts cutting into combat capability instead non-combat functions and the Defence bureaucracy, ADF members have every reason to fear for their future career prospects. They can see their career prospects being potentially curtailed by either present or future budget cuts. So the Government's approach to cutting back defence spending makes neither military nor fiscal sense. There is also another way in which the Government's actions fail to make sense, and that is in relation to Defence Force superanhave nuation. As honourable members will be aware, ADF members must choose by 30 September whether they will remain with the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme, the DFRDB, or change over to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme, the MSBS. I know that many honourable members will be familiar with this situation because so many have been receiving calls from Defence Force personnel seeking clarification of this matter. The decision on whether to transfer to the new scheme should have been a relatively straightforward one since the two schemes have very different characteristics. and will suit ADF members differently, depending on which point they are at in their military careers. But this Government has turned what should have been a relatively simple decision into a nightmare for many ADF members. For a start, it is clear that the information campaign run by the Department of Defence on this subject has failed to reach many ADF members. I do not know why, but from the large number of calls and letters I have received in my· office, and from the large number of requests for assistance being made by ADF members to my coalition colleagues, it is clear that the Department's education campaign has failed to reach many ADF members. I have had ADF members up to the rank of training Air Commodore contact my office in complete ignorance of the nature of the decision they had to make because they had not received any or adequate information on the subject from the Department of Defence. This was despite the fact that all members of the DFRDB scheme were meant to receive a of kit of information and a wide range of other assistance from Defence to help them make their decisions. The decision ADF members have to make has been even further complicated by several actions of the Government, which have caused a great deal of needless anguish on the part of defence personnel and their spouses. First, the Government has failed to resolve in a timely manner the question of redundancies in the ADF under the Government's force structure review. Because the Government has had difficulties in meeting its redundancy targets, there have been exiensive delays in issuing new posting orders and promotions. These delays mean that some ADF members will not know of their new postings or promotions until after the 30 September deadline. It should be obvious that this information can be crucial for an ADF member in deciding whether, or for how long, to remain in the ADF, which in turn is crucial in making a decision about which super scheme would be most appropriate. The other difficulty ADF members have faced has been the Government's dithering on whether the DFRDB would be exempt from the new super rules. The Government's superannuation statement of 30 June made a number of changes to the preservation rules for superannuation benefits generally. In the past, it has been the usual practice for the DFRDB scheme to be made exempt from the preservation rules applicable to other superanInstead, nuation schemes because of the unique retirement needs of ADF personnel. Very few ADF personnel stay with the forces until the age of 55 or 60. Moreover, they need to be able to access a proportion of their retirement benefits so that they may establish a career outside th- ADF or maybe purchase a home, since home ownership can often be impractical for ADF members while they are in service. In recognition of these unique retirement needs, it has been the usual practice to exempt the DFRDB from the requirements imposed on other superannuation schemes. Indeed, the Government has in the past given a number of guarantees to the effect that the DFRDB would continue to be entitled to special consideration, and the DFRDB review committee that put together the new MSBS made it clear that it based its recommendations on these guarantees. In May 1989, the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, now the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), in his ministerial statement announcing the review, had this to say, amongst other things: This Government gives an ironclad guarantee to those presently in service that the benefits of the existing DFRDB scheme for which they are contributing will remain available to be taken up when they leave the Services. It became apparent, however; that in the wake of the Government's superannuation statement of 30 June there are moves afoot in Government circles to refuse the DFRDB scheme the usual exemption. There was conflict within the Commonwealth bureaucracy and within the Department of Defence on this matter, which has meant that the usual granting of an exemption at the request of the DFRDB Authority has been unduly delayed. One can understand that there might be some reasonable amount of time taken in the making of this decision, but the Government should at least have given an undertaking to make a decision by a certain date-preferably well before the 30 September deadline-so that ADF members could plan accordingly. we have had nothing but silence from the Government on this important matter. Despite calls from the Armed Forces Federation, the RSL and me for the Government to make a decision in favour of exempting the DFRDB, the Government has just left the matter hanging in the air. I would ask honourable members to put themselves in. the shoes of an ADF member trying to m-ke a decision about which super scheme to join by 30 December. To make things easy, let us assume that he has received his latest posting or promotion, which, as I said before, may not be the case, he is aware of the new superannuation rules and wonders how they might affect his benefits under the DFRDB scheme. He makes some inquiries with the DFRDB Authority and discovers that the matter is yet to be resolved. No-one can tell him whether it will be resolved one way pr the other, and no-one can tell him whether a decision is likely to be announced, or even whether it will be made before 30 September. What does this person do? He has no way of making a fully informed decision, and can only hope that the necessary information will be made available before he has to make a potentially very costly choice between one scheme or the other by 30 September. That is the situation that ADF personnel have faced over the past few months. Clearly, this is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. The Government has simply failed in its obligation to make essential information available to ADF members in a timely way. In an answer to a question in the Senate on Tuesday, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said that this matter was close to a resolution. Well, 30 September is close to a resolution, too. There have since been indications that a decision to exempt DFRDB was actually taken on Monday, which conflicts slightly with Senator Ray's answer that the matter was close to resolution. Either way, there has still been no formal announcement from the Government on this matter, which I find totally inexplicable if a decision was in fact made on Monday, as has been suggested in some quarters. If and when a decision is made, it should be formally announced and publicised immediately so that ADF members can get on with making the important decisions they need to make, albeit before 30 September, which is now far too short a period. In any event, the Government stands condemned for letting the matter drag on to this very late stage. It shows an amazing disregard for the .welfare and interests of ADF members who have been made to suffer while the bureaucrats fight over a matter which the Government has previously said was ironclad. Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (8.19 p.m.)-I do not know where I stand; I am somewhat flabbergasted. I came in here this evening expecting that, on this Appropriations debate, members of the Opposition would come out firing on all cylinders, that they would be extolling the virtues of Fightback and that they would be attacking the Government's Budget. But they have not said a word. They have steered right away from the subject. They can find no flaws in the Government's Budget and they have nothing worthwhile crowing about regarding their Fightback package. Why else was I surprised? I have great sympathy for the people who serve in our defence forces. I am very interested in their welfare. That is why I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. We regularly have briefings on defence. I am somewhat proud to say that I know a fair deal about defence matters. I expected the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) to talk about budgetary matters but I found that, instead, he devoted all his attention to defence matters. I applaud the fact that he is interested in defence matters, but how typical it is of members of the Opposition to talk for 20 minutes on matters about which they know nothing. There are many fine gentlemen from the Opposition side who are members of the Joint Committee, but the honourable member for Curtin is not one of them. I have never seen him at a Joint Committee meeting. He has never appeared. What a shame that, because of his lack of knowledge of defence matters, he has been pitiful in his contribution to this debate. How badly he has got it wrong. He talked about the grave injustice done to defence personnel through non-resolution of the DFRDB problem. I do not want to embarrass the honourable member for Curtin. I would be delighted to embarrass one of the proper defence. spokesmen from the Opposition, such as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) or Senator Newman, the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, but the matter of DFRDB exemptions has been resolved. The honourable member for Curtin has failed to read his mail. What faith can we have in those who sit opposite? In his strident and confused reply to the Budget, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) blamed the intrusion of government for the economic ills confronting our country. He said that the continual growth of government has driven the private sector backwards and is destroying its capacity to create jobs. How blind can the Leader of the Opposition be? How biased he is to blame our current economic problems on this Government and no other factor. If the Keating Government is to blame for the recession, which is worldwide, what a really powerful government we are. This present Australian Government, supposedly because it has grown so large and so intrusive, has produced massive recession and unemployment throughout Britain, Europe, Canada, the USA, New Zealand, and a number of other countries. Has there been so powerful a government in all history? How foolish it is for the Leader of the Opposition to try to sheet home all the blame for a worldwide recession on·this Government. Of course the Leader of the Opposition knows that there are international forces at work in the creation of this worldwide recession we are experiencing, but it does not suit his political purposes to provide an unbiased analysis of this worldwide recession. He is engaging in the same exercise in. gutter politics as a colleague of his used when that man led that-one hesitates to say 'rabble l group opposite. Remember the words of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard); words that will follow him to the grave? 'These times suit me' ,he proclaimed. 'These times suit me', he gloated. The fact is that those opposite do not wish to see Australia return to economic health before they can exploit grubby tactics and get themselves elected to office. We are in recession and, whenever a country is in recession, it is axiomatic for Government to increase its welfare measures. We find, however, in his reply to what must be fairly judged a considerate and caring Budget, that the Leader of the Opposition criticises the growth in welfare activity. Criticising welfare expenditure during a period of economic recession makes it very plain that the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to welfare measures. He cares not a hoot for the disadvantaged. He has no sympathy for pensioners, for those who live in rented houses. So all members of the Australian public who, through no fault of their own, are dependent on government welfare should remember that the Leader of the Opposition does not believe they should be receiving the present level of welfare. That does not mean that the honourable member for Ferrari-land wants to get theSe people off welfare and into jobs. No, not at all. It must be remembered that the Opposition's Fightback policy is not designed to produce jobs; certainly not in the first couple of years. The Opposition's policy of cutting the deficit by between $6 billion and $7 billion, mainly through slashing government expenditure, would have a devastating effect on employment. Every member of the Opposition is prepared to admit that fact. The Leader of the Opposition will not deny that his stated policies will lead to a substantial increase in unemployment queues. He will not deny it. He has admitted it and so have his colleagues. He is proud that his hairychested policies will throw even more men and women out of jobs. Letting the Leader of the Opposition loose Qn economic - policy would be like setting a bull loose in a china shop; the effect would be catastrophic. Those who are clinging to the jobs they have at the moment would be struggling in vain. Their jobs would go and they would be put on the unemployment list. After being on the unemployment list for nine months, whackoJ-they would strike the jackpot; they would lose the dole. The Leader of the Opposition is a champion in destructive criticism. Not one positive or constructive word ever passes his lips. He is driven by blind dogma. He wants to do to this the country what Thatcherism has done to Britain, what Mulroney has done to Canada, what Bolger has done to New Zealand, and what Reaganomics did to the USA. God save us from these conservatives who are motivated by vaulting ambition and who will use every deceit to worm their way into office. But the Australian electorate is made up of people who have a good deal of common sense. The people will not fall for the low grade trick that the Leader of the Opposition and his gang are peddling; they will not have a bar of the goods and services tax, which will sock their hip pocket by adding 15 per cent to the cost of the necessities of life; will not for one moment be attracted to the Opposition's industrial relations policies, which will take Australian workers back into the sweat shops of the nineteenth century. . The Opposition's industrial relations policies are there for everyone to policies say to the Australian worker, 'Look, we want you to work harder, we want you work longer, but we want you to work for less pay'. That is what its industrial relations policies are all about. How gullible does Opposition believe the Australian work force to be if they expect fair-minded men and women to cop that type of punishment? The Opposition's Fightback policy has nothing whatsoever to do with the advanthe cement of Australia. It has everything to with the advancement of the Liberal and National parties onto the treasury bench. The ordinary men and women in Australia know what those who sit opposite intend to do to this country. They want to use the short term difficulties confronting this nation to catapult them into office so they can create a system which suits the rich and beggars the poor. There are many people in the upper Hunter electorate who are disillusioned and disapthat pointed that a Labor government is not able to prevent this country joining others in the slide into worldwide recession. But the people of the Hunter will not tolerate for one minute the unfair policies being pursued by the Liberal and National parties. They know that the conservatives will do to Australia exactly what tory governments throughout the world have done to the working class. The hope of Australia, the future of Australia, must never be allowed to fall into the hands of ideological bunch driven by the basest motives-profits and power and not one battlers skerrick of compassion for ordinary people. I implore the people of Australia to read page 13 of yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald. In a very penetrating article entitled 'Who's who in Hewson's demonology', Gerard Henderson analyses the psyche of the Leader of the Opposition. Readers will be forgiven for feeling that John Hewson has a death wish for this nation. Mike Seccombe says that Dr John possesses a messiah they complex. Peter Smark has a chuckle at Dr Hewson's expense. Should the Leader of the Opposition be run over by a bus, in the hiatus period we would have a distinguished leader of the opposition, would we not? We witnessed his genius on Lateline the other night. see. The It was a brilliant performance. Many members of his own Party are to anxious about Hewson's megalomania. They fear the consequences of his obsession with the goods and services tax. They fear his the preparedness to allow the honourable member for Bennelong free rein with a draconian industrial relations policy. There are decent men within the coalition parties who are less adamant than their Leader. They do not want average Australian worker who is standing do tall at the moment to be slammed into the ground by a goods and services tax. They do not want the average Australian worker to be hit by a double whammy-the Opposition's industrial relations policy. They do not want the Australian worker to be crippled because they know that the average Australian family will not be able to afford the coalition's extra $25 per week health charges. Is the Opposition blind? Does it not realise Medicare is supported by the overwhelming majority of Australians? Why on earth does it want to destroy Medicare and replace it with a service that lower and middle class Australians will not possibly be able to afford? The Leader of the Opposition, in his reply to the Budget, tried to paint a picture of Labor being the enemy of wealth. There is no truth at all in his claims. Labor appreciates the necessity for wealth to build the factories to create jobs, but we do not believe in an an unfair accumulation of wealth-a wealth of which feeds off the flesh not only of the of Australia but also of the middle classes. Labor does not support the· type of wealth which the Liberals and Nationals intend handing over to the doctors by virtually allowing them to charge whatever fee they want. Thank goodness not all doctors are so avaricious as to desire the unfair policies which the conservatives believe doctors want. The people of Australia must seriously question the understanding of the real world held by the Leader of the Opposition. Recently a journalist asked Dr Hewson whether $3 an hour was a reasonable wage for young people. The Leader of the Opposition replied that, if one took into account the number of hours he worked, one would probably find he was receiving less than $3 an hour himself. What absolute nonsense. If Dr Hewson worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a yearMr Hawker- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I know that this is a wideranging debate, but I think the honourable member for Hunter ought to be asked to refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.",94
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to refer to honourable members by their title.,101
206,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"I am sorry. If the honourable member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition, worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year-I am no mathematical genius-he would earn about $26,000 a year. I suspect that his salary is somewhat more than that. The good doctor has been criticised for his $10 billion deficit in his Fightback package, but we should not be too harsh on him as it has now been clearly demonstrated that the good doctor always has trouble with arithmetic. When one looks closely at the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the Budget Speech, one finds that it contains more comedy than a Charlie Chaplin silent movie. In his reply the honourable member for Wentworth criticises Medicare in these terms: Youthat is, the Australian Labor Partyhave had about three goes at trying to patch Medicare. He criticises us about our health policy! Surely the people of Australia will never forget the embarrassed face of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) when he made that dreadful admission a couple of years ago about the Federal Opposition never having had much success in coming up with a decent health policy. Goodness gracious me, the Opposition's policies on health were always duds. They were never any good,and nor was its policy on micro-economic reform. Time and again we hear the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) ranting and raving about problems such as the waterfront and shipping. Throughout the long years of coalition rule, those opposite never had the wisdom to produce any improvements in these areas. I invite honourable members to read the tributes by Ross Gittins in this week's Sydney Morning Herald regarding Labor's waterfront reform agenda. My time is running out, but I must stress that we have seen. amazing increases in productivity on the wharves. We must remember that Australia was wallowing in the unemployment trough when this Government came to office. We reduced that problem by creating 11/2 million new jobs. Those jobs are real today because of the increase in the work force and the increased retention rate. Nevertheless, unemployment has risen. But this Government has proved that it has the strategies to get Australia working. We will achieve our employment targets without consigning the bulk of our work force to dismal poverty through the use of draconian, confrontationist policies. The Labor Party is the compassionate party, genuinely cOncerned about the unemployed. Until we get them working we will make sure they receive sufficient welfare to live in dignity. Because I represent the electorate of Hunter, let me bring a few facts closer to home and expand on what the coalition's Fightback package would mean to the people of my electorate. There are plenty of miners in the electorate. I can tell the Opposition right now that the miners in the Hunter Valley will not be attracted to the industrial relations policies up of the Opposition. There are many things that I want to say but I conclude on this note: the Leader of the Opposition said that Australians never get the governments they deserve; Let me say to him, in a friendly way, that the people of Australia have never done a thing to· deserve him. The Australian people do not deserve a Hewson-led coalition government.",101
207,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) and to have the opportunity to pick up some of the points he made. In his opening remarks he said that the Opposition had failed to stand here and sell its Fightbac"" package. He was, openly critical of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for addressing his remarks at precisely what the Budget failed to do for the Australian defence forces. I remind the honourable member for Hunter, for whom I have a fond personal regard, that his criticism of some people opposite for not having been widely read reflects very badly on him. He should have paused to consider that my colleague the honourable member for Curtin is the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel and, therefore, he has a direct responsibility to address all of the issues which directly affect defence personnel. He did that in his remarks tonight. The honourable member for Hunter's comments about my other colleague Senator Newman, who is no longer the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, reflect rather poorly on the degree of reading that the honourable member for Hunter has exposed himself to. The honourable member for Hunter said that we on this side of the House were prepared to entertain-and these were his words- 'every deceit to worm our way into office'. I ask those members who are gracious enough to remain in th- House and those people in the gallery: if we as an Opposition are prepared to entertain every deceit in order to wprm our way into office, why have we laid down a Fightback program? Mr Robert Brown-Good question.",101
208,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"I freely concede that the Minister for Land Transport is a man always honourable enough to acknowledge these points. It would be far easier for any Opposition to attain the government benches in the present economic climate without a Fightback package. Far from an exercise in deceit, this has been an exercise in integrity. Far from seeking to deceive the electors of Australia, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has gone out of his way to ensure that the electors of Australia know precisely what the Opposition intends to do when. it becomes the Government I would have thought it was time for just a semblance of integrity from those opposite' and for one person to stand up and concede that no Opposition-the Liberal and National parties or the ALP-has ever gone into an election and, before being elected, laid such detail before the electors of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition has never pretended that what he proposes is popular, and that is entirely to his credit. But, frankly, that is rarely acknowledged by those opposite and not much more frequently acknowledged by the press gallery. Every deceit to worm our way into office? Hardly, Mr Deputy Speaker. In responding to the Budget debate, speaker after speaker has compared the initiatives that the Government proposes with those that the Opposition proposes. Never in my nine years in this Parliament has there been as informed and deliberate a choice open to the people of Australia. I think we owe it to our electors when we stand here on either side of the Parliament to at least acknowledge that this place only survives if people stand here and state what they believe with integrity and sincerity. The great thing about being a member of the Opposition-there are not too many compared with being a member of the Government-is that one can look at the situations in which people in other parts of the globe find themselves. While we are here tonight we should pause and consider what is happening in Africa, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Ireland or even in Thailand. The great thing about standing on this side of the Parliament is that one has the responsibility to speak up for all those people who did not elect the Government. It is a minority, nonetheless a substantial minority, who depend on the Opposition to speak on their behalf and to respond-usually, they hope, fairly; we, are all subject to human weakness-to what the Government proposes. It is our responsibility to look at what the Government proposes in the Budget and to suggest what our alternatives should be. If the democracy we would cherish and keep alive is to thrive in Australia, the obligation we have is to be as honest as we can, given the temptations that drift around to embellish things a bit from an individual party point of view. No-one in the Parliament has denied that the nation has gone from an overseas lending capacity of something like $33 billion when the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) became the Treasurer, to a figure of about $150 billion as announced in the press last week. If I wanted to make a cheap political point, I would blame the Prime Minister; if I wanted to offer any integrity in this debate, I would have to concede that the Prime Minister, the Premier of South Australia, the Premier of Victoria, and sundry and assorted business entrepreneurs have all made a contribution to that Budget blow-out. I find that no-one disputes that it is time a change of direction in Australia. After nine years of this administration, people fear most of all that they are inheriting a Budget which will be passed on to their children. Far from seeking to be elected, the Opposition is saying, 'Here is a change of direction. Here is what we propose to do. We know it is unpopular; we know there are people who will be disadvantaged by it', but they are not all those in the lower socio-economic group alluded to by the honourable member for Hunter. We feel that the nation has no choice. If we are to be a responsible Opposition, we have no choice but to stand by these changes. If honourable members thumb through the Hansard speeches on this appropriation debate, I am sorry to say that they will find comment after comment made by those opposite that simply refers, as the honourable member for Hunter did, to a 15 per cent extra tax on everything that every Australian will consume. That is a blatant untruth. Forget about the Liberal Party's calculations, forget about the National Party's calculations, there is no way that the Treasury can suggest that the result of a Fightback package will be a 15 per cent increase in price. Why? Because we propose to remove seven taxes; six currently existing taxes. We make no bones about the fact that the coal export duty has gone and that the customs duty is an incidental one, as alluded to by the Prime Minister today. We do not even make a great fuss about the changes we would make to lump sum super tax, and we do not make a great fuss about what we would do to the training guarantee levy, although we would do it without apology. We have been saying to Australians that we will remove sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax. As a result of the impact of those taxes, as they cascade through the present Australian capitalist system, the real effect of removing those taxes and denying incoming Treasurer Reith $35 billion will mean that an additional 15 per cent goods and services tax-an additional $27m he collects-would not raise prices by more than about 5 per cent. That is Neil Andrew's arithmetic; it would be 3.8 per cent if Treasury's figures are used; and 4.4 per cent if the Fightback figures are used. for Time after time we have had the 15 per cent figure thrown up in some sort of scare campaign that is totally without foundation. Mr Fitzgibbon-On food.",102
209,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"The honourable member for Hunter has returned and I am happy to respond to his point. It is true that we propose to put a 15 per cent GST tax on food and on clothing, in case the honourable member is about to interject on that comment as well. In South Australian terms, the baker at Tip Top has his flour delivered in a truck that no longer has ' sales tax on it-not only on the purchase of it but also on the tyres, the fan belts, the gear box and all the works and jerks-it is powered by fuel which no longer has an excise on it, by the way, and all the little people at the Tip Top bakeryMr Fitzgibbon-What about the road user tax?",103
210,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"I would be happy to respond to that but, since we do not know what the Government is doing, I think it is inappropriate for either the honourable member or m- to comment on that. Flour is being delivered to the Tip Top bakery in a cheaper form and all the Tip Top employees are now running around the bakery that no longer incurs a payroll tax; Mr Tip Top fires his oven with diesel that no longer incurs an excise; he wraps his bread up in wrapping that no longer has a sales tax on it; and out the other end of the factory he plonks it in a Tip Top van that no longer has a sales tax on it or a sales tax on its spares parts, is driven by a little Tip Top man or lady on whom he would no longer pays payroll tax and is powered by fuel on which he no longer pays a fuel excise. The real impact of the GST on that food would be something like 5 per cent and not 15 per cent. But, more than that, let us say that we exempt food. Let us say that because it would be politically popular-and the honourable' member might remember that in his speech he said we were using every deceit to worm our way into office-the Leader of the Opposition decided that he was prepared to exempt food. What would he do then? He would say to Australia's largest businessmen who may currently choose-and I am not offended by this-to dine every night at a silver plate restaurant, 'You will not pay tax on that service and that meal'. Under a GST those who dine at silver plate restaurants pay considerably more than those who are unable to do so. There is a measure of equity in that which the honourable member failed to concede. Furthermore, we looked at the whole issue of what to do with a tax on food. We looked at the Canadian experience where exempting food has been a disaster. So we have avoided it in spite of the political unpopularity issue. Far from choosing to be deceitful, we have fronted the Australian electorate with all of the information and made sure that when they elect us they will know precisely what they are getting. The honourable member said that one of the dreadful things about the coalition is the way in which we would model our tax policy and our industrial relations policy-in. fact, he emphasised industrial relations-on the Bolger experience in New Zealand. I have been to New Zealand. I was there three weeks ago. I made it my business to visit industries in New Zealand, to wander up and down the shopping malls and to talk to the welfare agencies such as the Salvation Army. What did I discover about business in New Zealand? I talked to one employer in Christchurch who also happens to run a factory in Melbourne, so he provided a very useful comparison. He said, 'We would not change the GST; it's so simple. But it is a non-issue for us. The one thing that has made New Zealand strong is enterprise bargaining'. He said, 'Here I am with a factory in Christchurch and a factory in Melbourne. My on-cost-it is nothing to do with what my employees get, of course; it has only to do with what it costs me to employ them-is 19c in the dollar in New Zealand and my on-cost in Melbourne is 53c in the dollar. Where do you think I am expanding? Where do you think I am running an extra shift? Where do you think the employment opportunities are currently? Where do you think my people are in the strongest position to negotiate a better package?'. It was in Christchurch. What is happening in New Zealand? In spite of the comments made by the Premier of Victoria, for the third month in a row New Zealand has a balance of payments surplusthe very thing that we need most. I am not suggesting, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) is not suggesting, and the Leader of the Opposition is not suggesting that our proposal is somehow comfortable and that Australians will instantly grasp it. But I will not wear the nonsense that the honourable member for Hunter has paraded in here, suggesting that we would get into office of the only by wowing our way in with every deceit. We have been up-front and if in fact we get into office every Australian will know precisely what we propose to do. Let us look at another issue in the few minutes that are left to me. Let us look at tariffs. It has been so convenient and so easy for the Government to deride the Opposition over its tariff policy, but no-one has paused to consider-as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) insisted during the discussion of the MPI this afternoon-that there is very little difference between the Government's attitude to tariffs and the Opposition's attitUde to tariffs. In fact, between now and 1996 it will be easier to be an employer in AuJtralia under our policy than under that of the Government. By the year 2000 what will be the difference? At most, for two industries it is the difference between 5 per cent and 15 per cent if nothing happens at all. The policy is the same for all other industries. Our policy at the year 2000 is negligible, and for two industries nominated by the Government the maximum one could extract would be a 10 per cent difference. What do we propOse to do for employers relative to what the Government proposes to do? We propose to give them the sort of industrial relations climate that currently exists in New Zealand. We do not want to tear down centralised wage fixing; it will remain. But those who choose to negotiate outside it will be able to do so, just as the New Zealanders do. Are we supposed to apologise for that? Of course we are not. But imagine how it riles me to sit here and watch the Prime Minister pretend that there is something dramatically different between my policy and his; that in some way we are supposed to be poles apart. I am in Opposition. It is far easier for me to be critical him. Instead of that, over the last four years at least-for as long as the Government has had this policy-at the cost of a good deal of electoral popularity we have chosen to defend the Government on the tariff front. One could not say that for all political parties in Australia. But it would not hurt the Prime Minister to be gracious enough to concede that an Opposition which could have easily exploited his tariff stance has been prepared to defend it. But is there any gracious remark of that sort from the Prime Minister? It is hard to imagine any remark like that even passing his lips. The Government was so proud of this Appropriation Bill when it offered to Australians, particularly the unemployed, $350m for job creation. I do not have much to complain about in that regard: my electorate picked up $4.5m. So there is no way in which the Government could be accused of having ignored an Opposition electorate like mine. Why did I get that money? I got it because, sadly, I have a relatively high proportion of lli""lemployed people in my electorate. But if that is ndt: bad enough, I am in another great bind. That is, if people are unemployed in Wakefield and they live in the town of Clare there is no money for them, but if they are unemployed in Wakefield and live in the town of Peterborough there is money for them. If people are unemployed in Wakefield and live in the town of Kadina there is money for them, but if they live in the town of Maitland there is no money for them. That is hardly a just policy. It was not intended to be unjust; nonetheless it is not really doing what it set out to do and it is not creating full time and permanent jobs. I do not pretend-and neither does the Leader of the Opposition-that there is any nice, easy, simple way to create full time employment. We have not pretended that unemploymt:nt would fall dramatically under us, but we have put together a difficult but responsible package which, frankly, gives unemployed of Australians the first opportunity they will have to see jobs at the end of the tunnel because 'it makes Australia 'efficient and productive for the first time in the last decade.",103
211,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"I wish to continue with the same feeling of goodwill as expressed by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I accept that the honourable member is a sincere man who believes what he is sayitig. I have always found him to be most reasonable in his contributions to parliamentary debate. Carrying on that theme, maybe we should step back from the conflict which is often apparent in Budget debates and look at what is common between the Government and Opposition in terms of economic approach. I think the first and most important common point between us is that both the Government and Opposition clearly see that unemployment is the single biggest issue confronting Australia economically. It is the issue to which the Government and Opposition, and indeed the entire Australian community, should be turning their primary attention. A seCond point on which the Government and the Opposition agree is that for Australia's long term future there has to continue to be a very fundamental shift in the way in which our economy is based. We can no longer be so reliant on the export of primary products and commodities such as minerals; we have to be an economy which is far more broadly based. A lot more value adding has to be conducted in Australia and there has to be a much stronger manufacturing system and a much stronger services system. I do not think there is any disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on that point. A third point which would obviously be fundamental and common to all members of this House is that economic policy is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. We debate economic policy and different approaches for the common goal of improving Australia, improving the living standards of all Australians and the quality of life and the opportunities which all Australians have. Our point of difference is not those goals, but the means by which we use our economy in order to achieve those goals. It is useful to recall that in those fundamental areas there is much more which joins us in this Parliament than divides us. That is an important point. Against those three tests I would like to contrast the different approaches that have been proposed by the Government in its Budget and by the Opposition in its Fightback policy. I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield again that we have in the Fightback policy the most comprehensive attempt on behalf of an Opposition, at least in recent years, to put forward to the Australian people a fully explained program for them to judge. Maybe Gough Whitlam, in terms of the very extensive program he put to the Australian people in 1972, could also claim to have had a very extensive policy, but in 1972 the focus was not on economics quite as much as it is today. But I certainly concede that point to the honourable member. Mr Andrew-We are not bringing it in by deceit. Mr LAVARCHI certainly would not join with that criticism. I do not think that is particularly fair. From that point on, the honourable member and I start diverging. Although I spent a few minutes explaining the points of agreement, I am afraid I will have to turn at some time to the points of disagreement. The Government's No. 1 goal is to tackle unemployment. We have tragic levels of unemployment in this country. There is no debate whatsoever about that. Let me put it in . perspective. Let us look at what happened over the last decade. The reality is that during the 1980s Australia's employment growth was very strong. That is not a question of debate; it is a fact. During that period something like 1.8 million Australians obtained work, either part time or full time. During this recession a few hundred thousand people have tragically lost their jobs. That is why our closest attention is on unemployment. But the fact remains that in 1992 something like 1.4 million more Australians are in work than there were in 1982. When I tell people that, they say, 'How can that be? Unemployment is 11 per cent. Surely there must be more people out of work or the work force has reduced'. It has not. Because of the significant change in the participation rate of the Australian economy, along with our major economic changes, there has been a major social change in Australia, common with most Western economies. That means there are more people out of the total population who either are in work or consider themselves part of the paid labour force. That is largely reflected in the changed career patterns of Australian women. The vast bulk of those 1.8 million jobs created in the 1980s went to Australian women. We have high levels of unemployment, but we have a much larger work force today, something like 1.4 million people. In 1992 the Australian economy, our gross domestic product, is some 30 per cent larger than it was in 1982. So it is a little misleading. We can get caught up. We think Australia must have shrunk or there must have been an endless recession. That is not the reality at all. The Australian economy throughout most of the decade has grown quite strongly and is some 30 per cent larger. Our collective cake is 30 per cent larger than it was a decade ago. Those are important things to understand, but , we do have a high unemployment rate. What has been the Government's response to that? This is where there is a very fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition. While both the Government and the Opposition accept that Australia is a mixed economy, that is, we have a mix of private sector activity and Government enterprises and a role for government, what we think are the appropriate roles for government and the private sector is quite different. The Government's approach in this Budget and earlier in the One Nation statement has been to expand the role of government. That is the fundamental thing. We can say, 'Where has the money gone?'. Whether it has gone into a local government capital works pro'gram, into a better cities program, or into other specific line departments' the fundamental response of the Government has been to increase the size of government spending. The Government has been roundly criticised on this point by the Opposition. We are told that by having a Budget deficit of $13 billion we are being fiscally irresponsible, that we are mortgaging the country and that we are going to load our children with debt. I think the honourable member for Wakefield suggested that our children would be carrying the debt of the current generation. He was speaking more in terms of the foreign debt. But the reality is that that is not the case. During the 1980s, when the private sector was moving along quite nicely and when employment growth was strong and investment was strong, the Australian Government pulled back the size of the public sector involvement. For the first time in this country's history we ran a series of Budget surpluses. That was the appropriate response at the time because we had a booming private sector. It was not appropriate in an economic model for the Government to be also in there spending away madly. We now have exactly the reverse situation. We have a very sluggish private sector, a private sector which in some industries is obviously still contracted; and the appropriate response, at least on behalf of the Government, is for it to increase demand by spending more. That is exactly what it has done. The Government has not said, 'Look, it is all on the never-never; we are going to be on $13 billion for time everlasting'. In Australia to a position of a reduced Budget deficit the Government has committed itself to getting back to a balance or surplus position. We can talk about being deceitful and trying to worm our way into government, which occupied part of the last two speeches. The same thing could be said to the Government. We were honest enough in the Budget statement to say that we will look at the withholding tax system and at the prescribed payment system a couple of years down the track if we find that the Budget is not returning quickly enough to a balance position. There is nothing deceitful or underhand about that, despite the attacks along the, lines that there is some sort of secret tax agenda. Obviously, there is not. It would be a secret tax agenda if nothing at all were said or mentioned in the Budget Papers; if it had to be wormed out. Mrs Bailey-The amount is secret. Mr LAVARCHThere is nothing secret about the amount-I accept the interjectionin that we are talking about Budgets which will be decided two or three or four years down the track. We all know what difficulties there are in putting together estimates even 12 months down the track. With the One Nation statement and the Budget we seem to have some difficulty four months down the track. I think it is slightly unreasonable for the Opposition to say, 'You should be able to tell us now exactly what is going to be happening with these provisions some four years down the track'. Like the Opposition's proposals in the Fightback policy, this is an honest attempt to state that we will be looking at these measures and that we have a very real commitment to return Australia to a situation where the Budget is put back in balance. But we accept at this stage that the tragedy of unemployment is such that we cannot stand idle; we cannot say, 'Well, that's too bad. You're unemployed. We're very sorry about that, but we are not going to do anything about it'. The Government is quite committed to increasing the role of government to overcome the deficiency in private sector demand. That is why the Government has order to return taken that course. In contrast to that, the Opposition, in its replies to the Budget and more particularly in its Fightback proposals, is proposing to cut government spending. It is saying that the public sector should be wound back and that there should be less spending by the Government. That is supposed to be the philosophy which will lead to increases .in overall employment. I have never qUlte understood-and maybe subsequent speakers will explain it to me-how that can be. That certainly is not conventional economic rational thought in my view. I can understand that, if the private sector were bo?ming, the Government would compete for mvestment and savings; that if the Government called on savings it would be denying them to the private sector. I can understand it then, but one can hardly claim at the moment that we have a boundless private sector kicking on; it is obviously very sluggish. I would like it explained to me. I am only a simple back"" bench member of the Parliament. Maybe the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) will take up the challenge and explain how it is appropriate at this stage for the Government to knock off something like $6 billion or $7 billion government spending and say that that WIll lead to an improvement in the employment position. If we are truthful and honest, we will realise that if a government adopted those policies in the current economic conditions it would lead to greater levels of unemployment. The economy would shrink, there would not be any demand - t all and we would go back into a recession where the economy slows. I want to take up another point raised by the honourable member for Wakefield. He gave the example of Tip Top in his electorate. He went through the various stages in the production of bread-the trucks coming and picking it up and what have you, and finally getting it to the supermarket. He concluded that from this chain of things-putting taxes on and taking taxes off, and not charging fuel excise but putting a GST on instead-the net result would be about a 5 per cent increase in the cost of a loaf of bread. I think he wrong about that. For instance, most of the taxes on vehicles, spare parts and what have you are 20 per cent at the wholesale level. He is talking about putting on a 15 per cent retail tax. Even if there were a significant reduction in petrol prices, we have no idea what would happen with the road user charges, except that the Opposition has said that it is committed to a policy of road user charges. We have no details yet of how that will be implemented, but one must assume that there would· be some cost imposed somewhere. Road user charges mean the people on the road are actually paying. If they are not paying through the bowser, one assumes they are paying through registration or some other system along those lines. From the figures that I have seen produced by the Opposition, I think the truthful outcome of the old loaf of bread example from Tip Top is that tltat particular item will probably be rising not by about 5 per cent but by something like 10 or 11 per cent. That 5 per cent increase is on things like deodorants and. cleaning items. They do become cheaper and the 5 per cent would even out between the things which go up and .the things which come down. The honourable member for Wakefield then went on to expand on the New Zealand experience. He said that Australia could learn a bit from New Zealand. He compared the positions of two companies, one in New Zealand and one in Melbourne. I really hope that New Zealand is seeing some benefit after going through a period .where its economy has shrunk. The New Zealand economy now is smaller-it is not that its growth' has been slow or anything like that-than it was at the beginning of the 1980s. One would hope that after all the pain it has gone through it might now be seeing some benefit flowing from it. While the New Zealand economy has got smaller, the Australian economy has grown by about 30 per cent; that is, while our domestic product is 30 per cent greater than it was at the beginning of the 1980s, the New Zealand economy is actually smaller. If New Zealand is such a great place for workers, employment and good wages and is a bit conditions, I wonder why so many New Zealanders seem to be voting with their feet and coming over to Australia to look for work. Why is it that New Zealand shearers are here in great numbers? I suggest it is because the wage levels in Australia are considerably better than they are in New Zealand. There are considerably better conditions in Australia and that is why people from New Zealand are voting with their feet and coming over here. If the Opposition is talking about overcoming that disparity, I do not think it is talking about raising New Zealand standards, conditions and wages to the Australian level; it is probably talking about lowering the Australian conditions, standards and wages to the New Zealand level.",105
212,Mr COBB,Unknown,Wrong.,109
213,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"I am told that I am wrong. It always amuses me that we hear about the great benefits of the Opposition's industrial relations policies and that there would be far more flexibility in the system. Employers and employees would be able to sit down freely, negotiate and work out things which are suitable to their oWn industry and their own conditions. I think this would be the first time that I have ever heard the Opposition propose a policy in terms of· industrial relations or wages and conditions which has not equalled lower wages and lesser conditions. I can judge people only as I see them. And I see an opposition which has opposed every national wage decision essentially during the 1980s-that is, opposing people's wage increases-and which at the same· tiIn.e has always advocated a wages system based on productivity, and that has always meant that wage levels would become considerably lower. I would be quite amazed if members of the Liberal Party honestly tried to tell us that their industrial relations policy was designed to increase wage costs in Australia and that its end result would be to increase wage levels and working conditions. It does not mean that at all. It means on the whole that they believe that the wages outcome will be lower. The other thing in terms of industrial relations on which I think the members of the Opposition are slightly uncharitable is their refusal to accept that there have been significant advances· under the Government's policies. I do not know whether honourable members had the opportunity to watch the Sunday program last weekend. It gave a very good analysis of the Industrial relations situation in respect of this policy.",109
214,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,It was a terrible program. It was very biased; Mrs Bailey-It was the most lopsided program I have seen for years.,109
215,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"We hear the same thing from members of the Liberal Party: if they do not like the outcome or the program, they attack it and say it is biased and all sorts of sinister things. I suppose the Sunday program now joins the teachers union, the ABC, the car makers, the nurses union and everything else in the great conspiracy to try to blacken the name of the Liberal Party. They have added the Sunday program to the great parties in the overall conspiracy to try to make the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Liberal Party not look real good. Can we not accept that other people have a different point of view? Such a point of view as was expressed on the Sunday program conceded that there had been very significant gains made in industrial relations. (TIme expired)",109
216,Mrs BAILEY,Unknown,"The Australian public has had enough rhetoricand certainly enough of the sort of rhetoric that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) has been going on with tonight. It ha- had enough of the economic theories and the so-called economic statements by this Government. In the past year we have had the 1991-92 Budget, the job statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the One Nation statement, the national youth employment and training statement and now another Budget. We have had a total of 17 economic statements by this Government, yet look where we are today. We have intolerably high levels of unemployment, an appalling lack of investor",109
217,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"This is not rhetoric:, Fran?",109
218,Mrs BAILEY,Unknown,"These are the facts. We have an appalling lack of investor and consumer confidence, falling living standards and an unprecedented number of business bankruptcies. With this Budget the Australian community was actually looking to this Government to take responsibility for its mistakes and to take action on the fundamental economic problems that we have in this country, but the Government has let them down once again. Instead of concentrating on the causes of our economic problems and developing constructive and real, long term solutions to those problems, it has opted yet again for the quick fix solutions, which will do precious little to stem the swelling tide of unemployed and even less to overcome the fundamental deficiencies in our economy. This Budget is no different from those in the past. The only thing that has changed is the rhetoric. We no longer have the Budget that is g!)ing to bring home the bacon, but we are supposed to have the caring Budget. The terminology would be almost farcical if it were not such a serious matter, but there is nothing caring about this Budget. The end result of the policies of this Government and the Budget is record unemployment and making more people more dependent on government for their very survival. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: what is caring about that? It is a tragedy that more and more people are having to depend on government assistance through no fault of their own, whether they be on unemployment benefit because they have lost their job or, in the case of young people, because they simply cannot get a start in life, or whether they have jobs but pay so much tax that they have to rely on government assistance to make ends meet. . This Government and this Budget deny Australians the opportunity to independently fulfil their basic needs of housing, feeding, clothing, educating and nurturing the members of their family unit. What Australians really want is the opportunity to provide for themselves and not to be increasingly dependent on government. What they want is the opportunity of a job, perhaps with some overtime, and to be rewarded for their hard work rather than to be penalised. They simply want a fair go .. The most critical problem facing us as a country, is the distressing unemployment crisis. We have a country that has abundant natural resources, a hard working and talented work force, and the most well-educated young generation in our nation's history. Yet, despite that, officially one million Austral-as are out of work, 680,000 children are living in homes where neither parent has a job, and those numbers are increasing by more than 500 a day. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are able to find only part time work, and many more are worried about losing their jobs or their loved ones losing theirs. As Trevor Sykes, writing for the Bulletin said, Australia now has: I ... one in nine of its people out of work; where regional unemployment is high eno1)gh to be labelled depression rather than recession; where a large proportion of our youth has been condemned to the dole queues for so long that they are probably permanently unemployable; where greater inequality of income exists than ever before in Australian history; and where large sections of Australian manufacturing industry have' been dismantled.",109
219,Mr COBB,Unknown,So much for social justice and compassion.,110
220,Mrs BAILEY,Unknown,"Exactly. And if we need further proof of the fact that our standard of living is slipping further and further behind that of other OECD nations, it is this: at the beginning of federation we' had the highest standard of living per capita; 'we are now 6 per cent below the OECD average and falling. The nation's foreign debt has climbed past $150 billion after expanding almost six times more quickly than the general economy during the past financial year. In fact, our net foreign debt now takes up 40 per cent of our gross domestic product. This is the real picture of Australia today, and this is what this Government had the responsibility to address with its Budget. The Budget provided it with the opportunity to tackle the causes of the unemployment crisis and the 144 per cent increase in business bankruptcies. However, just as the Government deliberately chose to maintain high interest rates, it chose to keep drifting-at our expense. The Prime Minister has refused to acknowledge that there are very serious problems with the economic structure in which we must all operate, whether that be running our own businesses or working for others who provide employment. Instead of tackling the problems that are forcing thousand of businesses either to cut back on working hours or to close their doors, the Prime Minister chose a very short term cosmetic program. The Budget contains little good news for most sectors of the Australian community and in particular for farmers and rural communities, who are suffering from falling income and the recession. As recently released statistics from the ABS national agriculture finance survey 1990-91 show, the rural economy is in a perilous state. Farm incomes are down by one-third, cash operating surplus is down by 36 per cent nationally and 40 per cent in Victoria, farm capital expenditure is down nationally by 36 per cent and again in Victoria by 40 per cent. All of those figures combine to paint a gloomy but, unfortunately, realistic picture life on the land. As I drive through country towns in my electorate of MCEwen, I see all too clearly the evidence of the damage that this Government's policies have done to the rural sector. Shop after shop, business after business, dealer after dealer are either empty, closing down or have laid off staff. These businesses have been forced to close their doors and put off their staff because they simply cannot afford to operate in an economic climate where business costs are too high and demand is stagnant or declining. Despite these hardships, rural communities and farmers are to get no relief from this Government. Instead, the situation may get worse. It is predicted that as many as one in five farmers will leave the land during the next five years. According to the Weekly TImes, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has warned rural counsellors around the nation to prepare themselves for major structural change. Counsellors have been told that there is a potential worse case scenario of 20 per cent of farmers leaving the land-the biggest demographic shake out in memory. The flow-on effect this will have on small country towns will be devastating. The National Farmers Federation has said that the Government has chosen a shOtt term job fix rather than the creation of permanent jobs through sustained economic growth in this latest Budget. The Budget does not remove the high add-on costs or tackle the problems that make our exports, including our primary products, uncomp6titive on the world market. We need to encourage production and encourage our farmers to export. To do that we need to remove the cost burdens that make our products uncompetitive, and only Fightback will do that. Only the Fightback plan will give farmers and rural communities the relief they so desperately need. In fact, the Treasury analysis has confirmed this. It has found that under the Fightback plan costs in the agricultural sector would fall by $1 billion and costs in the transport and storage sector would fall by $2 billion. Further support of the benefits of Fightback comes from the NFF's independent study of the Fightback plan undertaken by ACIL of Australia Ltd. It found that the savings for farm businesses range from 8 to 29 per cent if there was no road user charge, and from 7 to 22 per cent with a road user charge; on which the Government must make up its mind, and that farm families with low incomes would benefit by up to 11 per cent, while the real disposable incomes of families in higher income groups would increase by about 3 per cent. It is the responsibility of this Government to provide the economic environment in which business can thrive and develop, but this Government has abrogated its responsibility in relation; to the business community. Businesses-indeed, all of us-have been let down by this Ke-ting Government because it refuses to- so the resolve to tackle the causes of our ent problem and refuses to make the cha ges necessary to reform our economic st cture and allow us to take our plac- am0t;tgJ the top mo-ern, competitivtradmg natlons and, most 1mportantly, help create seci.e and long term jobs for the future. I Despite that massive potential for jbb creation'nd growth in small business, there was not one mention of small business in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and there was nothing in the Budget Papers to encourage business to employ or invest. Already, business investment is one of the weakest sections of the economy. Statistics show that it has fallen by more than a quarter in the past two years, and the Budget Papers forecast another fall. Labor's policies make it expensive for employers to employ people. In Victoria it is estimated that employers are paying almost $4,000 a year in administration costs on each employee. Businesses are further hampered by a restrictive taxation system which burdens them with excessive add-on costs such as payroll tax, sales tax, fuel tax and training tax, to name just a few. We could dramatically cut unemployment levels by abolishing payroll tax alone. The Prime Minister himself said that the abolition of payroll tax would create between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs. The coalition is not going to abolish just one we will abolish seven major hidden taxes. The Government had the opportunity to take this action with its Budget, but yet it frittered away the opportunity and ignored the plight of those hundreds of small businesses in my electorate of MCEwen who are struggling for survival through this recession. I have only to pick up a copy of one of my local newspapers to see that yet another business has shut down in my electorate. The local paper in Yea recently ran an article highlighting the number of businesses that have been forced to close. Its investigations found that in the main business district there are 16 empty shops, while at the new shopping centre nine stores, plus the large supermarket, are vacant. These businesses were hoping for some relief in this Budget, but they got none. All they got was more of the same. The only measure in the Budget which will affect small business was the Government's announcement of a $10 a week wage rise, a rise which small business simply cannot afford, especially when it comes on top of the superannuation levy and the recent increase in the training levy. For many small businesses this wage increase may well be the last straw which pushes them over the edge into closure or bankruptcy. The question I am most asked by businesses in my electorate is when will they get relief from the crushing level of add-on costs they are forced to pay now. This Budget has demonstrated that this Government has absolutely no answer for them. Given the level of youth unemployment, especially in rural and outlying urban areas, such as Craigieburn and Epping in my electorate, it was to be hoped that the Government would take some real action on this problem. But rather than try to tackle the causes of youth unemployment, the Government has once again chosen to disguise the causes of the problem by throwing more handfuls of money into training programs which in the past have had poor or dubious outcomes-spending, yet again, what it does not have. In the Jobtrain program, Labor's own figures show that in 1991 only 22 per cent of tax; young people who actually completed a Jobtrain course were employed three months after completing Jobtrain. Additionally, oneagain third of those who enrolled for Jobtrain courses drop out before they are completed. In this Budget the Government has provided for a range of temporary make-work schemes and training programs costing $3 1/2 billion. These measures are entirely cosmetic exercises aimed at reducing the unemployment queues by shifting the young into education or training schemes. Sadly, there is no guarantee that any of those involved with these schemes will have a job at the end of their training. Another example of the lack of resolve of this Government to really address the causes of ou- unemployment can be seen in its decision to spend millions of dollars on short term job creation scheme -, the major one being the local capital works program. No-one objects to local facilities being upgraded or extended, but what happens to those who get some short term employment, when the money runs out? Once again, by not tackling the causes of our problems, the problems will not only continue to exist but they will get worse. Would it not be more honest and make more sense to tackle the causes of the problems now? This Government has presided over the worse unemployment in this country's living memory. Unemployment hit a post-war record of 11.1 per cent in June, but in my home State of Victoria things have been much - worse for much longer. Unemployment passed the 11 per cent barrier months ago and is now at 11.9 per cent. One of the most disturbing aspects of the Budget is that with it the Government has embarked on a massive unfunded spending spree which will do precious little to help our unemployment crisis and nothing to overcome the fundamental problems in our economy. The long term ramifications will be disastrous. It is economicaIly irresponsible. This Budget of spending now and paying later is just that: economicaIly irresponsible. Already under the present Prime Minister we have witnessed one of the greatest fiscal turnarounds this country has ever seen. In two years the Government has gone from a forecast Budget surplus of $8 billion to an official deficit for 1992-93 of $13.4 billion. As I sat listening to the Treasurer on Budget night when he was making his Budget Speech, I had a distinct whiff of the Kirner Government, because this Federal Labor Government is spending money it does not have and selling assets to reduce its Budget deficit. We have heard and seen that many times in Victoria under Cain and Kirner. The Treasurer has even admitted that the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to reduce the 1995 Budget deficit, which has been increased in order to fund the spending spree. In short, Government will impose massive increases in taxes and charges to pay for this year's and last year's unfunded spending spree. Already we have had increases in the Medicare levy, tobacco excise and fringe benefits tax. It is the responsibility of government to provide a framework for business, industry and consumers of this country in which they can be dynamic and innovative. This Government has certainly failed that. It is going to remain for the coalition when it forms the government to introduce those changes which are so desperately needed in this country. AIl it takes is determination, courage and commitment. We have an example of that determination and commitment: firstly, to admit that we have real problems in this country; secondly, to identify the causes of those problems; and thirdly, to strategicaIly set about fixing those problems. A smaIl country across the Tasman has . already faced up to its responsibilities. I might add that it was a Labour government that initiated the changes and showed that courage and determination. In conclusion, I will quote from a letter in the Australian Financial Review on 31 August 1992 which I believe summed up this Government's Budget beautifuIly. It reads: . . . as a taxpayer I demand more honesty from those in power. Instead, at the moment we're heading for the resurrection of George Ill's taxes on windows and tea leaves, which' simply r-ulted in windows being bricked up and the US declaring its independence from the government responsible. This is not a Budget which makes any genuine or serious attempt to face up to Australia's real economic problems. Sadly, it is a Budget which offers absolutely no hope or genuine security for Australians of any age because it has failed to provide that economic framework that will enable people of all ages to thrive rather than to merely survive.

221,Mr ONEIL,Unknown,"I will refer to a few things on which the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) spoke. It is good to see the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in the place. He is the somebody for whom we on this side of the House have a great deal of respect. The honourable member for MCEwen could take a few notes from the honourable member for Bennelong. The honourable member for MCEwen talked about tax on smaIl business. When one talks to smaIl businessmen, the greatest fear they have is the goods and services tax. They are all frightened of becoming another arm of the Australian Taxation Office. I say to the coalition: if it is ever thinks about forming a government, please run on that goods and services tax. The coalition will never be in government; it will always be on the other side of the House. The honourable member for MCEwen might not be here at all, because people out in the bush will not buy the GST. I am sure that when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) goes and there is a change of leadership there will quickly be a watering down of the goods and services tax. I am sure that there are councils within the electorate of the honourable member for MCEwen that would gratefully receive the funding under the capital works program. I am the first to admit that unemployment is unacceptably high. The unemployment level in this country is a real tragedy, but it is a worldwide phenomenon, unfortunately. We are in a world recessic:>n. The tragedy is that we are not able to get away from unemployment. It is a fact of life. tragedy. I have not heard anything from the Opposition that would certainly create constructive employment. There are a number of things that I want to speak about. One of them is that in the recent Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) it was very disappointing that once , again people who have taken out private medical and hospital insurance received no recognition, return or benefit from this Government for this financial sacrifice. If the bureaucrats who advise the Federal Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) believe that it is only the wealthy in our society who take out private health coverage they are wrong. In the working class cities and towns of my electorate, ordinary people-pensioners, blue-collar workers and other battlers-overwhelmingly take out medical insurance which, in most cases, they can ill-afford but choose to do so because of the fear of being denied adequate hospital or specialist treatment in their hour of need. Let us be perfectly honest: there are long delays in the public hospitals for such things as hip replacements, breast reductions and other surgery, although these operations can be done immediately in private hospitals if one has private medical cover, as the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, would testify. It is ironic that the very people who oppose the private health insurance scheme because they can afford it are in the scheme on the highest table in case they or their family need urgent medical treatment. I firmly believe that if anybody, as a priority, is prepared to make a financial sacrifice to take out health insurance, a tax rebate is more than appropriate and is fair and reasonable. If we do not do this, more and more people will drop out of private health schemes and the whole system can only become chaotic. I agree that it is imperative to retain Medicare and continually improve it, but let us not be so bloody-minded as to not reward those who make sacrifices to take out private cover. I urge the Minister for Health, and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in particular, to initiate the necessary changes to allow tax rebates for people taking out private health I think it is indeed a coverage. Of course, we are all aware what would happen if, unfortunately, the coalition were to win government. It would most certainly be the end of Medicare, and we would go back to the previous conservative government period when people gambled on their health and two million people had no health cover at all, which would be totally unacceptable in our democratic society. As I represent some 91 per cent of South Australia, which covers a land mass of 895,000 square kilometres, I am well aware of some of the unique difficulties rural and regional Australians face. Australia is the most highly urbanised country in the world. It has the most highly concentrated, unevenly distributed and, for its land area, the smallest population. Along with Canada, it also has the lowest overall population density and vast areas of extreme sparsity, making servicing rural and especially the more remote parts of the continent difficult. Partly because of this, rural Australia is disadvantaged on a number of social and economic fronts. One area, of course, is that of tertiary and higher education, which I have spoken about many times in this House. What normally happens is that people who are denied Austudy when living in the country have to virtually set up a second home in cities so that their children can go on to higher education. I think that is an outrageous situation. I believe that if anybody lives within something like a 100 kilometre radius of a city they should be means test free for receiving Austudy. This places tremendous strain on the families, and I think something needs to be done for the families. I know that Austudy has been improved, but I think a review should be taken of Austudy to see what can be done to help ordinary Australians, particularly those living in country Australia. Another problem is the area of unemployment. In Australia rural unemployment is higher and more prolonged than urban unemployment. This places tremendous strain on local councils, so it was very heartening news for local government in my area to receive the financial boost under the local capital works program announced in the Budget. The total amount allocated to councils in my area is $3,127,339. I am particularly delighted about this. Apart from the fact that it will create a number of worthwhile projects and constructively employ people for a period of time, the Mayor of Port Pirie, Dennis Crisp, who is the Mayor of a very progressive council in my area, came forward to the Government with this type of proposal and these recommendations. I am pleased that the Government acted upon these proposals, because I think that country people suffer more than those in the city areas. As I said earlier, unemployment is prolonged in country areas and getting employment is very difficult indeed. This exacerbates the problem of people from country areas moving to cities, and we will have the huge problem of small towns and regional areas becoming ghost towns. It is very sad indeed, when we have the infrastructure there, that good hospitals, good schools, and other infrastructure will be left idle simply because people who cannot get work have moved into the cities, creating a problem of overpopulation. I hope something can be done about that, and I am continually raising that issue with the Government. One of the other promising things that came up prior to the Budget was the fact that $12m was allocated for the refurbishment of the Indian Pacific train. This work takes place at Port Augusta-John MCElligot, who runs the refurbishment program, does an excellent job-and much superb work is done on the refurbishment of trains. The Indian Pacific is one of the great train lines of the world. It is perhaps sad that we do not sell this as a tourism project as much as we should, because people who have had the opportunity to travel from Sydney to Perth on that train have all said that it is a wonderful opportunity. I hope that, under the new National Freight Corporation in conjunction with Australian National, we go out and sell that project because it is very worthwhile. It would be a tremendous fillip if we could sell that project. Most people would be aware that for every 26 tourists that come to Australia one full time job is created. I guess most members have had the opportunity to travel overseas, and some of the tourist projects that are sold do not come within a bull's roar of some of the projects that we could sell h@re and, unfortunately, do not sell strongly enough. Much has been said during this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) about the changes in unemployment, but I do not think we give enough praise and credence to some of the trade unions, particularly in my area, who have made some dramatic changes. I pay tribute to Doug Elkins of the Trades and Labour Council and some of the trade union leaders within Whyalla, for instance, where dramatic change has taken place. Communications between employers and employees have improved. For instance, in Whyalla some 6,400 workers were employed in BHP about 10 years ago in the steel making and shipbuilding division. There is no doubt that the steel industry was going to go under. It was very uncompetitive. As a result of cooperation between the work force and the management of the company, Australia is now a world leader in steel manufacturing. Hardheaded steel rails are transported all over the world. That situation was achieved at some cost to the labour force because less than 3,000 people now work in the steel industry there. But there has been no industrial disputation; the shedding of labour has been done through the trade union movement in conjunction with BHP. It has been done in a very productive way. Natural attrition has taken place. Everybody has acted in the best interests of the town and the company. That has been very worthwhile indeed. When I talked to John Prescott of BHP he admitted that, out of all the steel centres in Australia, Whyalla can hold its head high because of the way its people have cooperated. The same sort of thing has happened at the BHAS in Port Pirie, which is the largest lead smelting works in the world. For some time, the price of lead was extremely low. Changes had to be made within the industry and consequently, with cooperation between the work force and management, these changes took place. Although it is sad to see many people losing their jobs, if they had not made these changes both the lead smelting works at Port Pirie and the steel industry at Whyalla would have gone under. So they understand what change is all about. The workers really have taken the lead in these cases. Some of the tfude unions have been very productive and helpful. Doug Elkins, the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in Whyalla, has been at the forefront. It has not been easy to sell the changes to their constituency, but they have taken on the hard job. We have reaped the benefits because of the changes that have taken place. We have also been very fortunate to have had the cooperation of the trade union movement. I wish to raise another matter in this House. In doing so, I note that it is good to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) at the table. One could say that he is one of the more progressive Parliamentary Secretaries. I hope that he will take on board the situation facing many people who retired some time ago and have lived on their superannuation, at no cost to the Government. Now that interest rates have fallen, they have been forced to withdraw some of that superannuation. That is quite sad. One of the things that the Government needs to look at-and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take it on board-is the lifting of the tax threshold to a responsible level, something like $10,000. There is no doubt about it-if we are going to be an' economically viable country in the future, we need a national superannuation scheme. We need to give people every incentive possible to join a superannuation scheme. Those people who, in the past, have provided for their future, those who made big sacrifices and who are now being burdened by the fact that they are probably less well off than people on ordinary pensions, need to be compensated. With a national superannuation scheme, which I fully support, we would have a pool of our own resource. I do not think it is any secret that we are the most foreign-owned country in the world, and that is a sad indictment on the Australian people and Australia in general. If some overseas country wants to withdraw its funds or some investor wants to withdraw his or her funds, what is going to happen? Interest rates will go up to attract the funding back within the country. If we could have a national superannuation scheme, with billions of dollars to call on for any major project such as another Snowy Mountains scheme, we would have our own resource. Tonight I have spoken on a number of wide-ranging issues. It is imperative that the Government and the Minister's representative, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, who is at the table, take on board some of those matters, particularly the one concerning the superannuation scheme and the lifting of the tax threshold. Another issue I ask them to look at is that of private health coverage. It is not just wealthy people in Australia who take out private health insurance. In my area in particular the overwhelming majority of people who do so are ordinary people and our voters. So it is important that we look at that.",113
222,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,"i commend the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) for some of his forthright remarks tonight on the Appropriation Bill and in particular what can only be said was his applause for the coalition's Fightback package in relation to private health insurance and that portion of the package which deals with the provision of rebates for those who take out private health insurance. It is a pity that some members of the front bench, particularly the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who attacks the coalition from time to time on its Fightback package in relation to private health insurance, were not here tonight to hear what the honourable member for Grey had to say.",116
223,Mr COBB,Unknown,It was an honest speech.,116
224,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,"As my learned colleague says, it was an honest speech. It was different from most of the other speeches by Government members on the Appropriation Bills. In almost every speech on the Appropriation Bills-the honourable member for Grey was almost the exception to this-what we see time after time is simply an attack on the coalition's Fightback package. One would think that we on this side of the House were in fact the Government. If one listened to debate day after day in this place and if one came in here at Question Time on more than two or three occasions and heard the topic of debate at each Question Time, one would come to the clear conclusion, if one did not know which side of the chamber on which the Government sat, that we on this side of the chamber were the Government of this country. Since the end of November last year we have had a government totally pre-occupied with two things: the first is the coalition's Fightback package and the second, which leads from that, is its chances of being re-elected at the next Federal election. We have now seen the rats fighting amongst themselves. It is said that when the rats start fighting amongst themselves the ship is about to go down. In the last week we have been treated to the spel'.tacle of Labor's aristocrats of power, superannuated and current, fighting for prime position on the pedestal of Labor history. Labor's former failed leader, Gough Whitlam, delivered what in newspaper cliches is called 'a stinging attack' on his more recently superannuated brother in leadership, Bob Hawke. Gough said, a trifle bitterly, that Bob had 'one objective in public life and that was to become Prime Minister. And when he got there he had no purpose ... he never had any policies except the accord'. To add insult to injury, Whitlam then went on to anoint the present incumbent of office, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), his so called 'spiritual successor'. Now there is no show without Punch, and Keating and Hawke were the inseparable Punch and Judy of the last decade. There might have been some bitterness in that marriage and the usual amount of domestic violence, as Punch was prone to beat up Judy whenever the opportunity offered, but a marriage it was: Hawke and Keating; Keating and Hawke. Like the masked crusaders from Gotham City, Batt:nan and Robin, they were a pair. And as Hawke pointed out in his fortnightly column in the Sunday Age recently, his mate, the honourable member for Blaxland, was wont to be irrelevant about the hallowed Whitlam leadership of yore. The honourable member for Blaxland wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 November 1987 of the Whitlam Government's fatal flaw, which was 'a mismatch of ends and means'. L The honourable member commented that Whitlam's view that the Labor Party since 1983 had been 'seized by some new and alien philosophy', was 'a view which equates honour with failure and success with sell-out. It's the view of those who suffer from a sort of romantic nostalgia about a period which after all produced pretty indifferent outcomes'. Are we now to assume that, like his namesake St Paul, who we might recall prayed to God, 'Make me good, but not yet', the honourable member for Blaxland also had a knock on the head which caused him recently to see celestial stars where none had both been before? The name of the game-and I use the word 'game' advisedly, because the honourable member for Blaxland is always talking about games-and a good measure of someone's unreality index is votes at any cost, as long as it is at someone else's cost. Politics for the honourable member for Blaxland is just a game of brinkmanship. The other moral we can draw from the Punch and Judy divorce and Punch's deification in Labor heaven is that words mean as little as one wants them to mean. To this end, a good memory is a sore handicap. After recently decrying the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as shrill, strident and abusive-terms which suggested that he spends some time on self-reflection-the honourable member for Blaxland then indulged in some romantic glossing of Labor's noble achievements. He told us that Labor had developed an efficient market economy 'with a nice social policy wrapped around it'. Leaving aside the fact that we have the most severe recession since the Great Depression with half of our young people unemployed, a pennanent any of long tenn unemployed, an underlying deficit of more than $20 billion in the last Budget, and not the $13 billion as stated, a blow-out in imports to $5 billion in July, the highest monthly figure on record, which assembled facts might lead a rational man to believe that our current economy was not so efficient-leaving aside these mere trifles about the economy-let us look at this'nice, social policy wrapped around the fish and chips of the economy. The honourable member for Blaxland waxed lyrical about 'all the social balances'. He said there would be access to education and health, support for women, women's policies, aged care, child-care and occupational superannuation. Mr Keating was quoting the Leader of the Opposition as saying, 'Let's turn back a century of social and industrial advances. Let's have a policy of social impoverishment and the economic phoenixes, and the self-made people will rise from the ashes'. For a start, as to the century of advances, these were not LaQor's doing, because until this latest Punch and Judy show, which has brought us economic disaster and the brief Whitlam fiasco, Labor had only 16 years and six months in power in this century. Robert Gordon Menzies said in 1958 that the Liberal Party did not seek to win elections by making lush promises about social services. He said: We have, let me remind you, always perfonned much more than we have promised. He might have added that Labor always promises much more than it performs. Of course, the most laughable example of Labor grandstanding was ex-Prime Minister Hawke's pledge in his election policy speech in 1987 when he said: We pledge that by 1990 no child need live in poverty. He later said that the key word was 'need'. Are we to presume that any child in poverty has chosen this course because he or she really does not need to live in such a condition today? Historically, the Liberal Party has always seen itself as having a mandate for social compassion and social refonn. Alfred Deakin, our spiritual forebear, explained liberalism as a belief in 'equality of political rights without reference to creed, and equality of legal rights and without consideration of wealth or quality'. Votes for women and the principle of one man one vote were the very plinth of this platfonn. Liberalism taught that all, including the poorest in the community, should have their due and that there should be a minimum rate of wages and wise factory legislation to prevent wealth from taking advantage of the needy. In the early stages of the Second World War, the Menzies Government announced that social security was to be one. major objective in the post-war period. In 1941, it began a series of new social security programs with a scheme of child endowment. The previous Labor Government had boasted that it would create a national health scheme but had done little more than quarrel with the very people-the doctors-whose cooperation was vital. It took Australia's first Liberal Government to create a national health scheme in 1949. It was not at that stage a comprehensive scheme, being, as we recall, only for invalid, old age, widows and service pensioners. But it was a Liberal government which started it, and at the time it was said to have no superior in the world. The same government doubled the unemployment benefit and raised pensions, which had not gone up under the previous Chifley Government despite rapidly rising prices. Liberal governments oversaw the enonnous post-war immigrant influx. During the years of Liberal governments when the Labor Party was under the leadership of Arthur Calwell, there was virtually no difference between the Labor and Liberal social policy. I want to mention only a couple of recent social welfare policy signposts on the Liberal side. For example,· it should not be forgotten that the Fraser Government introduced the system of family allowances. Also important was the replacement of the pensions means test by an income test and the provision for automatic changes in the rates of pensions and benefits in line with changes in the consumer price index. The same Government-the Fraser Government-also set up a consultative committee on women's welfare, which Labor has continued except in a more straitened form. Let us not forget that a Labor government in Victoria insisted that single men during the Great Depression march on foot from town to town throughout the entire State-travelling for work was the euphemism used-in order despite to pick up their dole pittance, then called 'sustenance' like something out of some Dickensian poorhouse. The fact is.that it terrified of insurrection by the workers. It a cruel abuse of human lives in those years. Let us not forget, too, that Labor espoused White Australia policy, which now presents a grubby blot on its multicultural conscience. Much of what passes for achievement in the Government's current rhetoric is a mirage in the desert. Access to health that the able member for Blaxland speaks of is a joke. People in the lowest socio-economic taking out expensive private insurance that they can ill-afford to guarantee them hospital treatment because the public hospitals are now so overburdened that they can only treat what is supposed to be non-elective surgery. These are facts that the honourable member for Grey, a member of this Government, marginal pointed out in the speech before mine tonight. According to one hospital administrator, age pensioners are coming to private hospitals with their life savings to buy themselves treatment they need urgently for painful conditions which are deemed elective, such as rubbish bin. hip replacements. People are dying while they wait for treatment in public hospital queues this country. Is this access to health? Access for whom? Regarding access to education, Labor steal policies have demonstrably not led to increase in the number of working class students at tertiary institutions. Rather, it the reverse. It is true that there are many more women now in the work force but, middle management males have lost their jobs in the last few years, WOMen have filled the least well-paid dogsbody jobs in the work force. I suppose that this is what the honourable member for Blaxland would call dead-end jobs rather than the interesting jobs that he was promising the young people all over this country. For all the trumpeting, formal child-care remains prohibitively expen. sive and constitutes less than 10 per cent of child-care used by working mothers, many of whom are only working because of this recession. Labor has created a less equal society, all its rhetoric to the contrary. In fact, it is one of the great obscenities of our tfme that this Government can parade itself in all was the garb of compassion when every objective was assessment of its policies leads inevitably to the other conclusion. According to the latest the statistics released in this year's Federal Budget Papers, more than 300 people with taxable incomes of over $lm paid an average tax rate of 26.1c in the dollar. These figures reflect tax changes for higher income earners honourmade by the Hawke-Keating Government. Top earners did not do nearly so well under sector are the Frase!: Government. For example, the figures for Mr Fraser's last year in office, 1982-83, show that people earning more than $100,000 paid an average of 53.2c in the dollar in tax compared with 34.6c in the dollar in 1990-91. This difference was engineered by Labor's drop in the top tax rate and the introduction of the dividend imputation scheme. On any close old examination, the honourable member for Blaxland's social policy looks to be no more the than a grubby and rather greasy bit of butcher's paper best consigned to the nearest Labor's profligacy in promising what it in cannot deliver continued in its One Nation statement in February and in the Budget statements. The general idea seemed to be to the coalition's thunder with an 'all gain, any no pain' handout of tax cuts. The only . problem is that they cannot be delivered is because there is no money left in the piggy bank. This was picked up by none other than as ex-Prime Minister Hawke who obligingly pointed out that the Budget's signalling of probable business tax increases in 1995 had left a 'big question mark hanging over the Government vis-a-vis the business community'. It is now a contest, as Mr Hawke realised, of one set of taxes versus another. Spend now, and save later-a lot later-has been the hallmark of the Keating approach to the Australian economy, which is nowhere better enunCiated than in this last lacklustre Budget. Remember all the jobs that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) boasted of creating in the 1980s? He was at it again in Question Time today when he spoke about 1.8 million jobs. These jobs have now gone and what have we got? We have a net foreign debt of $148,000m. This year's Budget was no different-spend now and pay later. 1\vo aspects of the Budget are cause for particular concern. The first is the size of deficit which is claimed to be $13.4 billion. That itself is a huge blow-out from the $4.7 billion in last year's Budget and even a blowout against the revised figures of the One Nation statement in February. We have a situation where another $1,000 worth of foreign debt will be owed by every man, woman and child in this country adding to more than $8,000 worth of foreign debt attributable to every man, woman and child in Australia. When this Government came to power in 1982-83, the equivalent amount of foreign debt for every man, woman and child in this country was just $1,500. Spend now and pay later. Spend now all right, and we will all pay later-every man, woman and child in this country. Secondly, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said that the Government 'will consider and implement a number of tax changes' to reduce the 1995 Budget deficit. The fine print claims that the Government will examine withholding tax, prescribed payments tax and fringe benefits tax to raise up to $3 billion$3,OOOm more. So tax cuts can only be had now if it means tax increases in the future; the future' being 1995 which is, of course, after the next election. Unlike the goods and Services tax, which is basically a discretionary tax which someone chooses to payor not pay according to whether they decide to buy or to save, Labor's taxes are all taxes at source. Let us take the withholding tax, for example. A 20 per cent withholding tax on interest earned in bank accounts is an insidious and stupid measure. It is a harsh penalty for struggling retirees in this country. For business, it fails to recognise that all interest is not profit. These days many businesses, although operating cash positively, rely on interest earnings to offset operating losses and now businesses will be taxed at monthly intervals of 20 per cent by the Government. The 'banks will hardly do all this deducting for free, which will only add to the costs of industry which are so high compared with our competitor nations. Finally, account holders will earn less because they will lose the compounding the benefit of 20 per cent monthly interest and so will be able to save less than they can save at present; and domestic savings will be lower than the already lowest level in the history of this Commonwealth. Is this an incentive to industry or to the nation to save the capital we need to invest in our future? Hardly. Despite pump priming of $3,000m, as proposed in this Budget, it is expected that unemployment will remain at over 10 per cent well into 1993. It is steady as we go into the quicksand. Labor's policies have failed the Australian people. This Government has become no more than a blight on the hill. The Treasurer told us no less than seven times in his Budget Speech that the Keating Government was a caring government. It has yet to demonstrate that it has ever cared, and it does not care for anything more now than staying in power.",117
225,Dr CATLEY,Unknown,"I would like to speak in support of the Appropriation Bills and make a few remarks about some aspects of them. I think the Budget which the Appropriation Bills represent has to be put in the context of 'in where the economy is going in general. I think it is fair to say that we have seen it emerge from recession and the last four quarters have witnessed economic growth. We have all had delivered to our offices today the monthly economic and social indicators for August 1992. A perusal of the figures and graphs presented therein shows this .quite clearly. The number of employed persons has improved in recent months. The employment advertisement series has levelled out and the GOP has lifted each quarter since mid-1991 and, with it, retail sales, motor vehicle registrations and dwelling approvals. Indeed, there are also clear upward trends in the manufacturing production series and in new capital expenditure. I note that bankruptcy rates have been falling since September 1991. I suppose the most remarkable graph is that lending for housing is now standing at all time record levels. All these things are positive, but many in the community quite rightly feel that this is not being reflected in their day to day lives, and they wonder why. I suppose the principal reason is that the last thing to move in economic recovery is usually unemployment. Although there has been a movement downwards in the unemployment rate recently and although the number of people in jobs has gone up, this has been very patchy and it is difficult to say that there is an emphatic downward trajectory taking place. This is made worse in the State that I represent, South Australia, by the fact that the State by ':)rnte figures are uneven. Although the last two monthly figures have shown an improvement in employment and a reduction in unemployment, that is not necessarily going· to be the case· tomorrow. I would expect a rather flattish unemployment result. This unemployment situation is further worried by the fact that the major industrial countries share with us a recessionary situation. Some of them are even looking worse than we are in terms of a recovery. Indeed, as far as economic growth is concerned, we are at the top end of the table, although our unemployment improvement is no greater than most of them. It is against that general picture that the Federal Government has brought down this Budget. The result is that the Government has decided, unashamedly and unabashedly, as opposed to the situation that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), was trying to describe, to stimulate the economy by putting an injection of public funds into economic activity. The resulting deficit that comes out of that decision is about $13 billion, or about 3Vaper cent of GOP. This is a turnaround, it is quite true, from previous Budgets, where there has either been a small Budget deficit projected, as in the case of last year, or even four Budget surpluses, which is what we as a government ran in the late 1980s. I should point out that this is not a large Budget deficit by international standards and it is still much smaller than the coalition's farewell Budget of 1982-83. That was nearer to 4 per cent than 3 per cent. This year's Budget deficit, in other words, follows a small deficit and four consecutive Labor Budget surpluses which are able to take the level of Commonwealth debt to an acceptably low level by retiring government bonds and thereby enabling some expansion of debt to be quite acceptable to the markets and to economic activity over the next year in order to exercise the stabilising effect of what are usually called in economic textbooks built-in stabilisers. So the Government is unashamedly stimulating the economy as best it can. Th- way in which this stimulation is occurring is chiefly through a fall in revenue or, to be more precise, a fall in the growth rate of revenue as opposed to an increase in the rate of expenditure. Revenue will climb by 0.5 per cent in real terms as against an increase in outlays by 4.1 per cent in real terms, which means that there will be a 3.3 per cent GOP deficit, which is stimulatory, most of it occurringl by a lack of growth of revenue or taxation. But there is also in the economy some expansion of expenditure in the form of this 4.1 per cent increase in real terms, a quite moderate expansion that has proven to be, by and large, acceptable to international money markets; yet that will have a stimulatory effect. What do these stimulatory programs look like? The first and most notable is to direct job creation measures at the local level. The principal effort made here is the allocation of $345m targeted directly to those local government authorities whose areas have been identified as those with the highest rates of unemployment. Local government authorities will be eligible for such funds if they can show that they have projects which can employ people and which can be undertaken in the very short term and that those projects are worthwhile additions to community facilities: projects of a recreational, sporting or community service kind or projects to do with tourism where we think the infrastructure in many of our cities and indeed regional areas is lacking. In other words, the Government is bypassing the States, which have proven to be rather slow spenders of government funds in the past, and is going straight to local government authorities. Last Wednesday, in pursuit of these rapid infusions of well spent moneys into our local authorities, I chaired a meeting at my office in the central business district of Adelaide of local government administrators and elected councillors whose areas were eligible to receive funds and who were trying to design projects appropriate for their applications. The Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) attended. We had an extensive discussion about where they would apply to spend the money. I thought many of the projects they suggested were quite innovative, some relating to tourists, others relating to child-care centres, bike path infrastructure, the renovation of historical buildings, streetscape projects, parklands for recreational purposes and many other such projects-useful projects that should be undertaken anyway. These funds are then able to be brought forward. I did not hear too much of the criticism that we heard in this House that these funds were wasteful at the grassroots level. In fact, all these councils, which would represent diverse socio-economic backgrounds and political affiliations, were very appreciative of these opportunities to upgrade facilities in their areas. The only critics I could find in South Australia were those councils who were not eligible to receive funding, who were rather quickly mollified in most instances'when they realised that they could readily be eligible for such funding if they whacked up their unemployment rates, which they thought were unacceptable. The Lord Mayor of Adelaide, who was critical of the program and who is, of course, an endorsed Liberal candidate at the forthcoming State election, thought that the money was not well served but then would not hand it over to a few other councils which said that they had some very good projects to spend it on. One State Liberal shadow Minister thought too much was to be spent in Labor held seats. UnfortUnately, while this was a fine idea, it was an unsustainable prop<?sition. The Budget also allocates funds for our national .i,nfrastructure more directly, to areas such as rail expenditure, which will go through the National Rail Authority. I am pleased to say that in my own area there are a number of very specific expenditures, which I should itemise, and which I think will be very useful in the long term. Islington rail workshops, in the seat of Adelaide, will receive about $4m, enabling them much better to service the national rail infrastructure and rolling stock. Port Augusta, a much larger rail yard, will also receive sums of money. But most interesting has been the $12m refurbishment plan for the Indian Pacific Railway, which I would like to say a couple of things about. I visited Ute Indian Pacific demonstration at Keswick rail yards a few months ago, where they showed me what they had in mind for the Indian Pacific. Their proposition is that as we standardise the rail gauge from Cairns around the coast to Perth, with a spur line that is used by the Ghan to Alice Springs, if we can modernise, redesign and upgrade the Indian Pacific rolling stock, which comprises about five trains, we would be in a position to advertise as one of the great international drawcards for rail travel the Cairns-Perth round-the-coast rail routes in differently designed motifs. One would be colonial Australia, others would be Aboriginal Australia, bush Australia and multicultural Australia. One could fly into Cairns as an international tourist, get on and then roll around the coast to wherever was your chosen destination from which to fly out. This is a very imaginative, tourist oriented project. I think over the next decade, if this marketed properly, it could be seen as a rival to the Trans-Siberian which I have travelled on. I have to say that under socialism it lacked some of the amenities that the modem international traveller would have appreciated. It did, however, have 92 stops, at each of which the greatest culinary delicacy I could come across was roast potato, which no doubt did \Vonders for my waistline and induced frostbite when I left the train to buy it. It could· also rival the Orient Express, which I have seen only in the great Hercule Poirot movies-indeed, it seemed most amusing. I think around-the-coast rail stock for Australia, with a little route up the Ghan into Alice Springs-which is now operating profitably-is a really imaginative way to spend $12m. It will be tremendously well spent. If any members of the Opposition are visiting Adelaide in the next couple of weeks-indeed in the next few years-I can arrange for them to have a look at this proposal. I hope it will receive bipartisan support because it is a very imaginative effort for which our rail yards should be commended. Mr Anderson-A very kind, bipartisan offer.",120
226,Dr CATLEY,Unknown,"lam glad to hear that the .honourable member opposite is going to take up my offer. I am sure he can find· my address in the Parliament House Communications Directory and I will pursue this matter at his leisure. Road improvements are also to be brought on stream. Most· of these do not attract the romantic nostalgia of the long rail routes. Most of these are to be intercity trunk routes, but I draw the attention of honourable members to one of them since it is in my seat. We are going to spend $14m upgrading the Main South Road, which is a severe bottleneck in the carriage of persons and product between the northern and southern areas of metropolitan Adelaide. The latest bottleneckmuch of the rest of it having been improved-is between the River Torrens and ANZAC Highway which marks the boundary between my seat and that of Hindmarsh. That is going to be upgraded at a cost of $14m and is the money could not be better spent. It is a fine micro-economic reform effort and I am sure much labour will be employed in that area to very good effect in improving our national infrastructure. Incidentally, this project is adjacent to another national infrastructure project which has been brought forward, again in my seat, to which I would like to draw the Deputy Speaker's attention. That is the expenditure of about $4m of building better cities program money in the Mile End area. Despite the moneys which are being spent on the upgrading of the national railway infrastructure, there is now a redundant railway yard at Mile End which is adjacent to a number of other rather run down manufacturing establishments which are unlikely to receive attention directly from private sector industrial capital. The building better cities program has designated that as a redevelopment area, which will provide for inner city residential development with parklands, community facilities and probably a wetlands area in the western parklands. It is anticipated that about 5,000 new residents will move in there-an inner city area with affordable housing-over the next couple of years. I attended the launch of this program in Adelaide last month with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) . The Budget also places considerable emphasis on the expansion of the education system. As one who spent two decades in the tertiary education system in Australia, I am always pleased to see this expanded. It is a sector which we have increased by over 50 per cent during our term of office, achieving the equivalent of constructing 12 medium-size university campuses and in many parts of this country opening up university education to sections of the population-particularly working-class people, but also people in country areas who were singularly disadvantaged for 100 years of the previous tertiary education system. We are now injecting more money into capital expenditure in universities. I am pleased to say that two in my seat will be receiving about $14m for the upgrading of buildings, one of which I spent two decades in-and I can assUre honourable members that even without my efforts it would have required refurbishment. There is also an increase in the number of postgraduate research awards; there are new opportunities for people to study at the university through open learning; and a number of other innovatory efforts are being made in the secondary and tertiary education system. Of course, there has been a huge improvement in the quality and quantity of traineeships, programs and places for acquiring skills in a post-secondary educ-tion job market, and Skillshare programs in particular. As someone who has spent the last four years of his life as one of the directors on the Skillshare program, I can attest to the efficiency of these programs. I am delighted to see that over the last couple of years the Opposition has dropped its policy platfonn of seeking to abolish Skillshare and will go ahead with the innovative program which has proven a great success. ' The Skillshare project I am involved with has regularly placed over 50 per cent of the people that come in the front door into its programs. Given that it targets long tenn unemployed people who have found particular difficulty in gaining employment, I think this is a very worthwhile program. If we can move to a bipartisan position on that issue, I will more than pleased. In general, announced before the Budget, the national employment and training plan for young Australians, which followed on the youth job summit, allocated $77Om for funding in this Budget to provide employment and training opportunities for nearly 100,000 young people. The health budget introduces about $1.6 billion of new spending into our health system. The money is chiefly allocated to capital investment, infrastructure and other expenditure programs to improve access to public hospitals and to reduce waiting lists. There is some controversy over the alldcation of tax deductibility to private health insurance funds and there is also some controversy over whether money should be allocated to private hospitals. While I do not entirely go along with the remarks of my colleague and friend the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), I do think that, if it were the case that our public hospitals were suffering exorbitant waiting lists that were producing the deaths that have previously been suggested occurred as a result of people not being able to get immediate access to hospitals and if there were large numbers of vacant beds occurring at the same time in the private hospital system, something might be done to match these vacancies with the demand. Anxious to find out whether this was the case, I had a meeting on Monday with representatives of all the private hospitals in my seat and a few that are not in my seat to discuss this matter. At the moment, the private hospitals in the Adelaide metropolitan area are, generally speaking, experiencing a pretty healthy occupancy rate, although they do have apprehensions about the decline in subscriptions to the private health insurance system. If the decline were to be exorbitant to the extent that their financial lives were at stake, it would attract my immediate attention. At this stage, I do not think the existence of the private hospital system is at stake, but it is something I will keep an open mind about and my eye very closely on, as I told them at this meeting. There have also been some expenditure increases in the domiciliary nursing care be benefit and extended eligibility for carers' pension, and T welcome this. The Budget will also see pensions increase by $6 per fortnight from 23 January 1993 and an extension of fringe benefits. I have mentioned a few of the increases in expenditure that have been itemised in this Budget. I welcome them as useful expenditure patterns to add to the structure of national transportation, of national residential facilities, of national educational facilities, of our health system and some of the domiciliary services we offer for people who need to be cared for at home. All of these things are very useful in an environment where, economically, it was responsible and indeed necessary that the Government provide some additional stimulus to the national economy. If one can identify programs that one would like to see undertaken, but for reasons of financial stringency in an environment such as the late 1980s when it was necessary to reign in public expenditure because of the very rapid growth rate of the private expenditure, then now is the time to take on board some of these improvements to our national infrastructure. I welcome the direction in which they have been shifted; that is, the community works program at the local level, the infrastructure of transportation, the infrastructure of education and the infrastructure of health. of these are welcome additions to our programs and things which I indeed welcome. With that, I close my remarks on this Budget.",123
227,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"Gwydir) (10.35 p.m.)This is the Budget that should have been, at this time of great national need, about leaderSuch ship. It is a Budget that should have squarely addressed the nature and the extent of the problems that face us as a nation, the most serious that we have seen for decades. What we needed, but unfortunately did not get, was a vision-almost any vision, I am tempted to say-for us as a nation to work towards, to inspire us and pull us along together. The Government had a clear responsibility to give .hope to the Australian people and to be seen to be genuine in its efforts to deal with our woes. The Government should have outlined the parameters of our problems and chartered a way forward. Instead, unfortunately, all we got was elaborate deception and avoidance. No wonder cynicism eats at the very soul of the Australian people-the very soul of the electorate. No wonder it remains rampant and we cannot get the national cooperation that is a prerequisite for effectively addressing our problems in this nation. . The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) acknowledged this need for national unity in terms of the title given to his February economic statement-One Nation. But this, in common with the Budget that we ate discussing tonight, was nothing more than an exercise in subterfuge. The focus has been on dishonesty, deceit and division, instead of cohesion, cooperation and commitment. The hope seems to have been that if we can hide from the people the true nature of our national problems and what needs to be done to address them, we might yet sustain ourselves on the hope that they will vote for us, despite the circumstances. The result of this mislaid and wayward philosophy is policies which will simply see a continuation of the bankruptcies in our small business sector and our business community in general, and a continuation of the unemployment problems that have blighted this nation for so long. If we want to restore All business we must restore an economic environment which encourages confidence, the sort of confidence that is a prerequisite for investment-investment in genuinely productive exercises, not the sort of speculative bubbles that we saw So much of in the 1980s. exercises are, in tum, the key to the future of real, sustainable, long term prosperity and job opportunities in this country. Slirely we have learnt that much over the last 10 years. Only this morning the Sydney Morning Herald graphically catalogued our nation's dilemma: unemployment in the private sector has crashed to 1987 levels. In the year to March, nearly 180,000 jobs were lost in the private sector-jobs gone. This represents a contraction of 4.2 per cent in th- private sector work force in just the last 12 months. What did this Budget do for· the private sector, the sector that employs 71 per cent of Australia's wage and salary earners? What incentives did it provide to encourage business to invest? What reforms did it outline to lift investor confidence? The answer, tragically, is nothing. It is as if the problem just does not exist and does not need to be addressed. The failure of this Budget is now a matter of public record. There is no doubt that out in the community it is dead in the water, as the current saying goes. The failure to recognise that business holds the key, that business is the way out, is reflected in the bandaid measures to disguise unemployment by throwing money at training schemes and job creation programs, which will end up in a situation where we will have the best trained dole queues in the world. Then there was that ultimate example of clumsy pork-barrelling-the local capital works program of the Minister for Family Support artd Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons). This is a scheme which aims at providing temporary relief for a small and very select, I might add, group of people for a limited time. In my electorate, councils received a grand total of $1.9m-better, I understand, than they got in Maranoa, but rather than less than they got in places such as Blaxland. M;r Taylor-None.",125
228,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Groom got none. I would have thought that his unemployed people were unfeeling and insensitive-they obviously do not need the money. The problem is that only half of my 22 councils are eligible, so I daresay I am doing better than the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Groom. But only half are eligible and two major towns-Narrabri and Gunnedah-miss out totally. Why the unemployed of one town are somehow more deserving of help than another is beyond me. Perhaps they are less sensitive or perhaps they are less deserving. Perhaps the Prime Minister's electorate holds the answer to the question. The electorate of the honourable member for Blaxland, as I assume he will be known after the next election, has been allocated $21m. There must be a very severe problem with unemployment there. Mr Bruce Scott-Twenty-one million?",126
229,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"That is what we are told. As if skewed priorities are not enough, Minister Simmons just cannot get his facts right. He announced that the program was worth $345m but the total value of the projects actually came to $650m. I suggest to the Minister, if he is watching tonight, invest in an abacus, as counting on his fingers obviously does not work. Although councils will do what they can with this money provided to them by the taxpayers and to be repaid-because it is, after all, on the national bankcard-what rural communities in this country really need is a regeneration of their rural economies. Nothing else will ultimately provide the sort of prosperity and job creation opportunities that will be needed to keep people in rural Australia. Coming specifically to the Budget and its impact on the primary industry s-tor-a sector in great difficulty at the moment-the Budget shows that $1.76 billion will be spent on primary industry. But that is rather deceptive. The industries themselves will contribute $774m in charges and levies. Together with $428m through the excise on diesel fuel, we have a situation where government spending on primary industry will only be about $551m. This is down nearly $1oom on what the Government contributed in the last financial year. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that we do not particularly want more money from government. That is not what farmers either need or want. What we need and what we would prefer is for less to be taken from them in the first place, and a better environment in which they might be able to survive until, hopefully, we get, an international upturn in commodity prices in terms of the prohibitive costs and charges and uneconomic environment that confronts Australian farmers today. The impact of the abolition of the seven taxes that we have committed ourselves to scrubbing in Fightback is very substantial for the rural sector. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax, fuel· excise and the payroll tax, in particular, will have a major impact on farmers. Farmers sometimes say to me that they do not pay payroll tax so they cannot see how they will be helped by that initiative. In reality, as Labor's own Treasury shows in its estimates, farmers lose out to the tune of several hundred million dollars every year in increased costs of production inputs as a result of payroll tax and its imposts on the that he community on production costs. We really need a situation where, in terms of what Treasury's estimates reveal, we can strip out over $1 billion-around $8,100 per Australian farm-in operating costs. That will be of substantial help in the current difficulties. Add to that the $2 billion savings for the transport and storage sector which are so vitally important to the rural sector. Add to that the relief in the order of $1.5 billion for the food processing industry-Australia's biggest industry. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) never stops talking about the need for value adding rural product in this country. There is nothing better that he could possibly do for that industry than to strip out $1.5 billion worth of taxes and charges which hold that sector back at the moment, with the possible exception of getting serious about industrial relations reform in that industry. The tax changes alone will involve an improvement in Australian farmers' terms of trade of around 5 per cent. We need that desperately in Australia's beleaguered rural sector. There is no doubt about that at all. That is the improvement that results simply from the tax changes-in other words, by removing the impost of current charges and taxes on the agricultural sector in this nation. When one looks at the other benefits that will flow from a revitalised economy, it is perhaps worth considering that in New Zealand-our reforms will not exactly mirror its reforms but there are some useful parallels to be drawn-its farmers now enjoy a terms of trade advantage over ours of between 20 and 30 per cent. New Zealand is winning markets that we are losing. Its farmers are pulling ahead. Its exports are recovering. We heard someone saying in this place tonight that New Zealand is running trade surpluses for the first time since 1973, while in this country the trend continues against us and this Government continues to behave as though we can ignore the problem. We cannot ignore the problem and if for no other reason than the fact that New Zealand is outstripping and outperforming us and winning investment that we are losing we must move to lift our competitiveness, to lift our game, lest it swamp us and lest we find that it is simply in there beating the living daylights out of us and every conceivable market opportunity that we would regard as ours. It is not as if that sort of direct contribution to the farm sector or the reduction of costs is lacking in the Budget. The Budget forecasts a very substantial deficit-a deficit that is reflective of the most massive turnaround in budgetary outcomes in this country that we have seen for many decades. There is a deficit projection of $13.4 billion which represents nearly $2,000 per Australian taxpayer or, for that matter, Australian farmer. As we all know, the Government's forecasting record-whether the result of fair or less than realistic calculations-is utterly appalling. That raises the very real danger that the projected deficit, already unacceptably high at $13.4 billion, will blowout. I hope it does not blowout as badly as last year's which more than doubled from the original prediction. The danger is that the nation's bankers, those overseas to whom we owe so much and who, in so many ways now, call the tune for us, will withdraw their money and the markets will respond by pushing up interest rates again. We have seen evidence of that in the last couple of weeks. It sends a chill down the spine of every small businessman, of every farmer and, I hope, of every one of their representatives in this place who has any concern at all for his or her constituents. It is the last thing that Australia's beleaguered rural sector needs at a time when average farm debt levels, in some areas of this country, are now up around the $300,000, $400,000 and even $500,000 level, while farm equity has plummeted because farms that were worth $600,000, $700,000 and $800,000 are now virtually unsaleable or if they are saleable they are realising only $300,000 and $400,000. Against that backdrop, ABARE reports that the average loss per broad acre farm this year is likely to be in the order of $30,000. I would have thought that a sector that still contributes massively to this nation's economic fortunes, a sector that still employs, in terms of a multiplier effect downstream from our farm activities, a massive proportion of the Australian work force, would have been an industry that might reasonably have expected something much more realistic out relief in tetms of of this Budget. There is another aspect to the question of integrity in this Budget and that relates to the attempt to hide the need to be more realistic in our approach to industrial relations in this country. The Government apparently cannot and, in the end, will not·confront the critical issue that now presents itself to this nationthat is, the need to really bite the bullet, to stop issuing palliatives and actually get on with the job of confronting the issue of building a more competitive and a more cooperative Australia able to out-perform our competitors abroad. The reality is that, despite all of the good fortunes that we enjoy in this country, resources. laid on-a well-educated population, a stable political system and all of those sorts of things-living standards have plummeted. We saw the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) stand at the table today and make a magnificent contribution to today's matter of public importance. He talked about like nations abroad. He suggested that we commonly think of America, Britain, Japan and Germany. We do like to think of ourselves as enjoying living standards up there with those sorts of wealthy and productivenations. I suspect that many Australians still think of ourselves as belonging in that category of nations. However, over the last 20 years the reality is that we have slipped from the top third of OECD nations in terms of take-home pay levels, disposable household income, to the bottom third. That is not a bad record over a couple of generations. In fairness, it is not this Government's fault. But the reality is that this Government has done more to exacerbate the problem than anyone else, it has done nothing to arrest the problem and it seems to be determined to continually avoid confronting that problem. If that has been our performance over the last· couple of decades, one can only speculate as to where we might end up in the next generation if we do not get serious about taking on this issue. As we know only too well, our industrial relations system in this country has been based on the monopoly representation of employees by unions, compulsory arbitration, and the setting of awards and conditions through the highly centralised process of national wage case hearings conducted by the Industrial Relations Commission. It is inflexible, bureaucratic, anachronistic and confrontationist. It is based on the old class warfare ideas that dominated industrial relations last century. Ironically, it is the very model, if you like, from the British system that we ought to reject. When there is so much in our own culture and heritage which we ought to be proud of and keen to maintain, the Government wants to reject those things and maintain this system which we think is the very thing that ought be disposed of. Despite the rhetoric and the talk of reform, the reality is that the system remains pretty much open to the charge of being·inflexible and bureaucratic. We believe that a very real change in the way things are done in this country is necessary. We have clearly, openly and honestly outlined our industrial relations proposals. The policy is built on four major principles. The first is the absolute right of individual employers and their employees to make voluntary agreements at a workplace level, without the intervention of organisations or industrial tribunals and subject only to, the observance of a decent minimum wage structure-not a slave labour rate-and other minima relating to things like sickness benefits, leave and existing statutory requirements relating to health and safety matters. Beyond that, people ought to have the right to freely negotiate their own just workplace arrangements. After all, the people in the workplace are those who are most likely to have a clear idea of how to make their workplace work to the best advantage of all involved. The second principle is that we ought to establish once and for all the absolute right of individuals to join or not to join a trade union. It is time that we stopped kidding ourselves that there is no such thing as de facto compulsory trade unionism in this country. The concept is inimical to freedom and runs strOJigly counter to the idea of effective choice in the matter of working out our own workplace arrangements ..The reality is that 'We do, of course, have closed shops in Australia. The Pilbara is evidence of that. There we lost $50m or $60m worth of export income simply over a dispute because somebody wanted to exercise his right not to belong to a trade union. One ought to have the right to belong or the absolute right not belong. The third principle is the maintenance that concept, that binding idea, that the conduct of all Australians should be subject to the ordinary laws of Australia, administered wherever possible by the ordinary courts Australia; and the fourth principle is the right of ttade unionists to associate on an will enterprise, industry or craft basis without arbitrary restrictions of any kind. There is overwhelming evidence that capacity Australia's economic performance is declining. That has been exacerbated by the existing industrial relations system. Neverthe the less, the Government, as evidenced in this Budget, has paid only lip service to the GOP. manifest need to properly decentralise our industrial relations system through the use enterprise agreements. This must end. It is paradox, to put it kindly, that the accord partners should be preaching salvation by enterprise bargaining but at the same time damning enterprise unions by insisting on 10,000 minimum membership threshold. contrast, the system of enterprise agreements proposed by the coalition would not be within the Commission's purview.

230,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"Parramatta) (10.55 p.m.)In rising to speak in the debate on. Apwhat propriation Bill (No.1), I make the point the outset that this Budget's prime focus is jobs, economic growth and economic recovery for Australia. Fundamentally, it reinforces the Labor Government's commitment to caring, compassion and concern for those in need. is a reinforcement of the Government's social justice commitments, which have been the hallmark of its period of office since 1983. The day after the Budget, the headline on the front page of the local paper that circulates in my electorate, the Parramatta Advertiser, was 'Jobs, Jobs, Jobs-Thanks Keating'. I suggest that is a very accurate reflection of the 1992 Budget. It fundamenlays. tally sums up the ingredients in the 'Budget for this year. It recognises the importance this Budget has in setting the framework to create the recovery and the jobs that are essential for Australians. It recognises economies such as ours are struggling worldthe to wide because of a whole series of circumstances. The way to generate activity to get of over those problems is to have government take initiative, demonstrate a lead, show the sort of stimulus that is required and demonstrate the capacity to deliver on those commitof ments. That is what this Budget does fundamentally. It focuses on those key things that get recovery going. It recognises the pain and the hardship .that many people have suffered during the recession. But it notes that the recovery ingredients are there, as is the to build on them over the next year. . The provisions in the Budget provided for responsible deficit figure of $13.4 billion. Again, I point out that that is 3.3 per cent of It is certainly a realistic and reasonable figure in the circumstances. It is also worth of recognising that the ratio of outlays is still a less than the figures of the seventies and the eighties. Therefore, I think it can be said in any sense that it was a reasonable and responsible fiscal stimulus, but one which at the a same time has targets and defined goals and By will achieve objectives. One should contrast the approach adopted in the Budget that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) brought down with that of the Opposition in these issues. As was clear from the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr at Anderson) said, when Opposition members on talk about the needs of rural areas they fundamentally do not understand that the government services in those areas are part of the infrastructure that they require. In areas It such as the electorate of Gwydir and Parramatta, they are a fundamental part of the infrastructure that is needed, be it in health care, aged care, child-care, road transportation or other forms of transportation-all of the things that government has a part in. If we take Fightback at its word, the Opposition is suggesting that it would cut something like $7 billion out of public outWho are the ones that lose out of that $7 . billion cut? Of course, they are the people that that are in those categories-the ones that need aged care, child-care, education services and so oli. It is clear from the speeches made that by Opposition members in these debates on Appropriation Bills that they have little recognition of areas that have high unemploymake ment and require structural adjustment siderations. They have little understanding those issues. The sorts of things adopted in the Budget relating to the local capital works program responsible in every sense of the word. One of the things that I have learnt over the years, after spending a long time in local governin ment, is that local' government is most capable of providing innovation and delivering imfunding mediate activity, without some of the bureauonly cratic delay that can occur with some of the projects at the State level. Local government can get things done. It has important projects that are able to be developed. It has projects in areas such as local tourism-things add value as time goes on, providing additional services that can create downstream employment in those types of industries. I am pleased to say that the councils broader region of western Sydney, which stimulus represents about 1.6 million people, received about $43m under the local capital works program, and that is important. That is being done in a targeted way. Some councils did get funding because it is worked out in relation to how much unemployment there has been in those areas over the last 12 months. The net effect of that $43m worth of expenprograms diture will be to create many job opporsuch tunities, and many new facilities will be developed which will build further opporand tunities into the future. In the Parramatta electorate two councils are directly affected and receive funding under the local capital works program. Parramatta Council receives $4.14m and the Holroyd Council receives $2.94m. Both those councils have readily taken up this funding. They have recognised the value of it and have work force. already started to develop and submit projects that will achieve very real and very susstructured tainable objectives for those local comit munities. It is important to note that, irrespective the political persuasions of those opposite the local level and what they say in this argument chamber, once the focus gets back to their electorates they are saying that they want cooperate in these projects and they want them happen, but when they come here conthey want to jeopardise these sorts of of programs. This two-faced approach on these issues is what we get from the Opposition. Those projects that are being conducted in are the local areas do a number of important things. One of the projects in my area will restore one of the oldest buildings that exist this country-it is 200 years old next year; a project that we have not been able to secure for from any other level. We are not doing something that is going to have real tourism potential as time goes on; we are restoring part of the unique heritage of Australia. I defy anyone from the Opposition to suggest that such projects are not worth that can while and not sustainable. We now come to the value of projects that relate to draiilage in urban - reas such as Parramatta. Very cost-effective projects will in the be developed. They will have immediate in creating jobs in the local area, and that certainly will be very welcome. In the longer term, they will have the real impact of making people's homes free of flooding. That not is something that everyone should regard as fundamental. I know the community in the electorate of Parramatta does. It is a pity that the Opposition would want to put at risk as valuable as that to communities as those in the Parramatta electorate. Now we come to labour market initiatives the range of flexible programs that have been developed to provide the skills for the range of initiatives in the Jobstart and the Jobtrain programs. They are designed to The encourage people who have different experiences, either because of time out of work or the restructuring of industries, to get training opportunities and to get back into the Contrast that approach of trying to provide re-adjustment and retraining where is required with the approach of those opposite in these areas. They seem quite of happy to decimate whole industries. For at instance, the Opposition continually runs an that it is going to pursue zero tariffs no matter what, as the honourable member for to Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has made clear in the to last few hours. Those opposite are going to proceed on that basis and destroy industries. Opposition members keep saying things such as, 'Don't you worry about that. The goods and services tax will fix up all those· things. The zero tariffs will just happen. People will get cheaper cars and other things'. But jobs are irrelevant as far as the Opposition is concerned, it would appear. Jobs are relevant. The industries that have been through the restructuring process understand the relevance of the car plan and the steel plan. We have heard honourable members opposite talking about industrial relations. I would like to take some of those opposite out to a company like Dupont in my electorate to see the approach it takes to industrial relations and to see what nonsense is the talk about workers not being prepared to take up the challenge of restructuring their processes and of having reforms of work practices. Of course workers are prepared to do that, but they are not prepared to stand by idly while industries are destroyed because of the Opposition's approach to zero tariffs. The Opposition says that having a car industry for Australia is one of those optional extras. It does not really matter in its terms. Our Budget makes it clear that we are concerned that we do have that structured growth and that we encourage growth to occur. Governments have a role to play in encouraging growth when we are in a period of economic difficulty. As we come into the recovery, it is doubly important that we use the resource base that has been built up to ensure that that recovery and those growth rates are ones that produce benefits to the whole nation. It is interesting to note that within only a Kingdom. fortnight of the Goveniment's Budget-which provided a real and sustainable stimulus in fiscal terms, but which most would still argue was within fairly modest projections-the Japanese, when faced with the difficulties of economic conditions in Japan, went for a stimulus to their economy which was three times greater in real terms or comparative terms to that conducted in Australia. They recognised that the wayan economy faced with the difficulties that the Japanese economy is faced with, or with the that Australia is faced with, gets growth going once again is not to have a $7 billion cut in public expenditure which hits all those people with the greatest need: the way to do it is to ensure that governments take up some of the projects that can create those jobs. They looked at infrastructure projects, local capital works projects and matters such as the ones we adopted in the One Nation statement in February relating to governments taking over with the taxation changes and so on. These are the very things that the One Nation statement, the jobs statement in July and the Budget that this Government has introduced are all designed to create-that is, the structured growth that is so essential and which will again create the opportunities which are so necessary for people. That is why it is unrealistic to come in here and say, 'We are going to change everything for the better by introducing a $27 billion tax. We are going to make things better. There are going to be more people employed because there is.a $27 billion goods and services tax'. This tax is effectively a value added tax on labour as well as a tax on all the other services that, despite the Opposition's protestations, are not subject to taxation at the moment. The Opposition says that it will zero rate education, but we have already established that things like school excursions, food bought through school canteens and so on will be subject to the tax. There will be no exemptions for those things, because that is not part of the Opposition's agenda. It wants to go a step further than even Margaret Thatcher was prepared to go in the United Really, one must ask: what purpose would there be in adopting this sort of approach? What rational reason would there be for adopting it? Why would we want to put an additional tax on someone's lunch at the school canteen and at the same time make Ferraris cheaper? One really does have to ask what sort of motivation is driving that sort of policy making. The Government recognises that with its labour market programs and initiatives in the education system it has a real difficulties commitment to schools. Last Friday I was very pleased because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was able to open a new school in my electorate, Our Lady of Lebanon School at Harris Park, and was able to note there the great achievement there had been in school retention rates and particularly the number of young women completing secondary school. We have achieved a dramatic improvement in the number of women getting education and that was demonstrated very prominently at the school on Friday. If one looks at what was provided in the Budget as far as education is concerned, one sees that there has been a massive increase in spending. In growth areas such as western Sydney, that is particularly important because we need additional education resources in areas of high population growth. The increase in recurrent funding for non-government schools for 199- is $45m, on top of the One Nation funding, and again a similar sort of increase was provided for capital funding. All of those things are important and very relevant for the people of regions such as Parramatta, particularly those Catholic systemic schools which have certain demands. They are looking for additional resources. These have been provided in the Budget and that is very pleasing. In 1993 every student in secondary schools in areas such as Parramatta will benefit from recurrent funding at the rate of more than $2,100 per student and every primary school student will benefit from recurrent funding at the rate of more than $1,400 per student. Government schools are not being neglected in that process either. An additional $60m will be allocated to government high schools. There will be important expenditure in areas like research, technology and library facilities, all of which will be valuable for students in high schools throughout areas such as the Parramatta electorate. One area that got very proper attention in this Budget is the needs of the aged and disabled in the c;ommunity, where a compassionate approach was taken. The carer's pension represents a very important landmark in the recognition of those groups. The commitment of the Government to increase pensions in January by $6 per fortnight represents a real increase in line with our commitment to ensure that pensions are kept above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. These are important initiatives in difficult times, because people in that category really struggle when economic conditions are trying. The unemployed, especially the mature aged unemployed, got particular attention, which was also very important. In respect of the aged and veterans, one thing that is really important is certainty about the future. An important initiative taken was to ensure that fringe benefits applied to all part rate pensioners and veterans. All age pensioners and veterans get the benefit of fringe benefits as a result of this Government's decision. That was an important decision, and I note in all the publicity that there has been no commitment by the Opposition to match it. Yet when one goes around and talks to pensioner groups, one finds repeatedly that that is the issue that many aged pensioners are concerned about. They say, 'Can't we have the certainty of knowing that, irrespective of the movement of a dollar or two one way or the other in superannuation or other income, we will still get the fringe benefits?'. This Government has ensured that that occurs, and that is a very important change. In terms of health care, the retention and strengthening of the Medicare system and additional funding for public hospitals are important issues for people in regions such as Parramatta. It is very important to note that we will not go down the track of the Americanisation of our health system. We are not prepared to countenance a situation where a large mass of the population gets denied health care in any form and is abandoned by the health system. We will not follow the approach of the Americans. We note that the approach of the Americans is essentially the approach of the Opposition. It is quite happy to have that sort of approach adopted for Australia. There is no way that this Government will countenance many people being left out of getting decent health care. The fundamental structure that underpins the whole process is the need to get recovery and economic growth. We have created the ingredients for that to really flow through in the next 12 to 18 months. There are major problems here at the moment; there are major problems in many countrieS, at the moment. When the United Kingdom is compared with the relevant data on Australia, Australia's problems pale into insignificance. We have important considerations that we have to follow through. How will we do that? I suggest that the best way to do it is to have a more positive and assertive talk about Australia's future. We must recognise that at this stage we have the lowest inflation rate and the lowest interest rate regime in 20 years and a situation where our merchandised exports are at the highest growth level in history as far as exports in that category are concerned. The Opposition has always decried that fact each time interest rates were cut. Each time interest rates were cut, it said that we were pushing the pace too much. In February 1990, it said that it was political to be cutting interest rates. Ever since the cuts have occurred, it has said that there would be runs on the dollar or that something else would occur. Anything it can do to talk negatively about Australia, it will do, and it will go to almost any level to do it. This Budget provides a positive, caring, compassionate, consistent, coherent strategy of growth for our economy, and it will create jobs. We still have a way to go because of the magnitude of the world recession we are dealing with, the drought and all the other factors involved, but the creative talents of Australians, coupled with the initiatives in this Budget, can create the environment to get real growth. I support the Budget. (TIme expired)",129
231,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"All I would say to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) is that his local press was clearly being deluded because all the national press around the country was universally critical of this Budget. This Budget is yet another one that simply will riot be delivered. It is a big spending, spend now pay later, bankcard based, fudge it Budget which is about as believable as the One Nation deficit forecast of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) just six months ago, which was out by a staggering $5 billion. This Budget involves at least $13.4 billion, which the Government does not have and must, therefore, borrow from us and from our children. Clearly, it is the Prime Minister's last irresponsible budgetary gasp, heavy on selective vote buying handouts, and is another attempt by the Prime Minister to buy his way back into office, knowing that he will not have to live with the consequences of this Budget before the next election. As the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said a little while ago, the most likely result is the prospect of some of the best educated and trained dole queues in the world. It is a Budget where an extra $3.4 billion will be pumped into the economy over the next two years to directly create just 27,000 new jobs and about J 10,000 training places. In other words, the Government is spending more than $3 billion just to knock one percentage point off unemployment. Even with this policy of throwing money at the problem, the Government, by its own admission, says that unemployment will not come down below 10 per cent and may hover closer to 11 per cent between now and the forthcoming Federal election, whenever that might be. On this issue, much of the $230m devoted to regional unemployment announced by the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) to go into the unemployment black spots will be spent in Labor held electorates. For the benefit of this House, I repeat that in my electorate of Groom a big round zero is allocated in each of the three categories of that particular program. This generates little confidence in this Government-and my constituents are very disappointed-but, more importantly, it provides little hope for the nearly 7,000 people in receipt of 10bsearch payments in Toowoomba and the eastern Darling Downs region. This is an increase of more than 40 per cent in the last two years. That, of course, falls fairly and squarely at the feet of this irresponsible Government. Furthermore, the Government's failure to publish forward estimates of the deficit is designed to obscure a certain tax increase next year, of which the Medicare hike and the cigarette tax increase in this Budget are just the first instalments. In other words, this Budget offers the Australian people a clear choice between, on the one hand, a hidden tax agenda of a Prime Minister and his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and, on the other hand, the allcards:-on-the-table funded economic reform Fightback package of a Hewson government. In a nutshell, this Budget offers Australia .another year like the last 10 years-another year of self-delusion, failure, disappointment and squandered opportunities. I would like to turn to the educational aspects in particular of this Budget. It a government unable to break decisively with its flawed policies for education and training while stealing as much from our Fightback package as indeed it dares. Once again, quality has come off second best, as the Government tries to create the impression of a certain degree of action. Its policies for higher education continue the funding arrangements described by the Industry Commission as fatally flawed. Despite its vast spending spree in this Budget, the Government cannot provide the places needed for qualified students, and it refuses to give the institutions the freedom which will allow them to create places. I will return briefly to this point more specifically a later. The open learning program will provide opportunities for some who have been deprived to date. However, it will not address the unrnet demand and there remain serious questions over its quality. I am sure that the remark made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech that 'every Australian with access to a television and a letter box can now have . access to a university education' will come back to haunt him. His disregard of the requirements for a quality university education is well known, but this appalling denigration of what a university education really means will disgust, and. has disgusted, many in higher education. The proposal to increase the discount on up-front payments of HECS is, once again, a direct steal from our Fightback package. The Austudy changes are an admission that the Opposition's criticisms of the inequities in, and the rorting of, the student financial assistance system have been fully justified. Austudy remains an inadequately targeted scheme and it will be fully reviewed by the coalition in government to ensure that it is fair to all. The new optional loan scheme in this Budget, while adopting many features from the recommendations of the Chapman report, departs from those representations in certain key respects. In particular, the design of the scheme seems to do little to help rural students in genuine need who have been reveals precluded from Austudy assistance by the assets test. Indeed, many of those students are within my electorate and the electorate of Maranoa, which is to the west of mine in southern Queensland. The schools decisions reflect the continuing collapse of the union-inspired new schools policy which is designed to prevent parents exercising educational choice. The Govern.: ment should have had the courage to dump the policy completely as recommended and proposed in the Fightback package instead of caving into bureaucratic pressure. The non-government schools funding decisions demonstrate once again the divisive nature of the Government's policy by conlittle tinuing the freeze of per capita grants to schools in categories 1 to 4, even though it is obvious to all that present policies are threatening the viability of schools in those particular categories. There is no recognition by the Government that all parents should have a basic entitlement to a measure of public support, and no satisfactory basis for the funding of non-government schools. This factor was reiterated in my electorate at a meeting several weeks ago by 1,000 concerned parents and friends. The decision to change the focus of the good schools policy towards promoting quality teaching in schools is an admission that this policy was misconceived from the beginning. Presumably, the Government has now discovered that good schools require quality teaching. They require much more besides, but the Government is listening only to the agenda of the teaching unions, et cetera. This is confirmed by its support for the hijacking of the move towards teacher professionalism by the Australian Teachers Union through the proposal for a national teachers council. All in all, issues of quality and genuine structural reform of Australian education and training as proposed by the coalition remain off the Government's agenda. Only a strategy aimed at raising the standards of Australian education and training to international levels will provide a sound base for employment opportunities and ultimately secure this country's long term future. It is this strategy that we on this side of the House provide in the Fightback package. The Budget gave the Government one last chance to show that it had something of substance to offer in the area of education. In my view, it has clearly failed and failed abysmally. Turning now to tertiary funding, I simply refer the House to newspaper headlines in my electorate highlighting the parlous situation of the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba: headlines such as '''Raw deal"" on USQ funding'. The article stated: . The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) has suffered a major setback with the Federal Government's capital works allocation announced in the Budget this week. This was a report in the Chronicle in the last week of August. According to Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), Emeritus Professor Ralph Parsons, the university was delivered a raw deal. Another headline reads, 'USQ missing out on Govt funds is ""outrageous""'. The article reads: . . . (USQ) Dean of Engineering Professor Peter Swannell is outraged the institution will miss out on multi-million dollar funding for a technologies building. He went on to say: ... USQ, which offers Australia's only agricultural engineering degree, was on the verge of being recognised as the national centre for agriculture. Rural industry had already committed $1.1 million to the university to the end of 1993 for research. With sufficient capital funding this research could be 'five times' as large as it would now be. He went on to say that the Federal Government's approach to capital funding was inconsistent with its push for value adding and for young people to reach their potential. He went on to say: 'We will continue to do that research but we will do it in absurdly crowded conditions'. 'We have the J?Wple, we have the policy and we have the skills but we don't have the building'. An article only last week in the Toowoomba Chronicle headed 'USQ, govt in funds fight' stated: University of Southern Queensland Vice-chancellor Professor Barry Leal and Chancellor Mrs Allison Dickson have thrown down the gauntlet to  They will fly to Canberra next week to battle to have USQ's capital funding allocation reinstated. As recently as this morning, in the higher education supplement of the Australian, an article headlined 'USQ chief on attack over $20m ""retreat"" , stated: The vice-chancellor of the University of Southern Queensland, Professor Barry Leal, has accused the Federal Government of 'reneging' on a commitment to provide $20 million over three years for a technologies building at USQ. It was to have been the first significant new building on the campus for more than a decade. The planning officer at USQ, Dr John Clarke, said the whole Toowoomba community was just as angry as Professor Leal, chancellor Ms Allison Dickson and the rest of the university. 'For an institution this sizethere are 13,000 students on the USQ campusthis is a huge issue. There is a lot of anger and a lot of frustration in the local community that rural Queensland has yet again been disadvantaged,' Dr Clarke said. USQ's view is that the Government has changed the rules governing capital works mid-stream, effectively ending the university'S plans for anew building and leaving it with nothing but a hollow promise and little opportunity to complete its engineering in modest development plans. This evening Professor Leal and Mrs Dickson were to fly'to Canberra for a meeting with Minister Baldwin tomorrow morning. As late as mid morning today, that meeting was cancelled. I hope it was only postponed, hopefully only until Monday. If and when both Professor Leal and Mrs Dickson do arrive in Canberra for discussions with the Minister, I feel sure that they will present a clear and convincing case and make five points. I will make those five points very briefly. The first point is that at a joint meeting of Commonwealth and State authorities in November 1991 an understanding was reached that USQ would receive.$12m in 1994 and $8m in 1996 for a technologies building. This project had been identified by the State of Queensland as the top priority for that State. The second point is that the Commonwealth has recently changed the methods of allocating capital grants. This means that USQ will now receive only $1.37m in 1994, effectively eliminating any chance of constructing the technologies building. This has severe consequences for the future development of USQ. The third point is that, since 1990, USQ has been enrolling 250 students a year more than its funding warrants. This has been done to provide additional places for students in Toowoomba and south-eastern Queensland. The financial strain put on USQ by the loss of this promised capital funding will mean that this policy can no longer be supported. Educational opportunity in Queensland will be further restricted. The fourth point is that a special Budget allocation of $31m was recently made available to fund building projects for univerFord sities as part of a job creation strategy. Despite the high priority afforded the technologies building by the State of Queensland, USQ did not receive any of these funds. Given the university's needs, this is incomprehensible and, indeed, insulting. The fifth and final pomt is that USQ remains, very importantly, the lowest per capita funded university in Australia. During the 1980s it received from the Commonwealth only one teaching building, constructed at a cost of just $1.68m. Such shabby treatment is believed to be without parallel in higher education over this period. I conclude my remarks by quoting from a letter from Professor Leal to Minister Baldwin, dated 4 September 1992. In his final paragraph he said this: The University has obviously been seriously disadvantaged by the timing of the implementation of the capital roll-in process. The loss of projectspecific funding for the Technologies Building from 1994 has been a major blow and has been compounded by a lack of any concession or consideration in the Commonwealth's associated capital initiatives for 1992/93. If some allowance is not made to compensate the University for its major loss in this area, and some money made available to support the Technologies Building (perhaps from the proposed 'discretionary poOl' of $35m announced for 1994) then the future developmentI emphasise thisof this institution and the overall quality of its programmes are in serious jeopardy. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear on Monday to receive both Chancellor Dickson and Vice-Chancellor Professor Leal. Debate (on Motion by Mr Staples) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Staples) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Elizabeth Mary Ford: Death",133
232,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"It is with feelings of pride and sadness that I rise tonight to talk about a very fine lady, Miss Mary Elizabeth Fo-d, who died on 31 August this year. I am proud and privileged to have known Mary Ford and deeply saddened by her recent death. Mary was one of those very special people whose many attributes included loyalty, dedication and commitment to othersattributes that are all too rare in this so-called modern world. The list of Mary Ford's community involvements spans a lifetime and included: Junior and Senior Young Farmers; Blowhard Comfort Fund from 1940 to 1945; Ascot Social Club; Agricultural and Pastoral Society, President of the Ladies Committee; CWA Miners Rest Branch; CWA Ballarat Group President; CWA State Vice-President; editor of the CWA Cookery Book; Blowhard Tennis Club; Mount Prospect Tennis Association; Ballarat mid-week tennis; Ballarat Tennis Association; Learmonth and Blowhard Tennis Association; Ballarat Badminton Association; Ascot Table Tennis Club; Learmonth Football Club supporter; Chairperson of the Shire of Ballarat's Local Community Committee for the Celebration of Victoria's 150th Anniversary; Chairperson of the Shire of Ballarat's Local Community Committee for the Celebration of Australia's Bicentenary; Chairperson of the Pioneer Park Committee; member of the Learmonth Historical Society; member of the Blowhard School Centenary Committee; Compiler of Mortillo: A Short History of Mount Blowhard; Compiler of the Miners Rest CWA history; Liberal Party branch President and chair of the Ballarat Federal electorate committee; councillor for the Shire of Ballarat; council representative on the Barwon Central District Assembly; delegate for the Barwon Central District Assembly to the Municipal Association of Victoria; MAV Policy Executive Committee; MAV Environment and Conservation Standing Committee; Gillies Street Recreation Complex Committee; Alfredton Community Centre Committee; Chairperson of the Council's Parks Committee; member of the General Purposes Committee; Chair of Council's Equal Opportunity Employment Committee; member of Council's Australia Day Celebrations Committee; vocal member of Ballarat anti-amalgamation campaign; Ballarat school holiday programs organiser; and All Saints Anglican church ladies guild member, Sunday school teacher and vestry treasurer. This list is extensive but not exhaustive bears testimony to a lifetime of community sharing and giving. Mary Ford devoted her life to the community and one of her great loves was the Country Women's Association. Mary Ford unashamedly expressed her very deep love for God, Queen and country and she will be very sadly missed by all. Over 800 people attended a service to celebrate the life of Mary Ford. I extend my condolences to her brother, Tom Ford, and members of her immediate and extended family. Local Government Employment: Criticism by NSW Premier",136
233,Mrs CROSIO,Unknown,"I rise tonight to bring to the notice of the House what I believe is one of the cheapest political stunts ever pulled. On 2 September 1992 in the State Parliament of New South Wales the Premier of New South Wales, in answering a dorothy dix question from one of his colleagues, went on to criticise as a cruel hoax: . . . a cynical and calculated political ploy that may create a number of short term jobs. He went on being critical by stating: In a number of cases, unemployment is not the criteria for those councils which get the money. . . I would like to remind the Premier of New South Wales of something. Our local newspaper described it admirably. It stated: This windfall has offered some hope for the city's legions of unemployed. Jobs will be created as the money is used to start much-needed community projects and improve roads and drainage. The State Government should roll out the red carpet when dealing with Fairfield's growth plan. It is shameful that the State's leaders are using ""big brother"" politics to cast doubt on such a worthwhile program. All three tiers of government-federal, state and local-should co-operate with each other to solve the nation's unemployment crisis, rather than get involved in political point-scoring. There was more. Following that statement by the Premier of New South Wales on 2 September, the President of the Local Government Association in New South Wales, Alderman Peter Woods, stated: Wemeaning local governmentare sick to death of state politicians playing politics and when we want to get on with the job. I raise this matter because following the very generous program introduced by the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) after the Budget allocation for local government works programs throughout Australia, my Council was one of those which received funding. Something like $105m has gone to New South Wales and out of that something like $9m will be spent in the Fairfield City Council area. With the cooperation of Federal members, aldermen and staff an excellent program has been put together which will bring to fruition dreams that that community has had for many years but has not had the finances to achieve. They not only put together a very constructive program, bringing in capital works programs, from the erecting of buildings to roads and drainage work-work which, as I said before, has not been able to be attempted in the past-but also they completed designs and plans and presented a submission to the Association last week; all within seven days. For years, local government has been saying, 'Give us the opportunity and the finances and we will get on with the job'. The Federal Government has provided that opportunity here. But in the State of New South Wales local councils are now being threatened that if they cannot fund the work completely within their own means they will not have their borrowing programs extended. We have to make sure that the State Government does come to the party as far as local government is concerned. These are not mickey mouse projects; these are projects which will have long term effects for the community. They will help the unemployed and, most importantly, every one of those people who finds long term employment will then be spending those dollars. As I have said before in this House, it will create that domino effect whereby the person who is earning a dollar will then spend a dollar. I congratulate the Council on the speed with which it has put those programs together. I congratulate it, too, on the way in which the work has been done. It has been evenly distributed throughout the city. The Council has looked at construction jobs, road building and drainage. I say again that we do not need cheap political stunts: we need cooperation and assistance. When we look at the $12.5m program of construction works which would be created, we see that $1.2m would not even take the loan borrowing program of Fairfield City Council up to 22 per cent. it is a very small part of its overall budget. It is a mean and, I believe, miserable act to threaten local government and say, 'Well, because we weren't consulted you're not going'to get it'. to 1975. I say to all and sundry: let us get on with the job and help those people who have now become the meat in the sandwich and who have· had very little cooperation from the State Government. Let us get on with the job and provide them with the,opportunity to get out and work. My people need it and are crying out for it. A community as large as mine could certainly take the construction and the work which will now take place as a result of this program. I believe this program will be submitted to the Federal Government next week. I think it will be to the disadvantage of the State Government if it does not consent to that loan borrowing program. Most particularly, it will be using the people of my electorate and the people of many electorates in New South Wales who have had the advantage of that funding as the meat in the sandwich. I do not think we should do that as politicians. I think we should be united. As our local press has said: roll out the red carpet. Let us get on with the job and, in particular, let us make sure. that the Premier of New South Wales does not pull any more of these cheap political stunts by criticising this program. He criticised it very badly and he did it in such a way that he could not make those remarks outside the Parliament. It was misleading; it was mischievous; and, most importantly, he did not even get his facts together. As I have stated before, let us get the job done. (TIme expired) Defence Awards",137
234,Mr MACK,Unknown,"North Sydney) (11.40 p.m.)The recent announcement of the approval by Her Majesty the Queen of a medal for Australian personnel who served in support roles in Vietnam is, in the words of the Minister for Defence Science and Personriel (Mr Bilney), long overdue and completes unfinished business for 20,000 loyal Australians. It also underlies the continuing humbug, bureaucratic obfuscation and hypocrisy which has been practised by all very Federal governments since the Second World War in their continuing failure to recognise veterans who served in campaigns from 1945 For over 40 years veterans and the associations that represent them have sought recognition, to no avail. It is no wonder they feel bitter, discriminated against and unfairly treated. For years they' have listened to excuses and empty rhetoric. More recently, they have watched in disillusionment as Prime Ministers have cried at Gallipoli and kissed the Kokoda 'trail. Veterans from the 1939-45 war and from the campaign since 1975 have been recognised with Australian Service Medals. Why then are the men and women in the 30 years between 1945 and 1975 treated as virtual pariahs? There are the 35,000 to 40,000 service men and women in Korea from 1950 to 1953, the 10,000 plus who served in Malaya from 1948 to 1960 and the Malay Peninsula from 1964 to 1966, the 10,000 plus in Borneo. from 1960 to 1966, the approximate 100 in the Berlin airlift in 1948, the hundreds in United Nations forces before 1975, and the nuclear veterans of Maralinga and Monte Bello. Many of these veterans did get recognition from foreign governments, yet it is almost inconceivable they cannot receive it from their own. If nothing else, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should publicly state why these service men and women are excluded from the sentiments of his recent speeches emphasising Australia's independence as 'One Nation' free of a colonial past where all Australians should be aware and proud of the sacrifices and services given by our military veterans for Australia. These speeches had given hope to affected veterans that at last their services would be recognised. Many had also believed that formal recognition would finally come from a Prime Minister apparently determined to establish Australia as a fully independent nation, yet the recent rejection again by. the Parliamentary Secretary to the  the futility of their hopes. The arguments used on that occasion as to why formal recognition could not be granted related to the imperial versus the Australian honours system, operational as opposed to non-operational services, conscription versus volunteers and that the argument that medals should only be issued with the commencement of an Australian honours system in 1975. These arguments were seen by veterans as largely rhetoric and had little basis in The subsequent issue of the Vietnam logistics and support medal and the Minister's accompanying statement confirms the sophistry and hypocrisy of the Government's position. It was argued that medals could not be issued for service prior to 1975 on the grounds that the Australian honours system did not originate until that year, yet the new Vietnam award was clearly issued as 'a formal award within the Australian honours system' in recognition of a service prior to 1975. The last Australian troops were withdrawn from Vietnam at least three years prior to the introduction of the Australian honours system. They were withdrawn also prior to the Queen formally becoming the Queen of Australia in 1973. It is therefore quite clear that there is no reason whatsoever why the veterans of the 1945-75 era cannot be recognised under the Australian honours system. Every person in these defence forces served this country as directed by the governments of the day. Many served under horrific conditions. Since it became obvious that they were to be ignored and treated as though they never existed, their anger has risen at this blatant discrimination. A similar condition existed in Canada until 1991, at which time the Canadian Government formally recognised the post-1945 veterans of that country. The Canadian system operated under the same imperial honours system as Australia, yet has now found processes to provide official recognition qnder their own Canadian honours system. I am indebted to Frederick Kirkland, OAM, of Neutral Bay, a war historian and author of the works Sometimes Forgotten and Operation Damask, for his role in publicising this most unsatisfactory state of affairs and campaigning for its remedy. Representing the veterans community has been the driving force behind documenting the history of Australian military involvement in campaigns and related activity of the postwar years, and he deserves great fact. credit for opening his readers' eyes to discrimination against veterans of the 1945-75 era which can so easily be corrected. Education Fightback",138
235,Mr COURTICE,Unknown,"Hinkler) (11.45 p.m.)The comments by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), in criticising the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), cannot be allowed to go unanswered. He criticised the fact that more money was not going into the campus in Toowoomba. He forgot to say that the money is now going to areas like Bundaberg and Gladstone. In the Budget an amount of $1'/4m has been funded to both Bundaberg and Gladstone so that families can allow their children to be educated in their own cities instead of having to go to Toowoomba, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Groom, and pay board to get tertiary education there. It shows some short-sightedness and a lack of understanding that Toowoomba is not the centre of the universe and certainly not the centre of Queensland.",140
236,Mr GEAR,Unknown,Not like Bundaberg.,140
237,Mr COURTICE,Unknown,"As our Whip says, the growing areas of Queensland are Bundaberg and Gladstone. I want to make that point very clear. Mr Hulls-And Mount Isa.",140
238,Mr COURTICE,Unknown,"And Mount Isa, too, as the honourable member for Kennedy says. Those provincial areas are equally important. That is why the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services recognises as the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) also points out, and ensures that funding goes to areas across our great State instead of just to Brisbane and Toowoomba. Tonight I really want to comment on the importance and the ability of a program called Lateline to draw in millions of people. Again tonight Lateline has brought in great ratings. I have watched Lateline of a few nights ago for the third time. Not since Walt Disney produced his great program Disneyland, with Donald Duck, have we seen such comparable characters as Napalm Charlie and Tiny Tim. Indeed, it is interesting to see the Opposition's scorched earth zero tariffs attitude. It is interesting to note that so many Opposition backbenchers are sitting at the table. I do not know whether they want to get away from the scorched earth and zero tariff policy of the back bench or not, but I tend to think that the seats are getting quite hot back there, as the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) has very ably pointed out today. It is interesting to note the attitudes, the comments and the behaviour of honourable members on the other side about Fightback. Probably the greatest comment, after watching the re-runs of Lateline earlier tonight, was to listen to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) complaining about that right angle agreement with tourists coming into Australia. He was actually complaining that we are going to get eight flights into Australia and only one into America. I would have thought that we would benefit from that, because eight plane loads of Americans means that they are going to spend money in this country. One plane load . of Aussies going to America is not going to spend much dough in Australia. And he is actually complaining. I really do not know how he is going to tell the tourist operators, the motel and hotel operators and all the small businesses, how they would be better off if we had eight plane loads of Aussies going to America instead of the eight plane loads of Americans coming here.",140
239,Mr GEAR,Unknown,They should take a bag of wheat each.,140
240,Mr COURTICE,Unknown,"Absolutely. But, interestingly enough, the greatest quote of the week comes from the greatest stand-up comic in Australia, Bob KaUer, Jr, the man who lives in the great electorate of Kennedy. He made this comment on Country Hour on 9 September: All of the Members of Parliament north of Brisbane-every single one of them, and as far as I know every single candidate north of Brisbane, has come out trenchantly opposed to any further reduction in the sugar tariffs. Certainly it is the National Party in Queensland-they are trenchantly opposed to any further reduction in the sugar tariffs. Robin MCConchie went on to say: That would appear to make Mr Katter's views quite clear, but not so. Mr KaUer then went on to say: The underlying philosophy of the Fightback package is very acceptable as far as I'm concerned and I would say that would be the opinion of the other new candidates for the National Party throughout Australia. There it is. There is the truth: table 4.1. The nightmare on Elm Street is going to appear day after day: table 4.1, rural and manufacturing assistance under the IC; the elimination of tariff, quota and bounty assistance to rural Australia. There we have Bob Katter, the stand-up comedian, saying, 'We don't want to see tariffs reduced but we're going to back Fightback'. But guess what? It means nought, zero, scorched earth, napalm, all across the country. Better still, Bob Katter went on to say that he predicted that a splinter group would emerge over zero tariffs. (TIme expired) Intellectually Disabled People",140
241,Mr DOBIE,Unknown,"In the short time available to me tonight I wish. to raise a matter of serious concern to many of my constituents. Yet again the bureaucratic red tape of this Government has trapped more Australians, this time the most defenceless in the community. While this Government imposes further regulations and restrictions on individual effort, the intellectually disabled are forced to sit and wait while their fate is discussed, seemingly endlessly, by the bureaucrats. The Handicapped Children's Centre in New South Wales is a great institution which has provided services to the southern Sydney area's intellectually disabled people for over 40 years. I am proud to have been closely associated with the centre in my time as the Federal representative. As. the Handicapped Children's Centre knows, it will continue to have my enthusiastic support. The people involved with the centre are a marvellous example of dedication and persistence, under circumstances often trying, and they are to be complimented on their splendid efforts. These efforts are being hampered by red tape. The Commonwealth-State disability agreement was to transfer the responsibility for accommodation and support in disability services from the Commonwealth to the States. I understand that the Commonwealth was to continue funding, centres such as the New South Wales Handicapped Children's Centre. To date, three States-namely, New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia-have not met the guidelines of the Government's tenos of this agreement. So, while the bureaucrats at both State and Federal levels argue the toss with each other, centres such as the New South Wales Handicapped Children's Centre suffer. The transition program of moving children from Rainbow Lodge to accommodation in the general community has been stopped because these funds have been frozen. This is a bureaucratic nightmare. The Handicapped Children's Centre has been trying to wind down the Rainbow Lodge facility for some time and move the residents into community cottages where they can live on their own. They were able to open three such cottages in 1990 and 1991. Many parents of the residents have contacted me to explain the advantages of community living and they have impressed upon me the gains that their children have made when they begin to live in their own homes. I fully support this transition. Because of my long association with the centre, I well know that there are considerable advantages in these people living in the community and taking part in society. It has been a noble objective of the centre for some time and, while it has always had my total support, I cannot say the same for the Government. This transition has now come to a complete standstill because the Handicapped Children's Centre cannot receive any funding from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. While the negotiations between the relevant government authorities. proceed at what appears to be a snail's pace, the centre is unable to proceed with its tran-' sition program and, importantly, those residents still at Rainbow Lodge are being denied the opportunity to live as a part of the general community. Surely the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) can act in some regard to ensure the continuation of funding for the Children's Centre so that this program of devolution may continue. One of the parents who contacted my office stated: Our daughter is being denied these opportunities because Minister Howe and his Department say there. is no money. Why have they started this transition process without thought of the ultimate cost? My constituent went on to say: That we will have to wait until responsibility is transferred to the State governments is not good enough. How true. I understand that government negotiations such as the Commonwealth-State disability agreement take time. I further appreciate that the Government has set aside approximately $20.3m in the recent Budget to implement the agreement. But what good is that money to the residents at Rainbow Lodge if it remains locked away while these negotiations flounder? I repeat: surely the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services can extend at least part of this funding to enable the winding down of Rainbow Lodge to proceed. Is it unreasonable to suggest that the gains these people make when they live in the general community do warrant some intervention from the Minister? Is it equally unreasonable to suggest that, without the intervention of the Minister, the people still housed at Rainbow Lodge are being denied these opportunities and benefits? I raise this issue in the sincere hope that this. Parliament can intercede to promote the objectives of these people. Surely they are deserving of this. The parents of the children of the Handicapped Children's Centre are showing a deep concern and it is totally unfair to all concerned that everything is at a total standstill. Rugby League",141
242,Mr BEVIS,Unknown," Mr Acting Speaker, in recent days a number of sporting· events have been held which would have been of particular interest to the constituents in Brisbane and, I would imagine, to you, with your keen interest in sporting matters across the nation. The Brisbane rugby league grand final was held last weekend and concluded the Brisbane rugby league season. I am very pleased to say that the Western Suburbs team based in my electorate was successful in winning the Brisbane rugby league grand final for the first time since 1976. I have been reminded this week of a couple of links between that 1976 team and the team which won last Sunday by a very substantial margin of 40 points to 10. Bob Green, who captained the 1976 side, had his son playing in the grand final team last Sunday and I am sure he would have been very pleased to see his son follow him, not only wearing the Brisbane Wests jersey but also succeeding in a grand final. Yesterday in the gallery of this chamber we had with us a school teacher, Richie Twist, whom some honourable members may recall. He was also a Wests player in the 1976 grand final winning team. He also played for Queensland and was an outstanding second rower of the era. The people in. my electorate, particularly in the suburbs of Red Hill, Ashgrove and Bardon are thrilled to see their red and black Panthers back on top of the rugby league ladder. I could not let the opportunity pass without also making some comment about the fact that one of the greatest footballers ever to play the game retired a fortnight ago-Wally Lewis. He is one of those players who have excited the imagination of sporting lovers throughout the nation, not only rugby league followers. He is one of those peculiar sportsmen who have attracted the attention of people across the country. There is no doubt that he has made an enormous contribution to the game. It will seem a little strange, as a Queenslander, going· along to watch State of Origin matches at Lang Park without seeing Wally Soccer Lewis on the field. He was a brilliant player; he was a brilliant captain; and he is a brilliant coach. His efforts as captain in organising and lifting the Queensland side and the Australian side assisted both the Queensland and Australian sides to many of their victories over the last decade. The accolades which have been given to Waliy Lewis by former great players are testimony to his genuine outstanding ability. I have some regret that he ended his days not with the Brisbane Broncos. This year, with the Brisbane Broncos now minor premiers and <,:lear favourites to win the premiership, it would have been pleasant to see Wally Lewis, who loved Brisbane and who loved Queensland, finish his playing days on the field for the Brisbane Broncos, winning the 1992 grand final in front of a Sydney crowd. There are a couple of other things that I wish to mention which are also occurring this week that are of great interest to the people in Brisbane. You may know that the State school soccer carnival is on. here in Canberra this week and that there are teams from all around Australia competing. There are three teams from Queensland involved in that competition-a boys primary school side, a boys secondary school team and a girls secondary school team. I had the pleasure of watching part of one of those games on Monday of this week and I was impressed by the standar4 of play. I was particularly pleased to see girls playing in that sport and being given some recognition for their skill and dedication to the game. I am also pleased to say that all three Queensland teams have won their two opening games and I wish them well as the week unfolds and as the tournament draws to a close at the end of this week. Motion (by Mr Staples) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affrrmative. House adjourned at 11.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Dr Caney to move That this House reaffinns the need to create a positive environment for business confidence to ensure investment in and the viability of the automotive industry in South Australia. Mr Filing to move That this House: (1) recognises the environmental costs associated with sewage' effluent disposal into ocean systems; (2) urges governmerit bodies responsible for sewage disposal methods to consider alternative waste treatment irrigation schemes that would recycle and utilise treated sewage effluent productively in an environmentally responsible manner; (3) recognises the irrigation sewage treatment scheme proposed as an alternative to the Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant (BWTP) north of Perth, which would result in less pollution of our marine environment than the operation of the BWTP, and while subject to stringent environmental s-dards, would provide economic benefits through the sale of timber and employment of labour. Dr Hewson to move That this House calls on the Prime Minister to addreSS, as a matter of urgency, the plight of the 350,000 long term unemployment by: (1) scrapping payroll tax; (2) deferring the national wage case indefinitely and moving to genuine enterprise bargaining; (3) encouraging the development of effective youth wages; (4) scrapping the compulsory training levy; (5) scrapping the compulsory superannuation levy; (6) implementing a significant cut in immigration; and (7) the other measures contained in the Opposition's 'Fightback' program of economic and tax reform. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 9 September 1992: Civil Aviation Act-Civil Aviation Regulations-Civil Aviation Orders-PartsIDS-Amendments, ,8 September 1992. 106-Amendments,8 September 1992. 107-Amendments,8 September 1992. Public Service Act-Determinations-l992 Nos. 155, 161, 162. . The following answers to questions were circulated: . Australia Post: Registered Publications (Question No. 1459) Mr Andrews asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 30 March 1992: (1) Has Australia Post undertaken an analysis of the revenue and costs attributable to the registered publications service. (2) How does Australia Post measure the revenue and costs attributable to registered publications. (3) What was the (a) revenue and (b) costs of the registered publications service in (i) 1989-90 and (ii) 1990-91. (4) Has Australia Post carried out an analysis of whether some parts of the registered publications service have been profitable; if so, (a) what analysis was undertaken and (b) what did it reveal. (5) Has Australia Post carried out an analysis of the consequences for (a) Australia Post and (b) users of the registered publications service of moving profitable large users from the service; if so (i) what analysis has been undertaken and (ii) what did it reveal. (6) Has Australia PoSt carried out an analysis of whether charges for some users could be justified on (a) a price discrimination strategy or (b) marginal cost pricing; if so, (i) what analysis has been undertaken and (ii) what did it reveal. (7) Does the registered publications service have the status of a community service obligation. (8) Has Australia Post undertaken a study using an avoidable cost approach of the costs of community service obligations; if so, (a) what study was undertaken and (b) what did it reveal. (9) Has Australia Post revised or developed since March ·1991 the statement in its corporate plan relating to its strategies and policies for the delivery of its community service obligations as required by section 36 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989; if so, what revisions have been made. (to) Has Australia Post developed a strategy for reducing the cost of its community service obligations; if so, what is the strategy for each obligation. (11) How does Australia Post allocate costs to the registered publications service. (12) What non-price measures has Australia Post (a) investigated and (b) implemented since NA 1984 for improving the profitability of the regisService tered publications service. (13) Has Australia Post entered into any arrangement or contract with a magazine or newspaper owner, publisher or distributor for the delivery of publications at. a price different from standard postal or registered publication rates; if so, with whom have such arrangements been made. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Australia Post, is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Australia Post uses conventional commercial accounting techniques to measure the revenue and costs attributable to Registered Publications. The cost allocation· methodology for the Registered Publications service was examined by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) as part of its 1991 Inquiry into the Supply of Postal Services. The PSA noted that the cost allocation methodology could result in losses being overstated. However, the PSA was satisfied that the loss on Registered Publications was directly attributable to the cost of delivery of magazines on a national basis. (3) As the Registered Publications service is a competitive one, cost details are considered commercial in confidence. The net loss on the service for 1989/90 was $27.5 million and for 1990/91, $21.4 million. (4) Yes. The analysis undertaken by Australia Post showed that in addition to the overall subsidy which Registered Publications receive from other postal services (ie its loss), there were also some cross subsidies within the service eg from fully presorted, lightweight items, travelling short distances, to the heavier unsorted publications travelling long distances. (5) Yes. A commercial assessment of moving publications away from the Registered Publications service to a new cost based service was undertaken. It showed that some publications would benefit from a disaggregated charging structure, whilst many who would face increases under such a system would have advertising as a source of income to offset such increases. This led to the conclusion that a phased closure of the Registered Publications service was desirable as well as easing of the restrictions on advertising content. (6) No. Apart from its reserved services, Australia Post has no basis for price discrimination other than on commercial grounds. (7) No. The delivery of Registered Publications is not a service reserved to Australia Post, a statutory community service obligation. Australia Post's community service obligations are defined under S.27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1987. The Act defines Australia Post's obligations to supply a letter service. (8) Yes. Estimates of the cost of community service obligations are included in the Corporation's Annual Reports which are tabled in the Parliament as required under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 (the Act). The cost of fulfilling Australia Post's community service obligations in 1990/91 using the avoidable cost method is estimated at $60 million. (9) Yes. Under section 36 of the Act, Australia Post's Corporate Plan is to contain a statement of strategies and policies that Australia Post is to follow in order to meet its community service obligations. A Corporate Plan for the new triennium beginning in 1992/93 has been approved by the Board and submitted to me as Minister. That Plan contains a statement of the strategies and policies concerning community service obligations. As required by section 43 of the Act, the latest report on the strategies and policies relating to community service obligations will be included in Australia Post's 1991/92 Annual Report. (10) Strategies for reducing the costs of community service obligations are linked to Australia Post's core commercial strategies and policies, including labour and total factor productivity. Therefore, strategies to improve the efficiennetwork cy of the postal service as a whole, and efficiency in the delivery of community service obligations, are set out in the Corporate Plan for the next triennium which has been approved by the Board and submitted to me as Minister. As 'a direct consequence of the pursuit of efficiency objectives, the costs of operating the business improve and, with that, the scope for reducing the cost of meeting its community service obligations increases while service quality is maintained or improved. (11) Australia Post uses conventional accounting techniques to determine direct costs and to attribute indirect costs. (12) Australia Post has investigated both general cost control and specific access restriction measures with a view to improving the profitability of the Registered Publications service. In 1989, it imposed a $5 cover price limit and tighter eligibility conditions for certain publications produced by businesses. I (13) Yes. Given that the distribution of publications is highly competitive, details of the contracts nor is it are commercially confidential. Agreements have only been made with major customers where there has been a commercial advantage in doing so. Port Kembla and Newcastle Ports: Rail Services (Question No. 1557) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: (1) To what extent and with what outcome was consideration given at the Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting in Auckland on 10 April 1992 to the matters raised in part (1) of his answer to question No. 1271 (Hansard, 25 February 1992, page 182). (2) Have the Australian Government and the New South Wales Government discussed the operation of rail services by the National Rail Corporation Limited for the haulage of coal to Port Kembla, NSW, and Newcastle. ' MrRobert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Industry Commission report on Rail Transport was considered at the Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting on 10 April 1992. Ministers noted that the Prime Minister's letter of 26 February 1992 to State Premiers indicated that one of the conditions to be met before Commonwealth funding of the' $454m upgrade of the standard gauge intercapital rail was a commitment from each State to accelerate reform of its rail system, including early adoption of the relevant recommendations from the Industry Commission's 1991 Report on the Rail Industry. The Industry Commission Report was also considered at the Heads of Government meeting on 11 May 1992. The leaders agreed that further rail reform is required if the significant potential economic gains are to be realised. They noted that a number of the Commission's recommendations were consistent with measures already adopted by the States, but that there was still considerable scope for increasing rail efficiency. Th- Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia agreed 'to continue to pursue and accelerate reform of their rail systems over the next three years. The Federal Government issued its own response to the Industry Commission Report on 31' July 1992. As part of that response it was noted that the Federal Government will pursue with the State Governments the cof\1lllitments given by State Premiers at the 11 May 1992 Heads of Government meeting to accelerate reform of their rail systems over the next three years. It is proposed that a review will be held in eighteen months time to assess States' progress. . (2) No. The National Rail Corporation (NRC) was set up on commercial lines to make its own business decisions. It is a matter for the Board of the NRC to decide which particular rail services are operated. The NRC was established to carry interstate freight and I understand that the Board regards this as its core activity. Australian Wool Corporation (Question No. 1603) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 27 May 1992: (1) Were Coopers and Lybrand responsible for organising the recent annual general meeting of the Australian Wool Corporation; if so, what sum did they receive for their services. (2) Were there any irregularities in the allocation of, proxy votes at the meeting referred to in part (1); if so, who designed the system which allowed the irregularities to occur. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Coopers and Lybrand were not responsible for organising the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). Coopers and Lybrand were appointed to scrutinise and count the ballots cast at the meeting. I am informed that as at 17 August 1992 the Coopers and Lybrand account has not been finalised. (2) The AWC has informed me that the Corporation is unaware of any irregularity in the actual allocation of proxy votes. However, two allegations of irregularity relating to proxies have arisen. The first allegation was that ballot papers had been given to proxy holders on the day of the AGM without lodgement of the approved form at least seven days before the meeting. However the AWC concluded that the persons concerned were voting as authorised representatives of companies and partnerships rather than proxy holders. While the relevant regulations prescribe procedures for recognising proxy voters, the position of representatives of non-natural persons entitled to vote at the meeting is governed by the general law. For thi$ reason, the AWC took the view that it could provide ballot papers to a person who, on the day of the AGM, was able to' establish his or her credentials either as an authorised representative named by the relevant wool-tax payer in the registration application form or appointed by the tax-payer in substitution for that representative. The second allegation related to whether proxy appointments lodged by facsimile were proxies lodged in the approved form as set out in the legislation. Both the AWC and Coopers and Lybrand obtained legal advice on the question and accepted the facsimile appointments on the basis of that advice. I am presently considering amendrilents to the Australian Wool Corporation Regulations to specifically allow receipt of proxies by facsimile and to restrict the nomination of tax-payers' authorised representatives to the period within which proxy appointments may be lodged. The procedures relating to the meeting were based on those which have been used by the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation at all seven Annual General Meetings held by that Corporation. Research and Development Projects (Question No. 1688) Mr MCGauran ,asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) What research or research and development projects have (a) public sector research organisations and (b) university research groups undertaken for the Minister's Department since 1983. (2) What was the (a) dollar value and (b) term of each project identified in part (1). (3) Was each project identified in part (1) satisfactorily completed against the criteria initially established for evaluating outcomes. (4) What, in summary, were the objectives of each project. (5) Was each project put to open tender; if not, was the prospect of the project being undertaken by private bodies evaluated; if so, how. (6) Have any projects been undertaken through the private sector since 1983; if so, what was the dollar value of each project. (7) Will further projects be undertaken through the public sector; if so, in each case (a) what, in summary, is its objective and (b) will an open tender be sought. Mr Beddall-I have been advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (6) The Department of Administrative Services did not exist in its present form prior to July 1987. In respect of the period from 1987-88 to date, much of the information sought by the honourable member is contained in the annual reports of the Department, notably the appendices to these reports detailing individual consultancies. These appendices are available from the Department on request. The Minister for Administrative Services is not prepared to authorise the considerable time and resources which would be entailed in collating the required information in the precise fonn sought by the honourable member. If the honourable member requires information on specific projects it will be provided. (7) While it is not possible to forecast what research or research and development projects the Department might commission in the future, current Departmental instructions for procuring goods and services for a project are outlined in Commonwealth Procurement Guideline, No. 10, Benchmarks for Procurement Decisions. These Guidelines state that the choice of procurement method for a project is influenced by the extent of effective competition available; the volume and character of the services or supplies required; and the need to achieve value for money. Detenninants of the choice include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the requirement, quantity, time-frame, administration and purchasing costs. To meet these requirements a variety of procurement techniques, including public tendering, may be utilised. Screw-worm Fly (Question No. 1697) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) Has it been estimated recently that a screw wonn fly outbreak in northern Australia during the wet season could kill over 90 per cent of calves and more than 30 per cent of cows. (2) Is Australia the only country with a tropical climate that remains free of screw wonn fly. (3) Will the Government immediately approve funds to build a screw wonn fly research facility in Malaysia. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, it is not correct that a recent estimate of a screwwonn fly outbreak in the Wet in northern Australia could kill 90 per cent of calves and 30 per cent of cows. However, at a meeting convened recently by Queensland Department of Primary Industries (QDPI) experts with representatives of the Queensland cattle industry as part of a consequence modelling project being funded by my Department under the Screwwonn Fly strategy, it was estimated that 90 per cent of calves and 30 per cent of cows that were struck by the screwwonn fly may die if not treated. The QDPI have advised that the estimate of deaths for screwwonn fly struck calves has since been revised to 80 pet cent. These figures are estimates based on the scientific literature from overseas, most of which relates to a similar but different screwwonn fly, Cochlyomia hominovorax, the New World Screwwonn Fly, found in the central and south Americas. As the screwwonn fly nearest Australia, Chrysomya bezziana, the Old World Screwwonn Fly, has fortunately never occurred in Australia it is not possible to accurately determine the level of livestock deaths that may occur in the event of an outbreak. (2) Australia is one of the few countries with a tropical climate that is free of screwwonn fly. The Old World Scr:ewwonn Fly is present across tropical Africa, in the Middle East and in south and south east Asia as far as Papua New Guinea. It does not occur further east in the Pacific island nations. The New World Screwwonn Fly is present in central America south of Mexico and tropical South America. It has been eradicated from the southern United States of America and Mexico, although there have been recent reports of isohited reinfestations in parts of Mexico. The only occurrence of the New World Screwwonn Fly establishing outside the Americas was in 1988 when it was introduced into Libya. Subsequently, an international eradication program controlled by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation successfully eliminated the infestation. Libya was again declared free of the New World Screwwonn Fly on 22 June 1992. (3) The Government has provided $2.434 million in the budget for the construction and equipping of the proposed pilot facility in Malaysia. As well, we will continue to fund the other on-going aspects of the SWF strategy, which will amount to $228,000 in 1992-93. Motor Vehicles: SES and Senior Officers (Question No. 1724) Mr Downer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: What are the costs associated with providing parking for (a) SES vehicles and (b) senior officers. Mr Beddall-I have been advised that in relation to the Administrative Services portfolio during the period 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992 the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (a) $115,162.00 (b) $171,906.00 Supportive Wage Package (Question No. 1735) Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: (1) Will the introduction of the supportive wage package affect the (a) eligibility of blind and vision-impaired persons to receive the disability support pension and (b) level of payments received by eligible persons under the Disability Support Pension Scheme. (2) What is the anticipated annual cost of the supportive wage package and how will it be funded. (3) How many persons are expected to be employed under the supportive wage scheme.",142
243,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) As announced in the 1992-93 Budget wage arrangements for people with disabilities to improve their employment prospects in the open labour market will be further developed. Details of elements of the system will not be finalised until further consultations have been held with interested parties. However, and vision impaired persons to qualify for disability support pension on an income test free basis will not be affected. Pensioners: Telephone Allowance (Question No. 1756)",148
244,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: Are some pensioners who do not have telephones receiving the telephone rental allowance; if so, (a) how many and (b) at what cost.",148
245,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Telephone allowance replaced the Telephone Rental Concession scheme from 1 July 1992. The former scheme was not covered by legislation, so no obligation could be placed on clients to notify changes in telephone subscriber status. However, a check of status was undertaken by the Department in situations such as change of address. With the enactment of the legislation for telephone allowance, a requirement for clients to advise Social Security if they cease to be a telephone subscriber was included in the advice to clients with the first payment of telephone allowance. Following this, a number. of clients advised that they were no longer telephone subscribers. Payment of telephone allowance to these clients has been stopped. (a) Sampling of the pensions database indicates that, since 1 July 1992, approximately 8300 clients have notified that their telephone subscriber status has changed. Most of the clients would not have been telephone subscribers on 1 July 1992. (b) On the assumption that none of the clients referred to in (a) was eligible for telephone allowance on 1 July 1992, the cost of paying these clients the first instalment of telephone allowance was around $O.lm. The cost of a complete update of clients' records of telephone subscriber status by data collection would have been at least $1.5m. Pensioners and Social Security Beneficiaries (Question No. 1765) Mr Andrews asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: Has his Department provided any Member of Parliament with a list of persons receiving pensions or other social security benefits in the Member's electorate; if so, which Members have been provideligibility of blind ed with details.",148
246,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The confidentiality provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 make it a serious criminal offence for an officer of the Department of Social Security to disclose personal information about clients of the Department unless the disclosure has been authorised. No disclosure of this kind has been authorised. It follows that the Department has not provided such a list. If the honourable member has any information suggesting that such a list has been provided, he should give that information to the Australian Federal Police for investigation of a possible offence against Commonwealth law. Airport Terminals: Smoking Bans (Question No. 1774) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: (1) Was the Minister involved in the decision by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) to ban smoking in its airport terminals from 1 July 1992; if so, what are the details. (2) What persons or organisations were consulted before the ban was announced. (3) Were the by-laws relating to the ban notified in the Gazette on 22 July 1992; if so, was the ban enforceable between 1 and 22 July 1992. (4) Is he able to say whether a total ban is applied in airport terminals overseas; if so, which terminals. (5) Have provisions been made for (a) transit passengers travelling for several hours and (b) passengers delayed by flight postponements or industrial disputes; if not, why not. (6) Since the ban was enforced how many persons have been (a) warned and (b) fined. (7) Will the Minister consider the provision of segregated areas for smokers at airport terminals controlled by the PAC. (8) If the PAC applied the ban before it was legally enforceable, .on what basis did it do so.",148
247,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Federal Airports Corporation (pAC): (1) No. The decision to ban smoking in all PAC terminals was taken by the Board of the PAC. (2) The PAC consulted the three main airlines affected by the ban, Qantas, Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia. In addition, the Corporation advised all airport tenants and airlines using its airports. (3) PAC By-law No 1 1992 was notified in the Gazette on 22 July 1992. The By-law was not enforceable (or enforced) between 1 July and 22 July 1992. , (4) The decision to ban smoking in airport terminals was based on domestic factors and conditions. Practice at other airports with different domestic factors and conditions was not considered. (5) The ban on smoking is a total ban in all parts of pAc airport terminals. The Corporation's policy, prior to 1 July 1992 of designating zones and relying on the goodwill of patrons was not observed by smokers, particularly in areas where they were in close proximity to non-smokers, such as check-in and disembarkation points, d-parture lounges, baggage collection and concourse areas. Complaints were regularly received about smoke drifting into non-smoking areas. The PAC did investigate the option of providing designated smoking facilities. However, the effective protection of non-smokers, particularly airport staff, from the possible hazards of passive smoking required the installation of isolation air-conditioning at unacceptable costs. In view of these factors, the PAC decided that the most effective approach was to apply a total smoking ban. No provisions have been made for (a) transit passengers or (b) passengeJ:S delayed By postponements or industrial disputes. Pew passengers have transits of several hours and delays through postponements or industrial disputes where passengers cannot leave the terminal are infrequent. (6) (a) & (b) The Corporation's staff are currently under instruction to implement the By-law by passive means and smokers are politely asked to refrain from smoking in the terminal. Both air travellers and visitors to the terminals have reacted cooperatively to this approach. The PAC has not recorded the number of persons who have been asked to refrain from smoking. However, as at 28 August 92, no fines have been issued. (7) The provision of segregated areas for smokers at airport terminals was considered and rejected by the Board of the PAC due to; the potential hazards of passive smoking, especially to airport staff; and the costs of providing isolation air-conditioning. (8) PAC did not seek to apply any provisions of the By-law before it was legally enforceable.",149
