Mr HUGHES'-On Thursday last the honorablo member for Bourke, referring to the administration of my Department with regard to the metal interests, made statements which are inaccurate and misleading. According to the Hansard report he said (page 1163)Tho other day there appeared in Dunn's Gazette a notice of the reconstitution of the Electrolytic Smelters. The names of Seigfried Hirsch and Frank Snow appear as foundation directors. The facts are these: A paragraph appeared in Dunn's Gazette of l l t h June last, and in the Labour Call of the 12th July, drawing attention to the registration in Victoria of the Electrolytic Comjpany of Victoria, and the alleged enemy interests in the company. There are, however, no enemy shareholders in this pany. Hirsch held shares in it , hut two not ready for circulation ibhis years ago the company compulsorily rebut tired him , and the shares were purchased by local copper companies, the proceeds deal being paid to the Public Trustee. The morrow. company also came to an arrangement under which Snow sold his shares and cancelled his contract with the company. The icompany was registered in New South Wales in 1907, and decided, June of this year, to register in Victoria, when the original .articles of association, containing at the foot the names of Hirsch and Snow, as holding one share each, were inadvertently attached to the application for registration. The honourable member for Bourke is reported to have said, also (Mansard, page 1163)The Prime Minister, while tal'kng about cutting out the cancer of German trade, diately opened Abe door so that the Union Bank could open up negotiations with the Hirsch Company through America. There is no foundation for that statement. At the outbreak of war Hirsch and Son had some 35,000 tons of zinc and lead conpared centrates stored at Port Pirie, on which the Union Bank had advanced £70,000. All the leadies, amounting to about 2,043 tons, were sold by permission of the Commonwealth Government to the Associated Smelters, and the resultant lead was sold to the Ministry of Munitions. The zinc concentrates have not been allowed to be dealt with, as their sale would interfere with the current production of Australian mines, which have a large uninform disposed of accumulation. The only tiation permitted with the American agents of Hirsch was in relation to the payment of Snow's overdraft. Ifc was expressly stipulated that no consent to any dealing with the concentrates was implied, and that no arrangements could citizens ? be entered into without the consent of the Attorney-General. What has been done in these matters has been wholly in teered. the interest of Australia and of the E pire. WAR - TI ME PROFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL .",4
2,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the Treasurer read the speeches of honourable members on War-time Profits Assessment Bill , if so, is he in a position to let the House know what amendments he intends to pose to that Bill?",5
3,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I am sorry comthat the notices of the amendments are - afternoon, I hope that they will be distributed during the day. We shall not be able to with .the Bill in Committee .uaitil to- ' NA ENGLAND,",5
4,Mr WEST,STATE REPRESENTATIONI N,"Has the Prime Minister in seen a telegram from London giving a report of a meeting between the Agents General and the Premier of New South Wales, which seems to ' show that they are endeavouring to create strife 'between the States and the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the existence of the war? I ask the righ t honourable gentleman if he is prepared to take advantage of his powers under the W a r Precautions Act immeto deal with these gentlemen?",5
5,Mr HUGHES,STATE REPRESENTATIONI N,"My attention has Aaron been directed to the paragraph in question, and I may say, for the information of the public of Australia and of the States, that the Commonwealth is preto resist to the bitter end any attempt to encroach upon its prerogatives. INDUSTRIAL CRISIS. NA - POLICE TRAINING-POR T AUGUST A TO KALGOORLIE RAILWAY : CONVEYANCE OF PERISHABLE PRODUCE-COMMONWEALT H INTERVENTION.",5
6,Mr MATHEWS,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,"The newspapers us that there are youthful giants - negoof mighty physique in the volunteer camps of loyalist workers_which are being formed. I ask the Prime Minister why these men have not enlisted to fight against"" the common enemy of their country instead of against their fellow",5
7,Mr HUGHES,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,"I do not know why any person of militarv age has not volunOn ithe 28th October last I m - placed at the disposal of the people an ample and sufficient remedy against this failure of duty, but they, refused fco accept it . '",5
8,Mr WEST,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,"Can the Prime Minister tell me by whose orders the police of the New South Wales are being; trained in and, the use of guns with fixed bayonets?",5
9,Mr HUGHES,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,I do not know that prothey are being so trained. No information on ithe subject has reached me.,5
10,Mr HEITMANN,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,"In view of the in terference with trade between the eastern States and Western Australia, and the shortage of supplies which is likely to occur in Western Australia by reason of this interference, will the Minister for Works and Railways take into, consideration the possibility of transporting butter and other perishable produce over the transcontinental railway ?",6
11,Mr WATT,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,"At the request of some Western Australians, I have been giving attention to that proposal, but at present there are many difficulties in the way of it being carried out. The gap between rail heads yesterday was about 48 miles, and I do not think that there aire conveyances there to bridge it . When the ends of the line approach nearer, I shall be glad to see if the Department can cope with the matter..",6
12,Mr BRENNAN,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,"L as t week I asked the Prime Minister a question as to the possibility of the aid of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court being obtained by voluntary action on the part of the contesting parties in the present great strike in New South Wales? The right honourable gentleman said that he would consider the question. I now ask what are the results of his deliberation and whether he has anything to announce to the House as to the possibility of the assistance of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court being invoked, by consent, or by the operation of the War Precautions Act , in connection with the great industrial upheaval ?",6
13,Mr HUGHES,VOLUNTEER WORKERS OF MILITARYAG E,"The honourable member has omitted to state that on the day on which. I answered his question, I said, in reply to an inquiry, thab the Commonwealth Government would not in tervene - I may say, however, that the case, in general and in particular, was stated to Mr H all , Attorney General of New South Wales, and myself, by a deputation from the Melbourne Trades H all and the unions concerned, including the Railway Unions of both New South Wales and Victoria. I informed the deputation that we could not, and would not, interfere unless the Government of New South Wales was willing that we should do so. Mr H all said that the Government of New South Wales would not accept the intervention of any party in this dispute, and he gave reasons which, I think, are amply sufficient. In any case, that is the attitude of the Government. NA WORKS. ADVANC E OF £500,000 BY BRITIS H GOVERNMENT.",6
14,Mr GREGORY,ESTABLISHMENT OE SPELTE R,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have received £500,000, or any proportion thereof, from the British Government, as an advance towards the establishment of spelter works in Australia. If so, has there been any allocation of the amount ?",6
15,Mr HUGHES,ESTABLISHMENT OE SPELTE R,"I do not think we have yet received any proportion of the amount. I may say, for the information of the House and of those particularly in terested, that the £500,000 mentioned was an integral part of an agreement between the British Government and the Commonwealth Government, as represented by myself in London, in regard to the disposal of zinc concentrates, zinc, and spelter. That agreement falls under two headings, one, the dealing in Great B r it a in with a certain proportion of zinc concentrates mined in Australia, and the other dealing with electrolytic and other zinc made in Australia from Australian concentrates. The advance of £500,000 is towards the establishment of works in Australia to treat spelter electrolytically under that contract. ""So far as I know, we have not yet received any portion of it . SALE OF ENEMY GOODS. NA RETAILERS.",6
16,Mr TUDOR,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,"A b o u t ten or twelve months ago there appeared in the press a statement to the effect that the Government had issued a notice requiring that all goods which had been made in enemy countries, and were held by warehousemen in the Commonwealth, should be disposed of before a certain date, and that all such goods held by retailers should be disposed of within a subsequent date, which was named. I am aware that it was found necessary to extend the time l i m it for the disposal of these goods, but I should like to ask the Prime Minister what was the eventual outcome of the notification, and whether any order, or regulation under the War Precautions Act, dealing with the matter has been issued?",6
17,Mr HUGHES,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,"Such a notification was issued to the trade. It was found, however, that it imposed a complete prohibition on the Wholesale houses. The retail houses would not take the goods at all, since, as they would have to get rid of them before their due date, the wholesale houses would escape their liability, leaving ihe retailers to carry the whole burden: The consequence was that no business was done. At the end of the period fixed, these - goods still remained in the wholesale houses. Tihe Government considered this matter very carefully. After all, the goods had been paid for by the wholesale firms, and unless we were prepared "" to say that these firms, who had bought in good faith long before the war started, were to be fined anything from £100,000 to £300,000-n o one could say what the amount would be-w e were compelled to accept the position that, desirable as this prohibition might theoretically be, in practice it could not be enforced without imposing great hardship upon one section of the community. WAR-PENSIONS.",6
18,Mr KELLY,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,"The Government regard a widow who has lost a son at the Front as having an absolute right to a pension, irrespective of her circumstances. J should like to ask the Treasurer whether he will take into immediate consideration the question of extending the right pf a pension to mothers of dead soldiers, who, owing to special circumstances, cannot obtain maintenance orders by legal process against their husbands. To illustrate my question I should like to explain that I have a constituent whose husband is in England, and who has lost two sons on service. She is persistently regarded by the right honourable gentleman's Department as not being a widow for the purposes of the Act since legally she has a husband, against - whom, however, she can have no redress.",7
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,"I would ask the honourable member to give notice of his question. The whole matter as to those persons who should have an absolute right to a pension, irrespective of their circumstances, was thoroughly threshed out when the War Pensions Bill was before the House, and the law as it stands was passed. I shall be very glad to look into the case mentioned iby the honourable member if he will furnish me with the par'ticulars.",7
20,Mr KELLY,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,"I have been working at it for months. This lady has no Teal resources, and has lost both her sons at the Front.",7
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,I suppose the fact is that she is a married woman and not a widow ?,7
22,Mr KELLY,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,Sh e is not married for the purpose of maintenance.,7
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,If the honourable member will give notice of the question I shall deal with the matter. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. PROMPT ATTENTION TO SOLDIERS' GRIEVANCES.,7
24,Dr MALONEY,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,"I have had a very pleasant experience of the attention given by the branch of the Defence Department which, under Major Isaacson, has the duty of inquiring into the grievances of soldiers. In oomplimenting Senator Pearce, or whoever has appointed that officer, I desire to ask whether, if need be, this branch, under a man who is sympathetic to the people who go there, will be kept up to date, and carried on as at present, when the claims and grievances become mulch greater than they are now?",7
25,Mr GROOM,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,I shall submit the honourable member's suggestion to the Minister of Defence for his consideration. NORTHERN TERRITORY: PAPER. EXPENDITURE AND SETTLEMENT.,7
26,Mr GLYNN,NOTICE TO WAREHOUSEMEN AN D,"Some time ago the honourable member for Franklin asked whether I would make a statement regarding the conditions of the Northern Territory, in connection with the growth of expenditure and settlement. I now beg to lay on the table a memorandum dealing with the subject. Ordered to be printed. NA WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",7
27,Mr FOWLER,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Seeing that Western Australia is entirely dependent on the Eastern States for certain classes of foodstuffs, are the Government taking any step, or do they propose to take any, to maintain the shipping service with that State ?",7
28,Mr HUGHES,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The Government are quite aware of the position of Western Australia, and have given consideration to the matter. We propose to take all the steps open to us to maintain communication. GERMAN DRUGS: ASPIRIN.",7
29,Mr FENTON,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Some time ago there was a rule that aspirin and other German the table? drugs and 'secret processes were not allowed to be manufactured by chemists unless they received the approval of the Commonwealth Analyst. It is now stated that any chemist, without restriction, may manufacture these goods. that true or not?",8
30,Mr HUGHES,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"That is true. the new regulation, or cancellation of the old one, whichever it was, no man could manufacture aspirin except by licence, and the licence was issued to one person only, a man named Nicholas. duction was analyzed by Mr . who pronounced it to be of excellent quality. He has had the ru of the market for eighteen months deavoured or two years; and I take it that he has been able to do one of two vernment things-eithe r prove that he can make a good article or the reverse. made a good article, Nicholas' aspirin sell, and chemists will not buy such an of article on speculation from any one else. Anybody can make aspirin and anybody can take it , but, while that is so, it is a fact now, as it was before the war, that people prefer to take a drug about which they know something. In my opinion there is ample safeguard now, and chemI ists will not buy, nor doctors order, a that is inferior. REPATRIATION : LAND FOR SOLDIERS.",8
31,Mr RODGERS,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"When the Repatriation Bill was introduced in another place, the Minister indicated that the question of land settlement was to be passed on depends on circumstances. to the States; and the States, particularly Victoria, are now wrestling with patriation Bills. Will the Minister us when we shall have an opportunity of dealing with the parent Bill , so that the States may know how they stand in the matter?",8
32,Mr GROOM,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The Repatriation Bill is on the business-paper now, and its conentitled to some return. sideration will be resumed as soon as shall possible. EXPORT OF BOTTLES.",8
33,Mr LECKIE,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,Is the Minister f Trade and Customs aware that the recent removal of the embargo on the export of bottles is playing into the hands of Bottle Combine of Australia; and will he place the file in connection therewith on,8
34,Mr JENSEN,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Yes ; I shall have mueh pleasure in doing so. HOUSE RENTS. Is Dr MALONEY - - In view of the loss of population, according to Knibbs'' StatisU n t i l tics, wherein Victoria is shown to have lost nearly half of the net loss between the years of 1914 and 1916, will the Prime Minister bring under the consideration of the Cabinet the necessity of dealing with His prothe unjustifiable raising of rents in MelWilkinson, bourne and other cities?",8
35,Mr HUGHES,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"This question appears n to come up frequently; and I have ento show how difficult it is to regulate rents. Interference by the Gois inadvisable unless it is likely to t>e effective and of benefit to the geneI f he has ral community. I cannot, for the life of will me, see how, without creating machinery a complex, difficult, and i r r it at in g kind-w e can find any effectual check against this attempt on the part of certain landlords to exploit the community. And I put this to the honourable member, to the House, and the country generally: f a man improve his premises, is he not drug to have anything more iby way of return?",8
36,Dr MALONEY,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,Giv e him a percentage on the expenditure.,8
37,Mr HUGHES,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"V e r y well; but the difficulty.is that we cannot do that by regulation in the same way as we may f i x the price of bread, sugar, or meat. There is no fixed price for a house; all A house today may the 10 miles away from Rea tramway or railway, and when a tell train or tram is brought to the dooi the rent goes up. Unless we take the unearned increment by taxation, rents will go up, and we cannot stop them. If a man adds another wing, or paints and otherwise improves his premises, he is However, I consider the matter from the standpoint of the protection of the great masses of the people.",8
38,Mr TUDOR,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Is the Prime Minister o r aware that some house agents, when a woman seeks to rent a house, ask her if she is the wife of a soldier, and, if she the is, refuse to let her the premises ?",8
39,Mr HUGHES,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,Why ? What is reason ?,9
40,Mr TUDOR,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I can give no reason, except that the agents say that if once soldiers' wives get into premises they cannot turn them out again.",9
41,Mr HUGHES,SHIPPING COMMUNICATION WIT H,"What is the use of asking me a question of that sort? First of all, how can I prove that such a thing is ever done? Unless I am to ascertain what is the motive at the bottom of such action, how can there be any possible exception taken to it? It might be said that agents would not allow clergymen's widows or wives, or even politicians' widows or wives, to go into their houses ; and that, of course, would be absolutely intolerable to every right thinking man in the community. If the honourable member will bring before me a case in which any agent or person refuses a house to a soldier's wife for the reason that she is a soldier's wife, I shall endeavour to find some means of dealing with him.

Mr ""WATT (for Mr Webster) - The answer to the honourable member's quest i o n is as f o l l o w s : The matter of residents rendering assistance in cases where they desire to secure the establishment of a public telephone is already covered by telephone regulation 47 (6 ) , the latter portion of which reads as follows:Regulation 47 (6) . . . . where the estimated revenue is less than the required amount, public telephones will be opened upon a guarantee being given by the persons concerned to pay annually to the Postmaster-General the difference between the actual revenue and the required revenue.

If so, has he qualified according to regulations for the rank which he holds? 3. If the answer is "" No "" to question 2(a) Why was Brigadier-General MCC. Anderson granted the rank which he holds; (6) what lawful authority was there for disregarding the regulations governing the granting of commissioned rank in the Australian Forces? 4. Is there any precedent in the Imperial Army for the granting of rank similar to that granted to Brigadier-General MCC. Anderson, and what are the names of the oflicer or officers who have created the precedent?",11
61,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The answers to the h o n orable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Yes. 2. He has qualified for the substantive rank which he holds in the Australian M i l it a r y Forces, which is that of captain. He has not qualified for any higher rank; but on being selected for the appointment of Deputy Quartermaster-General, Australian Imperial Force, Head-quarters, Egypt, it was considered the rank of Colonel was suitable for the duties which he was required to perform. Subsequently on being appointed Commandant, Australian Imperial Force, Head-quarters, London, he was granted the . temporary rank of Brigadier-General, which was justified by the duties which he performed. 3. Sec answer to question 2. 4. There is a precedent for the granting of such rank in the British Army, as instance that of Brigadier-General Sir A. C. Geddes, KC.B., who was an Honorary Lieutenant in the Army at the outbreak of war, and was since appointed to the position of Director of Recruiting at the War Office, and granted the temporary rank of Brigadier-General.

Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [ 3 . 4 0 ] - I moveTliat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue and moneys be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to authorize the raising of moneys to be loaned to and the advancing of moneys to certain States. Honourable members are no doubt aware that under an agreement made on the 6th November, 1915, between the Commonwealth and all the States except New South Wales, the Commonwealth agreed, on certain conditions, to borrow, for State requirements, £8,940,000 to the 31st December, 1915, and after that date £7,450,000 per annum until one year after the termination of the war. At the Premiers' Conference in January last, that agreement was modified; the Commonwealth agreed to borrow £5,400,000 for 1917 instead of £7,450,000, the States being at liberty to raise a certain amount, under stipulated conditions, in Australia. On 30th May of last year, this Parliament agreed to an Act authorizing the raising and lending to the States of £8,940,000. The whole of that amount was required for the calendar year 1916. For the current calendar year we have to provide the States with £5,400,000, of which all we have had - to find up to the present time is £1,560,000, leaving a balance £3,840,000 to be made available to the States before the end of bhis year. The States are very anxious to get this money, and in order to facilitate the giving of effect to the arrangement we are asking Parliament to agree to this appropriation of £8,000,000, which will be sufficient to fulfil our obligations to the States for 1917 and for the first half-year of 1918.",11
62,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Does the Treasurer propose to sefc off that money against what the States already owe?,12
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"There are two distinct agreements. One agreement is on the part of the Commonwealth to raise this money, and .the other is on the part of the States to repay what they owe to the Commonwealth.",12
64,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Will the States do their share ? ,12
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I shall try to get some of the money.,12
66,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,What chance have you got?,12
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Ver y little, I am afraid, because the States are not able to pay it . Their poverty, and not their will, is at fault. This appropriation is quite a formal matter, and / I ask the Committee to agree to it .",12
68,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Capricornia) [3.46] - I am very glad that the majority of the States have joined with the Commonwealth in this financial arrangement. It is a great pity that the Government of New South Wales did not enter into it too. The Premier of New South Wales is at present in the Old Country, experiencing, no doubt, very great difficulty in trying to make his financial arrangements independent of the Commonwealth. I rose particularly for the purpose of drawing attention to the inconsistency of the attitude of the Treasurer. Three or four weeks ago he made a statement that any money which he raised this year for the States was to be credited to them as part payment of money they owe to the Commonwealth. The right honourable gentleman has shown his good sense by backing down from that attitude. I suppose we must not take too much notice of what the Treasurer says. He invited us the other day to inform him of the amendments we proposed to move in a certain Bill.",12

70,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Du e notice has been given of a series of amendments. The Treasurer, - was to reciprocate by letting us know the amendments which he will propose, but he has broken his promise. However, the Treasurer has shown wisdom in altering his attitude towards the States. The latter need this money in order to carry out their commitments. They have undertaken to carry out public works, and if they were deprived of this money there would be a great deal of unemployment throughout the States. I have pleasure in supporting the motion.",12
71,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Wilmot ) [3.48] - It is very satisfactory to find that the Treasurer is not going to press the States in the manner that seemed likely about two months ago. He then informed us that he proposed to repay the Commonwealth, out of moneys which the States expect to receive during this current year, certain sums that are due from them to the Commonwealth. I am glad that he is not taking that course, because, owing to the war, the States are finding great difficulty in raising money, just as the Commonwealth experiences difficulty in raising loans for other than war purposes. Had the Treasurer adhered to his original intention he would have inflicted a great deal of hardship on the States. The State authorities deal with the same taxpayers as are controlled by the Commonwealth authorities, and the people of Australia would have been penalized had the action that - was then contemplated been taken. I am glad to learn that it is not going to be taken, and that the Treasurer intends to make every effort to assist the States,",12
72,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Yarra) [3.51] -""What is now proposed to be done is to enable the States to borrow more money than they could have borrowed under the agreement entered into in November, 1915. Under that agreement, they were to be free to borrow £7,450,000 in 1917. Now it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall borrow £5,400,000 this year on their behalf, but they will still be at liberty to borrow in Australia £4,332,000 more, or £9,732,000 altogether.",13
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,The amount which could be borrowed in Australia is the same in both cases.,13
74,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"We were told months ago, by members now occupying the M in isterial benches, that the whole energies of Australia must be devoted to the winning of the war. I pointed out that the public works of the country had to be carried o n ; bu t some of those opposite, when candidates for election, told the people that they would curtail public expenditure-in other words, that they would create unemployment to compel men to enlist,",13
75,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Who said that? The honourable member imagines that statement.,13
76,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I do not. The absolute cessation of public works was proposed. During the Darwin by-election contest, some persons were exercised in mind as to what would be done in regard to local works-as whether the Stanley breakwater and the Burnie breakwater would be discontinued, for instance. The Treasurer now says that he has backed down.",13
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I thought that States would pay.,13

It must be borne in mind that what we are now being asked to condecided sider is not the renewal of loans, but extra borrowing, which will increase public debt of Australia. As a great many loans are now becoming due, hoves us to be careful how we sanction urgently needed here. further borrowing. While there should beno undue curtailment of public exthemselves penditure, we must have regard to our liabilities. In addition to the borrowing of £9,732,000 this year by five of the States^ New South Wales will probably try to borrow between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 on her own account, so that the State indebtedness will be probably increased by afc least £13,000,000. Many persons outside think that the Commonwealth is lending this money to the States for the renewal of loans, but that is not so. The Treasurer should have made a fuller statement regarding the proposal, so that the public might know the exact position.  cording to the Opposition, the Treasurer has made two serious blunders, the first being that he has taken into consideration the requirements of the States; and the second that he has not stood on his dignity, and compelled them to pay back what they have already borrowed from the Commonwealth.",13
79,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I did not say that.  member for Capricornia said it . I should like to know where is the logic of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor), because in one breath he said that the wheels of industry must be kept revolving, and in the next found f a u l t with this proposal to lend money to the States to keep them going. You cannotbave works expenditure unless you provide money for it , and the Treasurer has acted wisely in paying regard to the requirements of the States. Although they borrowed from the Commonwealth on short term loan, it would have disturbed the harmony of the relations between the States and the Commonwealth had the right honourable gentleman compelled them to pay what they are owing to the Commonwealth, or appropriated advances f h e which had been promised to them.",13

The Treasurer told us this afternoon that the motion that he has moved, providing for the lending of about £9,000,000 to the States, is only a formal one. He seemed to expect us to run away and play while the Bill to authorize it was passed through the House. state of things should end. The time is coming when we shall be forced to give more serious attention to finance, because we are heaping loan upon loan.

I would prevent any Premier from hawking the assets of his State through the money market.",14

I am not a "" States' Righter,"" but I do not think that the right This honourable gentleman, when he threatened to deal drastically with the States, could have perused the minutes of the Premiers' Conferences, at which certain arrangements were made prior to his coming into office. His threat was that, as the States owed the Commonwealth £18,000,000, he intended to withhold, in part payment of that indebtedness, a sum of about £7,000,000 which they were due to receive by the 31st December, 1917. Having reconsidered the position, he has arrived at the conclusion that if the Commona wealth were to refuse to advance them any money during 1917 public works would be brought to an absolute stand-still in many, I am if not all, of the States.",14
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,But these bonds are due.,14
90,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"That is quite true. The Treasurer must not forget, however, that we are living in exceptional circumstances. A Conference of State Premiers, which was held in 1916, was attended by comthe honourable member for Capricornia to (Mr Higgs), who was then Treasurer, and at a later Conference, held early in assist1917, the honourable member for Grey  surer of the Commonwealth. It was then My agreed that the Commonwealth should be be the sole borrower for all the States with of the exception of New South Wales. I conbelieve in such an arrangement, and I regret the attitude taken up by the New South Wales Government, which decided to remain outside it. I wish that State harm, but I hope that the Premier of New South Wales (Mr Holman) will be taught such a lesson during his present visit to Great Britain in search of money in that he will be prepared to fall in with, in the agreement. I hope, further, that this agreement, made in .war time, with five out of the six States, will prevail in normal times. The Commonwealth will certainly be able to borrow to better advantage for the six States than any of them, individually, could hope to do, and I understand that financiers in the Old World object to the competition that has hitherto taken place between them. At one of these Conferences of State Premiers it was agreed that the Commonwealth should advance about £9,000,000 to the States. At a subsequent Conference an amended proposal by the Commonwealth to advance £7,000,000 was accepted. !",14
91,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"A sum of £S,940,000 was to be provided under the first agreement. Subsequently that amount was reduced to £7,450,000, and ultimately to £5,400,000.",15

The position was the same in other States, so that, had the Treasurer remained firm, the army of unemployed would have been materially increased. I am glad that this money is now to be provided to enable the prosecution of State developmental works, such as railway construction and water conservation, which will certainly be reproductive. The Treasurer is prepared to allow the States to have this money, and I trust he will not harass them too much for its repayment during war time.",15

96,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"In the present temper of the community no doubt many are prepared to do things which they would hesitate to do in normal times, but I do not think any public man would seriously urge the repudiation of our public debt. I do not think the States will repudiate the debts which they have incurred either directly or through the agency of the Commonwealth, and I trust that even after the war there will be no departure from the arrangement that all loans required by them shall be raised through the Commonwealth.

I would remind the honourable member that Mr Delprat, of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, has said that there are no more efficient and adaptable workmen in the world than are to be found in Australia.

I compliment the Government on their determination to deal as they propose to. do with the States, for I know the position occupied by many of them in relation to public works. I was amused to hear the honourable member for East Sydney warning the Treasurer to be very careful about borrowing in view of the fact that the price of money was going up by leaps and bounds.

If the Treasurer has the money, or the means of finding the money necessary to keep the public works of Australia going, then those works should be pushed on.

Ir1912 I introduced a motion on this question; and, though it was not debated, the present. Treasurer in timated' that a profit of £30,000,000 at least would be made by the Commonwealth on the transfer of the loans from the States. We were backward in taking any steps in this connection, but no one then dreamt of the war. great courtesy from the ex-Prime M in ister (Mr Fisher), who, speaking on my motion, is reported in Hansard of the 20th December, 1912, page 7690, as follows:An appeal from the honourable member that this proposal should be permitted to pass as an abstract motion, and one not binding upon the Government, would influence me more than would an appeal by most honourable members. However, such a motion was not convenient at that time. I brought it before the House on another occasion, but the proposal I then submitted, as shown on page 7689 of Hansard of the same date I have mentioned, was as follows: 1. That, as _Austrnlia's contribution to the Homeland, the Government should be invited to appoint a Commission to visit England with a view of converting the State public debts of Australia into Commonwealth stock. 2. That the Commission should consist of twelve members, five appointed by Commonwealth Parliament (including the High Commissioner)', and six representingand appointed by the States, and a president to be appointed by the Government of the Commonwealth ancl States (to have only one vote). 3. That the Commission should have plenipotentiary authority to enter into ainderwriting arrangements with the leading financial houses. 4. That, concurrently with the issue of he future Commonwealth stock authorized under such arrangements, the holders of the State public debts should bp invited to consent to the acceptance of equivalent Commonwealth stock. 5. That, dependent upon such conversion, the Imperial Government should be assured by the. State Governments, through the Commonwealth Government, that the saving of capital and the annual interest during the next ten years so caused by such conversion shall be devoted to the building of an Imperial Dreadnought Fleet in Great Britain for protecting the trades routes of the Empire, thus assuring the food supply of the United Kingdom and also the safety of the exported produce of our Australian farmers. I said that £25,000,000 then would have been saved, but I was wrong, because, after information proved clearly that the saving would amount to £50,000,000: If my motion had been accepted, even only as an abstract proposition, it might have done something to prevent the present war. Germany would have been bound to take some notice if the Commonwealth offered a g if t of £50,000,000 to the British Government, and it would have had the effect of ensuring theopen roadways of the British Empire. As I then pointed out, the heart of the Empire is in London, and if London falls so does every place where the British flag flies. An offer of £50,000,000 from a Democracy- a child of the Empire, thab even now does not I received consist of more than 5,000,000 peoplewould have made Germany ponder. And would not the farmers of this country have blessed the Parliament for keeping the roads of the Empire free and open ? We should have been able to send away this wheat which we are allowing the mice and the rains to destroy to an extent representing millions of bushels. Further, men cannot handle the wheat without the risk of a beastly disease, which is carried into their homes; and if we once allow that horror of the East-the plague-to gain a hold, God only knows what the end will be. As I have said, if it were not a time of war I would object to this Bill ; but this is not a stage at which to show any factious opposition, even to a Bill like this. I find considerable difficulty in proceeding, owing to the conversation going on amongsthonorable members present; and, in any case, I think there ought to be a quorum present -\Quoru m form-ed]What have the States already borrowed from the Commonwealth? New South Wales, according to the last monthly summary of Mr Knibbs, has borrowed £8,205,624, and the interest charge, is 3j(per cent. Victoria has borrowed some £6,000,000 at from 3 to 5 | per cent., while Queensland, which, to its honour, is the least offender-and , strange to say, it is the only State at present ruled by a Labour Government - has borrowed £2,125,000 at the highest rate of 5J per cent. The other States are paying only - from 2 to 5£ per cent. Why should Queensland be paying 5£ per cent., whereas . the highest New South Wales pays is 4£ per cent. ? Western Australia has borrowed £5,438,505 , and the rate of interest runs from 3§ to 5J per cent. Tasmania has borrowed £1,876,000, and the rate of interest runs from 33 per cent, to 5£ per cent. I am sure that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) will agree with me that it is not fair that Tasmania should pay a higher raie of interest than Victoria or New South Wales is paying ab the present moment. I would like to have the attention of the honourable member for a moment, but he appears to be too busily engaged with the Government Whip.

110,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"That statement absolutely incorrect. I I would use a stronger word.

On the other hand, there is no claim upon the gold resented serve of the Commonwealth excepting the notes.

115,Mr LAIR DSMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I rise to a point of n - order. What connection has the franchise us of Great Britain with this Loan Bill ?,18
116,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS, It is customary to allow latitude in debating a measure of this nature.,19
117,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"1 was about to point out, when interrupted by the point of order on which the Temporary Chairman has ruled so wisely, that the Home Land could not exist for six weeks if its highways and fdodways were not kept clear. If the conversion of the State loans had given us £30,000,000, we could have spent it to protect those highways. I think honourable members willagree with me that I showed some foresight in indicating this some two years before the declaration of war. If my proposal had been carried into effect, Australia would have been much better off. Its farmers would have had their produce much more i secure, and the mice would not have been eating hundreds of thousands of bushels of wheat, as, unfortunately, they are doing at the present moment. I hope that the Treasurer, when introducing any similar Bill, will explain why certain States are charged a higher rate of interest than others, and I trust that the Government, through an advance from the Australian Notes Fund, will the able to meet the absolutely urgent needs-of the various States.

I heartily support the Treasurer in bringing forward this Bill, because I am desirous that public works, which will be of value to the States, should be carried on as if no war were in progress. There are Government undertakings throughout the Commonwealth that will be paying concerns from almost the moment they are inaugurated. For instance, there is the hydro-electrical scheme in Tasmania. There the latent power of nature is being developed and harnessed, and from the moment that current is available the scheme will pay interest on the expenditure. It would be disastrous if the carrying out of works of that character were to .be discontinued. It was quite refreshing to listen to the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa after hearing what was said by other honourable members on the Opposition side. We read of those honourable members introducing deputations of unemployed, and telling their constituents that they are desirous that work shall be found for those who need it.",19
120,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,There should be a quorum to. listen to this eloquence. [Quorum formed.],19
121,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I am astonished at the inconsistency of honourable members opposite in criticising a proposal by the Treasurer which will enable the States to get funds for expenditure on public works, thus giving employment to a big body of men. In reference to the call for a quorum, I have no objection to a limited attendance of honourable members in the chamber when I am speaking, because I realise that honourable members are continually called out of the chamber on most important business, and to attend meetings of Committees. It is unjust that an honourable member, who is seldom in the chamber, should be repeatedly calling for a quorum. We rarely see the honourable member here, but we do find him calling attention, by advertisements in the press, to a medical institute where people may receive medical attention for half-acrown. I DrMALONEY - I rise to a point of order. The statement made by the honourable member for Denison is absolutely incorrect. I have told him previously that for the last three years. I have not been in medical practice. I am sure the lionorable member will withdraw the statement he has made.",19
122,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS," What statement does the honourable member desire to have withdrawn ? Dr MALONEY.;- I desire withdrawn the statement that I am not often in my place in Parliament, because I am at a medical institute in Elizabeth-street, attending patients for a fee of half-a-crown. I have not been in medical practice for the last three years.",19
123,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS, That is not a point of order.,20
124,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"If my stateI ment was incorrect I withdraw it , but only yesterday I read in the paper an advertisement to the effect I have stated. As one of those who interested themselves with the desire that the States sbould not be severely treated in the Treasurer's demand that they were to pay some of the money they owe to the Commonwealth, I commend the Treasurer for his action. I do not know what was in the mind of the right honourable gentleman, but I am of opinion that he desired to give the States a warning that they must proceed only with public works that are absolutely necessary. The action he took upon that occasion has, in my opinion, proved beneficial throughout the Commonwealth in compelling the State Treasurers to curtail their expenditure considerably. None of us should endeavour to curtail expenditure of a legitimate and wealth producing nature. I was told yesterday by a practical electrical engineer that the Victorian Government has very close to Melbourne a remarkable f u n d of wealth in the form of brown coal deposits, which are almost as valuable as the water power in Tasmania. This gen tleman told me that the coal can the converted into electrical energy at the pit's mouth, and current supplied to the people of Melbourne, which, with its enormous population and established factories, provides a convenient market. Unfortunately, Tasmania has not a very great population, and, therefore, consumers for the electrical power produced by the hydraulic scheme there ' are not close at hand. I was surprised to learn that an asset so valuable as the brown coal deposits existed close to Melbourne, and had not yet been utilized. If money can be found to brin g that latent energy into use, in what better way could any Legislature expend money when men require work? The State will be most progressive which enjoys the cheapest motive power, because cheap power will enable the manufacture of articles which are now imported from abroad. During the war the shortage of shipping is giving to the Australian manufacturer far greater protection than could be conferred by any Tariff.",20
125,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"He is getting protection from competition from some quarters, but nob from others.",20
126,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The protection is general. On investigating the statistics was surprised to discover how small today are the imports of materials that may be manufactured in Victoria. The i m portation of confectionery and boots has practically ceased. People cannot afford to pay the huge freights on American boots, which were sold very largely before the war. We have today a splendid opportunity for increasing our manufactures, and I , as an Australian, do not mind in which States manufacturing development takes place, so long as the people of the Commonwealth as a whole benefit. I support the Bill , and I congratulate the Treasurer on the tacti he showed in compelling the State Treasurers to curtail their expenditure. I was sorry to hear an honourable member, who is' widely respected in New South Wales, say that the Premier of that State has gone about England like a blind man with at in in an endeavour to collect money. I understand that that State does not desire Commonwealth interference in any State affairs, and, on second thoughts, the honourable member, I am sure, will withdraw the statement he made.",20
127,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I will not.,20
128,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I think that New South Wales should have joined the other States in the financial arrangement. The Commonwealth should be the only Australian borrowing authority, because it has an organized credit, and can borrow more cheaply than can any individual State. The organized credit of the Commonwealth has enabled us to do much during this war, and I look forward to the Commonwealth being enabled, by reason of that credit, to do still greater things. For that reason I am of opinion that the States should borrow only through the Commonwealth.",20
129,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Capricornia) [5.2] - I very much regret that the Treasurer did not give us due notice of his intention to bring forward this measure. According to the notice-paper, at least eight other Orders of the Day were to be dealt with before the House reached the Bill that is now before us.",20
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,This Bill is a very formal matter.,20
131,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"It is not. I have prepared notes upon which to base my observations upon this Bill , but I have not got them here, because I expected that the measure would not be proceeded with u n t i l after the House had. dealt with the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill , the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill , the Daylight Saving Repeal Bill , the Budget debate, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Appropriation Bill , the Freight A r rangements Bill , the Sugar Purchase Bill , and the W a r Loan (TJnited Kingdom) Bill . The Treasurer knows that he was most unfair in getting the first eight Orders of the Day postponed.",20
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,It is urgent that we should get this money for the States,21
133,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I wonder whether the Government are finding that the criticism from members on this side of the House becoming too objectionable. We have drawn attention to the fact that the Go99. vernment have not sold German-owned to shares, that they have not stopped Gerthe man trade, and that they are not winning the war, as they promised to do when they were before the electors, Apparently the Government are bringing forward their investor, financial measures early in order that they premium.. may go into recess as soon as possible",21
134,Mr HEITMANN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Y o u ought to say lot about winning the war!,21
135,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Honourable members opof posite are the Win-the-war party. They have a two-to-one majority, and what they doing to protect the familiesand wives of soldiers? In the press from day to day appear - accounts of the exactions by landlords. Only yesterday, a woman writin g to the newspapers said that the rent of a house which she had occupied was originally 14s. a week, and then 17s., and, after about 15s.. had been spent on it in repairs, £1 a week, but that when had left the place a soldier's wife took and was required to pay 22s. 6d. a week f it. Under the War Precautions Act Government can do anything it likes. The honourable member for Flinders told Ministers so., and the High Court said the same thing. But Ministers nothing to protect the wives of the soldiers. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN "" The honourable member is a little wide of the motion.",21
136,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"It seems to me that it is time that the Treasurer stood up against the little financial group which manages our borrowing in London. The other the right honourable gentleman raised £3,500,000 in London on behalf of the States, and allowed that loan to be at a discount of 2 per cent. that that was very wrong. I hope that I shall not be thought desirous of advertising myself if I say that when I was Treasurer, and it was necessary tb raise a loan of £4,000,000 on behalf of the States, I refused to borrow at a discount. I was told by this little nnancial group that it would not be wise to go on the market just then, because some small South American Republic was trying to borrow £2,000,000, and if we went on the market at the same time it would disturb things. - The Commonwealth had to wait, if you please! Then we got a cable suggesting that we should go on the market at once, is and should offer 5J per cent, and a discount of 1 per cent., issuing the loan at Now, to issue a loan at a discount is increase the rate of interest, although object is to delude the public that the money is being borrowed cheaply.",21
137,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,But you catch the ready who is on the spot looking for a,21
138,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I said that on no aca count would I consent to the loan being issued at a discount, and the little group financiers in London, at the head of Which is Sir Robert Nivison and Comare pany, abandoned the idea. I suggested that the loan should be issued at par, and that the rate of interest should be 5^ per cent. They cabled back that such a rate of interest was utterly unheard of, and advised us that if we did not act at once we would be in trouble. Having withstood them in the matter of issuing at a discount, I did not feel quite safe in putshe ting aside the suggestion regarding the it rate of interest. But I saved the country o r £40,000 by my firmness in regard to disthis count. What happens when we borrow money is this: Somebody in the office of has Sir Robert Nivison and Company-the has firm which underwrites our loans-tele do phones round London and gets one financier to take £1,000,000 of it , another firm to do the same, and perhaps at h i r d firm to take a share.",21
139,Mr HEITMANN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,That is the usual business of the Underwriters Association.,21
140,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,It is very expensive business for the Commonwealth.,21
141,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"We have the adday vice of the High Commissioner. Mr HIGGS,-The Treasurer does not need the adviee of London financiers now issued that there is a Commonwealth Bank. I think Had I agreed to borrow £4,000,000 at a discount of 1 per cent., Sir Robert N i v i son and Company, and his group of financiers, would have netted £40,000 at the expense of the Commonwealth. Now that the Treasurer has the machinery of the Commonwealth Rank at his disposal, I hope that he will see that money raised for the States is borrowed at reasonable rates. All he has to do-and this is what I intended to do-is to instruct the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to advertise the loan in London as our local loans are advertised here. When we propose to borrow money locally, we give the general public about six weeks' notice of the fact, aud latterly we have gone further, and have allowed investors to advance their money in ten monthly instalments. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) says that we want to give a man with ready cash the chance to invest. In London he gets very little time; only three or four days. When a loan of £3,500,000 is issued at a discount of 2 per cent., it is a bit of a prize to the underwriters, especially when the rate of interest is 5-j per cent. I do not believe that the financial position in London is so stringent that it is necessary for us to pay so much for money. I think that London investors have more reason for confidence in Commonwealth loans than for confidence in even the loans of the TJnited K in gdom. If the Treasurer, when he proceeds to raise this money, tells the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank not to trouble with the underwriters, but to advertise the proposed loan boldly, as we do here",21
142,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Why did not the honourable member do this when he was or elsewhere. about to borrow £4,000,000 on the London market?",22

144,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I suppose the Treasurer refers to the fact that when I was in office the Commonwealth Bank balances were large. I was a friend to the Bank.,22
145,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,But not to the taxyou payer.,22
146,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"There were reasons for rate.. what I did. Besides, the Commonwealth Bank had not been in existence very long, and we were learning.",22
147,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,And the public was paying for your education.,22
148,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I ask the honourable member to show that there was any change in the financial methods of the Governments of the States, or of the Commonwealth, until the Labour partly established the Commonwealth Bank. I recommend the Treasurer to accept monthly instalments when borrowing money. He can say to the British investor, "" You may advance the £8,000,000 that we need in ten monthly instalments."" The States do not need all this money at once.",22
149,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"They wanb it now, and want it very badly ",22
150,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"They require money from time to time. No doubt during the last few months t h ^ right honourable gentleman has approved of advances being made to them to meet obligations in London. He is told, perhaps, thab Tasmania needs £50,000 or £100,000 a couple of months hence, and gets similar notice from the Treasurers of the other States. I am sure that the whole of' this £8,000,000 will not be needed at once by the States.",22
151,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The States owe us £3,000,000, and we have to pay them only £3,840,000. We have already advanced £3,000,000 to them out of loan fund , and must repay the money.",22
152,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"At any rate, they do nob want their money all at once. They will be satisfied to get it in payments made throughout the year. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should avail himself of the machinery of the Commonwealth Bank for raising money in London",22

154,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I do not wish to discuss at the capacity of the financial advisers of v the Commonwealth in London, but I sugthatthere are certain principles in regard to which the Treasurer should be able to make up his mind, and one of them is that loans should not be borrowed at a discount. It is useless to try to deceive the public regarding rates of in terest. When you borrow at a discount increase the rate of interest, and it would be better to openly pay a liigher",22
155,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I do nob see much value in this dissertation on borrowing by one who has had very little experience. I have had twenty years of financial experience, and the honourable member has been a Treasurer only for six months.",22
156,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Like the Bourbons, the right honourable gentleman never forgets anything and never learns anything. A f t e r twenty years of experience, he recently borrowed on the London market at a discount of 2 per cent. It is time the right honourable gentleman learned something. I learned, within a few months of my ""taking office as Treasurer, that I could refuse to allow Sir Bobert Nivison and Company to run the Commonwealth.",23

158,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Since the right honourable gentleman is so offensive, let me say that I do not think he would use the machinery of the Commonwealth Bank in floating our loans. He is an enemy of the Bank, and would do all he could to injure it . Sir JOH N FOBBEST - That correct.",23

Sir JOHN FOBBEST - Why he will use the machinery of the Comhonorable monwealth Bank to raise this money in he was Treasurer % Australia or elsewhere. By doing so, he would save the States much in the way of underwriting expenses. Why should it be necessary to underwrite our loans?

Sir Robert Nivison has been undermuch common sense. writing loans for the Commonwealth since the inception of Federation. [50] ' I hope that the Treasurer will give the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank authority-or , if it will suit his temperament better, "" direct "" him-to raise this money on the best terms for the Commonwealth and the States. It should not be necessary for him to consult Sir Robert Nivison and Company, or - even the manager of the Commonwealth Bank in London. The manager of the Commonwealth Bank in London may be to some extent overpowered by the prestige which these financial gentlemen have acquired as the result of long years spent in exercising certain privileges which they have secured through their financial connexions in the Old Country. In speaking thus, I do not wish in any way to suggest that the Commonwealth Bank's London manager is not a very able man, but the atmosphere in which he lives and moves may affect his advice.",23
163,Mr HEITMANN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,The advertising and other costs of raising loans locally might is not possibly be as much as the discount paid on English loans.,23
164,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I do not know that that is so. In-the case of loans floated on the London market, there are not only advertising expenses, which are higher than honourable sulch expenses in Australia, but the underwriting fee which is paid to Sir Robert Nivison and Company. While dealing with the question of issuing loans at a discount, I should like to point out that in the early stages of the war we decided to issue 4£ per cent, loans at par. No doubt it was thought that we were doing wonderfully well; but honorin relieving of all taxation income derived from war loan investments we are in reality paying more than 5 per cent. In the future it would be better to abandon the principle of exempting our loans from all taxation, even if we have to pay a higher rate for our money. did not the member adopt that policy when",23

170,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Swan-Trea surer) [5.31] - I am unable at present to say whether we shall or shall not do so. I may state at once that I have not the objection which the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) seems to entertain to the issue of loans at a discount. We have always to adopt that course which promises the best result, and discount loans are of common occurrence. I do not think that any financial authority considers that loans at a discount should not be issued. Far removed as we are from the centre from Which we obtain our money, it is necessary that, in floating a loan, we should secure the best advice available to us. We have the Commonwealth Bank and the High Commissioner in London to advise us, and if we think their recommendations are isatisfactory^ we adopt the in. Before any loan is issued we are always consulted as to whether or not we approve of the proposed terms. Money is sometimes very urgently required, however, and, where the need is pressing,, a Treasurer cannot pick and choose, or say that he will not do this OT that. Af ter an experience extending over many years in the flotation of loans, I unhesitatingly say that delays bring very little advantage. A Treasurer is bound to accept the opinion of his advisers in London. While I was Treasurer of Western Australia, I . had the advice of the London and Westminster Bank and the Agent-General in floating loans for that State, and where I was not prepared to accept it, I would defer the floating of a proposed loan, and - later on make » second attempt. I never f oun'd, however, that I reaped very much advantage from such finessing or delay. These financial authorities are anxious to do the best they can for their clients. We have the Commonwealth Bank and the High Commissioner in London to act for us, and they consult the 'authorities at Home. I believe Sir Robert Nivison to be one of the great financial authorities on the floating of colonial loans. His name is well known, and he is a man of the highest repute. I know him slightly, and I certainly do not share the opinion of him that has been expressed by the honourable member for Capricornia. He is looked upon as a man of the highest repute.",24

172,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Quite so; he has given us cheap money. On one occasion, through his instrumentality, I floated a 3 per cent, loan at a premium. My first experience of him was at a time when he was financing the Western Australian Land Company in London. There was an offer to raise £1,000,000, and when I consulted the financial authorities as to whether Sir Robert Nivison was a man capable of carrying oub such an obligation, they said he was. That was 'twenty years ago, and Sir Robert Nivison has been at the same business ever since. He has been honoured by hiscountry, inasmuch as he has been made a baronet, and he occupies the highest place in the financial world, so far as colonial loans are concerned. I have had no communication with this gentleman, because we deal with officials, through the Commonwealth Bank and the High Commissioner; but I have the highest opinion of him, and believe that he is absolutely single-minded in his desire to serve us, and will see to our interests to the best of his'ability. I cannot say how the loan will be floated, but I should say it will very likely be at a discount unless we raise the rate of interest. .",24

I regret that the Treasurer 'has indicated in all probability, he will issue this loan at a discount, because if the matter t not is handed over to Sir Robert Nivison, he will simply acquaint his friends that the and Commonwealth Government Tequire about £8,000,000. He may suggest putting the this £8,000,000 on the market right away, or a he may suggest putting only £4,000,000 on the market; and if the Treasurer acno cepts his advice, and issues the loan at be98 per cent., instead of at par, he and his friends will undertake to underwrite the Sir Robert Nivison's comthat pany may not actually underwrite the whole of the amount-'the y did not do so n other cases-bu t they will get their financial group to underwrite it . In other l words, if no one else will subscribe the £4,000,000, this financial group will see that the Commonwealth gets the money. a On the face of it , this may seem a good the business transaction for the Commonbut it is not a profitable transn - action for it , because the underwriters ill issue the loan at par, and so get the have benefit of the 2 per cent, discount.",26
188,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Does the honourable member say that they will charge an underwriter's commission of 2 per cent.?,26
189,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"They will get 1 per cent, underwriter's commission, and, in all probability, ithey will unload on to the in vestor the greater portion of the loan at If all our the rate of interest which it is decided the Commonwealth should pay. That is to say, in the case of the £3,500,000 loan that t i e Treasurer issued some time ago, - the general public lent their money at 5-J - peT cent, interest, and, in all probability, do paid the full £100; but the underwriters our got the benefit of the 2 per cent, discount the as well as the underwriting charge of 1 per cent. We cannot deceive the underwriters. If we say that we require a loan I at 5^ per cent., and that we propose to the issue it at a discount, they know very well that it does not mean o \ per cent, only to them. It will probably be 6 per cent., depending on the date upon which the loan is to be redeemed. I submit to the Treasurer a plan by as are which he can do away with, the underwritin g charge and with the discount. I advise b i m to adopt the methods which were adopted in connection with the loan issued in Australia. The Treasurer will forgive me if I advertise this Any one who has sufficient intelligence conduct an election campaign, or to get votes from electors, can raise a loan easily. F o r instance, in connection with the Commonwealth war loan I adopted methods which I adopt in m y constituency. I got into touch with the people by means of .circulars. I printed lars, and sent them to the income-tax cers, with the request that they should sent out to every individual having an i come of over £300 a year. In that many thousands of circulars were issued; every person in Australia getting any come at all was made aware that there was a loan on the market, and was invited to subscribe to it . Furthermore, I did not select two or three sharebrokers to interest themselves in the loan, as been the custom of past Governments in Australia, as, for example, the selection of Sir Robert Nivison and his group of financiers; and I invited every stock share broker in Australia to help me get that money at a commission of 5s. cent. If the Treasurer will get the of every stock and share broker in Lonafforded don, and invite him to assist in raising .this £8,000,000 in London, he will need to pay the underwriting charge of per cent., which will amount to £80,000.",26

If the investors in London subscribed so readily to that £4,000,000 loan as to over-subscribe it in four days, my suggestion in regard to this loan is thab if the Treasurer would seek the assistance of all the stock and share brokers of London, and if the Commonwealth Bank would circularize the in vestors of London to the effect that the Commonwealth required £8,000,000 at 5 per cent., we would save, not only the underwriting charge, but also a great deal of interest.",27
200,Sir WILLIAMIBVINB,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,How will amendment help the Treasurer?,28
201,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,It precludes him from issuing the loan at a discount.,28
202,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Flinders) [6.2] - The difficulty I had in following the honourable member was to see how his amendment would go any distance towards avoiding the alleged evils of which he complained. We all recognise that Australia, in endeavouring to raise money in the Home market, has to pay more than she cares to pay. All of those who have had experience in connection with Treasury matters in the Statesj and no doubt also in the Commonwealth, have tried various methods of avoiding the payment of the heavy charges for brokerage and other commissions in regard to obtaining money, but they have failed their endeavours. It is all very well the honourable member to say that the money can be obtained in Australia out such charges having to be paid, bub Australia. he forgets that the people in Australia who have money look upon the Austranaturally lian Government-as an institution-wit the most absolute and implicit confidence as being the foundation of all their prosperity and well-being. largely in their sight. In their view, its Australia. credit is as great as, if it is not greater than, that of any other Government the world. They do not require to induced to lend their money, and if were uot very strong reasons against deavouring to get all this money in tralia, which the honourable member East Sydney (Mr West) suggested a little while ago, we might get a good deal more ing any great risks. money, and on possibly more favourable terms in Australia.",28
203,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Because no one is comhigher, ing into competition with us in Australia.",28
204,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"T h a b is the case. We need not go about attempting to convince the public of Australia that safe securities of British Consols. the Commonwealth Government has a certhey tain standing. The people know that if own initiative. the Commonwealth fails to meet its liabilicitors, ties everything they have goes as well. So there is no necessity to use any of these methods to bring the public of Australia to have confidence in the Government to which they are asked to lend money. On the other hand, there are material disadvantages in raising very large sums of borrowed, money in a country like Australia. We can go only a certain distance in that direction. I do not complain of the extent to which the Commonwealth the Government has already borrowed-pos sibly we may be able to go still further but if we go on holding out inducements, such as paying 4^ per cent, interest and giving freedom from income tax and all other taxation, there is a point beyond which we cannot go; because it would mean withdrawing from active enterprise and business a considerable portion of the working capital of the community. It is a question of the balance of convenience. We must raise some of the money in Australia, but not the whole of the immense sums which we must raise at this time. If we did attempt to raise all that money in Australia, we should do a irreparable in jury to the country.",28
205,Mr HEITMANN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,And do not forget in that we are sending abroad a large prof o r portion of the money raised locally.,28
206,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Of course a withgreat deal of the money is spent outside So there is a l i m it of ordinary prudence which the Treasurer will use in determining how much h money ought to be raised in such a small community as Australia. The people in England, from whom we get our money, It looms are people who know very little about I am not 'referring now to Sir Robert Nivison or the financial people in with whom he is in touch; they are not be the people from whom our money comes. there Ultimately it comes from innumerable ensmall investors, who know nothing about AusAustralia. There are thousands of people for who have a little money to invest, and desire to earn good interest without takThey are looking for a class of security not so gilt-edged as Consols, but standing as high, if not than the best municipal bonds and securities of that kind - From Australian stocks they get a little better interest than they would get for the absolutely Bub do not invest in these stocks on their They trust to their solitheir brokers, their friends, and other people in whom they have confimonwealth dence, and those people in turn trust men who are in the nnancial swim in England, and who do know all about Ausrises tralia. If we wish to get money those sources which are scattered all over only through the usual channels. Great Britain , we must get it through only channels by which they can be tapped. In a smaller way State surers have tried to solve this problem, and avoid the necessity for paying Treasurer brokerage, but for the reasons I have tioned ithey always failed. We have approach the people who have the money through the channels in which those people have confidence. W it h regard Sir Robert Nivison, I have had some as soon ciation with that gentleman, and I wish - to deprecate the tone in which reference has been made to him. philanthropist; he is a business man, and he has done very well out of the splendid connection which, through a long course of years, he has established - with the various British Dominions by retaining always the confidence of the Dominions and of Nivison, his other clients in his straight dealing. We must not regard him as a kind of ogre who. is lighted to hear that a new colonial loan is to be raised, out of which he and his friends will seek to make as much profit possible. To do that would be to look the fact that it is his business to honest with us, and it is only has the implicit confidence of those other financial authorities in London who have control of large resources of money that he is able to get the money so quickly for us in normal times. Whether he the same now I do not know, but he would have a better chance of doing it than would anybody else. I hope honourable member for Capricornia will Nivison. pardon me for saying that his suggestion that we should ask the High Commislove sioner to advertise to all the brokers London that we are in need of this money appears rather childish. By adopting that course we should entirely defeat our own ends; we should throw a load of susthat picion on the whole transaction, and should not. get the money without paying a great deal higher interest.",28
207,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Why not give some portunity for raising the money in Ausalways tralia 1,29

The honourable member seemed to think that because we have always done a certain thing we musb continue to do it . the I wish to make no attack upon Sir Robert He may be one of the best citizens in London, and may have a great for Australia; but I resent the argui n ment that we are dependent on him to raise this money in London. Rightly or wrongly, I hold the opinion that the credit of Australia in London is so good we can float this loan through the we agency of the Commonwealth Bank; and if the amendment is agreed to,' it will afford an opportunity for that proposal to be given a trial. If we never attempt to opget oub of the r u t in which we have moved, we shall make no advance. I have remarked before that very few of thoroughly understand the question of we finance. I remember being told in my boyhood by the school 'teacher that the - nation with a national debt was on a sound footing; and not t ill manhood did I understand that that statement was based on the reasoning that a nation which had a national debt was paying to its own people interest which circulated like a pension amongsb a large section of the community. I raise no objection to the Treasurer's proposals, but I wish to elicit information, so that we may know how our finances are managed. Despite what has been said by the Treasurer and the honourable member for Flinders, I believe that the people of England will be quite prepared to lend money to Australia through the Commonwealth Bank, and thus save us a considerable amount in brokerage. I am glad the amendment has been moved, because it affords an opportunity for honourable members to ventilate their ideas on finance. Those who were present this afternoon when the honourable member for Capricornia spoke were made wiser by his interesting discussion of the financial situation. If a little more attention were paid to finance, the proposal of the honourable member would be better understood, and the spirit in which it was moved would be appreciated. The real purpose of underwriting a loan is to get a guarantee that the money required will be forthcoming. The underwriters invite the public to subscribe, and they take up any unsubscribed balance, there being always the danger that a loan may not be full y subscribed by the public. I hope that, before this Parliament expires, we shall have a Committee such as I ' have suggested, to give attention to financial business and to in for m the House concerning it. Loans running into many millions will mature shortly, and some understanding should be arrived at concerning the financial needs of Australia, so that we may not have to pay an unconscionable rate of interest for renewals. H a d it not been for this unfortunate war, We should, I think, have redeemed some of our loans. Undoubtedly, we need some authority to take control of our borrowing. The public debts of the States should be consolidated, and taken over by the Commonwealth. Sooner or later we shall have Unification, and we should make the earliest attempt possible to arrange for the conversion of the loans of the States. Whatever may be the fate of the amendment, I think that we should do well to. get away from precedent, and establish some better method of borrowing. Ilfr. West.",29
211,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Illawarra ) [6.24] I am not in accord with the amendment, but I think that it would be well for the Government to consider whether the in* terest paid on future loans should not be liable to taxation. I can understand that the Treasurer of the day, when the first loan was proposed, was so anxious that it should be a success that he was led to attach advantages to it which, otherwise, would not have been offered. It is not a sound business method to pay what is practically higher interest to one in vestor than to another. Under this system no man can say what we are paying for money, for every increase in the in come tax increases the loss to the Treasury by reason of these exemptions. Seeing that the war may yet last a long time, and very heavy income taxation may have to be imposed, in my opinion it would be a sounder business principle to issue loans without any exemption in regard to in come taxation.",30
212,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Capricornia) [6.26] - I wish to say a word or two about the in sufferable patronage of the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William I r vine), who described my amendment as childish. I understand that) this gentleman came to Australia as a junior barrister after having been a schoolmaster, or a tutor. He has never got over the schoolmaster habit. I presume that he acquired his financial knowledge by doing his best for those for whom he did business, by assuming a very correct manner and a pose which made people think that) he was a very righteous man. This led him to be appointed director of companies, such as the Equity Trustees Company.",30
213,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS, The honourable member is not in order in touching upon these personal matters.,30
214,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I am trying to find the reason why the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine) described as childish my proposal that 'tihe Treasurer should adopt new methods in regard to the flotation of loans. I have not suggested that Sir Robert Nivison is a dishonest man. In some way-probabl y by assuming the same pose that has been adopted by the honourable member for Flinders, and the same voice-h e has builb up a connection. Probably he has had sufficient ability and good sense to treat the Australian Treasurers and Premiers who have visited London in such a way that they have been overpowered and ready to f all in with any financial suggestion that he might make. In all likelihood, he is a very clever and a very honest man, but he knows that he has a paying proposition, and does his level best to keep it. The financial methods of our present Treasurer and of the ex-Victorian Treasurer may have been the only methods they could adopt years ago, when they had to rely upon Sir Robert Nivison. Probably that gentleman is well in wibh the British Government, and stands very high socially.",30
215,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,He stands high financially.,31
216,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"No doubt he has a great deal of influence, and probably when a Premier or Treasurer has gone to him, he has given the best advice available. B ut the position now is quite different. In times past there was no Commonwealth Ba,nk from which assistance could be sought. Had there been no Commonwealth Bank, could we have floated loans in Australia? No ; it would have been impossible. The twenty-two Associated Banks would have held a meeting, and announced that they declined to float a loan at 4J per cent. They would probably have wanted 5£, or even 6 percent.",31
217,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,That was not the experience of Victoria prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. The State got cheap money then.,31

221,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,An overdraft is better.,31
222,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"An overdraft, however small, would be sufficient to induce any honourable member to take a n interest in financial matters and the habits and customs of those who buy and sell money. When the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) was giving the Committee some information about underwriting, the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) interjected, "" Surely we might take that for granted."" An y one of us might well have made the same inter jection when the 'honourable member for Flinders himself, in the most, impressive manner, was informing the Committee that "" There is a point at which you have to be very careful that in raising public loans you do not draw upon capital which would otherwise be used for the development of industry."" One might just as well say, "" There is a point at which you lose your equilibrium."" Surely it was a commonplace in which the honourable member for Flinders indulged. The point that he raised has been discussed over and over again in this Parliament since it was first proposed to float a loan in Australia.",31
223,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"And the honourable member has always ridiculed it . very Mr HIGGS - I challenge that statement. Ever since it was first proposed to raise money here, bankers, ordinary business men, and intellectual personsamong whom I include the - honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith)have urged that there is a point at which the Government must refrain from asking the general public to furnish capital for loan purposes. I have known financiers to say that it is impossible to decide at what point in such operations you begin to draw upon capital which would otherwise be used in the development of Australian industry. A year or two ago the honourable member for Robertson (Mr . Fleming) complained in this House that enormous sums of money were lying idle in the banks because, owing to Labour legislation .in the Commonwealth, many capitalists did not care to embark in any commercial enterprise or in any Australian industry. The war, fortunately for them, and unfortunately for the general public, has come along and furnished them with a very good investment at 4^ per cent. B ut we have not yet discovered, nor can thab very learned KCMG. . Sir William Irvine, tell us, at what particular stage we must refrain, from asking the general public to subscribe to our loans in order that we may not deprive commerce and industry of necessary capital. I regret that the honourable member for F l in ders is not present. If he were, he might supply me with an inspiration to deal with him as he ought to be dealt with . It is nearly time that some one dealt with him. because his egotism is calculated to create a political breachof the peace. I moved the amendment partly in the hope that the Committee might carry it as a direction to the Treasurer not to issue loans at a discount, butl particularly to secure an opportunity to point out that since the establishment of the Commonwith wealth Bank, and in war time, a few in London have been managing AusWest), tralian loans at very great expense to Commonwealth. I hope that the Trea- "" tripe."" surer will be democratic enough to adopt the principle of the amendment.",31
224,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Why not also fix the rate of interest?,32
225,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The honourable member is of opinion that if we fixed the rate interest at, say, 5 per cent., we might nob obtain the money we require, and that the Treasurer would then have come down with a new Loan Bill. It is unnecessary to fix the rate of interest the Treasurer will but adopt modern ideas. My contention is that it would better to offer a higher rate of - interest than to issue a loan at a discount. That is sound finance, in support. of which there is ample authority. . The world is supposedfcobe engaged a fight for Democracy. It is useless fco the Treasurer. talk of Democracy, which means the rule of the people, unless the Government the country is fco be administered in democratic way. If the Treasurer is deal with this matter in a democratic fashion, then he must so administer the law that the general public will either relieved of taxation or benefit in other way. If the right honourable gentleprofoundly man is going to allow Sir Robert Nivison and Company to underwrite our loans, then he is not going to observe democratic principles of government. It is not easy, however, to teach the Treasurer anything. He is not likely to adopt any of these methods to which I have. referred. . will, I suppose, issue his loan at a dissomething count, and offer a very high rate terest, with the result that it will cost the country something like £200,000 more than it would if democratic principles were observed.  would be difficult, from the point of view of the country's good, to assess the value of the speech to which we have just listened. ""When the honourable member rose, I anticipated that, since he had seen fit to make some *f airly sharp thrusts the present Treasurer, we should get from him some light and leading. Unfortufche nately, I have been grievously disappointed. I make bold to say that the Committee generally is disappointed with his speech, and still more disappointed that of his sole supporter, the honormen able member for East Sydney (Mr. who gave us a wealth of noise and the a good deal of what might be called The ex-Treasurer (Mr Higgs) made one statement, however, that I think might well claim an explanation from the Treasurer. The honourable member said that a previous loan had been floated of after being advertised for only four days, the inference being that in consequence, of the shortness of that notice the Comto monwealth had to pay more for its loan than it otherwise would have done. There if was also the somewhat ugly inference- I do not know whether the honourable membe ber intended to convey it or not-that .the underwriters had purposely shortened the notice in order that they might take up the loan and subsequently unload it to their own profit and advantage. That in statement demands an explanation from We should know why such a short notice was given. It apof pears to me that an appeal for subscripa tions 'to a loan should be long enough to to give all who have money to invest an opportunity to tender. To that extent, I did find a grain of wisdom in the first be speech made in Committee by the honorsome able member. Apart from 'that, I was disappointed. There is no virtue in the action of an honourable member who rises for no other purpose than to traduce another. I feel justified in saying what I have; and the honourable member for Capricornia would do well fco He remember for the future thab we expect more from, him than the raising of inof whirlwinds in the House. One fact is becoming more and more obvious to me as my parliamentary experience lengthens. The Bills we drafti and pass are practically skeletons, and in due time, after they have become the law the land, we get a whole sheaf of regulations; it ""is nob a case of the Bill and regulations, but a case of regulations and the Bill, and this, in effect, means that Parliament is slowly but surely losing control of those matters which affect the inat terests of the public. The last clause of fchis Bill provides, in the usual way, that Government may make regulations.",32
226,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS," The whole Bill is not under discussion, but a clause.  that the regulations governing the particular clause under discussion wil l probably be more important than the clause itself. Against this I protest. I impress on the Treasurer that, in placing this loan on the market, he should see that it is sufficiently advertised so that it will not be competent for any honourable member to afterwards say that we have to pay more than we ought simply because some persons on the other side of the world have not given it that publicity its importance demands. We should achieve the best results, and that cannot be done unless our loans are widely and properly advertised.",32
227,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Maribyrnong) [8.2] I intend to support the amendment. We have to start somewhere to effect reforms in borrowing money, notwithstanding the protestations made by the Treasurer and the honourable member for Flinders. If honourable members expressed themselves full y and truthfully , they would say that they are not satisfied with the whole course of our borrowing policy up to the present time. It is not only during the war that we have borrowed money within Australia. Previously we borrowed locally considerably £100,000,000, and since the war started we have borrowed nearly £80,000,000, so that our public debt is now almost halfand-half. By tapping Australian resources financially we have proved that these resources are capable of giving splendid results. According to the forecast of eminent nnancial authorities, we shall have to look to ourselves in the future. For years after the war, it is anticipated by those who know a great deal about finance that to meet the expense of our developmental works we shall have to depend on ourselves. Further, we are told that there is now great difficulty in obtaining money in London, and that the Treasurer has to be exceptionally careful. My own belief is that, fro m a financial point of view, f h e world is under the control of whafc may be called financial groups; thab is, there is a certain groupI shall not mention any names-wh o have a great deal to do with Australian finance, while another group devotes itself to South African finance, and still at h i r d to South American finance, and so on in other places. Each group, we find, has allotted itself different portions of the world, and any encroachment on the preserves of one group by another would very likely lead to the breaking up of this nice arrangement.

232,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"But this is a kind of union fchafc dips its Band deep in the pockets of the people of the country; and it has been pointed out by the ex-Treasurer that, by the reform he instituted, he was able to save £40,000 in underwriting a loan. In regard to the London market, the Commonwealth is in a dif ferent position fro m what it was prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. If this Bank is to be of any value, as we are told it is, in connection with our soldiers and other arrangements at Home, why should it not be able to carry out our loan arrangements much more cheaply than can private individuals? My own opinion is that the Bank could do so, and w© ought to make use of our own institution, if it is to be the valuable agency we expect.",33
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I thin k the Bank does float our loans in London.,33
234,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The Treasurer is never very definite. I remember very well the opposition - that was shown to the founding of this Bank, and also the veiled threats that were held out .when the measure was before us.",33
235,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Th © Bank does act for us in the raising of these loans. - Mr Fenton - And yet we have to meet the same old expenditure?,34
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,At any Bank acts as our agent in London.,34
237,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The Bank will not fulfil the functions which we anticipate if it is merely going to travel on the beaten . track of fleecing the taxpayers of the country. Already the Commonwealth Bank has saved this country many thousands of pounds in certain directions; and I do not see why it should not do equally useful work in connection with our loans. If , as I believe, Australia is under the control of a certain ring of financiers, we are bound to suffer in the raising of loans on the other side of the world, and the Bank is not what it ought to be. I should be very glad to hear that even the Treasurer is not misinformed as to what the Bank is doing.",34
238,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I am formed. M i . FENTON - Then the Bank is really carrying out the duties we would wish it to carry out?,34
239,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I what you wish; the Bank is the medium for floating the loans.,34
240,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I am afraid it is only one of the media. If the Government were in earnest in regard to the Bank and its connection with our loans, we should have these loans floated a good deal more cheaply than in the past. The honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will liam Irvine) has pointed out that there are men who, with no great financial^ resources of their own, collect from various clients in Great Britain and elsewhere, sums of money, small in themselves, but aggregating considerable amounts, and who advise those clients how to invest. Unless there is to be a boycott against Australian loans, I cannot think that these timorous mortals, who depend upon advice of the kind, will told not to invest in our securities simply because we have cut a new track on the other side of the world.",34
241,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,It seems to me that the honourable member does not sufficiently appreciate the great financial secret about which the honourable member for Flinders has informed us to-night.,34
242,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The honourable member for Flinders can be very impressive. I was very much impressed with the first two or three addresses that I heard him deliver in the House, but when I found that he built his arguments on very wrong rate, the premises, I did not take so much notice of him afterwards. No honourable member is perfectly satisfied with the present method of raising loans, and the amendment, therefore, should be welcomed because it seeks to bring about reform in the direction that honourable members desire. There is no doubt that we pay too much for raising loans, and if we are prepared to continue following the old and ancient procedure, we shall continue to pay too much. The Bill will be greatly improved if the amendment is adopted.  honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) has lectured the Treasurer for paying 4-£ per cent, on our loans, as if it were an excessive rate of interest, yet if his amendment is agreed to, the rate not misin- of interest will be something like 7 per cent. It is impossible to get loans at par at present except at a very high rate of interest. It is easy enough to raise money at par by paying a high rate of do not know interest, but if we approach the money market with a cast-iron rate of 4£ per cent., we will not get the money at p a r ; it will be more like90 per cent. . The 0 amendment is nothing but humbug, and absolutely contradicts the speech which the honourable member for Capricornia delivered when he condemned the Treasurer for paying an exorbitant rate of in terest. He condemned the Treasurer for paying 4£ per cent., whereas the effect of his amendment would be to compel the Treasurer - to pay something like 7 per cent. If there is a great paradox in this Chamber, it is certainly the honourable member for Capricornia. Question-That the words proposed to the added be so .added-put .

The clause as it stands is an insult to the intelligence of every Australian 'with a belief in his country and a hope for its welfare. Let me prove my statement by quoting from the Budget-papers the rate of interest paid by the public of Australia. The rates paid on loans raised in Australia are as follow:-On the first issue, £4 14s. lOd. per cent.; on the second issue, £4 14s. 6d. per cent.; on the third issue, £4 14s. 3d. per cent.; and on the. fourth issue, £4 13s. lOd. per cent.

The sum of £110,000 would have been saved if the last loan of £4,000,000 for the States had been floated in Australia. The discount on that loan was £14,164 16s. 4d. What is the discount on the Australian loans? I cannot find 'any mentioned in the Budget-papers. NOES. Mr Bruce SMITH - What are the rates the English people are paying for their loans at present?",35
246,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"They are paying much higher rates than we are paying in Australia, and that is all the more reason why this'loan should be floated here. It would save our people from paying more, and from being robbed as the English people are being robbed at present. I find these other expenses were paid: Commission to Commonwealth Bank (-J per cent.), £10,000; commission Tollers; to brokers (\ per cent), £8,938 16s.; underwriting (1 per cent.), £40,000; underwriting commission (^ per cent.), PAIBS. £10,000; postage, telegrams, &c, £15 0s. 3d.; advertising and printing inscription registers, &c, £1,859 2s. 6d.; stamp duty on allotment letters and amount set aside to meet stamp duty on transfers of stock, £25,911 17s.; making the total expenses, including discount on instalments prepaid, £110,899 12s. I d . Eor the flotation in Australia of a loan of £13,389,400, there were charges of postage and telegrams, £549 7s.; and printing bonds, inscription registers, &c, £442 14s. The net proceeds were £13,133,278. I ask honourable members to compare those expenses with the £1,859 for advertising and printing, and £25,911 for stamp duty t &c, in connection with the loan of £4,000,000 raised in London.",35
247,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,How does the honourable member account for Mr Holman going all the way to England to borrow money if he could obtain it more cheaply in Australia?,35
248,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"God and Mr Holman alone know why he went Home. The proceeds of the British loan, after deducting accrued interest, were £3,997,612 6s. 7d., whilst the nett proceeds after deducting the total expenses, of which I say the people of Australia were robbed, were £3,886,722. In plain words, the interest cost to the Commonwealth, including redemption, will be (a), if redeemed in 1920, £6 Is. 4id. per cent., and (6), if redeemed in 1922, £5 16s. 5d. per cent. Sir JonN FORBEST - What is the interest cost of the local loans?",35
249,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The interest cost to the Commonwealth, including redemption, but joot allowing for exemption from Commonwealth, and State income taxes, was £4 14s. lOd. in connection with the first issue of £13,000,000.",35
250,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The Commonrowing. wealth Bank has received £80,235 for floating the loans in Australia, and they cost altogether £181,629.",36
251,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"That cost of has £181,000 is for loans aggregating nearly £79,000,000, whilst the expenses of £110,889 relate to a loan in England only £4,000,000.",36
252,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"We suffered a loss of interest on the Australian issues. that loss to the flotation rate, and it be found that those loans are costing nearly 6 per cent.",36
253,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The interest cost of the loans raised in Australia ranges from £4 14s. lOd. on the first issue to £4 10don the last issue. The Treasurer makes much of the fact that it has cost us about £181,000 to raise £78,900,000 in Australia. Had our expenses in connection with those ""loans been proportionately as great they were on the English loan of. now, £4,000,000, they would have amounted £2,200,000.",36
254,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Are you speaking of the 1916 loan raised by the honourable member for Capricornia?,36
255,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Yes ; and I objected to that loan'when it was before ParliaEurope ment. It was the first Australian floated in England in war-time, and if the honourable member for Capricornia merits blame for having gone to the Engi lish market for such poor results, how much more blameable will the present Treasurer be if he has to pay a higher rate of interest, and the transaction brings less credit to Australia.",36
256,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I do not know that we can raise in Australia money for the States. I do not think we can. Thai; is the reason why we go to London.,36
257,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"As an Australian should be sorry if the people of the monwealth, after subscribing £78,900,000 in war loans, should refuse a paltry £8,000,000 asked for by the Commoncountry, wealth ' Government.",36
258,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,You must add to the cost of the flotations in Australia the had worn out. remission of income tax. Dr.MALONEY - Does the Treasurer deny that the income tax in England is actually higher than it is in Australia?,36
259,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"We do not pay the British income taxation, but we do lose income taxation on the Australian bor",36
260,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I wish to complete my comparison. The interest cost of the £78,000,000 odd that the Commonwealth borrowed in Australia, including redemption, but not allowing for the exemption from Commonwealth and State inof come taxation, ranges from £4 14s. lOd. to £4 13s. lOd. If the loan under discussion were floated in Australia, the interest Add would be paid, to Australians, and we will might be able to borrow for £4 13s. lOd. instead of for £6 Is. 4d. I am sure that, at the present time, money cannot be borrowed in London as cheaply as that. The 'Only place in which money can be bor13s. rowed more cheaply than it can be borrowed in Australia is* the TJnited States of America. Some eight years before the war, when money was at 3 per cent, and 3 i per cent, in London, it was being lent as at 2' per cent, in New York. There is I think, a superabundance of gold into America. Gold has been flowing there from every part of the world, and it is thought that America has too much gold for its own good. After that wonderful Commission of Inquiry by American scientists and men offinancewhich visited and examined the banking systems of England, .Germany, France, Italy, loan ^ and Spain, they have advanced in America in a ratio of less than 5 per cent, gold. I suggest to the Treasurer that f he wishes to get money at the cheapest rate of interest, he should try the New York market. It is his duty to Australia to borrow' as cheaply as possible. If a high rate of interest must be paid, it is better to pay it,to Australians, and to keep the money circulating in our midst, than to pay it to people in other parts of the world. Abraham Lincoln once said that when anything was made in America, I the money ' that it cost remained in ComAmerica for all time, and was still there after the thing itself had worn out, but that when money was sent out of the to buy a locomotive or anything else, the money and the thing made were both lost to America when the thing itself  I listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney). He lost sight of the fact that the £8,000,000 for the borrowing of which money there. the Bill makes provision is not the only rowing that the Commonwealth will have to do this year. The Budget-papers, ever, show that £60,000,000 will have be borrowed this year for war purposes Australia. The honourable member also lost sight of the fact, and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) either lost sight of it or concealed it, the money which has been borrowed in Australia has been borrowed, not at par, but at a discount of £1 10s. 6d., or 1^ cent., the actual sum obtained for £100 bond issued being £98 9s. 6d. That is tme of the loan Taised by the honourable member for Capricornia when Treasurer. The honourable member referred to a savport adopted. ing that he had made when borrowing in London, and I wish to remind him that when Treasurer I made a saving of £86,000 on the fourth war loan floated in Australia by'extending the system of ten monthly instalments to the large If we had not to borrow* so much money for war purposes, I should be strongly in favour of borrowing this £8,000,000 locally. To get money at par in England we should have to pay a very high rate of interest, it being very difficult to raise posedmoney at all there at the present time. When I was Treasurer I wished to raise £7,500,000 on behalf of the States. I No. 4. succeeded in borrowing £4,000,000, but on two occasions the Imperial 'authorities asked me to defer the borrowing of the remaining £3,500,000 because of their own requirements. The honourable memwhen her for Melbourne stated that we are allowed to go to America for money.",36

But we did not avail ourselves of it. advanced to the States the money necesment sary to enable them to carry on, and present Treasurer has succeeded in rowing in Great Britain the balance needed, the Imperial authorities having promised that we shall get it. In view the great financial needs of the Commonhad wealth, the Treasurer, must have authoa . rity to borrow in England if he can get to do. In addition to the bor- £60,000,000 needed for war purposes this year, £28,500,000 is due to the Imperial howGovernment on the 30th June next, so to - that over £80,000,000 is needed to meet in our commitments for this financial year. I believe that the patriotism of the people of Australia will impel them to come to - the assistance of the Commonwealth as that fully as they can, but Parliament should not do anything to make it more difficult for the Treasurer to finance the war by per insisting on new methods in connection every with the flotation of loans.

DEPARTMENT OF WORKS AND BAILWAYS . Division 1 (Works and Bailways), £ 5 , 6 2 1.",39
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Swan-Trea surer) [9.12] - The Government now in vite the Committee to deal with the A d ditions, New Works, and Buildings Esti, mates for the year 1917-18. The total provision proposed is £1,257,617. That amount covers the services payable out of revenue for the whole of the current year 1917-18. The various items contained in the total have been carefully scrutinized by the Treasury and the other Departments. The provision in every case has been confined to works of an urgent nature, and the amount provided has been reduced to the lowest possible minimum. As I said when introducing the Budget, it has not been the desire of the Government to unduly curtail expenditure during the current financial .year, or to unduly interfere with the employment of the people. This is a time at which every effort should be made to maintain employment, and to interfere as little as we can with existing arrangements. As the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) has just stated, we desire that these Estimates shall be passed as quickly as possible. At the same time it would be unreasonable to ask, and I do not even suggest, that honourable members should not scrutinize the items, and deal with them as they think best. I merely urge upon the Committee that we should pass them as soon as possible, since there is, as yet, no appropriation for the public works that are in progress all over the Commonwealth. They can be provided for only out of the Treasurer's Advance. It was thought that, since the Estimates would be placed on the table earlier than usual, we might defer the passing of an interim appropriation for additions, new works, and buildings. That was done, so there is no real appropriation, except in a general way through the Treasurer's Advance, for the works and buildings at the present time, though it is very desirable that there should be, with the detailed items of expenditure. Honourable members will agree with me that we should have these ETC. ' Estimates on the statute-book as soon as possible, so that we may proceed promptly with works early in the year, and not, as has often been the case, at nearly the end of the year. I , need not add any further reason, because it is well known that these votes, together with the loan appropriation which I hope to introduce shortly, will give a good deal of employment throughout the Commonwealth. The various items in the Estimates as they come along will be dealt with by Ministers, who will be able to give full information regarding each. I conclude by saying that, while I have no desire that honourable members should not give the fullest scrutiny to the Estimates, I am very anxious that they should be passed as soon as possible. I move That Item No. 1, £670, be agreed to.",39
286,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Yarra) [9.18] - The honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine) a little while ago asked that some notice should be given of a general discussion on the Budget, so that the Estimates should not be dealt with piecemeal. It will be seen that in connection with the Flinders Naval Base no figures at all are given, but there is a foot-note showing that the money has to be provided for out of loan funds for 1917-18. a similar intimation on practically every page. Thus we see that the acetate of lime factory, including installation of plant, and the vote towards the cost of a general arsenal and land, are to be in cluded in the loan expenditure, no figures now being before us.",40
287,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,We asked to deal with those to-night.,40
288,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I know, but my objection is that we have not before us the complete expenditure that is proposed. If honourable members can assure me that the figures connected with this expenditure are to, be found somewhere in the Estimates I shall be obliged.",40
289,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,You will find them on page 296.,40
290,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I presume that the expenditure qf £2,742,725 for works, shown on page 296, is the amount it is proposed to provide for out of loan funds for this year, and if we add the £1,257,617 that we are now asked to consider, to the amount I have just named, we have about £4,000,000. We hear and read of the Budget from time to time, and then we find thab it is proposed to pay out of loan funds for many works which hitherto have been paid for out of revenue. There is, for instance, the works controlled by the Postmaster-General's Department, in cluding the construction of conduits and laying wires underground, which we are told has to be provided for from loan funds in 1917-18, and which, I suppose, total some £200,000. In some years, I believe, such works have paid for out of revenue, and in other years out of loan moneys, so that now, I suppose, it would be very difficult to distinguish how particular works have been provided' for. I notice that the Department is now called the "" Postmaster-General's Department,"" and not the "" P o s t and Telegraph Department,"" and the lettering on the caps of the telegraph messenger boys and the letter carriers all tell us that this change has been made. As I was saying, these works have been constructed in some years out of revenue and in other years out of loan, though I had been under the impression that they were always paid for out of revenue. Then, again, in connection with the general arsenal, I suppose the total cost, to be paid for out of Loan Fund, will be over £500,000. The defunct Public Works Committee in There is quired into the matter of the general arsenal several times, and gave varying reports. If I remember rightly, the present member for Boothby (Mr Story), when a member of the Senate, entertained the Senate on one occasion for over ten hours with a speech on this subject.",40

292,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"If the honourable member spoke for ten hours on the Small Arms Factory, which is only a section of the arsenal, how much time would he have devoted to the whole subject? It will be remembered that about two years ago we sent a Commission to India to make in quiries and report as to a general arsenal scheme; and I should like to know whether, if we pass the whole of these Estimates to-night, we shall not be practically committing ourselves to the scheme then formulated?",40
293,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"You might explain why your Government, during recess, gave £40,000, without parliamentary author it y , to be spent on this work?",40
294,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I suppose that Parliament afterwards sanctioned the expenditure. I am very glad we have got these Estimates early in the session, and not, as on the last occasion, not only when the year had expired, but when a new Parliament had been elected. Every honourable member knows that the introduction of those Estimates was an afterthought; and I need not remind the Committee of the painful experience they had of being brought back to consider the items, albeen though all the money had been spent long before, and by another Parliament. If we are committing ourselves to the expenditure embraced by these Estimates, I shall require a little more informatio n on° some of the items than we have received from the brief speech of the Treasurer. I suppose that, seeing we are told that some of th© works expenditure has to come out of Loan Fund, we shall subsequently have the Loan Bill before us, and have an opportunity of discussing the items.",40
295,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I hope we shall have the general Budget debate before that.,41
296,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I hope so, too. hope that we shall have an opportunity to deal with the war profits and other taxation proposals, including the addimatters tional 10 per cent, on single men. In gard to the latter, I doubt whether even the Government could tell us who are people who will have to pay the tax. I should like to know why it is probeen posed to spend only £1,000 on lightof houses this year. Have the whole of the be altered. works been completed as laid down in the very admirable report of Commander Brewis? If we have got together an expert construction gang for the purpose building lighthouses, and cease all work of construction, it will be difficult to the men together again.",41
297,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,What connection has that matter with the Armidale Post-office?,41
298,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"If c is on the first item that we have a general discussion on the Government's financial proposals. not going into every detail, and I do not wish to speak again. I am anxious to mizing. know whether we will be committed to the continuation of the construction of Naval Bases, although there is not a single figure of expenditure appearing in these Estimates. I am also anxious to know whether we are voting merely the £1,257,617 time it continues to borrow. covering the items from pages 271 ito 294.",41
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Yes .,41
300,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"There is no desire on the parfc of the Opposition to block the Government's proposals for new works, and no honourable member can say that they have been wearied by any discussions that we have had so far during this session. It w i ll clear the ground to some extent if we are not to deal at fchis stage with the items of expenditure out of loan funds, referred to on page 296 and subsequent pages. But in order to show how we may be led astray we find no item of expenditure from revenue upon lighthouses, whereas, as a matter of fact, a sum of £50,900 appears on page 306 as expenditure to be incurred for new lighthouses and lightships out of loan funds.",41
301,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Why is the money come from loan funds ? Surely there is plenty of revenue for .the purpose ?,41
302,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I do not know. Honourable members had no idea->that we were deal with these Works Estimates The first intimation we had was when we met this afternoon.,41
303,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,The information was pubI also lished in the press.,41
304,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"T he newspapers told us that there were to be one or two formal discussed, but if we are to look reto the newspapers for information as to the intentions of the Government, the the sooner we know it the better. We were certainly not told that the policy that has followed for anumber of years, that building works out of revenue, was to",41
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,It has not been altered.,41
306,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,We have never conof structed lighthouses out of borrowed - money. Practically every item now to be get built out of loan funds has been built out of revenue at some time or other.,41
307,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Not every item.,41
308,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Some people talk lightly about loan money, and propose to establish sinking funds, and in order to create those sinking funds they would borrow I am more money. The only way in which sinking funds can be created is by econo",41
309,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,The Commonwealth has not followed ithe policy to which the honourable member has referred.,41
310,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"No, bufc afc the same Ever since the first loan was raised it has continued to borrow money.",41
311,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,The lighthouses will provide light for many years.,41
312,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Not only have we provided for lighthouses out of revenue, we have also provided for the construction of vessels for the lighthouse service from the same source, but now we are adopting a new principle. The Treasurer should have set it out in his speech. From his few remarks honourable members would imagine that, whereas the appropriation last year was £5,500,000, and the expenditure £4,300,000, the appropriation was fco be reduced to £1,250,000 this year. As a matter of fact, including expenditure from loan funds, the estimate for this year is £4,000,000. Instead of there being a huge saving, which the Treato surer apparently wished to make out, fchere has been practically no saving at all.",41
313,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The appropriation tolast year was £5,515,684, but the expento-day. diture was only £4,301,530.",41
314,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"T he Government never anticipate spending the full amount provided on the Estimates. The nearest expenditure to the amount appropriated that I can see in the Estimates before us is in the case of the Sydney Customs House, where the appropriation was £32,739, and the actual expenditure was £32,676. Sometimes not a single penny of the amount appropriated is spent: I wish to know whether honourable members will have an opportunity of dealing with the items appearing in the expenditure from loan funds before we are asked to pass the general Estimates. some matters about which I would like to say a few words. Eor instance, it would not be fair to ask honourable members to vote money for Naval Bases when we will, not be aware of the policy of the Government in regard to them.",42
315,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,We may not require the Naval Bases after the war.,42
316,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,That is why we should pause a little now in that expenditure.,42
317,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"No one knows what will be required in the matter of naval defence after the war, yet we may be committing ourselves to a large expenditure on Naval Bases ",42
318,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"It amounts £334,000.",42
319,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"It amounts to more. The honourable member is omitting an item of £65,500 which appears on page 304. There will be an expenditure of £400,000 on Naval Bases.",42
320,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The expenditure on Naval Bases from loan funds is £660,000. That was shown in the Budget statement.",42
321,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Unfortunately , we have not that information before us. It would be well if the Treasurer would explain where we can find the items. The details will not appear in the Bill which will be brought down after we pass these Estimates. I object to these matters being . placed before the Committee with practically no information.",42
322,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Flinders) [9.42] - I sympathize with the Leader of the Opposition. At the same time the practice followed by the Treasurer is that which has been followed by almost every Government since the inception of the Commonwealth. Works Bills are brought in before honourable members have the opportunity of discussing the financial proposals generally. There are included in these Estimates certain works which commit us on broad matters of principle, that should be discussed in connection with general financial proposals, but if there is any material difference of opinion .in the Committee as to those broad principles, there should be no difiSculty in having the particular items postponed until after the general debate on the Government's financial proposals takes place. I hope that the Government wil l give us an early opportunity of discussing these proposals. There never was a time in the history of the Commonwealth when it was There are so necessary for this Parliament, unless it is to abrogate its functions altogether, to review the financial position of Australia as a whole, and not piecemeal. We have already passed the second reading of a Bill containing one of the most important financial ' proppsals of the Government-the War-tinie Profits Tax Assessment Bill and we are to go on with that measure because the Government have asked us to do so, but honourable members should not be asked to deal with any other measures u n t i l they have had the opportunity, on the first item of the Estimates, of discussing the whole of the financial position of the Government. We have to never been faced with a financial situation requiring such grave consideration as we have before us now. The House of Representatives is not only entitled, but is also, in duty bound, to discuss the whole situation before it is asked to deal with the important matters contained in the various measures comprising 'the financial proposals of the Government. I do not say that with regard to the measure for the taxation of war-time profits, although I should be pleased if that, too, could be postponed until the whole financial question had been dealt with, but I do not enter any special objection against it , because I know that the Government are anxious to bring into existence the machinery for the collection of that tax. Before we deal with the general loan proposals, or any proposals which involve questions of principle-and in regard to which there may be differences of opinion- I respectfully suggest that the Government should give to the House an opportunity of dealing generally with their financial proposals, and of making any suggestions with' regard to --the financial position. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition desired to raise any objection to the ordinary Works Estimates being dealt with. The proposals before us represent the ordinary practice which is adopted to enable works to be proceeded with. But even in regard to some of the matters in these Estimates, I would prefer not to be asked to vote u n t i l we have had an opportunity to discuss them. Sir JOHNFORBEST (Swan-Trea surer) [ 9 . 4 7 ] - I listened with"" attention to what the honourable member for F l in ders said, but I do not think that the ordinary Works Estimates for the year to be paid out of revenue, and the not very extensive, but important, works which we think should be charged to loan, really affect the larger questions of the financial position of this country. If that position is complicated at all it is complicated by the 'immense expenditure on the war. Even if we were not at war these works proposals would require to be dealt with. We should have to carry on some of our public works just as we are doing now, and it is not a fact that the debate on the Budget should necessarily precede the consideration of Estimates for urgent public works. Our. works, proposals are not very large. It is clearly shown in the Budget statement that we propose to expend from revenue £1,257,617, as against £4,30.1,530 expended during the year 1916-17. It is clear that we have curtailed the ""expenditure from revenue, and are debiting a greater number of works to loan.",42
323,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,You have reduced the expenditure very much; you have merely transferred it .,43
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Honourable members do not wish us to discontinue these works. If they are of opinion that there are proposals in these Estimates which are not necessary, they have a right to say so. But I deny that the financial position of the country is in any way in volved in these proposals. We must proceed with the works mentioned in these Estimates or close them down.",43
325,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,You propose to spend £600 to store a motor car in Adelaide.,43
326,Sir JOHNFORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I say nothing about that. When we come to that item the Minister controlling the Department for which the expenditure is to be made will have an opportunity of explaining the proposal. For years-, the party sitting on this side of the House has urged that i m portant permanent works should be charged to loan account and not to revenue, and that is the policy which the Government are carrying out. The Budget mentions the works to be constructed in 1917-18 out of loan. There is an amount of £660,000 for Naval Bases, works, and establishments - I have always urged that those works should be charged to loan. We on this side do not advocate the taxation of the people in order to construct permanent public works. There is £53,000 for the acetate of lime factory, and another £200,000 for the general arsenal. Upon these projects honourable members may express themselves when the Loan Bill is before them. Other items include: Perth General Post Office, £45,000; contribution under River Murray Waters Act 1915, £90,000-w e are committed to that; Commonwealth railways, £676,161; and conduits and the laying of wires underground, £270,811. For several years the last-named work has been paid for out of loan. I was the first Treasurer to introduce the system of charging these works to loan, and the Labour Government persevered in the same course. Last year all public works were charged to revenue. There is an amount of £400,000 for Fleet construction. We have always said that we cannot afford to build our Fleet out of revenue. If a disaster overtook us, and we lost some of our big ships, how could the revenue stand the strain of replacing them?",43
327,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"B y voting for the items not in these Estimates we might commit ourselves, to them.",43
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Honourable members will not, by their actions tonight, be sanctioning any loan expenditure. The Loan Bill has not yet been in troduced. There is a proposal to vote £114,000 for the acquisition of land in the Federal Capital Territory, and £67,450 for the purchase of other sites. Sometimes these land purchases are charged to loan, and sometimes to revenue. I think they are a fair charge on loan. The other two important items are Lighthouses and Lightships, including the upkeep of vessels for construction work, £ 5 0 , 9 0 0; and the London Offices, £100,000. Some of the expenditure on the London Offices has been charged to revenue, but most of it has been paid out of loan. All those items will form the subject of a Loan Bill to be submitted to the House at an early date. I assure the honourable member for Flinders that I am following to-night the same course as has been, followed always. When I have been Treasurer on previous occasions, I have introduced the ordinary Works Estimates as a matter of urgency, because we desired to proceed with works and give employment, and later I introduced a Loan Bill.' Mr GREGORY,-If we pass these Estimates, do we commit ourselves to these items?",43
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Honourable members will commit themselves only to an expenditure of £1,250,000, which is chargeable to revenue.",44
330,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,We shall commit ourselves only to expenditure to be paid for out of revenue?,44
331,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"That is so. The Loan Bill is an independent proposal, and has nothing to do with this expenditure from revenue. For the loan expenditure, money will have to be raised, and I hope that we shall be able to raise it without going on the market. Our estimated loan expenditure on works is £2,742,725 , but the votes for some of the items are considerably underdrawn. There must be f u l ly £1,000,000 of loan appropriations in hand, so that we may not require more than £1,700,000 more to carry out our loan proposals. If able members will consider the matter, they will realise that there is nothing exceptional or underhand in asking the Committee to agree to the proposals that are now before it . Honourable members will be committing themselves to nothing beyond the works mentioned in the schedule of the Bill , and any information which they desire I shall be glad to afford them.",44
332,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Flinders) [9.57] - The Treasurer has slightly misapprehended the intention of my remarks. I take no exception to the Works Estimates being brought forward at this stage, nor do I take exception to his policy of paying out of loan for items which hitherto have been paid for out of revenue; because, subject to certain conditions, I agree very lafgely with that policy; but I say, with regard to all expenditure, more especially expenditure of loan moneys, that it is more essential now than is usually the case that a general review should be taken of the whole position, particularly as to things to be done, and the means to be taken to obtain the necessary money.. An enormous war expenditure is dislocating the finances of the country, and, in addition, there is a continuously increasing expenditure on ordinary services. It thus becomes i m peratively necessary for the Committee, if it is to act as the guardian of the public finances, to ascertain what amount we shall have to spend, and the calls that will be made upon us, especially in connection with loan money. We must consider whether particular works ought or ought not to be constructed, and also how much money will be available for those, and for other purposes, i l do not propose at this stage to enter into any discussion of the loan proposals, but I ask that before they come before us we may have an opportunity for a general discussion. We cannot efficiently or properly discuss what our loan expenditure ought to be u n t i l we have reviewed the whole position from the point of view of the demands that will be made upon the limited funds available. Out of those limited funds we shall have to find money 'for the States, which are entirely dependent upon us, and we cannot, without ascertaining the demands which will be made upon our attenuated means, efficiently discuss any considerable proposals for expenditure from loan. I have not taken exception to these ordinary Works Estimates being proceeded honorwith, not because they do not call for scrutiny, but because it is a matter of urgency to get the works in hand.",44
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"For the most part, these are ' ' carry o n ' ' proposals.",44
334,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Some of .the loan proposals are "" carry o n "" proposals, and some of them are not. As to the latter the Committee has to consider, not whether they are good in themselves or desirable for the giving of employment, but whether we can afford them, having regard to the limited amount of money at our disposal. For that reason, I urge the Government to give an opportunity for the discussion of the financial position generally before dealing with loan proposals. Mr JOSE PH COOK (ParramattaMinister for the Navy) f l O . l ] - I agree with the honourable and learned member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) that the Committee is entitled to an opportunity for the fullest consideration of the financial proposals of the Government, but I do not regard his observations as relevant'to the items before us.",44
335,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,They drawn froin me by the announcement of the Treasurer that he would proceed with the Works Bill before the Budget proposals.,45
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,What I said that we had done it before.,45
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"On the first item of tliese Estimates a general review of the financial situation is permitted, and in any case I can promise the fullest opportunity for the very desirable discussion which the honourable and learned member has in view. This is a proposal for "" carry-on "" works pure and simple, except perhaps as to one or two items which we may consider when we get to them. Owing to the re-arrangement of the Estimates, the Government is asking for the smallest sum that has been asked for during many years. purposely limited our request to the smallest amount possible. Instead of asking Parliament to vote £5,000,000 odd as we did last year, we are asking it to vote now only about £1,200,000, and in view of the urgency of the works to be undertaken, I hope that honourable members will let the Estimates go through.",45
338,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Capricornia) [10.4] One might think, after listening to the honourable the Minister for the Navy, that he had been a turtle dove, and had spent all his days in billing and cooing. These proposals are more than formal. If they are so urgent as the right honourable gentleman says they are, why were we not informed last week that the Government proposed to ask for this money ? The sum of £67 0 is set down to provide accommodation for the Electoral and Public Works staff at Armidale. not that proposal open up a discussion of the policy of the Government regarding Public Works expenditure ? - this party was in office we asked the electors not to approach their members with a view to getting unnecessary public works carried out. I understand that Armidale is in the constituency of the Postm aster-General.",45

341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,No ; ib is in General Abbott.,45

Is the new building needed? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - To-morro w the honourable member will be introducing an was unemployed deputation, and asking that work be f o u n d; now he is delaying works expenditure.",45
344,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I shall be able to explain my position. The sum of £16,00 0 is set down for buildings, stables, and other works in connection with the establishment of a serum institute at Melbourne. What is the policy of the Government regarding the Federal Capital?",45
345,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,The Estimates show it .,45
346,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"They show that the Government, like the Minister for Works and Railways, regards the Federal Capital as only a dream. We have Mr Glynn - Nothin g of the sort.",45
347,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"If the Government desired to honour the compact in the Constitution that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydney, it would propose to establish the serum institute at Canberra. All the experts agree that it should be tliere.",45
348,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,No . The Government of which the honourable member was a Minister was not of that opinion.,45
349,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The institute could well be established at Canberra. But Ministers are too comfortable where they are. The Minister for Works and Railways does not wish to have to travel to Canberra every week from his home in Melbourne. It is sixteen years since we first discussed the desirability of fixing the Capital site, and yet now, in 1917, the Does Government is doing all it can to keep the Parliament sitting in Melbourne. I appeal to the representatives of New South When Wales to say whether this institute should not be placed at Canberra. It is useless for the Government to try to get these Estimates through to-night. I consider it my public duty to object to the rushing through in an hour and a half of proposals invottvuhg the expenditure of nearly £1,250,000. There are several matGoters of Gevernment policy which must first be discussed. If the Committee that of agrees to the establishment of a serum institute in Melbourne, honourable members will be taken as supporting the Government in depriving New South Wales its constitutional rights. It is all very well for the Acting Prime Minister to say, "" Y o u will be leading a deputation of unemployed to me tomorrow."" The Government have discharged, I suppose, 200 men from the Federal Capital. Is that the act of people who seriously intend to establish a Capital at Canberra ?",45
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I thin k this is an act of deliberate "" stone w all "" on your part.",46
351,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I cannot agree to the passage of a million and a quarter of money in one and a quarter hours. I remember being stung by a remark of the Acting Prime Minister about extravagant expenditure on public works. He said it ought to be stopped; that there ought'to be some supervision, and more care taken. The Treasurer has made a great to-do, and has thrown something in the nature of a bouquet at himself by saying, "" I have introduced these Estimates in the early part of the financial year."" What is the good of doing that if he wants them put through in an hour and a quarter? The honourable member for Flinders, with whom I seldom agree, was quite right in saying that on this occasion we ought to review the whole financial position of the Commonwealth. We ought to decide what public works we shall carry out; what can be most economically carried out; what are likely to pay for themselves; what we can do out of revenue; and what ought to be constructed out of loan money. A very cursory examination of the Treasurer's Budget speech and Estimates will show that a most arbitrary proceeding has been adopted in deciding what items shall be put into loan and what constructed out of revenue.",46
352,Sir JOHNFOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I do not think so; it has been very carefully considered.,46
353,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"For switchboards and extensions are to be paid for out of revenue, but I find that a quantity of ephemeral things, like the payment of honorary organizer and secretary for the Repatriation Fund, are to be loaded off on to posterity.",46
354,Sir JOHNFOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I suppose that is for war. Mr HIGGS' - For war purposes, so called, but it is a very arbitrary distinction. The Treasurer's method of putting into the Loan Fund items that have hitherto been paid out of revenue might well furnish a subject for a little sideration. The Acting Prime Minister the comes here tired after a long Cabinet meeting, where I suppose amendments were discussed which have since arrived here in page for m constituting practically new Bills. But we cannot help that. If the Government, after months, cannot make up their minds about legislation, but have to come to the House and tap the brains of the rank and file, that is not our fault.",46
355,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,What sort of sense is that?,46
356,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I am referring to a budget of amendments circulated tp-night. They indicate that the members of the Government have probably had a wet towel round their heads for several nights, and that this is the result. But because they are tired and want to go home that is no reason why we should put through Estimates for £1,250,000 without due consideration. I protest against the spending of £16,000 on a new building in Melbourne which ought to be at the Federal Capital.",46
357,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I ask the honourable member to remember that he will have to read the proofs of his speech tomorrow.,46
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,He has been talking all day.,46
359,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Owing to the Government's action in introducing a lot of discord into the industrial community, and to the f a c t that there is a strike on in Sydney",46
360,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS, Order ! The honourable member is entirely out of order.,46
361,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Minister s are referring to the fact that I have had to talk here today at some length. A number of our members are away because they cannot get ""here. If they were present, it would not be necessary for me to do double time. instance, new Will the Postmaster-General or Minister for Works and Railways explain why he wants £670 for Armidale, New South Wales? If the Acting Prime Minister's promise is to be carried out, that Ministers administering the various items will explain them as we reach them, I shall be glad to hear the Minister for Works and Railways explain why £670 is to be spent in providing accommodation for an electoral and public works staff at that town during war time.

A r e we to have no information from the Minister on that item ? Is the Minister for the Navy, who went through this country disturbing the public mind and trying to create want of confidence in the Government of which I was a member by saying that we did not expend public money as we ought to have done, prepared to sit there silently, and allow this item to go through? Where is Geraldton ?",46
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,In Western Australia.,47
365,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I believe it would have been a very much more important place but for the right honourable gentleman's policy of centralizing everything in Perth. Is any member of the Government prepared to rise in his place and show that £16,000 ought to be spent on public offices at Geraldton? Are there any unemployed there ? If there are there might be some reason for spending the money.",47
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Will you sit and allow the Treasurer to explain?,47
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Swan-Trea surer) [10.19] - Geraldto n is one of the most important ports in Western Australia.,47
368,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,What is its population ?,47
369,Sir JOHNFORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I should say 3,000 or 4,000. It is 300 miles from Perth. Four railways come in there. It is in the constituency of Dampier.",47
370,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Is it a port for the goldfields?,47
371,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Yes , for Cue and all up that way. It is a very important centre for wheat growing and pasture. Some of the best land for grazing and agriculture is up there. There are also lead and copper mines at Northampton. Geraldton is the port for the Murchison goldfields.",47
372,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Is it good wheat-growing countiy ?,47
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"It has, I think, a rainfall of about 20 inches. I should like the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) to know that railways run inland from Geraldton for a distance of 400 or 500 miles to Nannine, Meekatharra, and Sandstone. The State Government has spent a large sum upon the erection of public buildings at Geraldton, but there are no public oflices for the Commonwealth services. The public buildings erected by the State for the accommodation of magistrates and other public officials must have cost something like £30,000. It is unreasonable to expect us to erect buildings that would not be commensurate with the importance 1 of the Commonwealth.",47
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [10.22] - The proposal is to erect a Commonwealth building in which to house all sections of Commonwealth activities at Geraldton. Provision will be made for new postal premises, Customs House and bond, and for the electoral offices. The present premises are being leased at a rental of £247 per annum. It is proposed to abolish the existing post-office, and to erect a new building on the present site. Provision will also be made for housing the quarantine branch. That is the explanation of the item.",47
375,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The position of the Government/'so far as the item is concerned, would have been better without the explanation. The Minister says that it is proposed to erect buildings ab a cost of down £16,000 to accommodate officers who are at present housed in a building the yearly rental of which is only £247.",47
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,It is proposed to erect these buildings because the present buildings are inadequate.,47
377,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Will the Minister say how many officers,47
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I shall say nothing more. The honourable member may make what he likes of the explanation.,47
379,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Maribyrnong) [10.24]. - I should like an explanation of the item "" Federal Capital Territory-Sundr y preservative works, £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 . "" I should also like a fairly full explanation as to some works that have been going on at the Federal Capital, which, in the opinion of many honourable members, will not be required for the next ten or fifteen years. In this time of war we should not undertake a work like that which has been going on during the last nine months in connection with the laying down of a surface railway between the present terminus at Queanbeyan and what, in time to come, is to be the civic centre of Canberra. This line crosses the Molonglo, over which a bridge is being erected. I do not think it is reasonable to ask us to go on voting money for works afc the Federal Capital unless we are informed what is actually being done there at the present time. In these Estimates there is also an item of £50,000 for power and plant at Cockatoo Island. I know of no expenditure that calls for stricter investigation than that carried out by the Naval and M i l i tary Departments.",47
380,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,What about the Flinders Naval Base?,48
381,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I am speaking of general military and naval works. undertakings should be carefully investigated, and yet under the Act they may be exempted from consideration by the Public Works Committee. ought certainly to be referred to that Committee.",48
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,It is really a general item covering a number of works.,48
383,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"There is another peculiarity about these Estimates to which I would draw attention. We have, for in-, stance, an item of £25,000 to be provided out of revenue in respect of wireless expenditure, whereas under the loan schedule, which will be considered at some subsequent date, there is a'further item of £15,000 for the same purpose. Items are in this way divided between the two schedules. Many of these proposed votes are very large, and the Ministry should not expect us to deal with them in a few minutes. They would save time by agreeing to report progress at this stage. Many honourable members have been travelling all night, and as sleeping berths are not available at the present time on the Sydney express, some of them have had no sleep. I hope that the Minister for Home and Territories will supply in formation as to the items to which I have referred.",48
384,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [10.28] - About one-half of theitem of for "" Sundry preservative in division No. 2, is to provide for stores and materials that were ordered in connection with works, and for which payment has to be made. The remainder is for preservative works. These include some works which were on last year's Estimates, and which have to be completed. We closed down on the general expenditure a few months ago, but some of the work then in hand has to be completed. For instance, this item relates to part of one of the avenues, and in order to complete the work as designed in 1916-17, it has been placed upon these Estimates. The honourable member also referred to the construction of a railway. He will find that on the Loan Estimates there is a sum of about £8,500 for building a railway from , I understand, the power-house to the business centre. It will be a continuation of the Jine from Queanbeyan to the power-house, which is being worked by the State Government in connection with the Federal Territory. Such We thought that instead of shutting down on this work for the present, it would be better to complete it . It is a continuation of the existing railway for about 3 This - item miles, and it will help in the general development of tha Territory pending the suspension of the building of the Capital.",48
385,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,What general development of the Territory is going to come from this extension ?,48
386,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"F o r instance, this extension of 3J miles will enable the farmers to deliver their wheat to Queanbeyan by railway. There is a railway of 5^ miles already made from Queanbeyan, and by continuing the line which was in construction at the time, the development of the Territory, apart altogether from the building of the Capital itself, will be benefited. The cost of running the additional length of 3 i miles* will not be greater than the cost of running the present length of 5 miles. The matter was gone into carefully, and it was thought better to complete the line. We have bought 198,000 acres of land.,",48
387,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,The line is being constructed for another purpose.,48
388,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I assure the honourable member that it is not so. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) referred to the building of the Federal Capital. This is not a time to talk about that work. I may tell him that in 1915£11,000 16, when I think he was in power, the exworks,"" penditure on the Capital was something like £160,000, and that the expenditure' up to the 30th June, 1917, was about £123,000. To build a Federal Capital to accommodate, let us say, 50,000 people, would cost, with the money already spent, about £6,000,000. At the 'rate at which our predecessors were going on it would take t h i r t y or forty years to have the Capital built. If honourable members want to build a Capital to accommodate 100,000 people, it would take between forty and fifty years at the pace at which it was being built to complete it . It struck us that the best thing for us to do in these difficult times was not to abandon the project, but to cut down the Federal expenditure for the purpose to an amount within our present means. The result haB been that we have suspended the operation of constructing for the present until we are in a position to expend at a rate which will accomplish the object of the Constitution. That is all I have to say on the matter at the present time, but if full particulars are required I shall be pleased to' give them to honourable members. Progress reported. STATES LOANBILL .

389,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Yarra) [10.34] - May I ask the Minister to say whether the con-* sideratiou of the' same business-the Works and' Buildings Estimates-wil l be taken tomorrow until it is finished ?,49
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I hope so.,49

392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [10.35] - We shall go on with the consideration of the Works and Buildings Estimates tomorrow. hope that the ex-Treasurer will come in a better mood tomorrow, for he has behaved very badly today.  mood to-night.",49
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I tell the hon candidly that I am quite disappointed ,49
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"I should like to tell the honourable member, and it is just as' well that the public should know it , that the Senate has no business for tomorrow.",49
395,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,Why do you not find the business 1,49
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"Thes e works are urgent. I should like the public outside, particularly those wbo are unemployed, to know that the honourable mem-, ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has prevented the Works and Buildings Estimates from going through to-night. Mr H i o o s - r deny that.",49
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"The honourable member's denial, I am afraid, does not alter the fact, which has been patent to everybody. What happened to him today I do not know, but he came here to stoDe-wall,"" and ""stone-wall"" he has done all day.  that remark.",49

400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,I have withdrawn it .,49
401,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N SPIRITS,"What satisfaction is it to us when you make a statement, and then proapologize ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - If honourable members will promise to get theee Estimates through tomorrow, I will withdraw everything I have ever said. Tn the first place, we want the Estimates because the Senate has nothing to do. In the next place, we want them because of the urgency of the works themselves. I hope that honourable members will give them bo us tomorrow. Mr TunOR - I notice thab the first excuse is that the Senate has nothing to do. That is more important' than the question of the unemployed. I Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.38 p.m.",49
