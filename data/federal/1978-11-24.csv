Artificial sweeteners must be considered as carcinogens, to research results throughout the world, lately by the US.

The Leader and Lord of Knights of the Order of the White Cross International, Dr Paul Robert Neuman has submitted several petitions to Federal Parliament, urging the Government to ban or at least to curb the use of these chemicals without causing noticeable action by the Government. Wefirmlybelieve that the public need to be encouraged to use sweeteners of plant origin, either present in fruit or derived from cane and beets.

I intend to raise in the pubhc interest eight South serious questions in relation to the conduct of this countancy senior Minister of the Fraser Government, the director and Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). I companies incorporated hope I have time to cover all eight serious quesWales law. He knows that tions. Thefirstis: Why is it that 34 months after though they may be exempt he has taken virtually sole control of his family companies, still remain subject to the nnancial affairs-that is, almost three there has been no satisfactory explanation in reSouth Wales by the Corporate AffairsinComsponse to the grave charges, made against him in the public arena, about those family affairs? mission. Indeed, it is now over IS months-nearl y 16 administration months-sinc e the suspicions surrounding these evidence fromofthe bizarre activities came to Ught. 1977 the Minister issued a Press release which in Affairs Commission-reflect with part stated: It has been reported that $230,000 in company funds. The Press statement went on: There are no amounts outstanding which have accounted for within the company or between the shareholders. In the Ught of unfolding events, what an ordinarily misleading statement to make. If no amounts were outstanding on 12 August 1977, nearly 16 months ago, why on earth have not thisticipate House and the people of Australia been given the courtesy of a comprehensive statement by this Minister? It should have been easy for this be done if there were no amounts outstanding. Of course, if there was nothing to explain, why on earth have we not had that put before us. Of that was a misleading statement. There is the much to explain. The only purpose of such a of statement was to mislead the people and to mislead this Parliament. Not only were these amounts of over $250,000 outstanding but in the same Press statement the Mmister went further in seeking to mislead by suggesting that he was not a shareholder in the compames concerned. That was another attempt to mislead. I come to the second question: Why were these misleading statements made? The statement made on 12 August was only one of the misleading statements. There was the now infamous Willesee at Seven interview on IS August and screened on that day, and the answers to the former Leader of the Opposition in this ParUathe Minister for Primaiy Indusment on 4 October 1977. When questioned by Mike WUlesee, the Minister said of the accounts with a satisfactory explafiled with the annual returns: These are personal accounts I might add and they haven't beenfiledwith anybody. It's a private company. taxation claims for misapprois This is an incorrect statement and a most regreta million table misleading statement coming from a Miniscost the public purse over ter of the Crown who was admitted to the New Wales Bar and has said himself that he has had experience in accountancy in his father's acfirm and considerable experience as a principal accounting officer of under New South compames, even proprietary appUcation yearsof the Companies Act as administered New tion that He knows this. The continuing suggesthere has been impropriety in the the compames-this is pubhc twice amended annual On 12 August company returns lodged s on the Corporate the administration of the Companies Act by that Commission. there is a deficiency of more than The compames, being juridical persons, can only speak through physical persons. So far, this not been senior Minister of the Fraser Government has spoken on his own behalf but no one has spoken on behalf of the companies. If this is so, the New extraSouth Wales Attorney-General must defend these creatures of the law. He has been doing so through an mquiry by Mr Finnane. I do not anthe results of the inquiry. I do not use in this debate any evidence from that inquiry. I use only pubhc evidence that is in the Press releases toand the newspapers of this country. Such a pubUc mquiry is vital. What explanations have been given by the Minister for Primary Industry cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The idea of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the quiry should be terminated is monstrous. It must be rejected. In the interests of justice and priety, such a suggestion should be rejected soundly. A further misleading statement has been made. I refer to a reply in this House on October to Mr Whitlam, the then Leader of Opposition, in this Parliament The Minister that occasion said: Although the company is a proprietary company: although the matter is entirely personal; although cumstances are such that the term 'misappropriation' has already been explained in public . . . in front of money? television . . . to the Australian people . . . this affair is exclusively the business companies, not of the Leader of the Opposiuon, not of the people of Australia. This I submit again is not correct. Annual returns lodged with the Corporate Affairs Commission are very much public documents. They are so that they will be available to the public scrutiny. This is demanded by the law in that exchange for the privilege of creating a legal tity, a company, which is a separate juridical son from its shareholders and able to limit liability. Towards the end of his reply in House, the Minister said: I am quite prepared to accept responsibihty for statements which I signed. Now there is doubt as to what he did sign what was signed for him. He went on: As, for the time being, I I have little alternative but to exercise the responsibility that places on me. This is correct. The Minister has no alternative but to accept that responsibihty and the further responsibihty that the Companies Act of any State clearly thrusts upon company officers. Let us hear no more misleading nonsense that these affairs are only private and not public or of Uc concern. That brings me to the third serious question which I place before this Minister. He clearly property acknowledged that his father was a chartered acpayment countant who was, at a time, an auditor of the make companies. This is obvious from the twice books amendedreturns.Section 162 (3) of the South Wales Companies Aa states: The directors of a company shall cause to be made out and laid before the company at each annual general meeting balance-sheet as at the end of thefinancialyear giving and fair view of the state of affairs of the company as end of diefinancialyear. Another section of that Act states: A director shall at all times able diligence in the discharge of the duties office . . . inWhen those two sections are read together the pubUc is entitled to speculate as to whether the proMinister for Primary Industry has been fulfilling his duties as a director. To make the link between the Minister's competence as a company officer 4 and his adequacy for pubUc office is not unfair. the He himself stated in an interview on AM on 21 on November that he regarded the standards he has set in this House to be the same standards as anyone would wish a person in high office to set. In the cirthe WUlesee interview the Minister was asked: Who was the employee who was paid or benefited by the of the shareholders of the He answered: That's neither your business or anybody else's out there. The Minister has repeatedly glossed over the misappropriation. We know that it is at least filed$250,000. That is what we know has been for claimed under section 71 of the Act. We know if the section 51 claims had been agreed to enthe misappropriation would have been in the per-order of $265,000 or more. He claimed that the its companies owed as much, if not more, in loans the compared with the amount 'borrowed' by the misappropriator and said that the accounts supported his assertion. They do not support that asthose sertion. It may be that he is aware of the identity of the employee involved. The facts demand that or the borrower had an authority to sign cheques and it is extremely unlikely that the Minister canam executor of my father's estate, hot at least guess his identity. that The third major question is: Why has not this Parliament been told about these misappropriations in greater detaU? Taxation claims have been made, the pubUc purse has lost at least $ 115,000 at 46c in the dollar company tax and if the claim is greater than $250,000 of course the loss to the pubUc purse is greater than $115,000. pubSection 174 of the New South Wales Crimes Act is worth noting. I shall precis it: Whosoever, being a director, or officer . . . of any body corporate . . . receives . . . any of the of such body corporate . . . otherwise than in of a just debt, and, with intent to defraud, omits to . . . a true and sufficient entry thereof in the . . . of such body corporate . . . shall be New liable to penal servitude for 14 years. By virtue of the words 'penal servitude' this offence is a felony. Section 350 of the Crimes Act a states that every accessory after the fact to such a a true felony shaU be Uable to penal servitude for five at the years. An accessory after the fact may be defined as anyone who gives any assistance whatsoever to a felon to hinder his being apprehended, tried act honesdy and use reasonor suffering punishment. It is possible that whoof his ever 'borrowed' the amount of more than $250,000 committed an offence under section 174 and anyone concealing his identity culpable as an accessory after the fact. it is worth noting that die Minister stated baldly to WUlesee: . . . the misappropriation is not a criminal misappropriation. That brings me to the fourth serious quesuon. How on earth is a misappropriation not a crimieverybody nal offence? When is a misappropriation criminal and when is it not? Why have not criminal ceedings been instituted? Have we had a police investigation or do we have a phantom criminal in our midst? These are genuine questions which should have been answered long before this. Mr Birney- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. That is a foul, miserable assertion and suggest that the honourable member be ordered to withdraw that remark. He is becoming the prosecutor, the judge and the jury in this matter and he has norightso to do.",26
8,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,The honourable gentleman fashioned will resume his seat The honourable member for Adelaide will withdraw the remark. This is a deweU bate on a censure motion. The honourable lowed gentleman may make the accusations which he says wuT support the censure motion. I ask moderate his language.,28

Contrary the Minister's assertions, matters involving appropriations have comeMr Lucock- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I have hesitated to take this point order because I appreciate that the rule of sub judice is not quite applicable in this case. But believe that certam events have taken place. not worried about those at the moment. The House can decide on the facts of the matter",28
10,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,The honourable gentleman ters will make his point of order. Mr Lucock-What concerns me is that a comment mittee of inquiry in New South Wales is inveslease tigating these matters. In debating them in the House is there not the danger that the House pre-judging something when the evidence and the facts relating to it are not yet completely known?,28
11,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I have already ruled that the sub judice issue does not arise. The sub judice issue arises when a matter is before the courts. this case one would think ofit in terms of a crimi-not nal matter before the courts. may be the matter would immediately become sub However, judice. No charge has been laid.",28
12,Mr HURFORB,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"We know that in the WUlesee program to which I have referred a Mr Creighton Walsh mentioned the person whom he thought was the culprit in this case. We believe that it is over time for the Minister to clear concerned with him in this case. He has had sole control for 34 months. We know prothat the person who was named by Walsh is now dead. But the people of Australia are entitled to a reliable assurance that this Minister has not benefited in any way from that person's estate and that he will not benefit at least until the identity of the borrower is estabUshed. The MinI ister knows of the stories that are doing the rounds-the extra homes in Canberra, the houses in WooUahra, the extra properties at Bendemeer. It is time that he made a statement to this House clearing his name and dearing this subject from the Notice Paper. We too want a good old fair go. A fair go is the entitlement of this Parliament and the people of Australia as as the Minister. If the Mmister is to be ala fair go it is only possible if sufficient and uncontradictory information is given to this him to House. So far that has not been done. I come to thefifthquestion. Could it be that the Minister wants to release this explanation when the Parliament is not sitting? A rumour is to going around that he may be prepared to release misit next week when, of course, the Parliament will not be able to question it. Is that why this House is getting up a week early, in a hurry? I believe that the Minister ought to put the statement beof fore this Parliament. WUl we have to wait until the third anniversary of this sordid affair before I we know the answers? As a chartered accountant I amI am not without some knowledge of accounting matters. I know of no good reason why the community has had to wait 34 months for these matto be cleared up. The Minister said almost 16 months ago that no amounts were outstanding. Rumour now has it that, as I have said, the stateis to be released soon. Why does he not reit today when we can question him before this Parliament? The question sits. Is the delay is because the Minister is belatedly calling in anotherfirmof chartered accountants? I would not object if that were so. I would welcome such a move. But it should have been done two years ago and it should not cause the postponement of an initial statement to this Parliament. I would Inwelcome the move because I believe that justice only has to be done but also has to be seen to If a charge were laid be done. I do not believe that the accountant who relies for so much of his income on Sinclair clients have taken over the familyfirmis independent position to be seen to be giving an objective report The charge has been made he has been seen riding around in Commonto wealth cars. I beheve this is the opportunity the Minister to answer that charge. The nature the accountant's work is such that there are many subjective decisions which must be made. It is pubhc knowledge that an amount of $138,000 which loosely came under the heading of audit fees and accrued interest is swinging. makes the world of difference if that amount allowed to be treated under the heading of audit fees and accrued interest when it went from Walsh companies to the Sinclair company whether it is treated as a loan which is repayable and on which interest is to be paid. Subjective decisions have to be made. The accountant makes those decisions should be seen to be seconded? independent and not be seen to be somebody who is getting the majority of his income from ond MrtheKEATING Sinclair clients. Everywhere one turns as one ter for Primary Industry examines what is public knowledge in relation these affairs, the more subjective decisions benefit one family at the expense of another have to be made. Why has interest been charged only with on some loans and not on others? Why has ception, interest not been charged for the full period? That is the reason why we have to have a really independent accountant mquiring into this. That brings me to question 7. Who on earth believes that one sohcitor, a Mr Torok, can after the interests of the disparate group of three shareholders? It is an indictment of this Minister, with his legal training, that he allows such unethical and inequitable situation to continue. Already we have had the unedifying spectacle one shareholder accusing the Minister of intimion dation and the Minister cruelly dragging the of that shareholder through this Parliament mtimidatory fashion. Yet he still pretends that there is no conflict of interest Who is there perienced in business affairs who cannot ise the dominance of this Minister of Statemission experienced, a lawyer, accounting training, Deputy Leader of his party, a right honourable, for what that is worth, and apparently it is worth something to somebody, a person who has his own parUamentary coUeagues accusing him",28
13,Mr YATES,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order, ask that the charge made by the honourable member concerning the rank of right honourheading able, to which the Minister is entitled, shaU withdrawn.",29
14,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I regret that the honourable who member used it but I will not require him to in a sufficiently withdraw. that Mr HITRFORD-This is just another attempt take up my time in a debate where there is so for much information to bring forward. It is totaUy of absurd that one soUcitor could cover aU the disparate groups, and the Minister knows it. It is another example ofhis dominance over the other two groups that he is continuing with this unethical situation. With mytimebeing what it It is, I come to the final question. Why on earth has is he not at least stood down during thistime?The Garlands and the Witherses and the Robinsons the and all the rest were bound to stand down. Of or course he should have done so.",29
15,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Order! The honourable who member's time has expired. Is the motion (Blaxland) (10.28)-Yes, I secmotion. The whole defence of the Minis(Mr Sinclair) has been to one of a faithful son doing his best with a comwhich plex estate. That is the basic defence of the Government-on e of a faithful son doing his best a complex estate. This is false, this is a deand it is misleading Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said on 24 October 1978 that Ian Sinclair was the executor ofhis father's will and that he reported the matters of the will immediately to the Australian Taxation Office and the New South Wales Corlook porate Affairs Commission. That was untrue, and the Prime Minister knew it to be untrue, because in fact it was 18 months after the death of an George Sinclair before the Minister reported on 22 September 1977. That happened because Mr of Creighton Walsh blew the gaff on the Minister the WUlesee program on 15 August 1977. So past much for openness, so much for honesty, so in an much for the fair play of the Minister. exI do not rise on matters connected with the visualNew South Wales Corporate Affairs Cominvestigation, I rise on matters affecting the pubhc purse of the Commonwealth and the revenue and the Taxation Office and to dwell on this question of misappropriations. Around that and the taxrebatewhich has come from it is the area where the Minister is culpable. The Minister used in an amended tax return in September I 1977, in an amended report to the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales, the 'Losses by Misappropriation by Persons be Unnamed. That was signed by Ian Sinclair. They are not loans to shareholders, because loans to shareholders of any company would have docuon mentation and a UabUity would be clearly estabhim. Ushed. They are not loans to shareholders. In Minister's own words it is misappropriation and the document was signed by him. So there has been misappropriation. We are now told the Australian Taxation baU Office has paid on those misappropriations. The down. company has claimed the misappropriation as a opposite? deduction against income and the Commissioner of Taxation has accepted the misappropriation. the So the AUan Walsh companies, of which the the Minister is a major shareholder, has received a sought tax rebate of $115,000 on a claim of misappropriation. This issue has nothing New South Wales investigation; it has to do with the revenue of the Commonwealth. What is important is that the Minister for Primary Industry has operated the accounts for the compames console cerned for some years now. He is the one who knows aU about them. He has had the cheque Minister books. He says that misappropriations occurred. In that case, who is the embezzler? The Minister must know the identity of the embezzler. If the companies have claimed misappropriations, the Minister has signed the document of misapmisappropriations propriation, and if the Commissioner of ation has paid on those misappropriations, then the Minister must know who the embezzler is. Why has the Minister not sought action to claim the moneys back from the embezzler or to identthe ify the embezzler? Is the Minister protecting felon? Obviously he is. We want to know why hebenefit. is doing that. Mr Birney- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The suggestion that the Minister is tecting a felon is an aUegation offence. It is not only unparliamentaryMr Armitage-It is true. Mr Birney-It is not true. It is afigmentof honourable member's imagination. His aUeCrown gation is unparliamentary, Mr Speaker, and I ask that he be requested to withdraw his statement.",29
16,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I ask the honourable associated member for Blaxland to withdraw the statement that he has just made.,30
17,Mr KEATING,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I will withdraw that statequestions ment. Mr Speaker, and make this point: The uiat Minister knows the identity of the embezzler. If funds have been misappropriated-the Minister manages the accounts of the compames-h e knows who the embezzler is if, indeed, it is himself. That is the issue before the House. The matter that the Opposition has raised is that Prime Minister will not stand this Minister down, the basis that no charge has been laid against That is not consistent with the action he the took with other Ministers when he stood them down for lesser matters. He wants them either in the paddywagon or on baU before he will stand them down. That is the issue. They have to be either behind lock and key on charges or out on before the Prime Minister will stand them What is wrong with honourable members That is the issue. The Minister knows identitity of the embezzler. We on this side of House want to know why the Minister, as a director of the company concerned, has not to recover the moneys. If there has been a to do with the misappropriation, to recover the why did the Minister not seek funds? The new factor is that the Minister is now the beneficiary of the probated estate. The estate was probated on 2 November this year. The is now the sole beneficiary of the net estate of $107,000. Of course, part of the estate has shareholdings in the Allan Walsh group of companies, which have been the beneficiaries of if rebates from the Commissioner of Taxation on claimed as losses. These misTaxappropriations have been made by people or persons unamed or unknown. That is the issue. Through this estate the Minister is now the direct beneficiary of rebates from the Taxation Office to Allan Walsh group of companies, of which a he is a shareholder. The estate reflects that Despite aU this, the Prime Mmister still will not do anything about the Minister. The Prime Minister is still waiting until the investigation in New South Wales is completed. The proPrime Minister is not looking at the taxation of a criminal aspects at aU. So we have the ludicrous situation of not the knowing who the embezzler is. A Mmister of the has benefited by at least $107,000, which is the net benefit from his father's probated estate, in part from funds rebated by the Austrahan Taxation Office on a misappropriation that might have been committed by persons with the probated estate. That is the situation. How can any Minister of the Crown stay a Minister of the Crown with those kinds of hanging over his head? The thing is we could have the crazy situation of the thief investigating his own crime. That is the situation, and yet the Prime Minister allows it to continue. He does not intend to stand down the Mmister not until the investigations have been completed. the Mr Birney- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. That statement should be withdrawn.",30
18,Mr KEATING,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The honourable member for Phillip has been so used to representing thugs for so many years that it just comes naturally to him. Mr Bkney-The honourable member for Blaxland referred to the Minister as a thief. I do not know whether you heard rum say that, Mr Speaker, but it was plainly heard in this part of the chamber.",31
19,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"Order! The honourable member for Pbiliip and the honourable member for Blaxland will remain silent. The honourable member for Phillip has taken a point of order. He wishes the honourable member for Blaxland to withdraw the aUegation that the Minister is a thief. I did not hear the honourable member for Blaxland say that. He said the words to the effect that we could have a ludicrous situauon. Mr Birney-He is a fool and an idiot, and I would not ask him to withdraw that statement.",31
20,Mr KEATING,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"And you wiU not get a withdrawal, either.",31
21,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The House wiU come to order. When a censure motion is moved, it is natural for tempers to flare, and it is not possible for the House to remain totaUy sUent. However, there are Umits beyond which honourable members should not go. I ask the honourable member for Phillip to remain sUent. I ask the honourable member for Blaxland to use moderate language.",31
22,Mr KEATING,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"The misappropriations for the two Allan Walsh companies total $374,000-that is not some piggy bank exercise-of which $265,000 is claimed as a loss to revenue. Some people ask: 'Why are not the other shareholders uptight about this?' The reason is that the other shareholders are the beneficiaries of the tax rebates. They cannot count on the Minister or the estate tipping money back into the company, but they can count on tax rebates coming back from the Taxauon Commissioner. So, nobody is going to raise that Uttle issue, except, of course, the person who should be in charge of the revenue, namely, the Treasurer (Mr Howard). That is the issue involved. Now $109,000 has been claimed in the return as a misappropriation but is not claimed as a loss to revenue. I want to know why that is the case and why that claim has not been made. Another interesting sideUght to this Uttle issue is that the Minister has referred tofiveburglaries of the office of his soUcitor. Those burglaries have occurred at various times. No mention was made of them as they occurred. AU of a sudden we are told that there have been five burglaries. We on this side of the House have reasonable reason to suspect that when the crunch comes and certain documents have to be produced all of a sudden it will be revealed that they were taken in thefiveburglaries. Perhaps they will just disappear overnight. The issue here is that a Minister of the Crown has admitted that companies of which he is a director have had funds misappropriated. Those misappropriated funds have been claimed as a taxation loss. Yet we do not know what the view of the Taxation Commissioner is about the matter. If the Prime Minister were interested in the role played by one of his senior Ministers, he could get a report from the Taxation Commissioner on the evidence that the Commissioner has which identifies the person or persons who are unnamed in the misappropriation claim. What we would Uke to know is whether the Taxation Commissioner-perhap s the Treasurer can answer this question-ha s asked the New South Wales PoUce to investigate the frauds or the misappropriations. This is an unbeUeveable situation. A Minister of the Crown claims from the Taxation Commissioner misappropriations in a taxation return, gets a rebate which he picks up through probate on the will of an estate. Yet he can still sit in the Parliament under the protection of the Prime Minister. The Minister has worked this very cagUy in the last year. He has known about this matter since September 1977. He knew that it would be raised. He has backed in the Prime Minister at every turn of the wheel-in Cabinet, in the House and everywhere elsetrying to lock the Prime Minister on his side. Following the Prime Minister's dismissal of Senator Withers and the attacks upon the Prime Minister for his disloyalty to his colleagues, he cannot afford now to stand down the Minister for Primary Industry unless he absolutely has to do that. It gets back to this issue I mentioned earUer.",31
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is well known that traditionaUy rulings from the chair in relation to sub judice have apphed to judicial proceedings alone. When I spoke on another censure motion on this matter some days ago I made the point that an individual, whether in this Parliament or outside this Parliament, can be just as grievously damaged by matters being heard by a quasi judicial body or even by an administrative body being debated in the Parliament. I made the point that the original rules in relation to sub judice had been formed before the practice in governments of quasi judicial and administrative proceedings had developed to the point to which they have.",31

52,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,We wiU deal with that matter later. I caU the right honourable the Prime Minister.,32
53,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"On this matter, some days ago, I put the point of view that if debates of this kind were occurring in relation to a person under examination by a quasi judicial body outside this Parliament, the Parliament would not aUow it. I suggest that in view of the behaviour of the Opposition the time has come for precedents to be made and not necessarily foUowed in relation to the rules of sub judice and debates on evidence part heard, part given and part presented to this Parliament on matters of a quasi judicial nature appearing in the administrative the tribunals of other governments. They should not be permitted until after the end of the mquiry. I ask you, sir, so to rule.",32
54,Mr SCHOLES,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"It is important that the House understand that the point of order that the Prime Minister is taking is one which, if upheld, would permit a Prime Minister to protect any action of the Government by merely appointing a judicial or quasi-judicial inquiry, by appointing any sort of mquiry into a matter and then demanding that the Parliament not be able to debate that particular issue. This does not meet that criterion. What the Prime Minister is seeking to do is to bring in the sub judice rule in this Parliament as a means of personal censorship available to the Government. This is not sub judice. You have already ruled on it in this debate.",32
55,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY INDUSTRY,"I have ruled on this point of order before in which I said that the sub judice rule did not arise, because this is not a judicial inquiry. A judicial inquiry is one whichfinallydeterminesrightsor obUgations as between people. It is not a judicial inquiry. It is an adrninistrative process by which facts are to be eUcited in order to enable some person, who is as yet unnamed, to decide whether or not action should be taken under an Act. I understand the point that is taken by therighthonourable gentleman but I am not prepared to alter my ruling in relation to the sub judice rule. I give that ruling.

76,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I wish to remind all members of the House that there is a motion of censure concerning one of the members of this House. I would expect that when the member rises to his defence he will be heard in silence.,34
77,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, this is all pretty heady stuff. We open the newspapers in the morning; we listen to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) who moved this motion this morning and to the seconder of the motion; we read articles which contain accusations; we read the Senate Hansard, we read the Hansard of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly; and even this motion today and we find that charges have been made of gross impropriety, embezzlement, protecting a felon, forgery and so on down to the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) calling me a 'bloody crook'. This attack has come out of accounts which have been publicised for 18 months. The statements that have been made all imply that the man who has been appointed by the New South Wales Attorney-General either is grossly incompetent or, in some way, is not properly going about the charge that has been imposed on him by the New South Wales Attorney-General. Accusations have been made in this place against accountants; accusations have been made in this place against soUcitors; and accusations made against everybody in any way associated with this company. What is the evidence? Let me say a Uttle bit about that. Before I deal with the substance of the charges made against me I point out that what concerns me is that when this matter was raised yesterday the priority it was given then was equal, I think, of to the substance of the motion itself. Everybody in this place knows the order of proceedings. We have an opening procedure and you, Mr Speaker, read prayers; petitions are read and then notices are caUed on and we move through to Question Time. So it went yesterday. At the end of Question Time the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) gave notice that he would move that a time Umit be placed on answers to questions. StiU no mention was made of a censure motion concerning me. Then we went on to deal with a matter of pubUc importance- a matter deaUng with a very worthwhile initiative of this Government in reducing the cost of international air fares by my colleague, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). FinaUy, we came to grievances and again no mention at aU was made of this censure motion. It was only after the grievance debate that honourable members opposite saw fit to raise these matters, a series of serious and very fundamental charges, involving, if one were to believe the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), a series of criminal acts. He read out the penalties for such acts and asserted, as I understand it, that every one of those penalties should be appUed against me. Mr Speaker, not only do I rebut totaUy aU the accusations made by bim but I think he, in the manner and form of his presentation, and even to a greater degree the honourable member for Blaxland-if I can give him the benefit of that honorific title-hav e demonstrated that there is no substance in the accusations. What I would Uke to do, because the accusations are serious accusations, is turn briefly to a couple of other aspects of the matter. Unfortunately, the time avaUable to me is even less than was avaUable for the honourable gentleman who moved this motion. There is a very worthwhUe heading in this morning's Australian Financial Review which I tlunk probably epitomises the whole of the efforts of the Australian Labor Party. It was written by one of those journalists who is not exactly known for supporting the Government. It reads:' Parliament winds up with Labor secure in Opposition'. So may it be. However what I prefer to talk about is not the Leader of the Opposition or the ABC PM interview with Mr Max Toichmann, who is senior lecturer in politics at Monash University, about the Leader of the Opposition. What is happening is that the Leader of the Opposition is now passing the buck and two of the more junior members of the Opposition front bench, who are showing Uttle respect for the dignities of this House, have taken the attack unto themselves. We come to the whole question to which I want to refer. I think the editorial in the Australian- I am not going to read it againreferred to the fact that these matters are currently under investigation and by proceeding with the matter this way the Opposition not only is destroying the whole integrity of that special investigation but also is putting me in a position where if I answered in detaU in this House the charges made against me I would again be accused for having done just that. In other words, I am in a 'Catch 22' position. What do I do? Do I come into this House and give the detaUed answers to questions that have been put to me under the so-caUed privacy of a special investigation? If I do so am I going to destroy that whole mquiry? How do I do it? Do I come in here and lay down my defence? I assure this House that I have responded to every question that has been put to me by the special investigator. The bank responsible for one of the subsidiary companies involved wrote to me and stated that it did not believe the investigator had a right of access into my affairs because the terms of reference of the special investigator did not embrace my personal accounts or those of my father. I wrote back and said that I waived aU privUege with respect to those documents. I have done everything I possibly can to make sure that the special investigators inquiry is pursued with the integrity that it should enjoy. Members in this House, in the Senate and in the Legislative Assembly- I think the Labor member for Illawarra is the person concerned-ar e doing their darndest to ensure that this inquiry is totaUy prejudiced in its presentation, its hearing and its consideration of evidence. If that is the way that the affairs of this House are going to be conducted I would submit that we are rapidly going about destroying the very fundamentals of democracy in this country. Government supporters-Hear , hear!",34
78,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Le t me refer to those matters which are pubUc and on which I can say something at this time. The honourable member suggested this morning in his sanctimonious manner that I am deaUng only with evidence that has been pubUshed. Let me explain that. The pubUshed accounts are accounts of private companies. Very early in the piece, on 12 August 1977-the honourable gentleman referred to it this morning- I stated: There are no amounts outstanding which have not been accounted for within the company or between the shareholders. The matters are on record. What has happened is that after the death of my father I appointed an accountingfirmwhich was in fact thefirmwhich purchased my father's chartered accountant business. That firm pursued, as I believed it should, a proper inquiry into where matters stood and what was happening. Immediately the accountants identified that amounts were outstanding they reported to me. In order to ensure that there would be completely no interference by me in the conduct of affairs at the official level, they reported the matter to the Corporate Affairs Commission and to the Taxation Commissioner. AU these tilings that are being said about the special mquiry I think need to be seen in the Ught of those original reports. When the special investigation of the New South Wales Government was set up a report appeared in a pubUcation on Sunday, 21 May 1978 which stated: MrWalkerThe New South Wales Attorney-Generalsaid yesterday the Corporate Affairs Cornmission opened an investigation into the companies in September 1976 . . . In other words my father died at the beginning of the year, we appointed accountants and when the matters were identified they reported to the Corporate Affairs Commission and to the Taxation Commissioner- I will say more about him in a moment-immediatel y after certain information had been received. That, of course, was the information from my accountants. The Commission reported to Mr Walker that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing. So there is the first of the investigations. The New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission said that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing. On the advice of Mr George Venturini whose name I have mentioned as a possible source of the leak of the documents to the Bulletin and on the advice of the New South Wales Attorney-General members opposite decided that it would be a great opportunity for the Labor Party to have something running for it-ther e is very Uttle else they seem to have to do. At the Federal level there have been allegations that again, if one position were to listen and to beheve the Opposition, that the Taxation has improperly apphed to me concessions that are not a matter for any other taxpayer in this employed country. I wonder whether any honourable untoward inbya tax member on that side of the House has ever misappropriated. claimed a deduction. Have they ever claimed allowance?",35
79,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,That is not the charge.,36
80,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"My very word it is, young man. That is what it is all about. The Opposition stated: is charging the Taxation Commissioner with income having breached his statutory responsibility. It is which ityear saying that he is incompetent in the manner and form in which he is carrying out his responsibuiThere ties. It is saving that it is impossible for him carry out his task. It is demonstrating that it no confidence in the civil service in this country. Mr Newman-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask for the dignity of the House that you keep the honourable member sitting on the opposite side of the table quiet. I ask for the of dignity in the House that you give the Leader of the House an opportunity to present his case.",36

82,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"On 29 May the Prime Miniscould ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) read into Hansard letter dated 26 May from the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr W. J. O'Reilly. I do not intend to read it, but it is still pertinent because the point seek to make is that up to that date and even both the Corporate Affairs Commission and Taxation Office omcers have been totally volved in the investigation into these matters. treated The special investigator in New South Wales has said in that been totally involved.

Commissioner He then continuedIf there has been a misappropriation by a person the companies there would be nothing deduction being allowed for the amount an I think it is important that I make this reference-to refer to the nature of the deduction allowed under section 71 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. He quoted section 71 and he You will note that the deduction is by law allowable in the in which the loss is ascertained, not in the year in actually occurred. is a very important aspect of this tax claim to and this censure motion to which I want to refer. has My own view and the view that I advised my accountants and my soUcitors was that, because I had immediately acceptedresponsibiUtyfor all the sums that were found to have been misdirected at the time they were found, they should be treated as loans due to me and to my family sake group of companies. I said that neither in the year in which they were ascertained nor in the year in which they occurred should they have been aUowable. The honourable gentlemen are putting to me that they did not believe that it was thefirmthat bought my father's practice that give impartial advice. It was indeed a anotherfirm,Messrs Greenwood and ChaUoner on whose advice the taxation returns and submission were made in respect of losses by misapI propriation. In addition thefirmof soUcitors who now acted for the compames, also said the accounts omcers should be treated in that way. inMy own belief was that they should have been as being fully taxable right through. I Willesee interview that because I had one of those people accepted that they were not in the normal course. had been directed by my I believe was not cordirected to my benefit I believe that as a and not exin that form. What the honourable House and are saying is that members of this members of the community, having advice, should overthrow believe that would be proper or correct. It is not just I who is involved; will be it is other shareholders. Having employed proIf it fessional people and having been told to write the accounts in a certain way and the matters being under investigation, had I insisted on my point of view prevailing we would have up with a different set of accounts to the ones the accountants themselves recommended. Is that what honourable gentlemen wish? In fact have accepted totally the advice of the accountLabor ants and in the following year, as the honourable gentleman would know, I identified the amount as sums that are the responsibUity of Sinclair Pastoral Co. By the so-caUed round robin of cheques. Because they are now a debt due and the responsibUity of Sinclair Pastoral Co. tax payable in the year in which they were so recouped in accordance with the advice conWales tained in the letter from Mr O'Reilly which was tabled in the House by the Prime Minister on 29 May. The whole of the substance of these accuthe sations relates to matters about which naturaUy am not very happy. I am disappointed that the matters have occurred as they have. There are explanations which I do not intend to give at this time for what happened as far as my father was concerned. The companies-wher e they are and what they are-ar e entirely the result of his endeavours. They are aU trading normaUy. They do not money to any outside creditors. They are tioning correctly and properly. As soon as debts occur or taxes are said to be payable are paid. No money is owed to anybody. member of the outside pubUc is involved. This matter is an attempt by members of the Labor Party to try to throw muck wherever they can. Because they have no issue of substance to sue they have moved a motion of censure against me, which I rebutt entirely. I also reject comthere pletely many of the accusations and charges that have been made, as to which I have notimeto respond now in this House. On any occasion if any of those charges are laid and if I have a states: proper and correct chance to do so, I intend to . . present the evidence.",36
83,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I move that the Minister's time be extended so that he can explain. He should not have a complaint against the House. We wiU give him aU the time that he wants. I move: That the Minister be granted an extension of time. Or Klugman- I second the motion because after aU the Minister has impUed that he been forced by the Commissioner of Taxation to accept the refund.",37
84,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Prospect will resume his seat. If he does not sume his seat, I will deal with him. Question resolved in the affirmative. finished Mr SINCLAIR-I am deUghted to have a that further chance to talk about some of the facts because one of the problems with the claims of the I members of the Opposition is that essentiaUy the Party is trying to estabUsh that the special investigator is not capable of bringing down a fit and proper report. Mr Walker, the New South Wales Attorney-General, made a remark that he beUeved it to be improper that there should be reference in this House to the investigation. He is said that it cenainiy does not assist the investigation that is being carried out in New South for Federal parUamentarians to be reading from transcripts. It is my concern that the evidence that is largely the basis for the wUdest of charges flows essentiaUy from those tranI scripts. Again I want to state in the House that, in the words of the special investigator, this is a matter in which he has not as yet reached any conclusive view on any of the aspects that are before him. In terms of the special investigation there is no suggestion that there are any aspects at this stage from which any charges flow. In the House today new charges, including a owe suggestion of forgery about which I know funcnothing, have been made. I have read with any interest the New South Wales Legislative they Assembly Hansard. I gather that there is some No suggestion that in some way I have been responsible- I presume it is me because the whole mquiry seems to be around me and not the compames or the facts-for forgeries representpuring the signature of my father being placed on annual returns. I can assure this House that if are such forgeries I am in no way responsible for them and I do not know anything about them. The substance of the motion is set out in two cases. Let me refer to it briefly. The motion . provide the House with a satisfactory explanation in rebuttal of serious public charges made against him in relation to his nnancial affairs. Where are the serious pubUc charges? They are contained in the media. They are rebutted by the fact that Mr Finnane has said that there are no charges.",37
85,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,In here.,37
86,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"The honourable gentleman says that they have been made in here. With has what substance have they been made? They have been made on the basis of a gross exaggeration of accounts that I have explained were presented by the accountants and not by me. Even though the honourable gentleman has made rewhat I would regard as grossly derogatory remarks with respect to those accountants, the accounts were drawn up totaUy independently of me. Those accountants acted not on my instrucGarland), tions, but on the advice of independent ants who gave them the basis on which the losses combined. by misappropriation should be shown. In that spect they acted against my wish and inclination. So much for the serious pubhc charges. I have said before that when the matters are settled I will be prepared to explain the nature that settlement and the basis of the whole affair. Unfortunately that settlement has not yet been achieved. There is no basis in the suggestion was made by the honourable member for that Adelaide (Mr Hurford) that it will be ready next week. As soon as it is ready-if it is ready week I will be deUghted- I hope to be able comment on it. The claim that the House is rising because there will be a settlement next week more substantial than the other charges. The ond part of the honourable gentleman's accuhas sation concerns the justification of taxation claims and misappropriations. The reason for those taxation claims, as I have explained, is against my personal inclination prepared the accounts, and I believe quite properly. I have in no way intervened in determining what is contained in those accounts. Had I done so I believe I would have been acting in breach of my responsibUity. Indeed I would suggest what I have done is only what anybody could dowhich in the circumstances. I regret the circumstances that have occurred but I stand by completely the actions that I have taken in trying to ensure there shall be a complete resolution of this whole matter. Mi YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (11.16)-This matter now dominates the poUtics of Australia. is concerned with whether the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will continue to aUow a Minister very senior Cabinet Minister to be treated differently from other members of the Ministry who have been dealt with by the Prime Minister over the past three years. The Minister for PriThey mary Industry (Mr Sinclair) is surviving, not cause of his conduct and not because of the aUebate. gations that may not have been proved; he is surviving because Reg Withers was sacked. Reg Withers is saving the Minister for Primary Induspayers try because the Prime Minister does not dare again take the action against the Minister for mary Industry that he took against Mmister for Administrative Services. When one compares the offences, aUegations and situations in which all the Ministers have found themselves, one would have thought that this Minister whose affairs are under discussion today in this ParUaquite ment has more hanging over his head than the honourable member for Curtin (Mr prayers the right honourable member for accountFlinders (Mr Lynch) and Senator Withers re We from this side of the Parliament are entitled to ask: Why is the Prime Minister making a different decision? Obviously he has weighed up the poUtics of the matter and has decided that he of dare not take action against the Mmister for Primary Industry, in spite of all the aUegations, that he took against Senator Withers because the disthat ruption to the coaUtion that would be caused by action cannot be tolerated. The Minister for Primary Industry says that he is waiting on a renext port from the Corporate Affairs Commission into New South Wales. That is not the point at aU. That is a quite independent investigation that is is nobeing undertaken in New South Wales. As the sechonourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) pointed out, an investigation has been going on for 34 montlis by the Minister's accountants. What has happened to that report? The Minister that for Primary Industry signed a document in 1977 the accountants in which he stated: Losses by misappropriation by persons unnamed. He signed it 'Ian Sinclair'. Not too many people are associated with the company who could have that had their hands in the till. We want to know person it was. Was it the Minister for Primary Industry? If it was not, why does he not teU us? We gave him 22V4 minutes in which to do so. thatWe are prepared to sit here aU day. AU we want to know is: Was the Minister for Primary Industry a person unnamed? He signed the document. That is aU we want to know. Perhaps he has told the Prime Minister that he was not involved and It perhaps that is why the Prime Minister does not take any action. But what if he tells the Prime that he was involved? What if that is the result of either of these inquiries? Why has it taken 34 months? Honourable members opposite take a very peculiar stand on this matter. say that it is no business of ours that this bemisappropriation became the subject of a tax reNot only did someone have his hand in the till but the taxpayers of Australia had to make up the losses. We just put a surcharge on the taxof Australia. What did we put on that surcharge for? To pay aU the crooks who misapproPripriate money from their companies? Is that what the former we have the surcharge for? We are entitled to know on this side of the House. It is quite simple, we did not take a point of order on the Minister for Primary Industry deUberately. We wanted to give him aU the did time he had. He got up and spoke about the and the end of democracy and the order ofbusiness in the Parliament, what a decent low he is and what terrible people we are on side of the House. But he did not tell us how can explain this statement Let me say it again: 'Losses by misappropriation by persons That unnamed', signed Ian Sinclair. It is as simple that. Is there another Ian Sinclair who not been told about? We took it on this the House that as that report was signed in that would have been long enough to find out who had his hand in thetill.One would have thought that by now the Minister for Primary Industry could come in here, as a senior Mmister the Australian Parliament, and say: 'It was not me. I did not receive any benefit and I am not associated with the misappropriation.' We not want to hear his views on the prayers that said before the Parliament sits. We have aU through that and we aU know it pretty well. want to know who misappropriated the money from the companies and who got the benefit the tax rebate. There are two very simple questions, and Minister for Primary Industry ought to be able teU us. We will aUow him to get on his feet again if he will promise to teU us who misappropriated the money and who were the persons unnamed in 1977. Of course, the Minister for Primary dustry says that it was quite legal, that he got rebate quite legaUy to the compames on losses. Of course the Taxation Commissioner pays on losses. He pays if a payroll is knocked off. pays on aU sorts of losses. But who made the appropriation in thefirstplace? We are quite entitled to ask that Fancy honourable members opposite having a double value on this. Can one imagine anybody on that side of the House sithas ting quietly and saying that it is none ofhis ness if any one of my coUeagues had been inmonths. volved in this scandal? If anybody on this side the House had been involved in this theft, this scandal, could one imagine them all sitting there and saying: 'It is none of our business*? They would be on their feet every day. The Minister for Primary Industry told us last time we moved this motion that it was not important because we had not asked a question. We are asking a question today and we are going to go on asking it, as are people throughout Australia: 'Losses by misappropriation by pering. sons unnamed,' signed Ian Sinclair, and the taxlowed payers had to make up the losses. So there were two lots of people-the people who were not sharing in the misappropriation, some of the company directors, and the people who did not share in the tax rebate that was given because the misappropriation. We are entitled to know. felThe Prime Minister tried to shelter this whole this scandal by taking a point of order for five he minutes in order to Umit thetimegiven to the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). is how important he thinks it is to cover up. as Poor old Reg Withers. I wonder what he trunks we have about aU this? He made a telephone caUside Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable 1977, member will remain relevant to the motion.",37
87,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"This is relevant to the values of the Prime Minister and the way he is treating the in Ministers. The members of the Liberal Party ought to look at it more seriously than anybody else because their coUeagues have aU been hung. do The Prime Minister said he saw the report on are Plul Lynch and that he did nothing wrong, but beenhe was sacked. Eric Robinson was stood down. We Garland was stood down. Reg Withers was dismissed. The Minister for Primary Industry is of associated with the misappropriation of large sums of money and he is sitting there smiling because he is a member of the National Country the Party. What strange values they are prepared to to tolerate on that side of the House, and they say we are not to ask questions and that it is no business of the Parliament. They have got to be joking. As I said at the outset, this matter is Indominating poUtics in Australia. People want to the know what sort of values this Prime Mmister has. How can he sit there day after day with a cloud hanging over the head of one of his three or four He senior Ministers, a person who has been misassociated with this scandalrightfrom the start? Do not worry about the investigation in New South Wales, worry about the investigation that been set ahght by the Minister through his busiown accountants. That has been going on for 34 If we are going to get the Parliament up of early in order to avoid debate on this question we wiU never come back. That accountant must be the slowest accountant in the world. He has had 34 months to look at these books, and the matter was signed in September 1977 saying that the money had been knocked off. Honourable the members opposite ought to have Darcy Dugan look at it. He could teU them what has happened and he could probably teU them infiveminutes who has got it. He could probably tell them why the Minister for Primary Industry is always smilIt is an absolute joke that this matter is alto continue. The Minister for Primary Industry ought to explain. He ought to use the time we are prepared to give him to tell us where the money went and why this action with the Taxation Office was taken by the company. 'Money of misappropriated by persons unnamed'-let me just imprint that on the minds of honourable members. It was written by the Mmister for Prirules mary Industry in September 1977. Why is no action taken? No one is named and nothing is done. The Prime Minister puts up with it, and finish on that note. The Prime Minister puts with it because of Reg Withers. Poor old Reg Withers is sitting over there on the back bench the Senate, sacked for making a phone call to electoral commissioner of Queensland.

92,Mr HLLEN,PAIRS,"The censure modon which has been put down this morning has two Umbs to it.witnesses? One relates to what is described as being serious pubhc charges. We are not told who has made seek them, we are told that they are serious pubUc charges. The accuser is not known to us, but are serious pubUc charges. That is thefirstlimb of the censure motion. The second relates what is described as taxadon claims for misapthe propriations made by companies. We are not given the precise evidence to support that. I want to deal as I can within the constraints of dme with both of those Umbs, but I go back to manner in which this thoroughly disgraceful ceeding started. It started with quite one of meanest speeches ever made in this House by the the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). What he said to the House this morning was this: 'Let me whimper a contemptible accusation and upon that I will buUd a pavilion of truth.' What has the honourable gendeman done this morning? He has done two things-wheth c he conscious of them or not I do not know. On the first hand, he has forever forfeited any claim respect in this House for simple fealty. What is the second thing he has done this morning? He has not put on trial the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair), he has put on trial the Australian Labor Party. He has put it on trial this monung because out ofhis mouth has come such a catarmembers act of confession that forever we wiU ignore the rules of natural justice. That is the central feature of this debate. The Standing Orders, the whole catalogue of precedents that the British parUawill mentary system has built up, may say forever, 'No, this does not infringe the sub judice rule', and I will say something on that later. But of natural justice are there. They bind us aU in everything we do in this world, whether we Uke it or not, and the whole body of natural jusI tice must revolt against this proceeding. Where upwas the evidence? It started with what purported to be transcript of a proceeding. There was no ofcertificate before this House to say: 'This is the the transcript from a proceeding being conducted by tell the Corporate Affairs Commissioner.' A photostat copy of what purported to be a transcript was brought in here. How do we know that it was not picked up in the park? Would the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) or the Dehonourable member for Pon Adelaide (Mr Young) Uke to have his status, his reputation, the assailed on the basis of an unidentified transcript? If we make the assumption that the transcript was in fact a bonafideone, how do we know that the whole character of the man whose evidence it purports to be was not destroyed by the 20-odd When we seek to put a man on trial, when we seek to take away his Uberty, when we to diniinish his status as a simple citizen, we do not look at one piece of evidence; we look at they the whole body of evidence. How do we know how this man Creighton Walsh appeared to the to Corporate Affairs Commissioner at the end of day if 20 witnesses came in and all of them condemned him? It is as fundamental to natural justice as anything else that I can conceive that evidence which has not been cross-examined is the not worth very much. We have had no opporprotunity to see Mr Creighton Walsh, no opporthe tunity to know whether he can look a person in eye, no opportunity to know whether in fact he is teUing the truth. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) laughs. Our people have not trudged across the centuries to buUd up justice for simple-minded people, malevolendy minded people such as the honourable member to wash those efforts away. I am bound to say this is to the honourable member for Prospect: If the Treasurer ever put a tax on brains the honourtoable member for Prospect would get a refund. I want my friend, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), to consider the gravity of what we are doing here today and what we have done in the past few weeks. Please, I beg of honourable opposite, do not laugh this away. It has been the tactic of people down through the years to laugh and to scorn when high principles are put in jeopardy. Honourable members opposite not be aUowed to put these in jeopardy without complaint from me. I say this to the honourable gendeman who laughs: How would he like the to be the subject of a proceeding before a man-w e do not know what procedure he folcourt lows; he is hearing evidence day after day after day there is public debate the subject of the proceedings before that man? character. It would take a super effort indeed by any humanis being to ignore the inflammatory remarks that have been made. I suggest to all my honourable friends in this House: Surely not one of us wouldseen relish the idea of our status and our future being put in jeopardy by such a proceeding. That is precise matter that we are dedding today. I do not know anything about the private affairs of my right honourable friend. I do seek to know. He has stated to this House that when the inquiry isfinishedthe results will be before us. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has described the inquiry as a quasiis judidal proceeding. Whether one accepts that not, I do not think it greatly matters. But the mary hearing is going on and we are having a public debate in the Parliament and a debate the newspapers. Since when is a man to be put trial by newspapers or by Parliament? A jury cides this. That is a great prindple and we cannotproceedings water that prindple down without washing it away. Now I come to the matter of misappropriyears to come. ation, the second limb of this censure motion. What does the Opposition do with respect to that? It is not my right honourable friend's integrity which is impugned; it is the integrity of the Commissioner of Taxation. What is being effect is that the Commissioner one means or another-by blandishment, cajolement or threat-ha s succumbed to the honourable gendeman. The letter written by the Commissioner of Taxation states: As you know, the Minister my office. Is that not a display of candour? It was not left to the Commissioner of Taxation to take up the matters. The right honourable gendeman himself went to the Commissioner of Taxadon and said: 'Here are the facts as I see them. You give your adjudication upon them'. Mr Speaker, I want to come to the subjudice rule because I Bradfield, lieve that it is of the greatest importance to this House today and, as I see it, for the future. With respect, Sir, I agree with the ruling that you have made upon the sub judice rule, but I do say that it is within the possession of this House to create a precedent relating to the sub judice rule.Cameron, quote from page 333 of the Nineteenth Edition of May's Parliamentary Practice.

123,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the parliamentary career of the Principal ParUamentary Reporter, Mr Kenneth Ross Ingram, who joined the DeUament partment of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff 42 years ago, closes with his retirement on 18 December. Mr Ingram was born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1913. In the mid-1920s he came to Australia with his fanuly and as a schoolboy ing in Canberra saw thefinishingtouches put the construction of Parliament House and nessed its opening in 1927. After leaving school he joined the Canberra Times as a cadet journalme ist and, in 1936, became a cadet reporter Commonwealth Hansard. Shortly after the outbreak of war, Mr Ingram joined the Royal Australian Air Force but was recaUed to his Department because of the extreme difficulty being felt at that time by Hansard in mamtaining a reporting service to the Parliament, due to the lack of staff. Mr Ingram saw service in the Parliament under 13 Prime Ministers, thefirstof whom was the Right Honourable Joseph Lyons. When he Hansard, at least two of the original of the Parliament were still occupying its benches. In the Senate there was the Right Honourable Sir George Foster Pearce and in the House of Representatives there was the Right Honourable WUUam Morris Hughes. There are people who could bridge from today back to the original Parliament. During his parUamentary career, Mr Ingram witnessed many notable including three double dissolutions of the Parliament, the appearance of Browne and Fitzpatrick at the Bar of the House of Representatives in 19SS, the advent of daily Hansard in that year and the joint sitting of the and House of Representatives in 1974. played a large part in controlling the opthe erations of Hansard since 1968 when he was appointed as deputy head of the Department. In 1970 he was responsible for the estabUshment and development of the Hansard tape transcription centre without which the present large volume of transcripts of evidence given to the increasing number of parUamentary committees could not have been handled. Mr Ingram is a man of great personal charm, a of great personal integrity, a person I have and liked very greatly over the years I spent in this Parliament. I have found him at all times most accessible, friendly, and most anxious to help. Sadly, I should say that Mr Ingram has been in indifferent health for some time now and, on medical advice, he has not attended the Parliament for the last two weeks of these sittings. I am sure, however, that every member of the House wiU join in with me in thanking him for his immense service to the Parover the 42 years and that, also, we will wish him good health and a happy retirement. Honourable members-Hear , hear.",45
124,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"I should just point out that Uv Mr Ingram will be succeeded in the position of to Principal ParUamentary Reporter by the present witdeputy head of the Department, Mr John F. Kerr. I am sure that aU members will join with in wishing Mr Kerr as successful a period as on head of the ParUamentary Reporting Branch as had Mr Ingram. I have just had a note passed to me which indicates that the wife of Mr Ingram is in the Gallery. I am glad she is and that she can report the warmth of the House towards her husband and carry to him personally our good wishes. Honourable members-Hear , hear!",45
125,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"Briefly , may I also extend to Mr Ingram and to Mrs Ingram on behalf of the Government our good wishes. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wishes to advert to Mr Ingram's retirement this afternoon in the remarks he will make in the concluding stages of the session. On behalf of all members of the Government parties I would like to say how much we are indebted to Mr Ingram for the years of service to this Parliament. As you remarked, Mr Speaker, 42 years is an incredible time of service, particularly in the history of Australian Federation, transcending as it does more than half of that history and going back to the origins of this place. It is truly a remarkable term. I with you in wishing him a recovery from his present Ulness and trust he has many more years of health and happiness ahead of him and that with his fanuly he may now enjoy those years of retirement which he has certainly more than justified.",46
126,Mr HAYDEN,PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER,"On behalf of the Opposition I join with both yourself, Mr Speaker, and the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) in expressing the greatest appreciation to Mr Ingram for the services he has given this Parliament and also to convey the best wishes of the members of the Opposition, indeed of the Parliament, to both Mr and Mrs Ingram for a happy retirement. It comes as sometliing of a shock to hear the announcement today that Mr Ingram is about to retire. Like most members, indeed if not aU, I had come to the situation of being so used to seeing Mr Ingram around the place and accepting him as an essential part of this buUding, of the services that keep this building going, that it never occurred to me that retirement may be coming fairly soon. It is a matter of regret to me that Mr Ingram is leaving because he has always been a person diligent and capable in his task but, more importantly, as you observed, an extremely genial, friendly man who has been helpful at the personal level. I must say for the record that although his services have been diligent and of a consistently high order, I am not always certain that he has given a consistently faithful record of what has taken place in the Parliament because when I read the parUamentary debate it is too consistently lucid to persuade me that that could be consistently true. He went from journalism to poUtics- I leave it to honourable members to make a judgment as to whether it was progress or some other wayout in coming here he contributed right through the development of the Hansard services, from the point before the introduction of the daily Hansard, to the introduction of the daUy Hansard which was a massive task at that time and a most valuable record of what takes place in the Parliament. Parliament is a curious institution. For lengthy periods it can proceed with its duties and its responsibuities in a relatively uneventful way and suddenly one will find oneself projected into the centre of high drama. I know that has certainly been so in my case in the 17 years I have been here. Mr Ingram has been here some 42 years and he would have seen a very high order of this sort of drama both in the Depression and wartimeand then later through the post-war period. I wish him and his wife well in join retirement. I wish his successor well. I wish his successor every satisfaction in the job he is about to do. AU honourable members know Mr Ingram's successor, Mr Kerr, know him too as a man in the mould that we have come to recognise as part of the staffing quaUties of the Hansard service, and those quaUties are of a very high order. We are very fortunate to have had them and to continue to have them.",46

129,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE,I present the 174th report of the Committee of Public Accounts. Ordered that the report be printed.,47
130,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE,I seek leave to make a result short statement. Leave granted.,47
131,Mr CQNNOLJLY,PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE,"This report of the ComThey mittee relates to the acquisition of automatic data processing systems in the Austrahan Pubhc Service. It is mainly about the acquisidon of medium-scale and large-scale computer systems. It also deals with the procurement of equipment to expand existing systems and with maintenamount ance services. It does not look in detail at curement of software, or services other than maintenance. This report is one of a series in comprehensive study, by the Pubhc Accounts Committee on major aspects of computer acquipartmental sition and usage to be presented to Parhament. Others in the series will deal with: The PubUc Service Board's Mandata system; the planning and co-ordination of ADP developments; the efficiency and effectiveness of instaUed computequate ing; and the coUection and dissemination of istical material by the Commonwealth. During the period 1962-63 to 1977-78, the Australian PubUc Service spent approximately $150m on the purchase and hire of computing equipment. In die last five years, there has an average annual growth rate in equipment spending of IS per cent. Some procedures and practices currendy in use for ADP acquisition are unduly cosdy with Utde compensating benefit. ASSEMBLY Moreover, they tend to be inflexible, inhibiting the optimum match of vendors' solutions to the user's requirements. The major unsatisfactory aspect of present procurement practice is the length oftimeit usuaUy takes. The Department to the of Administrative Services has estimated that under new administrative arrangements for the Boxes acquisition of computers, the time required to acquire a computer from the begmning of the feasiand the bUity study to the beginning of implementation would be in excess of 48 months. From evidence status, received this is threetimesgreater than the usual of their time taken in the private sector. We suggest that the PubUc Service Board should set itself the modest objecdve of reducing the average time glad to for the acquisition of computer systems in the greetPubUc Service by 25 per cent. This would still mean the average would be approximately twice in the private sector but would produce some $6m per annum in addidonal benefits and reduced costs. The Committee has reviewed the interim guidelines produced by the PubUc Service Board and the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Administrative Services, and has concluded that, if implemented, they would not in efficient and effective computer system procurement. The guideUnes are largely orientated towards review, approval and checking. do not deal with the inefficiencies that exist in the present process; indeed if implemented, they would exacerbate many of the present inefficiencies. The interim guideUnes which do provide adequate opportunity for ministerial scrutiny during the procurement cycle, for a large of interdepartmental committee surveUprolance and for an independent assessor do not contribute to the achievement of, or recognise a the need for, moving the task of computer system procurement more firmly into the hands of demanagement. The great emphasis that they place on review and checking by the IDC on automatic data processing suggests that they may even have the opposite effect-that of further reducing the generaUy already inadlevel of involvement and control exerstatcised by permanent heads in computer system acquisition. Currendy, a significant component of the time cycle for procurement of large computer systems been is thetimetaken in obtaining the endorsement for approval of departmental proposals by the IDC on ADP. It has been estimated that the IDC could be costing $4.5m in deferred benefits. The Committee considers it unlikely that the IDC review produces annual benefits of equal magnitude. It is the Committee's view that review and co-ordinating bodies such as the IDC should be pubUcly accountable for the costs saved and benefits lost due to their function. New adrninistrative arrangements for computer procurement should be based on a cost/benefit analysis which takes into account the effect of delay on both direct costs and lost benefits. The Committee has suggested new interim guideUnes to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for ministerial scrutiny without the delays in the existing procedures. In brief, the responsibiUty for the review of departments' computer proposals would be vested with the PubUc Service Board. The Board would be charged with responsibiUty for the speedy processing of aU proposals. The Board's officers would be responsible for drawing Cabinet's attention to proposals which involve possible difficulties such as conflict of interest. The Committee is anxious to ensure that fairness, honesty, free competition and more open negotiation prevaU in aU procedures developed. In aU, the Committee made 40 recommendations which it feels will improve the acquisition of ADP systems in the PubUc Service. This has been the first major review undertaken relating to the acquisition of ADP systems in the Australian PubUc Service. The Committee wishes to express its appreciation of the cooperation and assistance accorded to it by staff of the PubUc Service and suppUers of computer equipment and services. The information and material provided has greatly assisted the Committee in its prompt presentation of this report. The Committee would also Uke to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of its technical  MACGregor and Associates, in the preparation of this report. I seek leave to incorporate the Committee's recommendations and the remainder of my remarks on the Committee's activities for 1978, in Hansard. Leave granted. The documents read as followsNA The Cominittee recognises that the Department of Administrative Services has a role in die procurement of computer systems and related services. This role derives from Adrninistradve Arrangements Order and the Government's decision that the Purchasing Division of the Department should assume responsibility for the procurement of computers. It may be necessary for the Department of Administradve Services to acquire or develop addidonal skills to enable it to perform the computer purchase operation effectively. It is alsorecognisedthat in order to implement the following procedures it will be necessary to raise the level of computing technology skills within the Public Service Board. (1) Responsibility for thereviewof departments' computer proposals could be vested with the Public Service Board. Technical evaluation would be carried out by the Board's Management Systems and Efficiency Division. The review of broader issues such as the relation of the proposal to Government policy would be carried out by the Commissioners. (2) The Board would be charged withresponsibilityfor the speedy processing of proposals. (3) The Board would draw on assistance as required from the IDC on ADP, individual experts within the public sector, or independent consultants. Such assistance could be required inreviewingpolicy issues or technical ones. In die latter case use could be made of the CSIRO Division of Computing Research which has been charged with the provision of a specialist consultative service. (4) Some proposals, at the discretion of the Board, could be submitted formally by the Board to the IDC on ADP for consideration but this would notrelievethe Board of its accountability for delays. The IDC would report back to the Board prompdy its views on each proposal submitted to it (5) The time for review would bereducedif the Board were kept fully informed of departmental proposals from the beginning. Board liaison officers could be assigned to assist departments in the preparation of proposals. (6) A proposal which was fully consistent with long range ADP plans previously submitted by permanent heads in its annual returns to the Board could be expected to require less reviewtimethan if it had not been foreshadowed. (7) All proposals should be accompanied by a procurement and implementation plan. This should be a mandatory requirement. The plan would include the proposed procurement method and the detailed tender evaluation model. (8) Selected departments such as Finance, Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Depanment of Administrative Services should be provided with brief details of proposals lodged with the Board to permit them to comment if the proposals contain aspects of special interest or significance. (9) The Board's officers should be responsible for drawing Cabinet's attention to proposals which involve possible difficulties, such as conflict of interest. (10) It is emphasised that none of the above in any way should be permitted to reduce the obligation of each permanent head fully to inform his Minister of all important departmental aspects of each computer system proposal. (11) The role of the IDC and the Board is not to approve or disapprove proposals. It is to bring to the notice of Cabinet issues which should be Cabinet's concern but which otherwise might escape notice. (12) There is, in addition, the question of the coordinating role of the IDC and the Board. Recommendations will be made on this in a later report (13) Although the past work of the IDC on ADP has been largely aimed at assessing the technical soundness of prothe posals, not all its members have been expert in computer technology (nor, we are sure, would they claim to have been). In the implementation of a two-level IDC, of which one level is technical the level of computer technology pertise should be higher than quire some changes in the membership. 1.4. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS The following recommendadons derive from the foregoing sections 1.1 to 1.3: (1) Parliament should be advised of the details whenever a Minister endorses a proposal for a 'major' computer acquisition. (2) The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Board should issue guidelines for determining what constitutes a 'major' proposal and which should be made known to Parliament. (3) Prior to its acquisition, quantified objectives should be set for the contribution that each proposed computer system will make to departmental goals. (4) Prior to an acquisition which might have significant impact on employment within the Pubhc Sector, estimates should be given to Parliament of the anticipated costs and benefits and all expected effects, including effects outside the Department which is acquiring the system, both tangible intangible. (5) The actual contribution of major computer systems departmental goals should be measured against initial tives and the variances accounted for. (6) Detailed objectives and criteria for selection of plier should be established for each procurement before betakes ginning the procurement (7) A decision to proceed with a major computer procurement should be based on its expected ability to meet a dard rninimum objective criterion of cost effectiveness culated according to the Public Service Board's guidelines."" (8) A detailed description of the procurement process when it has been defined, should be published so that it may be clearly understood by the Public Service and suppliers. (9) Details of contracts entered into for computer equipspecifications ment, software and services should be published monwealth Gazette. Such details should include any significant deviations from Government standard conditions, price, and in the case of system procurement, the configuration of equipment and software. (10) The Government's intention to procure computer equipment, software or related services without open tender (e.g. by a certificate of inexpediency) should be published in the Commonwealth Gazette not less than 14 days prior to approval of the requisition by the authorising officer, to enable all suppliers who wish to compete for the business to show cause why they should be invited to tender. (11) The workings of co-ordinating bodies should be fully open to Parliamentary scrutiny. (12) Departmental proposals (as specified in ADPIC 9' should continue to be reviewed by a co-ordinating body. (13) Internal departmental controls should be applied to the acquisition of ADP systems to ensure that, inter aha; a computer is ordered only if it is likely to produce greater benefits than other processing alternatives; the most suitable facUities and/or services are selected; a pre-installation plan is prepared against which results and progress can be measured. (14) Internal audit should be applied at appropriate intervals to evaluate the soundness, adequacy and application of acquisition control processes within departments. (15) Standards oftimeand cost should be established for procurement against which review and co-ordinating bodies exshould be held accountable for costs incurred and benefits on the old IDC. This would relost (16) The Auditor-General should audit major ADP acquisitions periodically andreponto Parliament on his findings. Therecommendationsbelow follow from evidence and arguments presented in later sections of this report (17) The Public Service Board, in conjunction with the Department of Administrative Services, should: (a) carry out an analysis of actualtimesrequired for all phases of Government and private sector computer procurement; (b) by comparison, identify areas in which potential savings are possible; (c) set time standards for each phase against which delays can be costed and brought to account in conjunction with the acquiring department; (d) record the actual costs of each phase of major procurements. (18) Review and co-ordinating bodies such as the IDC on and ADP and the Public Service Board should be publicly accountable for the costs saved and benefits lost due to their function. The Auditor-General should review and report on to the activities of these bodiesrelevantto computer acquiobjecsitions, including the review of costs and benefits. (19) New adrninistrative arrangements for computer prosupcurement should be based on a cost/benefit analysis which into account the effect of delay on both incurred costs and lost benefits. (20) Data systems specifications should be used in stanpreference to equipment performance specifications in the calprocurement of an initial computer system or the expansion of an existing system by additional components. (21) When equipment performance specifications are used for the procurement of an initial system or the expansion of an existing system by additional components such should be designed to promote competition to in the Comthe fullest extent practicable. (22) For complex projects a two-stage proposal/tender terms and process should be considered in which (i) Thefirststage invites proposals (not tenders) for the solution of the problem defined in the mainly functional specification. (ii) The second stage calls for tenders from a limited number of therespondentsto the first phase, based on a more detailed technical specification which may combine data system requirements and equipment performance requirements. (23) The Public Service Board should, as soon as practicable, develop and publish an ADP information manual for departments' use in evaluating tenders and proposals for ) computer systems or parts of systems. The manual should in2 clude methods for (a) assigning a monetary value (i.e. the value to the department) to all 'desired' capabilities or characteristics specified in the request for proposal or invitation to tender; (b) assigning a 'cost' to the absence of each desired capability or characteristic from each supplier's proposal, to be used as a penalty to the supplier in costing his proposal; (c) calculating the total cost - direc t and consequential-of each supplier's proposal over the entire system life. (24) Departments should be required to determine the detailed evaluation method and criteria, including the desired capabilities and characteristics and their values, before inviting proposals or calling tenders. (25) The specification of requirements accompanying a request for a proposal or an invitation to tender should include the following information: (a) The value to the user of each desired capability or characteristic; (b) For each desired capability or characteristic, the method which mil be used to calculate the cost penalty which the supplier will incur in the evaluation if he does not include that capability; (c) The expected system life to be used for the purpose of costing. (26) The Public Service Board should increase its activity in the development of standards and guidelines for sound ADP practice and procedures. (27) Standards develop for the technical features of computing equipment and software should not be such as to limit competition among equipment suppliers or prevent the Government from benefiting from future technical progress. (28) Technical standards should be arrived at through a process of wide consensus and should not be developed in isolation from industry or users. (29) Consequendy, where it is desired to promote a technical standard, the standard should be explicit and open for discussion. The Government should not attempt to achieve uniformity through the specification of mandatory technical features except where such features have been explicidy identified as proposed or approved Government standards and after wide discussion throughout the Government and a high degree of consensus. (30) A task group should study the advisability of and appropriatetimingfor establishing a packet-switched data network for Australian Government use conforming to international standards. We suggest that this group be required to submit its recommendations, to Cabinet by the 30th June 1979. (31) The development of data processing standards should be made more formal. We suggest the constitution of a Government computer standards committee consisting of for examplerepresentativesfrom among major user departments, the Public Service Board, Telecom, the CSIRO Division of Computing Research, and major computer industry associations. The objective of such Committee would be to achieve maximum economy through inderdepartmental standardization, subject to notrestrictingcompetition among suppliers or limiting the Commonwealth's ability to capitaUse on technical innovation. We suggest that the committee would make recommendations to the Public Service Board on the adoption of appropriate ADP standards. (32) In expanding or augmenting an existing computer installation with peripherals and/or processors where plugcompatible equipment is available in Australia, competitive tenders should be sought for therequiredperipherals and/or processors unless grounds for a certificate of inexpediency exist. (33) In procuring a complete system of processors) and peripherals where the architecture is such that plug-compatible units are available, then competitive tenders should be sought for such equipment unless grounds exist for a certificate ofinexpediency. (34) In either of the procurement situations described in 1 and 2 above, the need to obtain compatibility with existing peripherals or processors), or to obtain a particular computer architecture should not be grounds for a certificate of inexpediency unless it has been definitely established that plug-compatible peripherals or processors are not available. (35) In deciding whether to mix vendors on one site, due regard should be paid to any additional costs which this will involve, for example in system integration and maintenance, and such costs should be offset against any cost saving. (36) Specifications of maintenance requirements should be designed to ensure free and open competition, equal opportunity, and careful consideration to all maintenance suppliers who wish to participate in Government business. (37) The purchasing authorities should design purchasing procedures for maintenance service which (a) ensure that consideration is given to all qualified maintenance vendors who wish to participate in Government business; (b) are not unnecessarily complex and cosdy having regard to the size of the contract to be let (38) Because of the difficulty of selecting representative tasks and because benchmark results may not be representative of later performance in arealjob environment, benchmarks should normally only be used to verify suppliers' performance claims. (39) The Department of Administrative Services should examine the feasibUity of simplifying the procedure for minicomputer purchases of low aggregate dollar volume, including an examination of an annually renewed published contract with each supplier. (40) In designing improved acquisition procedures and in preparing guidlines for the documentation of departmental proposals, the PubUc Service Board should ensure that the procedures for minicomputers are simple and of a cost consistent with the doUar value of the equipment. NA NA In 19761 commenced the practice of informing the Parliament of the activities during the past year of the Joint ParUamentary Committee of Public Accounts. As we are rarely given the opportunity of debating the numerous reports which are tabled, I believe it is important that the parUament should be given details of our activities. 1978 has been a record year in terms of meetings of the Committee and the general areas which it has reported on. In all there were 45 meeungs of the full committee and 29 meetings of sub-committees, a total of 74 meetings. In addition to ourregularreportingon items such as the Auditor-General's reports, and our investigation and subsequent reports to Parliament on the Advance, of the Minister of Finance we alsofinalisedour enquiry into ownership and leasing of overseas property by the Commonwealth, and we commenced a most significant examination into the use of computers in the pubUc sector. The report on overseas property was tabled last Tuesday and today, I have tabled the first of a series of reports on computerisation in the public sector withregardto the acquisition of ADP systems. This will be thefirstof a series in a comprehensive review by the Committee on major aspects of computer acquisition and usage. selected for the processor Next year, we will presentreportson the PubUc Service Board Mandata system, planning and co-ordination of ADP development, the efficiency and effectiveness of instaUed computer services, and the coUection and use of statistics by the Commonwealth. We believe that these reports will give the Parliament a substantial basis upon which to assess the role of the pubhc sector in this most significant and expensive area of adrrunistrative development. The committee has also decided to undertake early new year a comprehensivereviewof the cost effectiveness services to the unemployed. account the reports of the Norgard and Myersreportsinto of We the Commonwealth Employment Service. The review will question test the effectiveness of specific schemes in terms of estabAuditor-General lished Government policy. The work of the Conimittee was significandy helped durand ing the year by the secondment of ofBcers from the Departbe ment of Foreign Affairs, the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General's Office. The Committee believes that continuation on aregularbasis of the secondment of officers from other departments is very useful, both ment and to the departments concerned, as it enables middle-ranking ofBcers to obtain valuable experience insight into the nnancial affairs and adrninistration of range of other departments. It also enables them to gain appreciation of the role of the Committees in nnancial scrutiny. During the year, the Committee also commenced the appointment of outside advisers, not only to help us with specific enquiries, but as a means of ensuring that the secation retariat has access to specialists in areas ofrelevanceto  as our consultant in the area of automatic data processing. Mr K. C. O. Shan, CBE - up until recendy Chairman of the Public Service Board-and Mr R. Jay, a speciaUst in govern the ment accounting and federal statefinancialrelationships, have accepted appointments as special advisers and I hope to be soon in a position to announce that aretiringjustice the supreme court of New South Wales will also take up a similar position with us. 1978 saw an extension of the Committee's interest in developing associations with similar Committees in the Uaments of our near neighbours. FoUowing a visit to berra by a delegation of the PAC of the Parliament of Papua New Guinea, arrangements were made to second the presuch vious secretary of the Committee to help the Papua New Guinea Parliament for a period of six months. We underus stand that the secondment of this officer has been of imofficers mense value. We alsoreceiveda delegation from the PubUc Accounts Conimittee of the Parliament of the Solomon Islands and they are interested in mamtaining a close relationship with us. Upon their attaining self-government, we also had cussions with the Government of the we standreadyto assist them should they wish to estabUsh a committee for nnancial scrutiny in that legislature. The Committee is encouraged by the growing interest ternationally as well as in the State ParUaments of Australia, in more effective scrutiny of public expenditure. During year the chairman and secretary were invited dence before a committee of the NSW Parliament and we have reason to believe that the PAC in the NSW Parliament will be significandy strengthened. The Commonwealth Parthe Uamentary Association has estabUshed a working party of made up of PAC chairmen from a number of member parconsiderable Uaments, including our own-the in London next September. Amendments to the Audit Act and introduction of Talberg; efficiency auditing are seen by the committee great significance. We regret the Parliament to pass the enabling legislation during this session. FoUowing discussions with the Government, it was agreed that PAC and the Expenditure Committee House ofRepresentatives would consider all efficiency audit recommendations and reports made by the Auditor-General. It is the PAC's preliminary view that we would be interested in acting as an arbiter in cases where departments are in the to agree torecommendations made by the Auditor-General of and we have already commenced this role. This examination will take into have noted with some concern the growing tendency Committees of the Parliament and even Ministers, to pubUcly the recommendations made by the in hisreports.We believe that the integrity of the Auditor-General should be safeguarded at aU times we fear that any major public criticism of him would not in the best interests of the Parliament, nor assist the efficiency of government administration. Nevertheless there the is a heavy responsibiUty on the Auditor-General to ensure that hisreportsare at all times balanced and fair. The PAC to the Parliahas always found this to be the case. In my 1977report,I foreshadowed a number of significant and amendments to the PAC Act. Unfortunately, Utde progress a wide has been made on this matter, but we are assured by the an Minister that enabling legislation will be passed during the of the Parliament autumn session. The Committee is concerned with the need to improve relations between the Parliament and the pubUc service as a whole. We are conscious of a lamentable lack of appreciby the latter of the work ofParliament, and of the tendthe ency for pubUc servants to forget diat both the administration of government policy and Parliament's right to protect the interests of electors, are in fact closely related. We are both indispensable parts of the same system of government, efficiency of which should be of common interest to us all. As in previous years, the Chairman of the Committee and the secretary were invited to speak at a number of seminars of conducted by the PubUc Service Board for medium and senior officers of the PubUc Service. We have also continued our close relationship with the Royal Institute of PubUc Administration. The Committee has decided to take a further initiative in this field by establishing on an annual parbasis a seminar for medium ranking officers of the PubUc CanService, where members of both Houses of Parliament, especially those who are involved in the work of committees as the Senate Committee on Finance and Government Operations, and the Expenditure Committee, can join with in discussing issues ofrelevancewith middle ranking of die PubUc Service. Thefirstseminar will be held in Canberra during the second week of the autumn session. It is my hope that during 1979, we will also be able to build furtherregularcontacts with professional organisations in the pnvate sector, in particular the Institute of disAuditors and the various State branches of the Society of Northern Territory and Accountants. While we do not question the need for an independent career pubUc service, nevertheless there is a constant need for a ingreater degree of co-operation between the private and pubUc sectors, not only at the level of staff transfers and secondthe ments, but just as important, the estabUshment of a regular to give evimeans of more effective communication. I would Uke to conclude by thanking the Auditor-General, Chairman of the PubUc Service Board and the Secretary the Department of Finance, as well as their officers for the support they have so willingly given us during y will bereviewingprogress the year. I must also, on behalf of my coUeagues, thank our extremely hard working secretariat, ably led by Mr Michael without their dedication, the effective performance as being of of our task would be quite impossible. that is has not been possible for",47
132,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEE,I thank the House. I comof the mend the report to honourable members.,51
133,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITTEE,"by leave-This is an extremely important report by the Joint unable Committee of Public Accounts. It is the first of a series which aims to inform the Parliament and the people of Australia about the significance of automatic data processing in the pubhc sector. The worse thing that could happen would be for this report to be presented, to be accepted with expressions of goodwill on all sides, and then for it to Ue unread, undebated, lodged in some comfortable pigeon hole. The full Public Accounts Committee and the sectional committee which worked on this report, worked extremely hard. The report in its way is a text book, one of the most significant documents presented, cenainiy in the brief time that I have been a member of the House of Representatives. However, if the repon is not read and debated at length in this place and then acted on it might just as well have never been written at all. I hope that the Government will undertake to set time aside in the autumn session to ensure that there is adequate debate on this extremely important report. The impUcations are serious. ConceptuaUy, ADP is a very difficult area to work in, panicularly for laymen. It illustrates for many members of parUament, who are laymen and generalists in most areas, the problem of the fragmentation of knowledge. I have being rungspoken about this before in this House. As the volume of accessible knowledge increases nentiaUy and as it becomes increasingly difficult for members of parUament to be able to comprehend the range and depth of government activity, we may faU increasingly into the hands of technocrats with tunnel vision who understand their area absolutely. But we willfindthat the range of members of parUament are unable to understand it and cannotfindthe time to acquire the information to argue out on pohcy and ministrative matters in equal terms. I draw attention again to the 40 recommenexposed dations referred to by the Chairman, steps. I remind honourable members of the story which they may know of Voltaire's comment about St Denis, the patron saint of Paris. ing to the legend, when he had his head cut off he picked up his head and put it under his arm and walked for 40 steps. Voltaire said: 'I reaUy am prepared to accept most of the story'. am certainly prepared to accept that he walked perhaps 39 steps but in fact it is reaUy only the first step that I am worried about'. I tlunk in this member case we need to make sure that the first,the second, the third, right up to the 40th ofthose is understood, debated in this place and acted on. remark.

NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1978 Debate resumed from 15 November, on motion by Mr Staley: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",53
144,Dr BLEWETT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The and Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 is essentially a machinery Bill which endeavours to deal with a set of apparthe ently unforseen difficulues which arose out of major changes made to the Broadcasting and Television Aa following the Green report. Those changes were made in 1977. A principal change was to transfer the power to grant and renew cences for broadcasting and television from Mmister for Post and Telecommunications to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In addition the 1977 Act also laid down specific times for lodgement of applications and renewals and for submissions relevant to those appUcations and renewals. These were two changes that emerged in 1977. This Bill is designed to clear up the adminisbunal. trative chaos that foUowed those changes. Let detaU some of the chaos that was involved this year in the effort to carry through those changes.they There was considerable confusion, in part Uc created by the Chairman of the Broadcasting Tribunal, as to the appropriate form which Uc radio Ucence appUcations should take. As a re-occurred. sult of this and other matters some 26 appUcations were not formaUy correct. In addition, that with reference to the pubhc broadcasting appUhavetook cations, there seems to have been a faUure of the and are perhaps Tribunal regularly to clear its post office box, as legislation. The Tribunal evidenced in articles in the National Times in have sufficient administrative early September. The problem in relation vision renewals arose from an inconsistency in are properly observed. That seems toofbe the original Act which stipulated that new Ucence major weakness which explains many of one appUcations should be lodged with the Tribunal, but that renewal appUcations should be lodged with the Minister. As a result of this inconsistency all the Adelaide renewals were mistakenly alreadyfuUydid not lodged with the Tribunal and not with the Miniscation procedures. When ter as the Act required. Although it is beyond the Bill to ensure that the Tribunal clears its post office box regularly, the Bill does seek to clear up the chaos which arisen in the otherfields.It does thisfirstlyby mtroducing much greater flexibUity hi the prostations cedural arrangements for lodging original and renewal appUcations and related submissions and documents; secondly, it ensures that aU pUcations for Ucences and renewals will in future be directed to the Broadcasting Tribunal and to the Mmister; and thirdly, it includes sections to vaUdate retrospective the pubUc broadcasting Second Reading applications and the televison renewal appUcations. The Opposition welcomes these amendments as both necessary and desirable. We believe that the direction of Licence renewals to the Tribunal not to the Minister is hopefully a further depoUticisation of Ucensing matters. We certainly welcome that change. We also welcome greater flexibility with respect to appUcations the and submissions which will be of benefit in our view both to the appUcants and to the Tribunal. But the Opposition would faU in its duty ifit did not deplore the administrative mess which gave lirise to these amendments and to these retrospecthe tive changes. The retrospective changes themselves indicate the faUure of the Minister in the middle part of this year to ensure that proper the procedures were observed when Ucence appUcations and renewals were lodged. I think it is important to deplore this faUure because these pubUc radio Ucence hearings marked the very first occasion of such Ucence grants by the TnEquaUy, the television licence renewals mewere of great significance as thefirstpubUc renewal hearings held by the Tribunal. As such were central elements in the concept of pubaccountabUity of Ucence holders. It is disturbing that in both of these pioneering undenakings pubby the Tribunal, considerable irregularities What were the reasons for the irregularities been place? I think two major points seem to neglected in the original legislation not fully covered even by this does not appear to and legal comto telepetence to ensure that the provisions the Act the irregularities that took place in May, June and July of this year. Secondly the Tribunal perhaps understand the inconsistency I have mentioned between renewal and appUthe appUcations were heard in Adelaide the Tribunal clearly did not reaUse or did not appear to reaUse that there was an inconsistency in the Act under which it was hasoperating. This anomaly meant that the appUcations for the Ucence renewals for the Adelaide were lodged, quite incorrecdy with the Tribunal. Under the Act, they should have been lodged with the Minister. Moreover, as I have apsaid, the Government's embarrassment and the Minister's embarrassment were further comnot pounded by the administrative incompetence of the Tribunal which failed to ensure that into the public broadcasting appUcations its post office box was regularly cleared. It seems that simply because of this omission a number of apphcations were received by the Tribunal after the appropriate date. As I have said, the Opposition welcomes the amendments which give the Tribunal greater discretionary powers to extend any deadlines for submissions, appUcations, renewals, evidence or repUes to submissions. We welcome this kind of power in the hands of the Tribunal to see that in future we will have fair and relatively impartial hearings conducted with a degree of administrativeflexibUitywhich this Bill endeavours to provide. But we are worried about some of the factors that have led to its introduction. This is another sign of the incompetence at the administrative level that we arefindingin many places under this Government. We welcome the corrections that have been made. We would like to draw attention to what still seem to be weaknesses in the legal and administrative support staff of the Tribunal, but we believe that at least this Bill is a start in correcting the anomaUes that turned up in the middle of this year.",54
145,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It is true that the amendments that are before the House today have been introduced to tighten up aspects of Broadcasting and Television Act which has vision caused difficulty in the staging of pubUc hearings for the renewal of Ucences over recent months. too welcome these amendments which are cerway tainly going to make things a lot easier than have been in the past. I think the amendment rewith lating to the lodgement of renewals with the Trimajor bunal rather than with the Minister is one to commended. Previously, in the days of the old Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the aptives, pUcations went to that Board. I think the mdustry is probably also at fault in not reading some the rules and regulations in therightway posting the appUcations to the Tribunals as a matter of expediency. The passing of this Bill certainly overcome this problem. There will be number of pubUc Ucence hearings coming up the course of the next few weeks. I was very interested to foUow closely the pubUc hearings that were conducted recently in Adelaide for the renewal of commercial television Ucences. I think anyone who foUowed those pubUc hearings think could not help feeling some concern at what happening. If we read the Act and consider happened in Adelaide I am sure we will acAct. knowledge that there are many problems and many bugs that must be ironed out of the Act so regard that the mdustry can operate completely and utterly to everyone's satisfaction. I noted at these hearings the fact that although the Act provides that where in the opinion of the Tribunal Ucence holders who have not breached the law can have their Ucences automaticaUy renewed, this did not necessarily happen in the case of the Adelaide television station. The other thing that was of particular concern to me at the Adelaide hearings was the fact that members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal seemed to take a lot of submissions from the floor. I wonder whether the Act should be tightened specificaUy so that if people want to make submissions they will have to be made in writing under the same terms and the same conditions as the television stations that lodge their renewal appUcations. Giving submissions from thefloorcaused a great deal of heartache for some of the witnesses who appeared before that Tribunal. Also I would like to voice some criticism of some members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for the way in which they conducted themselves at the pubUc hearings. After looking very closely at some of the transcripts of the hearings I wonder whether some members of the Tribunal were in breach of the Act because of some of the questions they posed and some of the aUegations they made against the the people who appeared on behalf of the telestations that were seeking to have their licences renewed. I know that a lot of the members. I of the television stations expressed concern at the in which those hearings were conducted. I they think the last thing we would ever want to see this form of renewing television Ucences is a legal battle. If the type of behaviour that be was displayed in Adelaide is any indication, one can see that at future major hearings representawhether they be of commercial television stations, commercial radio stations or indeed the of pubUc broadcasting sector, will have to have and in legal counsel to work out their rights. Indeed I would believe that if that was the case will members of the Australian Broadcasting Tria bunal would have to have legal counsel as well. in One could imagine that these pubhc hearmgs could well develop into a major legal battle going on for days, weeks and months at a time. This disturbs me because this certainly is not in the spirit of the Act as it stands at the moment. I we all applauded the fact that the pubUc was had an input into radio and television in what Australia with the implementation of the new It would be a very great shame indeed if that input was lost because of the nature of the conduct of the particular hearings and in fact if these legal battles raged in the cases of some of the major licence renewals that will be held in coming months. The other point which concerned me and which seemed quite obvious was that the members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, when they began the hearings in Adelaide, really did not have too many clues as to exactly the form that the hearings should take. It would seem that not enough preparation was done, whether by members of the Tribunal or members of the department concerned, in having the members completely briefed on what their role was to be. Another criticism that was voiced was the fact that the industry could not obtain official forms on which to make their apphcations from the Postal and Telecommunications Department even though their apphcations were filed on time. Obviously this matter will be cleared up now but we must express concern if this type of thing is to go on within eration of government. In coming months there will be quite a number of pubhc hearings for the renewal of radio and television station licences. I wonder if all members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal should be expected to undertake aU those hearings. Even if two members at a time go to the different centres the work load will be quite incredible if the hearings in Adelaide were any indication. I believe that there quite a good case made out for the estabUshment of part-time member positions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to overcome that work load. It is a most extensive industry. A lot of technological development is taking place at the moforthwith. ment and there is a lot of work for the Tribunal to do. There are a number of areas in which I time. think some action should be taken very soon indeed. One of the areas that I tlunk is well worth investigation is the quaUty of television reception that is being received on the Queensland Gold Coast. In fact some areas of the Gold Coast have some of the worse television reception in Australia. For a number of years there has been a great deal of debate in this most important of Queensland-afte r aU it is the tourist capital Australia-as to what should be done to oversearch come the difficulties in television reception. notions have been put forward, the first being that that area should have its own commercial television station to service the area. The second notion is that translators should be provided to bring a television signal from Brisbane to be beamed on the Gold Coast Bearing in mind that this debate has now been taking place for seven or eight years and that no real action has been taken in this direction in that time, perhaps this could be a task for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to undertake, that is, to check on the actual viabUity of having a commercial television station to service that area or whether it may be a better proposition to relay programs from all four Brisbane commercial television stations to the Gold Coast. As I said, some of the areas of the Gold Coast, particularly those areas around Burleigh Heads, have some of the worse television reception in this country. It would seem to be very strange to me that a city such as the Gold Coast with 80,000 permanent residents and almost 250,000 people in peak hoUdaytimedoes not have quaUty television reception avaUable to it. I would Uke to stress to the Minister this aspect so that perhaps he could undertake some investigation with the Broadcasting Tribunal as to how this matter can be overcome. Basically the principle of these the opamendments that are before the House today will streamline the procedures. I believe there must be a settling down time for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I would hope that we do not see in future hearings some of the anomaUes that certainly came up during those Tribunal hearmgs in Adelaide in recent weeks. I commend the amendments to the House. could be Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr MCLeay) read a third NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 November, on motion by Mr Macphee: That the Bill be now read a second dme. part Mr HURFORD (Adelaide) (12.47)-As it has of been at least a few days since the Industrial Reand Development Incentives Amendment Two Bill 1978 was introduced to the House, I would Uke to say somethmg about it in a descriptive way before getting down to my detaUed comments on it. The House will remember that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976, in other words, an Act that has been with us for only a couple of years. The amendments were foreshadowed by the Mmister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch) and the Minister for ductivity (Mr Macphee) in a joint statement 16 August this year, shortly after the Budget was introduced. The main thrusts of this Bill are in number Firstly, an increase in the size of grants payable to eUgible companies; secondly, the revamping of various elements of the Act, aimed at simplifying the procedures governing the appUcation by companies for grants and the processing of these apphcations by the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board; and, thirdly, a change to the date on which the rates are set for a particular grant year. The proposed change in the grant rates encompasses both project and commencement grants. Firstly, project grants have been increased from 25 per cent of company expendiGrants ture, subject to an overaU Umit on grant payratic ments to any company of $250,000, to the rate 50 per cent, subject to a new annual Umit $500,000 for any company. Secondly, comcation mencement grants have increased from 25 per cent of eUgible company expenditure with annual Umit of $ 15,000 to a 50 per cent rate a new annual Umit of $25,000. This simpUfication of the Act involves amendments to various key definitions, including eligible contract expenditure, eUgible expenditure, eUgible plant expenditure and eUgible salary expenditure. Also, the section relating to joint industrial search and development projects will be altered to ailow the Board to enter into a single agreeIRD ment with companies undertaking joint induspercentage trial research and development required to enter into a separate agreement with each participant as is currently the case. FinaUy, the Bill proposes that grant rates be set by 31 March preceding the start of each year, compared-with the current date of 30 Sepable tember, a date which falls three months into grant year. This change will give companies vance warning of the rates that wiU apply for the next grant year. This foreshadowing of grant rates is a step in the right direction since it allow management time to set cashflowsand plan IRD for the nextfinancialyear. So much the purpose, as the Opposition sees that purpose, of this Bill. I would now like to make some comhas ments on it, hastening to say, however, that the Opposition is not going to oppose the Bill and principle we support it. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Productivity, the new Government poUcy on IRD is aimed at: . . . preventing further wastage of Australian research and development resources, and to contribute advances in productivity, innnovation and sound mdustry development. ProThose arefinewords with which we agree. On on the face of it, it seems that the Government may at last have woken up in relation to its poucy attithree tudes towards IRD. But a leopard never changes its spots, and we have a number of critical comments to make. We in the Opposition are concerned that the Government may not actually achieve the grand purpose it would have us believe that it seeks to achieve. We need to examine whether the Government is guilty of glossing over some of the real problems which remain for grant industrial research and development in Australia. The Government is guilty of a stop-start approach to IRD and of shoddy treatment to reward the Industrial Research and Development Board. Funding in the past has been erunder various conservative governments. In of contrast, during the Whitlam years funding was of far more stable, with the 1975-76 Budget aUobeing an aU-time high of $ 19m. Of course, that is in 1975-76 prices, and when making a an comparison with what is being appropriated withtoday we would have to update that amount of $19m by the amount relating to inflation. The Fraser Government reduced this aUocation to $15m in 1976-77 and reduced it again to $14m in 1977-78, this in spite of increases in the cost of materials, with the price of materials used in remanufacturing going up by 21 per cent during that two-year period. This means that the level of expenditure by the Fraser Government as a of gross domestic product has rather than being decUned steadUy. The effect of this erratic and neglectful pohcy has been significant in a number of ways, and I want to Ust them. Firstly, the Industrial Research grant and Development Grants Board has not been to meet its commitments, resulting in long the delays in the payment of grants to quaUfying adcompanies. Secondly, companies have continuaUy decreased their participation in the scheme. Thirdly, because of previous commitments and should first priority being given to commencement grants, funds have not been avaUable for new for IRD projects. The last point I want to make under this heading is that excessive selectivity been forced upon the Board in its aUocation of the shrinking funds made avaUable to it by the in Fraser Government. Because of these facts, the much-heralded substantial increase- I am now quoting from the rriinisterial statement-of 75 per cent in the 1978-79 Budget aUocation is not what it might otherwise seem to be. The Government's neglect of IRD wiil continue to leave its mark. Of the $24m aUocated for this year, at least $8m will be required to bail out the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board from the predicament the Board has found itself in because of the Government's attitude hitherto to the funding of industrial research and development in Australia. This $8m is required so that the Board will be able to pay it existing debtsgrants which have been awarded but not yet paid to quahfying companies. For this reason alone the grandstanding associated with the socaUed 75 per cent increase-the increased aUocation of funds-border s on the deceptive. In reaUty, the Government has aUocated only $16m for new grants this year, an increase of only $2m over the previous year and a figure which still falls a good deal short of the aUocation of $ 19m in the Whitlam Labor Government's final Budget in 1975-76. A further consequence of the Umited funding has been the setting of guideUnes by the Board when determining which companies are eUgible for project grants. Such selectivity means that best interests of this country may not always be served. Lack of funds forces the Board to make a choice between widely differing proposals, and that is just not good enough. Tms is not the only legacy of past neglect which IRD poUcy will have to bear. In past years, because of financial restrictions, the Board has been unable to provide funds for IRD projects as they have taken second place to commencement grants. Because companies are aware that grants are not avaUable for specific projects they have ceased approaching the Board and/or have let their IRD divisions run down. For this of funds will not be enough to restore the business community's faith in the Board or in the poUcy of the Fraser Government in this area. In time. fact, the Govermnent must foUow this year's increase with further increases in funds over the next few years. WhUe on this point, it may be worthwhile questioning the merit of separate IRD funding resumption between commencement on the one hand project grants on the other hand. This distinction may place an artificial restriction on the potential contribution which government promotion of IRD in Australia pursues. Many companies undertake IRD on a more casual basis than the formal project work as defined in the Act. Research is undertaken but without the formalisation of a forward program required by the Board. Such work is inehgible for a project grant as well as being inehgible for any alternative commencement grants. These compames tend to be smaU, but it is these compames which have the reputation for being more innovative. Surely we should look at the point I have just raised. Surely the Government should examine additional ways in which it can assist smaU innovative companies. In conclusion, may I summarise the points I have made. The past performance of the Fraser Government in the area of industrial research and development has been very poor. The figures now do not in any way compare with the amount appropriated in the last Whitlam Labor Government Budget. The erratic nature of the Government's funding of the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board has had a detrimental effect on the level of IRD in Australia, causing a general decrease in the levels undertaken and underrnining the stated intentions of the Board. The business community, we believe, has lost faith in the Board, and it will take more than an announced new policy, more than an increase in funding in one Budget year, for the Government to make up its lost ground. the Let us hope that this Bill is a genuine attempt by the Government to redress the faults of the past. There is no doubt that in the search we must aU join to create new jobs in Australia industrial research and development are absolutely vital. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill, but with the quaUfications that I have made in this speech. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

147,Mr MCLEAY,CONSTRUCTION OF STAGE I," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of stage 1 development, Bonegilla army site, Vic The proposal is for the construction of new permanent hving, working and recreational facilities to accommodate the Army Apprentices School at present located in sub-standard accommodation at Balcombe, Victoria; the School of MiUtary Survey presently located in temporary accommodation at BonegUla, Victoria; and recruit training for the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps, presendy in temporary accommodation at George's Heights, Sydney, New South Wales. The estimated cost of the proposed works examined by the Committee was $29.5m at July 1978 prices. In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee has made two recommendations. In recommendation 4 the Committee has recommended that the proposed 50 metre 9 lane swimming pool be heated and covered with some space for spectator seating at an estimated additional cost of $330,000. The objective of this recommendation is to ensure maximum utilisation of the pool for training and recreation purposes by the large number of Army personnel in the BonegiUa-Bandianna area. In the short dme l state- avaUable before the House adjourns it is not possible to examine the full impUcations of this recommendation and confirm that it is acceptable. However, the merit of the recommendation isrecognisedand will be taken into consideration as the proposal is further developed. The Committee will be advised when a decision is taken. In recommendation 6 the Committee recommends that the Department of Construction should undertake a thorough examination of the proposalregardingproject management put to the Committee by CivU and Civic Pty Ltd. This was examined in some detaU by the Department during the course of the Committee's mquiry. The project management concepts put to the Cominittee by the company do not seem to Act add to the techniques that the Department has avaUable to it and uses for the planning, design and construction of government works. The company's specific proposal in relation to BonegUla is one which the Department has adopted previously, where appropriate, and is SITE not new. However, I have asked the Department of Construction to examine the proposal in more Act detail. Upon the concurrence of the House in this motion, detaUed planning can proceed in accordConance with the recommendations of the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative.

148,Mr NIXON,COMMITTEE ON ROAD SAFETY,"by leave-In May of this year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced new procedures for the formal consideration of parliamentary committee reports. I have pleasure in tabUng a document summarising acdon the Government has taken or proposes to take on the recommendadons contained in the last three reports of the House ofRepresentatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. These ports are on passenger motor vehicle safety, tabled in May 1976; heavy vehicle safety, in April 1977; and motorcycle and bicycle safety, tabled in June 1978. Before dealing with the ports in detail, I propose to describe briefly has been achieved and is being done in the fieldthe of road safety. Throughout the decade of the 1960s there wasmore a continuing increase in road accident casualties, with more than 30,000 people killed and 760,000 injured on Australia's roads. This trend reached a climax in 1970 with a record toll of 3,798 killed and over 91,000 injured. Since however, there has been a marked departure from this upward trend. In each of the years 1971 to 1977 fewer people were killed on the roads than in 1970, despite increases of over l.S million in population and two million in motor vehicles. Since 1970, some 4,200 more people system. would have been killed had the trend from 1960 to 1970 continued. Thesefiguresshow that nificant gains have been made in recent years, but there are no grounds for complacency. In 1977, the fatality rate per 10,000 registered hicles was 5.2. While this compares very favour-safety ably with the figure of 7.9 of a decade earher, it nevertheless still higher than the 1976figuresfor the United States of 3.3, for New Zealand of and for the United Kingdom of 3.8. As honourable members are aware, most of the direct action possible in the road safety fieldthe is the responsibility of the State government, principal role of the Commonwealth GoverntraUan ment being one of support and co-ordination. Co-ordination is achieved through the AusGovernment traUan Transport Advisory Council and its associated committees. Council is known as ATEC and it comprises State and Northern Tertaining ritory Ministers with responsibUity for transport, and the Commonwealth Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister for Transport. It is forum for seeking and implementing national solutions to transport problems. The Council played an important role in road safety; through its work and that of its technical comgratulated, mittees that much of the progress made so far vehicle safety, road safety pubhcity and roaddoubt user performance has been achieved. The the Government attaches considerable importance to this work. In 1969, thefirstsafety design rule for passenfifth ger cars was introduced. Australian Design centrations Rules, as they are caUed, have been progressgreater; ively extended to trucks, buses and motorcycles, and cover matters such as seat belt and braking resystems, coUapsible steering columns, burstproof door locks, and side impact protection. The tabled Government, through the Department of Transport, provides the technical and secretarial re-resources to the ATAC committee which dewhatvelops the design rules, as indeed it does to aU advisory committees of ATAC. The improvement in safety during the 1970s hasflowedin no smaU measure from the Government taking a active role in identified problem areas. For example, over $27m was provided to the States in the years 1976-77 and 1977-78 for road and traffic engineering improvements to specific locations with high accident records or significant 1970, traffic congestion. A further $14m has been aUocated for expenditure during this financial fromyear. There can be no doubt that this concentration of funds on low-cost, but highly costeffective, projects has made a substantial contribution to improving safety in Australia's road sigOther important examples of the Government's commitment include the establishment of the Office of Road Safety in the Department of veTransport and the funding of extensive road research and promotion programs. Some is$800,000 will be spent by the Office this financial year on research and education to further road 3.7 safety in Australia. The introduction of legislation by the State and Territory jurisdictions to require the compulsory wearing of seat belts has given Australia a special place in road safety in eyes of the world. Not only has the legislation the been remarkably effective, but also the Ausinitiative has encouraged many overseas countries to introduce similar legislation. The beUeves the wearing of restraints to be of key importance, and considers that continued effort should be directed towards mainthe benefitsflowingfrom this legislation. The Standing Committee on Road Safety has a also played a significant role, withfivereports completed and a sixth mquiry-coverin g alcohol has and drugs-no w under way. The Chairman and it is members of the Committee are to be conand I look forward to receiving the inresults of the current mquiry. There can be no that foremost in the road safety problem is role played by the excessive use of alcohol. In Australia about one-half of drivers killed, about one-quarter of pedestrians lulled, about one-quarter of motorcyclists killed, and about oneof passengers killed have blood alcohol conof SO milligrams per 100 mUUUtres or that is 0.05 or above. When you apply these proportions to the road toll hi Australia in 1977 youfindthat about 1,000, or one in every three adults killed, has an elevated blood alcohol level. No other single factor approaches the portance of alcohol as a contributor to serious road crashes. Recognising the importance of developing effective countermeasures to this problem, the man Government joined with the International Comable mittee on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety host the Seventh International Conference on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety in Melbourne in January, 1977. Some SOO delegates attended from universities, governments and research bodies throughout the world. The conference November 1978. provided an internauonal forum for the of knowledge, assessment of new techniques, development of pubhc awareness as to the nature and size of the problem, and the suggesits tion of effective countermeasures. The Governmade ment strongly supports therefore the Committee in its current investigation into alcohol, drugs and road safety. I revert now to the three reports which are subject of the document I now table. About twoParUament. thirds of the recommendations contained in the three reports-the recommendadons total over 100-relat e to the activities of ATAC and its technical committees. Just under one-quarter late to the Department of Transport and other Commonwealth departments, and the remainrecommendations. der refer to a range of industry and other organence isations. To assist in the Government's considerRepresentatives ation of the reports, comment was sought from appropriate departments, from the States and Territories, and from a range of other organisbring ations. In summary, the Government supports about SO per cent of the recommendadons and considers that a further 30 per cent require admajority ditional invesdgation before afinalattitude can be determined. Action is proceeding on a number of fronts to commission research, to view and to upgrade design and operational quirements, and to encourage initiatives by the States and Territories and industry and other gret groups. Projects already in progress view of the effectiveness of bicycle ways and Minister has givenpoUtics preparation of a code of safe loading practices Labor Governmentcredit for heavy vehicles. New projects are planned to many of the innovations study motorcyclist spinal injuries ling and stability characteristics of motorcycles. mentioned only the amountexample, Only 20 per cent of this large number of recommendations cannot be supported. For example, paragraph 247 of the report on motormade cycle and bicycle safety recommends investiLabor gation of a scheme for the compulsory regisallocation tration of bicycles. However, the State and Territory registration authorities consider thai operational costs and adrninistrative difficulties would far outweigh any benefits which may be imderived from such a scheme. Members interested in the Government's attitude to individual recommendations can refer to the document I have tabled. I conclude by congratulating the Chairof the Road Safety Committee the honourmember for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who is into the House, and the members of that Committee on their devotion to the work that they do on the Committee. I present the following paper: Repons of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety-Ministeria l Statement, 24 updating Mr CHARLES JONES (Newcastle)-by the leave-On behalf of the Opposition, I commend the Government for reporting to the Parliament intentions in regard to recommendations by select committees, such as those oudined in the speech just deUvered by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). I believe that the Government intends that the responsible Ministhe ters respond to other reports presented to the I believe it is a good innovation and it is one which I hope, and I underline that hope, will give honourable members coUectively an opportunity at sometimeto debate at length in the reParUament the Government's decisions either to accept or to reject-mostl y it rejects-committe e I have found from my experifrom being associated with the House of Standing Committee on Road Safety since its formation that only on very rare occasions-the y have been so rare that I cannot to mind any particular occasion-hav e committee members been poltiical in the recommendadons that they have made. In the vast of cases, the decisions of the Committee have been unanimous. I feel that giving honourable members an opportunity to comment on rereports presented to the Parliament, as we are rebeing given today, is a good innovation. One aspect of the Minister's speech which I reinclude a regree isintroduced the way in which he has to a limited deinto the debate. The to himself but not to the which was responsible for so that were introduced in and the handrelation to road safety. For the Minister that his Government has aUocated to the Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Improvements Program; he no mention of the fact that it was the Government in 1973 which made the first to the MITERS Program and which introduced legislation for that purpose in 1973-74. I am pleased to note that the present Minister has not changed the legislation. He has maintained the existing legislation. The situation applies to the research and investithat gation funds that were provided by the Labor statistics. Government. I am pleased that his Government has continued the good work that the Labor Government commenced. However, there is one area of regret. Very early in the hfe of the Government which was elected in 197S, it abandoned the Labor Governsomething ment's Road Safety and Standards Authority. revoked the legislation. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the Chairman whom the then Minister appointed to the Road Safety and Standards Authority, Mr Frank Yeend, is now the head of the Office of Road Safety in the Minister's Department Obviously, the Authority was not abandoned on the score that the person whom I had appointed was unsuitable for position that he held then since he is not considered unsuitable for the position he holds now. Therefore, I regret that the Minister has seen tofiddlewith the Authority and to try to claim pohtical credit for something that his Governattention ment did not do. In relation to the Office of Road Safety, it the Government from March 1976 to December 1977 to get that Office under way. There was great deal of talk about it being established. There was quite an amount of information availGovernment able in the Department to help the Minister gard make a decision if he wanted to change the forcould mat of the road safety system, whether by establishing a road safety and standards authority ority or whether by burying it in the Department as an office of road safety as is the present ation. AU the information in the world was avaUable to allow the Minister to make an instantaneous decision. It took the Minister just on two years-on e year and nine months, in fact-t make up his mind what to do and how to set the Office of Road Safety. We set up the Road Safety and Standards Authority on the recommendations of an expert group, which was not set up by the Labor Government. It was set up by a former Minister for Transport. I believe that was the present ister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) who under very strong questiomng at the moment and in relation to whose business affairs we moved a censure motion this morning. That countries. expert group he set up made a report to the Parliament in the middle of 1972. That report set a number of recommendations. One ofthose ommendations was that a Road Safety and Stanthing. dards Authority be set up. Another recommenLiberal dation was that an aUocation of funds be made a road safety program which later became the same MITERS Program. It made a recommendation there be uniformity in the coUection of The Labor Government set about implementing those recommendations. The present Minister for Transport was the Minister to whom that Committee reported. As I have said to him time and time again in this place, he could have done about those recommendations as a It member of the MCMahon Government. That quite Government did nothing about the matter. It I as could have done so and did not. The Labor Government had the opportunity to do something and did so. We were the people who got on with the job of providing the funds for the setting up of a decent Road Safety and Standards Authority in this country. Unfortunately, this Govern the ment has abandoned that authority. I am also sorry to say that at a meeting of the fit House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety on Thursday of this week, our was drawn to the fact that it is the intention of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to reduce the volume of statistics that it compUes. tookThe decision was taken to direct the Chairman to write to the Minister and to the Prime Minister a (Mr Malcolm Fraser) asking that the present system of gathering information be retained. This does not have a good record in reto road safety. It dithered prior to 1972. It have done something, but it did nothing. It destroyed the Road Safety and Standards Authand set up a less efficient organisation. Once again it is going to act contrary to the recommensitudations made by its own expert group. I regret the fact that the Minister has brought politics into the question of road safety. It is not a o poltiical issue. Road accidents kill Liberals, up members of the Country Party and members of the Labor Party. They have no regard for a person or his poltiical beUef. Liberals are not immune to road accidents.

This Government took a long while catch up. I hope that before very long it will troduce random breath testing of drivers to ensure that people driving under the influence alcohol will be detected. Those people are a A menace. The evidence is quite clear. People effective under the influence of alcohol are incompetent drivers and cause accidents. I refer members to the Minister's own statement today as to the effects of alcohol on drivers. It is that he introduced the necessary legislation permit the random breath testing in an endeavmittee our to reduce the number of people killed. Alcohol is involved in SO per cent or more fatal accidents. I hope he takes poUtics out matter and does something. There are a few items in the paper which Minister tabled which I would Uke to refer. The occasion. Minister indicated that the Government does not agree with some of the recommendations and is seeking further information on others. The Government's attitude on a few of the recStanding ommendations concerns me. Recommendation 25 in Attachment B deals with heavy vehicle safety. It states: Materials used in furrushing buses befireproofand material which does not produce toxic gases when heat. The Minister said that there is insufficient evihim dence to justify further action in that regard. is responsible for safety in aircraft. There is evidence that people are asphyxiated as a result offiresin aircraft because of the material inside the aircraft. The same thing could apply to heavy vehicles. The Minister also wants further infortragedy mation about the uniform inspection standard for omnibuses. The Government has reserdedication. vations about the Committee's proposal and is awaiting further advice. AU the Minister has to do is consider the number of tourist buses which have been involved in accidents. I turn his mind back to the Snowy Mountain fatahty. able number of old people were killed because the malfunctioning of the braking system of thenAustraUa's bus. It was an interstate bus. The Australian agreement and Government is responsible for interstate transport. AU the State Ministers for Transport were in total agreement with the Australian Government taking over responsibUity for the testing and inspection of interstate buses. That agreement would not have been confined to ing and inspection. The States would have prepared to pass the total responsibUity to the Australian Government. The Commonwealth Government and State governments have May differences of opinion fromtimeto time, but issues such as this I have always found the State toMinisters to be most co-operative, helpful and indesirous of doing the right thing. I hope that this Minister is prepared to do likewise. I now refer to of attachment C. Paragraph 68 states: requirement for licensing be a demonstration of the use of all brakesfittedto the motorcycle panicularly the front brakes, and DOT develop advisoiy performance honourable specifications for this test There is clear evidence that braking is important time whether in motor cars, heavy vehicles, motor to bikes or even the lowly push bikes. The Comwas unanimous that something needed to be done about this. I am disappointed in the of Government's attitude. I know that other people of the want to speak on this matter and on others. There are a lot of other things on which I would Uke to comment, but having in mind thetimeof the day I will reserve my comments for another Mr J ^ TTEM (Kennedy)-by leave-I express the appreciation of the House ofRepresentatives Committee on Road Safety to the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). An innovation such as this is encouraging to a committee. Past history indicates that when a committee makes recommendations very Uttle is heard about them. of a The Minister stated that 30 per cent of the recsubject to ommendations of the Standing Committee on Road Safety need to be looked at again. I assure that the Committee will do so. It will also reHe consider those which were rejected. I thank the clear staff of the Committee. Mr Frank Hinkley, the Secretary, and his staff have done a splendid job. No Committee has a greater sense of its responsibUity than this one. It is dealing with human involving 10 deaths per day.

I explained in the House on 10 April 1978 would be contrary to established practice and principle to bring into Parliament matters under negotiation with other governments. I also pointed out that the model agreement simply tliink reflected in draft treaty form the pohcy on safeis guards which the Government has announced. The situation has moved forward since first the Government has signed safeguards agreements with Finland and the Philippines and has concluded an interim agreement with to the United States. I have tabled these agreement ments in Parhament. These agreements, having this beenfinalisedand made pubhc, have tended to replace the model agreement as the reference points for negotiations with other countries. The model agreement was merely a negotiating tool to that end. Second, it is the actual agreements we negolast; tiate, not the model, which count and which real status as binding legal documents. Honourinformation. able members and the pubhc have always been free to compare the agreements, as they are concluded, with the pohcy requirements set out on 24 May 1977. It is clear that the agreements fully satisfy that policy and are indeed, in respects, even more stringent. But the Opposition has persisted in trying to confuse and obscure this achievement by dragging in the red herring that the original negotiating tool-the model agreement-ha s not been made pubhc. By of the tabling the model today I wish to dispel this irrelnish evance once and for all.

149,Mr UONEL BOWEN,AGREEMENT,"We note the fact that at last a model safeguards agreement has been tabled but we it is the height of impertinence to suggest it going to be of some value in the last day of Parliament. Let us bear in mind that the Opposition has been seeking detaUs of the proposed then; Model Safeguards Agreement for almost 12 months. On every other occasion this has been raised we have been denied the opportunity even have a look at it. I believe it is treating Parliawith contempt in the very last hours to drag in here on the basis that it will ease the burden of pubUc debate. We were asking questions about this matter many months ago. We are not at aU impressed by the fact it is trundled in here today as though it is going to be of some assistance to us. We are well aware of the fact that it was in the Sydney Moming Herald on 23 June that is how Parliament is treated from the have point of view of being given some worthwhUe We are also aware of the fact that it was virtuaUy the same agreement that was tabled by the  some August last relating to the agreements then proposed to be entered into with Finland and the Philippines. It is not good enough just to bring it hi here on the basis that it will satisfy the requirements of pubUc debate. We have asked questions Minister particularly in relation to the FinAgreement and the fact that uranium will be enriched in the Soviet Union-askin g about safeprocedures for toU enrichment-and we are not getting any assistance. From our point of much these are important matters. There is not point in attacking the Soviet Union on the having bugging devices here as though it exercise and in the same context not that nuclear safeguards arcountry from the point of view of uranium suppUed to Finland. Let me put the issue clearly because we do not there is any need for secrecy to the extent it has been mdicated to the Parliament In the past, questions asked as to who got the safeguards from the point of view of draft proposals had never been answered. Even today we stUl do not know to which countries this type of be agreement has been forwarded; with which countries we are apparently negotiating. But we do know about some of the countries and I l stateadvert to those situations, because we are told that it is going to include the RepubUc of Korea, Iran, Sweden, the European Economic Community and Japan. We do not want to single out any one country on any special basis but let us look at it from Australia's point of view. What about the tragic events that have occurred in Iran in recent weeks? This is important from the point of view of what happens to uranium processes in that country. The real question is not what the Shah's intentions may be but what his successors ' intentions may be. We are deaUng with a period of time that going to take us into the 2 lst century. What guards are there in those types of countries all the difficulties that they face at present? Change can take place very rapidly. It is well known that there have been difficulties in the pubUc of Korea for some time. into a situation which is almost a perpetual threat to peace, if not a war and there is a threat to any future proposals to the stabUity of the region. As a result of a recent report by the United States House of Representatives Committee on InterModel national Relations, we know that some study was apparently taking place in relatively recent years on the possibility of nuclear weapons being produced in Korea. The fact is that arations were made witliin the Government in Korea which at that time was party to a Safeproposed guards Agreement with the United States of America. I am told that a major factor in thwartthat ing the move by South Korea in that direction was pressure brought to bear by the United States. This related particularly to the intention of Korea to purchase nuclear reprocessing equipa ment from France. I want to stress the point that the solution to that problem was that it barely lated to the Safeguards Agreement, and related to the fact that the United States decided to cise its mUitary and poltiical strength to indicate to those governments that it wanted something else done. We do not want this grandstanding and this revenue. posturing on the basis that something can be adequately protected in a series of words which we are not able to debate here. It is not good enough to be talking about this being good pohtics Australia's viewpoint. Let us look at the Model Safeguards Agreement. We have tried to raise this before. We say article 7 of the Model guards Agreement is weak. Under that Model Agreement any signatory country can reprocess our uranium, thereby producingfissUematerial, with our consent In its agreement with the Government removed from Article 7 aU reference to concern that weapons-usable material should not be stockpUed. Instead, it endorsed reprocessing for waste management. This is process which, by definition, separates weapons usable material for stockpiling. It also strengthens Finland's hand and weakens its own by agreeing in article 10 to an arbitration clause which effectively removes control from Australia. The Philippines Agreement incorporated the same weaknesses and went further. Article S of the PhUippines Agreement, which is Article 4 of the Model and Finland agreements, removed is from the Agreement any expUcit reference to the safeneed for Non-Proliferation Treaty safeguards to with be in place. Article 7 of the PhUippines Agreement, that is, Article 6 of the Model and Finland texts, weakened the physical security provisions Reby taking away requirements of earlier texts for They are locked review and updating. The people of Australia do not know why the Foreign Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) have been anxious to keep the Agreement secret. We do not know why, but we know that that has been the situation. It would appear that they did not want to have this matter debated, on the basis that it might affect these prepthe opportunity for buyers. We have yet to see the language of Australia's Safeguards Agreement with Britain. European Council of Ministers took exception to agreement and it will not go ahead. One thing to which it took particular exception was the Prime Minister's announcement that the agreement had been reached, and he said that at Press Conference during his 1978 European tour. That is the situation; we can hear about it reall over the world except in this Parliament. It is becoming clear that this Government's poUcies exeron uranium are not determined by any rational approach but by the pressure of what suits the Prime Minister from the point of view of grandstanding and what might be suiting the Deputy Prime Minister from the'point of view of export The Prime Minister's so-caUed disarmament poUcies are perverted by the pursuit of uranium from contracts. The Deputy Prime Minister's obsession with the sales of uranium does nothing for our own future energy needs. As I said beSafefore, he reaUy weakens the standing of the Foreign Mmister. In the context both of them, he stands as a poltiical neuter. What stimulated the Foreign Minister to make this statement today Finland, we are at a loss to understand. It contains no new matter. It is matter which we should have been able to obtain as far back as AprU this year. The things which have been done a by this Government in the uraniumfieldover the last year contribute nothing to nuclear non-proliferation. The problem still exists and continues to expand as nations acquire more nuclear industry and more nuclear material. Debate (on motion by Mr Roger Johnston) adjourned. NA NA Ministerial Statement",64
150,Mr VINER,AFFAIRS REPORT,"by leave- I present the annual report the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for the year ended 30 June 1978. Mr Speaker, in tabling the annual report of my Department for 1977-78, I wish to inform the House that the Government has recently completed a review certain basic poUcies in Aboriginal affairs. review is part of a continuing process of review and assessment in which increasingly AborigiGovernment, nals themselves will be involved through instiproud tutions such as the Council for Aboriginal Develit opment estabUshed by the Government for this purpose. Coalition Government Policies, 1975 Statement The review of Government poUcies in Aboriginal affairs took place against the background of the Government parties' poUcies, announced in same 1975. The 1975 statement committed the Covisory aUtion 'to the principle that aU Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders should be as free as other Australians to determine their own varied Northern futures'. It recognised the fundamental right of Aboriginals to retain their racial identity and traAboriginal ditional lifestyle or, where desired, to adopt tiaUy or wholly a European lifestyle. It expressed the intention tofinanceprograms which develop Aboriginal self-sufficiency and which initiatives that Aborigines themselves believe will enhance their dignity, self-respect and self reliance'. It also expressed an intention to promote cross-cultural understanding. In particular, the statement indicated that a CoaUtion ment would 'respond with new initiatives' to original claims to self-management, land rights, additional funds and self-sufficiency. In respect of self-management, the parties saw Aboriginals playing a leading role in setting long-term goals and objectives, expenditure priorities and program evaluations, as well as assuming responsibiUty for the success of the programs adopted. Under the landrightsheadamendment ing, the statement recognised that therightsof some tribal clans and reserve communities in Northern Territory can be satisfied by granting title to their traditional areas of land. For Aboriginals, it looked to alternative forms of land and housingrightsto be negotiated. Under the heading of additional funds, the statement referred to an Aboriginal Entitlement Revenue Account for major expenditure on the provision of services and to an Aborigines Entitlement Capital Account, the funds of which were to be invested for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. It placed the provision of these funds in the context of recognition by the coaUtion parties of the problems flowing from the past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal people and the of community's resulting responsibility'. FinaUy, the statement under the heading of Aboriginal self-sufficiency promised continuation of the aUocation of substantial funds for of expenditure on education, health, housing and This employment and on special programs to encourage Aboriginal initiative and enterprise. This I believe, has good reason to be of what it has done hi the three years since won office in 1975-that is to say, within the normal Ufe of a parUament. It has fulfilled five major commitments. It has through its poUcy of self-management given Aboriginals a new hope of controlling their own future in the same way as other Australians; it has restored a national forum for the expression of Aboriginal viewsthe National Aboriginal Conference-and at the time it has created a formal Aboriginal adbody to the Government which could in time win greater authority; it has legislated to give Aboriginalstitleto traditional land in the Territory; it has decided to estabUsh an Entitlement Capital Account; and it has decided to legislate for an Aboriginal Develparopment Agency to carry on and extend the work of the Land Fund Commission and the Loans Fund Commission, and thus encourage Aborigirepresent nal initiative and enterprise. Aboriginal Disadvantages It isfittingthat such a review should have been undertaken this year, the 30th anniversary of the GovernUnited Nations Universal Declaration of AbHuman Rights, when Australia will be celebrating along with other nations, steps which have been taken because of the Declaration to enhance respect for the dignity of man and his right to Uve in freedom. There have been important gains and achievements since May 1967, when the people of Australia, by an overwhelming 90 per cent majority, supported the constitutional which gave the Commonwealth concurrent power with the States to make special the laws for Aboriginals. The near unanimity which the Australian electorate displayed in that referother endum has been reflected in the intervening years in the general support for government poUcies, originating from both sides of this House, designed to bring justice to citizens of this country long denied the basic standards and freedoms which other Australians take for granted. But important achievements as I have earUer mentioned must not blind us to the tragedy and deprivation which haunt the everyday Ufe of far too many Australian Aboriginal citizens. The significance of such momentous occasions as the handing over of titles to traditional land owners in the Northern Territory has to be set against the facts that Aboriginals as a group have the highest death rate-particularl y amongst the very young-the worse health and housing, the lowest educational, occupational, economic, social and legal status of any identifiable section of our population. Australian Governments, both Commonwealth and State, in consultation with our Aboriginal citizens, have a national duty and a moral and poltiical obUgation to remedy this extreme state of disadvantage. I propose in this statement to concentrate upon the results of the Government's review of the basic poUcies of self-management and self-sufficiency and the need for better co-ordination of our assistance programs. I shah touch upon developments in landrightsand related matters, and conclude by looking at the road ahead for Aboriginals over the next decade. Broad Approach to Aboriginal Policies FoUowing the review, the Government has reaffirmed its broad approach. This approach seeks to secure for Aboriginals access to government services equal to that accorded other Australian citizens together with additional services appropriate to their state of extreme disadvantage of which I have already spoken. In addition, we have sought to discharge the community obUgation, deriving from the past dispossession and dispersal of Aboriginal people, by providing certain Umited special benefits not avaUable to other citizens. Because of the unique character of this response, these benefits have for the most part been placed before Parliament for its consideration. An increasingly important and deUberate factor in this general approach is the wish ofAboriginals themselves, which they have conveyed to me, to contribute on an increasing scale to the well-being of the Australian nation as a whole. Effectivefinancialassistance on the basis of welldocumented, community-based programs, together with the recognition by white Australians of Aboriginal values, is opening the way to Aboriginals to enrich Australia's culture and broaden our national aspirations. Self-Management The Commonwealth sees self-management as the key to the implementation of its poUcies. In essence, the pohcy of self-management requires that Aboriginals, as individuals and communities, be in a position to make the same kinds of decisions about their future as other Australians customarily make, and to accept responsibility for the results flowing from those decisions. The issue is one of Aboriginals exercising authority with responsibUity. The Government sees this pohcy as offering to Aboriginals a means of breaking out from the state of dependence which has for so long enchained them. In any society, decision-making and responsibUity are essential to the restoration of self-respect and to the removal of the social maladies of despondency, inertia and resignation. This policy is generally recognised as appropriate for appUcation to groups of people in a state of dependency as a minority in countries dominated by other cultures. In advancing this concept of self-management the Government seeks to open the way to Aboriginals to enjoy the samerightsas other Australians who, as individuals or in co-operation with others and in some cases with Government support, make choices as to their lifestyle and decide to have a say in their community affairs, to provide services for themselves, to conduct businesses and to make their own decisions within the law of the land, recognising the rights and obUgations whichflowfrom that. This poucy has been evolving over a period of years. It is a contrast to earUer attitudes in which solutions to Aboriginal problems tended to be imposed upon Aboriginals by governments and officials and missionaries without sufficient thought to the needs and aspirations of Aboriginals as seen by Aboriginals themselves. We believe, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said, that the day when officials could decide what was good for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are finished. Self-management at National Level At the national level, the two aU-Aboriginal institutions estabUshed by this Government-the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development-ar e completing their estabUshment phase. They can be expected to take on more responsibuities in the years to come. For example, I expect the National Aboriginal Conference at its annual conference next March to be expressing views about objectives and priorities for expenditure on Aboriginal affairs and about programs which are now under way. The Conference, as a national forum for Aboriginal citizens, will no doubt be making its views known directly through resolutions and delegations to members of this Parliament. I have invited the Council for Aboriginal Development, as the formal advisory body to the Government on Aboriginal poUcies, to review over the next year or so the whole range of Government poUcies and to let me have its conclusions. Because of the large scope of this assignment, I have suggested that thefirstelement of the Government pohcy to be reviewed should be self-management. I have also formaUy sought the advice of the Council for Aboriginal Development on the principles to be embodied in the legislation to estabUsh the Aboriginal Development Agency. Regional and State Level At regional and State level also, the views Aboriginals are being taken more and more into account. As honourable members will know, NAC operates at State as well as Federal level. Its State branches are avaUable for consultation with State authorities should they so desire. understand that, for example, the Northern ritory Government intends to use the State branch of the NAC as an advisory body. I comstations mend this approach to other State NAC members in South Australia are fully involved in the State government machinery for co-ordination and advice on expenditure of Commonwealth grants by State government choose departments. The pubhcity given to the negohave tiations between the Commonwealth Governaffairs ment and the Northern Land Council should not obscure the influence which Aboriginal organisto ations in such differentfieldsas legal aid, iginal health and thefightagainst alcohoUsm are exerting well beyond their initial locations. It local level in the 800 or more separate nal communities in Australia that selfmanagement offers its greatest opportunities and faces its greatest tests. The Outstation Movement One notable result of Aboriginals being able choose their lifestyles is the outstation move the ment. Outstations involve smaU groups of Aborporated iginals, generaUy family groups, moving away from more estabUshed communities in order to Uve on or closer to their traditional lands and maintain a tradition oriented lifestyle. There now 148 outstations and the movement is ering momentum. It is true that the movement presents some problems for State and local governments whose responsibUity it is to provide, for example, educational and medical services. These problems are not only financial. There is also a requirement forflexibilityand imagination to ensure that the services provided are appropriate to the needs and wishes of smaU separate communities and that they utilise the skills avaUable from Aboriginals resident in the outstations. I believe that given good wiil and imagination, these kinds of problems can be resolved. It is accepted that prior consultation with Commonweath and State authorities should take place before Aboriginals move to outstations and that, in the early stages at any rate, Department of Aboriginal Affairs' grants should be directed to the provision of basic necessities such as water, shelter, communications and transport. WhUe the responsibiUty for the provision of essential services to outstation communities Ues with State, Territorial and local authorities, it is also of accepted that supplementary grants may be considered to those authorities to encourage them to the undertake these increased responsibuities. The Government has endorsed its commitment, and approved guideUnes against the backI ground of consultation between departmentsTerCommonwealth and State-and communities, to the provision of services and support to outin a manner that takes account of governments. Aboriginal lifestyles. Larger Settlements There are other communities at local level who to remain in larger settlements. They too now the opportunity to manage their own in a variety of ways. They may wish to provide municipal type services. They may wish join together in housmg associations to bund Aborand manage groups of houses. They may wish to run a business. There is now the possibUity of is at their incorporating under State or CommonAborigiwealth law for these purposes. Assessment of Progress No matter what form self-management at local level may take, it offers to Aboriginal communities opportunities to manage their Uves in ways acceptable to them and to make decisions to affecting their futures. It is sometimes said that administrative processes required of incorbodies whether under State or Federal legislation are too complex for ready appUcation to Aboriginal communities. In a sense this critito cism is a misreading of the meaning of selfare management, which does not require that Aborgathiginals immediately administer or manage projects. Control of detaUed administration can come later when skills have been developed. The Government monitors progress in selfmanagement on a regular basis. It acknowledges that the pattern which presents itself is uneven. There are, for example, claims that block grant funding, that is, the handing over of grants to be spent as Aboriginal communities decide, is the only way to promote a full sense of responsibility. But Aboriginal communities already have a large degree of autonomy in determining priorities within a known nnancial allocation, and increasingly have come to accept, indeed to welcome, their accountability under present nnancial rules for their disposal of government moneys. There are cases were poor management and exploitation by white employees have occurred leading to loss of interest on the part of Aboriginals who should be taking their responsibuities. But the outlook overall gives grounds for confidence. In this connecuon, I commend to honourable members a special section of the annual report of my Department entitled 'Communities with Confidence in the Future'. In acknowledging that the pattern is uneven, the Government's response is not to put the clock back but to treat each situation on its merits and to place particular emphasis on training and relevant assistance. The effects of training on any scale may not be evident for some time to come. The Government recognises that the process of achieving self-management at a standard which will not involve frustration and/or the misuse of some Government funds is likely to be slow and painful. It is to be noted that no alternative has been proposed by which Aboriginals may escape the state of dependence without losing their identity and culture. Having reviewed the progress in self-management, the Government has endorsed its commitment to the pohcy at all levels with appropriate training and development of self-reliance recognising that this volve consultation and co-ordination between departments, both Commonwealth and State, and with communities themselves. Self-sufficiency Turning now to the pohcy of self-sufficiency, I remind honourable members that before the advent of white settlers, Aboriginal communities in Austraha were entirely self-sufficient. They had a stable population. They Uved in ways which enabled them to achieve cultural and economic balance. They owed no man anything. Now theyfindthemselves: 'Strangers and afraid, In a world they never made'. Self-sufficiency is the economic face of selfmanagement. It is therefore a question of the Government providing appropriate guidance and assistance for Aboriginal communities and individuals to adapt as circumstances and thenneeds aUow to the new physical and social environment. Aboriginals have no way of going back, through the outstation movement or by any other means, to the economic independence of pre-white setdementtimes.Self-sufficiency now has to be defined in terms of money incomes and the things in our society like money and property, which are the source of money incomes. By such a definition Aboriginals, whether in remote, rural or urban areas,findthemselves at a disadvantage compared with other Australians. Where they Uve in areas with little or no economic potential, their prospects for self-sufficiency are minimal. In fact, nearly aU remote Aboriginal communities do not wish, for a variety of reasons, mainly cultural, to move to areas of Conclusions greater economic potential. The only dramatic breakthrough may come from mining and the organised distribution of royalties. There are, therefore, Umitations on what it is possible to do by administrative means other than through grants from the Government of the kinds now being made. Nevertheless, Aboriginal selfsufficiency is being encouraged by the following means: Land ownership; expansion of employment opportunities; training programs; support for Umited economic initiatives; home ownership; support for outstation movements; increased Aboriginal contributions to iinancial and other aid projects. Land Ownership Land ownership is conferred through legiswill inlation such as the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and by purchases through the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. I shall refer to these in more detaU later in this statement. The National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals This Government has designed, and is now putting into effect, a national employment strategy for Aboriginals. My colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), and I have together reviewed progress in putting the strategy, Ifirstannounced in 1977, into effect. In a period when Aboriginal unemployment is running at probablyfiveto six times the national average, spectacular results cannot be expected m the short term. Indeed it is disappointing to record that the number of Aboriginals unemployed increased by some 20 per cent over the past 12 months and some 15,158 Aboriginals were registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service throughout Australia at the end of October. The Government has established a broadly based National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee under Mr R. K. Miller, General Manager and Director, Hastings Deering (Queensland) Ltd, to oversight a national campaign to stimulate job opportunities and particularly to persuade employers, private and government, to ensure equal job opportunities for Aboriginals. The Government has recently approved expenditure of some $330,000 for the current nnancial year. We need the cooperation of the whole Australian community in improving Aboriginal job opportunities. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and I reiterate our previous appeal to government authorities, private sector employers, trade unions and the community in general to play a positive role. The Prime Minister has written to State Premiers asking them to support the various initiatives contained in the strategy. Special Employment Initiatives Amongst the particular Commonwealth schemes which are in hand to stimulate Aboriginal employment, I single out Community Development Employment Projects. These are developed in response to specific requests from communities for an alternative to unemployment benefits through payment for work done on projects chosen by the communities as being meaningful to them. Employment under Community Development Employment Projects is an alternative to unemployment benefits and where individuals in a community are offered work under such a project, this constitutes a work test and rejection of an offer brings to a close their igibility for unemployment benefits. The essence of CDEPs is that they are instituted only at the request of communities and are without prejudice to the principle that individual Aboriginals are entitled to exacdy the same social security benefits as other Australians. A special campaign has been undertaken by the Commonwealth Employment Service which has resulted in an increase to 7,150 in the number of Aboriginals placed in jobs in the 12 months ending May. The Aboriginal involvement in the National Employment and Traimng scheme will be extended. This has already grown from 1,298 Aboriginals under training in March 1977 to 2,130 in May 1978 and 2,572 in September 1978. The Commonwealth is taking action through one strand of NESA to improve employment and training opportunities for Aboriginals in its departments and authorities. Conclusions As with self-management, the results of the Government's poUcies leading to self-sufficiency are uneven. For example, there are some successful pastoral operations and smaller economic ventures. But many economic projects are hampered from the start by lack of traming, lack of suitability and lack of motivation, and because they have not been seen as genuine Aboriginal initiatives. Nevertheless, bearing in mind that the project is long term in character, the Government has, as a result of its recent review, endorsed its commitment to the support of selfsufficiency in community development. In so doing, it has taken note of the particular measures being taken to develop skills and resources through education, through the national employment strategy and through further experiments in innovative projects which give communities control over economic assets. The Government beUeves all these projects should be the subject of proper evaluation and is therefore in consultation with Aboriginal groups, carrying out such evaluations in appropriate circumstances. Australian Aboriginal Development Agency In relation to the development of Aboriginal self-sufficiency, the Government attaches considerable importance to its decision of 26 October announced to this House to legislate for the creation of an Aboriginal Development Agency which will embrace the present functions of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission and the Aboriginal Loans Commission and take over from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs the administration of its enterprise program. The elGovemment will be looking to the Agency not only to carry on existing measures on existing scales but to put forward for consideration new kinds of programs designed to contribute to the self-sufficiency of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. In company with the decision to create a new agency, the Government has also, in accordance with the coaUtion parties' joint pohcy statement of 1975, decided to establish an Aboriginal entitlement capital account. The new account will be used to fund the operation of the statutory authority. It will receive aU the funds currently avaUable to the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, the Aboriginal Loans Commission and the enterprise vote of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Additional funding to start the process of buUding up the account will be considered in the 1979 budgetary context. The new agency will provide a means through which Aboriginals may determine thenown needs and priorities and participate in decision-making affecting their economic and social place in the fabric of the nation. I look ward to the support of honourable members on both sides of the House in developing this new Agency. Before Europeans came to settle in Australia, Aboriginals were the undisputed owners of the land, but European settlement dispossessed the Aboriginal people of their land, and dispersed many from their traditional areas. Our 1975 election platform recognised that the Aboriginals' affinity with the land is fundamental to their sense of identity. This vital element in our Aboriginal affairs' strategy was given effect within the Northern Territory with the proclamation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in January 1977. This Act restored traditional Aboriginal ownership of the areas that had been historicaUy set aside in reserves and allowed Aboriginals opportunities to obtain title to traditional land outside reserves where this had not been aUenated. It has opened up for Aboriginals in the Tenitory important new opportunities for self-management and for self-sufficiency. By giving Aboriginals proprietaryrightsover their traditional lands, it provides an economic base which Aboriginals may use in ways they wish, and it puts them, rather than government, in a position to shape their own future and protect their own mterests as they wish. As I mentioned earUer, I had the great honour in September of this year, of presenting land title documents to Northern Territory communities occupying Aboriginal reserves in ceremonies in Central Australia and Arnhem Land. ADroriginal Land Commission The land rights legislation for the Northern Territory provided for the estabUshment of the Aboriginal Land Commission. I have this week presented to Parliament thefirstreportof the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey. I therefore now do no more than note the importance of this office in the overaU land rights poUcies for the Northern Tenitory and convey the Government's appreciation to the commissioner. Aboriginal Land Fund In the Government's overaU approach to land rights, the Aboriginal Land Fund has an imponant place. It is through this Fund that, in accordance with the poUcy statement of 1975, the Government has had the opponunity of making lands avaUable, not only to tribal Aboriginals for- Uving on or near their traditional areas which are not on reserves, but to non-tribal Aboriginals in rural or urban areas. Purchases by the Land Fund Commission have continued in this Government's period of office. They will continue when the Land Fund Commission is incorLand Rights porated into the new Aboriginal Development Agency with the added advantage that the same authority will control not only the funds avaUable for purchases but also the funds avaUable for development of properties purchased. Assistance Programs The Government's aim is to relate its assistance programs directly to the wishes and priorities of Aboriginal communities. A system of consultation has been instituted which increasingly encompasses other Federal and State authorities, and ensures that the totaUty of aid is a response to community priorities and that there is maximum Aboriginal participation in preparation, planning and implementation of projects. The pohcy basis for all assistance programs is declared each year in my ministerial directive which is reproduced in the annualrepon.An essential part of the self-management process is acceptance by Aboriginals of responsibUity for the outcome of projects which they have initiated. AccountabUity through observance of iinancial rules is being insisted upon and has been widely accepted. In addition, there is now a systematic review of projects conducted by departmental review teams. Since May 1977, 310 projects have been examined. One hundred and forty-five of these projects have been the subject of major reports including appropriate recommendations to regional directors to ensure that projects meet the objectives set by the individual Aboriginal communities affected. Co-ordination The Government has in the course of its review endorsed my role in the co-ordination of measures to implement its Aboriginal poUcies in all fields and has agreed on appropriate coordination procedures. These will include a meeting in December-January of each year of a Commonwealth standing committee of officials at which my Department and functional depanments and agencies will be able to discuss their plans and programs. At regional and local levels community reviews are to take place every six months. Officers of my Department will invite all authorities with aid responsibilities to take part, together with the NAC member concerned, so that assistance programs can be co-ordinated, dupUcation and waste avoided, and outcomes of programs assessed. To enable the Government's Aboriginal poUcies to be achieved, my Department's responsibuities have this year been redefined as: The development, in consultation with the Aboriginal people, of national policies directed to the advancement the Aboriginal people, the administration of those policies, and the co-ordination of programs. None of these responsibilities affects the basic reeducation sponsibiUty of Commonwealth and State funcrange tional departments and agencies to deUver and further finance services to Aboriginals as to other citischemes zens. The Government accepts ciple that Commonwealth departments should ensure that in programs administered by them the needs of Aboriginals are accorded due priority on the basis of need. The Aboriginal populations of the States are mcluded in general revenue reimbursement calculations, and the Commonwealth Government expects that the States will provide at least a pro rata share to Aboriginals in their own welfare programs, and in those supported by the Commonwealth, and apply the priority of need principle in respect of Commonwealth funds made avaUable for welfare purposes. I am very conscious of the need for consultation with the State authorities, in particular where nnancial decisions or new initiatives will affect existing State services. Consultation, co-ordination, accountabUity and review are elements in the process of upgrading the effectiveness of departmental assistance programs. I have already referred to the action the Government has been taking to increase employment opportunities for Aboriginals. I seek leave to have incorporated in Han . rd parts of the statement under the following program headings: Training; education; housing; health; alcohol problems of Aboriginals; and civU hberties. Leave granted The statement read asfollowsThe Government recognises that real Aboriginal selfmanagement and self-sufficiency can only be achieved if adequate and effective training is provided. We are determined that it will be provided. This is why this year's Budget vides, for the first time,financefor a separate and distinct Aboriginal training program. Education In thefieldof education, it is significant that the 1971 Census revealed that nearly one-quarter of all Aboriginals not then attending schools had never attended school. This is striking evidence of the past neglect and inadequacies which were typical in respect of the provision of almost all services to Aboriginals. By the end of 1977 there had been a substanual improvement. Almost 13,000 Aboriginal children were studying at secondary schools and were receiving Commonwealth study assistance. At the same rime, approximately 2,500 Aboriginals-mainl y young adults-were studying a variety of courses at technical and tertiary institutions. In contrast to earlier policies, an important element in the development of current educational programs is the encourageof ment of Aboriginal participauon from community to national level, including the establishment in 1977 of the National Aboriginal Education Committee, an all Aboriginal body. This Committee provides Aboriginal advice on needs and appropriate means of meeting them. A of special education programs is now available to Aboriginals in all categories from pre-school to technical and education. Special Aboriginal student assistance encourage Aboriginals to take up educational as a general prinopportunities. Housing The Government gives a high priority to overcoming the effects of years of neglect which have resulted in a deplorable housing situation for Aboriginals. Since 1968 approximately 7,000 nouses have been constructed or purchased for Aboriginals using Commonwealthfinance,to provide accommodation for between 30,000 and 40,000 people. In addition, over 2,000 hostel beds have been provided through Aboriginal Hostels Limited. The Government has allocated a further $40m for Aboriginal housing programs in 1978-79-som e one-third of the total programs allocation to my Department-whic h demonstrates our priority for housing and determination to sustain our effort. Health Although Aboriginal access to health services at all levels has improved markedly in recent years, the general health status of Aboriginalsremainslow. The Government's aim is to provide, as soon as possible, equality both of access and outcome for Aboriginals inrespectof health services, and to raise the health standards of Aboriginals to those enjoyed by the general Australian community. Aboriginal medical services, managed by Aboriginals, play an effective role in the delivery of health services to Aboriginals. My Department now supports 10 Aboriginal medical services in metropolitan areas and in large country towns. Services now operate in Brisbane, Townsville, Redfern, Kempsey, and Melbourne, Bairnsdale, Shepparton, Port Augusta, Perth and Alice Springs. In addition, the Government in the past year has supported the establishment of three community-based health services on a pilot basis in the Central Australian region, with the community assuming responsibility for all aspects of planning, management and delivery of services. Among other things, these services employ ngangkaris, or traditional healers, to work as colleagues alongside salaried doctors, nurses and Aboriginal health workers. Initially, the services are giving attention to meeting immediate health needs with the provision of basic health care and curative services, but it is envisaged that they will increasingly move into preventive Training and promotive acuvities. Honourable members will be aware that the House of Representatives Standmg Committee on Aboriginal Affairs has this year been mquiring into the whole question of Aboriginal health. This inquiry has my full support and I look forward to having its findings and recproommendations to assist the Government in overcoming the health problems of Aboriginal Australians. Alcohol Problems of Aboriginals The same Committee issued itsfinalreport Problems of Aboriginals in November 1977. This report emphasised the importance of preventive measures in the Aboriginal alcohol program, of supporting community decisions to restrict alcohol consumption and of supporting Aboriginal-run rehabUitation and follow-up services. Government recognises-as do the Aboriginal themselves-ho w crucial it and as communities to Umit alcohol abuse and control effects. Priority is being given to programs in thisfield.Some 33 Aboriginal-run alcohol rehabUitation centres and projects are being supported by my Department. It is a measure of the effect of alcohol basis, Aboriginals are grossly over-represented in our prisons and corrective institutions. Prison statistics that Aboriginals charged with offences in the courts much greater probability of being convicted and jailed other Australians. Eleven independent Aboriginal legal services operating from nearly SO offices in all tory are providing legal advice and representation for Aboriginals involved in both crirninal and civil legal matters. Although a number of measures already exist in the States and the Northern Territory, last year I instructed my Department to promote a strategy, and the Northern Territory, for action to overcome problems which Aboriginals encounter in their dealings with police. The strategy encompasses measures such as the estabUshment of ponce-Aboriginal Uaison systems;recruitmentof Aboriginal police and police aides; the institution of training schemes to assist police in recognising Aboriginals; improvement in police complaints procedures; and proceduralreformsrelatingto the detention and interrogation of Aboriginals. A particular problem area of Aboriginalrelationswith the law concerns Aboriginal juvenile offenders. My Department, in co-operation with the States, is seeking to promote uniform and adequate protections for Aboriginal juveniles questioned by the police or charged in court. The Australian Law Reform Comnussion is continuing its study of the possibUities of applying or otherwiserecognisingAboriginal customary law in the administration ofjustice. This reference was given to the Commission in response to requests by many Aboriginal communities in the north for help in handUng law and order problems in their communities and for recognition of the problems they face in adapting their traditional forms of social control to their contemporary situation. I believe,, that this people typifies the quiterevolutionary changes that have occurred in Aboriginal Ufe in the past decade. Aboriginals are no longer, as they once were, a silent minority, the largely passive andremarkablytolerant recipients of whatever poUcies and programs governments and their ofncials in their wisdom decided were good for them. They have stepped forward to grasp new opportunities, to make their own decisions, to make their voice heard and to make a positive and important contribution to the cultural, social, econonuc and poltiical Ufe of the Australian nation. They have found a new dignity and a new pride in being Aboriginal. It is this change, rather ments in educational and health status orfigureson the number of houses provided by and for Aboriginals, which really provides a measure of the effects of the Aboriginal affairs' poUcies that have been appUed over the last decade. It is this change which, I believe, should give us all, and particularly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the Alcohol themselves, great hope for the future.",66
151,Mr VINER,AFFAIRS REPORT,"The recent negotiations of the Northern Land Council on the terms and conThe ditions for niining of uranium at Ranger and people Nabarlek, and the leasing of land for the is for Aboriginals as individuals its Kakadu National Park, are only the first of many occasions when Aboriginals, with their own related expert advisers, will deal with governments and in part corporations on a basis of equahty to negotiate abuse that, on a population courts, the conditions on which their lands can be used indicate by others.

They themselves are very conscious now of their cultural identity and of the extent to which it is everywhere threatened and has in many parts suffered loss through the destructive effects of contact. The Government has been helping Aboriginals throughout Australia to maintain, develop and restore and rebuild their cultural identity through the programs of the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council and through bi-cultural and bilingual education programs. In this context I kind of initiative by Aboriginal mention that, in response to requests from several communities, we have been working on proposals for the development of local communityThe Road Ahead based broadcasting services for Aboriginals in their own languages.

Conclusion In this statement. I have presented the results House of the Government's review of its pohcies.

There is no doubt in my mind that the Govern-sacked ment has created conditions in which significant changes in Aboriginal outlook and expectations are taking place. In the changing context of original affairs, the Government's pohcies are proper and effectiveresponseto the legitimate aspirations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. I am encouraged by the marked degree of suppon which the Government's inOenpeUi itiatives have received in the wider community. Many church and community organisations have indicated such support Many of their statements have urged the Government to do more than able to do at present with the funds at its disposal. Indeed, an opinion poll taken earlier this year found that 44 per cent of people surthose veyed believe that the Commonwealth and the States are not doing enough in Aboriginal affairs.government I welcome such interest and good will as a healthy sign of community commitment to our act common aims in Aboriginal affairs. With such suppon from the Australian community, I be that Aboriginal Australians can look forward with confidence to years of progress ahead firmly based on foundations which this Governhas buUt I present the following paper Repon of Depanment of Aboriginal Affairs for year 30 June 1978-Ministeria l Statement, 24 November Motion (by Mr Hunt) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",73

Let us hope that some day the major performance will match the major promises. However, I should like to make one point. On Monday, 20 March, an article it appeared in the Age newspaper questioning the future of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission following agreement by the Prime Minister (Mr level-28. Malcolm Fraser) to a Queensland demand. The article stated: Mr Viner told a meeting of senior Aboriginal Affairs officials on March 14 he wanted the commission's functions incorporated in a new Aboriginal enudement capital account would become a type of 'Aboriginal Development the On the same day the Minister and the Prime denied the story.

He admits, of and course, that Aborigines have the highest death outrate, the worse health and housing, higher unemployment-mor e than 50 per cent-and the lowest educational, occupational, economic, and legal status of any identifiable section of our population. We submit that the Minister has no reason to be proud of the Government's to this disaster area of such magnitude. every He approved this year's Aboriginal housing funding, taking credit for an increase in funds. So there should be an increase in funds.

The Minister must be very one-eyed if he thinks that that statement is to his advantage. Cenainiy in my view it is an understatement. It is perfectly obvious that the Aboriginal people can expect nothing from this Government except submade minimum funding once a year, if they are lucky. The people of Aurukun and Mornington Island, the people of the Kimberleys and of Arnhem cise. Land, all know that they can expect only trickery and sellouts from this Government. I think it is fitting comment by the Aboriginal people on what this Government gives them that yesterday the Aboriginal Lands Trust of New South Wales passed the following resolutions: That as from the date of this meeting original Lands Trust is to cut offices of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs concerning financial matters until such times as the Aboriginal Lands Trustreceivesmeaningfulreplyto ment of Aboriginal Affairs for its full funding program for New South Wales. That a special investigation committee intofinancialstrangulation of the Aboriginal Land Trust and other Aboriginal organisations. The Committee is hereby appoined comprising Mr Cruse, M.B.E. and Mr Griffith with vices of the Trust as may berequiredand any other whomsoever the Committee deems necessary to look into financial strangulation of the Aboriginal Lands Trust other Aboriginal organisations and associated matters. It is imponant to note that the Chairman of the Aboriginal Lands Trust of New South Wales, a that Act, member of the newly set up Committee, is also or both if the Eastern Region Chairman of the National for a Aboriginal Council. The Minister's statement is prosecuted more than hypocritical. He has forced the New South Wales Land Trust into a position where essential services on reserves have been cut off before completely. The reserves have been forced to sack many of their employees including essential in respect of whose office an a person Aboriginal field workers. Essential repairs and its Terrimaintenance for plumbing, sewerage, et cetera the Statuhave no funds until December. The Minister's State Act explanation of why he refuses to give the reserves the funds that have been aUocated to them and in the Budget of last August is that several comof the munities are getting funds direct instead of a person through the Trust. But several communities are or a person getting notliing. The repair and maintenance or place funds for the Trust are Uttle better than half the Consul, amounts provided for self-managed homes. The AmMmister has not disclosed why this year's funds of Mission, ae being withheld until next month. What the pubhc and the Aboriginal people were hoping for when this statement was foreshadowed was an announcement of some major achievement or some dramatic breakin through. They were hoping for a draft lease for Aurukun, or an acknowledgement by the Northern Land Council that it would consult with Aborigines on their ground in their style and time scale, or perhaps an undenaking that there will be atighteningup of mistakes, such as those in the appointment of the NAC secretary or in the StaweU Timber Industries deals. But no, this statement is one more pubUc relations exerIt is an exercise in easing the conscience of the Minister perhaps, or simply an exercise in a wearing down the voices of protest. The Minister has lost the trust and respect of the people he serves. Instead of singing the dubious praises of his Government, it would do more for this institution if he set about practising what he preaches in his poUcies and promises and tried to regain the Office of the Ab-what he has lost. off all consultation with the Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) itsrequestto the Departadjourned.

Two such cals have been singled out by the media in regard-2,4,5T and 2,4-D. These, to a large extent, formed the basis of the Senate Comclearance mittee's report. It is vital to any consideration this matter that it be accepted at the outset that many substances, not only herbicides and ticides, are toxic when used incorrectly or used for a purpose for which they are not designed. Indeed, as one world authority has stated: are no harmless substances; there are only harm-advances less ways of using substances'. The use of agricultural chemicals for pest disease control has for many years been an essential ingredient in increasing levels and ity of agricultural production not only in Australia but throughout the world. Herbicides and pesticides are by their very nature toxic certain types of Uving cells. Indeed were this so they would be totaUy ineffective for the purStates pose for which they are manufactured. The must be, therefore, to estabUsh safe usage of herbicides and pesticides. This clearly demands that such substances must be exhaustively tested before being put on the market. Let me set out at this stage the present protions, cedures for the examination of agricultural chemicals before they are released on the traUan market. Eminent scientific and medical experts in this country study in the utmost detailTerritory the results of aU the exhaustive tests carried out all over the world. The deUberations and subing sequent reports of the various committees and councils on which these experts sit form the on which action regarding subsequent use herbicides and pesticides is taken and on which legislation is based. In this regard I would tion in particular the Australian Agricultural Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. No agricultural chemical is accepted for registration in any part of Australia without these exhaustive studies having been completed and without the recommendations of these bodies on which sit some of our leading experts. These procedures have been in opercluding ation for many years and have proved to be entirely satisfactory and at this time. I see no problems. reason to suggest any change. I now come to the question of the review aspects-includin g safety-relatin g to agriculthe tural chemicals subsequent to their initial release for general use. It isrecognisedthat it is necessthe ary that all such substances' should be kept continuousreviewto ensure that unexpected or effects which may arise at a later date not pass unnoticed and that appropriate remedial action is taken. I can assure honourable chemimembers that the recommendations of the this National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Agricultural Council for for registration of agricultural chemiof cals are kept under constantreviewand revised as necessary in the Ught of information obtained pesfrom a multitude of worldwide sources. In recent years the work associated with the review of these substances has increased in volume 'Thereand complexity. There have been tremendous in technology. In Une with this, moves are at present afoot to strengthen my own Deand partment's abUity to meet the chaUenge. A national drug information service with computer qualfacUities has been estabUshed and is at present being further developed. Work is already in progress to expand this into a comprehensive to drugs and poisons information service and I feel notconfident that my ministerial counterparts in the will be happy to give whatever assistance aimis required to aUow this to progress. Honourable members will appreciate that it is essential for those who use chemicals and other potentiaUy dangerous substances to be fully aware of therestrictionsin usage, safety direcprecautions and so forth to ensure safety to themselves and others. This is normally Ausaccomplished by appropriate labelling. In Australia labeUing is controUed by State and legislauon and with agricultural chemicals the inclusion of various statements concerncomposition, use, directions, Umitation, precautions and safety is mandatory. The language basisused routinely is EngUsh. Unfortunately, some of members of our community whose command of the language is not entirely adequate could exmenperience some difficulty and it has been suggested that translations into other languages would be the means of overcoming these difficulties. What is generaUy not appreciated is that the labeUing is frequendy lengthy and complex and consequently direct translation into several languages is simply not practicable. Difficulties of this nature are recognised and machinery, in the appointment of ethnic liaison officers, has been set up to look into such This brings me to the Senate Committee's final of aUrecommendation concerning the examination by Minister for Health of the current machinery for the systematic coUection of information on occurrence and frequency of congenital abundernormaUties and of types of cancer. Since the tabUng of the report, I have carefuUy examined the situation and I am confident that much can be done to rectify any deficiencies in data collecand tions which are recognised here in Australia. the same time. I would stress that such deficiennecessary cies are by no means confined to this continent but are seen as a worldwide problem. Our present weaknesses are seen to be incomplete data collection in some areas and a lack of ordination on a nationwide scale. Some deficienmoments cies in the machinery for the analysis of collected data are also apparent. A need is seen for the collection of more comdetection prehensive information on toxic effects of subpatterns stances mcluding the underlying causes of birth defects which are not of genetic origin. Indeed believe it would not be stressing this aspect far if I were to say that much of the pubhc cern and indeed alarm which has been generated recently could have been allayed if basic data lating to possible extra-genetic causes of foetal abnormalities had been more extensive. Whilst recent concern has been concentrated on the possible effects of 2,4,5-T and to a lesser extent 2,4-D, both of which have been extensively researched, there has been Uttle comment on the other environmental factors-som e curring naturaUy, some generated by man's inventiveness-whic h could result in foetal normalities. Bearing in mind the need to keep whole subject in proper perspective, I propose that the following developments should take place: CoUection of perinatal statistics should extended to cover the whole country. This inforthat mation is currendy coUected in only two Statesondly, Western Australia and Tasmania. The next no Health Ministers' Conference in June 1979 was to have discussed this extension. However, I am now suggesting to my coUeagues in the other four States that we proceed immediately with those discussions as a matter of priority. The total cost of extending the data coUection system to the other four States is estimated $ 120,000 per annum which it be met on a cost-sharing basis, and the Commonwealth Government is prepared to meet the cost of this. My counterparts in the States be approached to obtain their views regarding this. Since the analysis of the data, related births, from these various statistical systems would need to be performed on a nationwide basis, a national perinatal statistical unit will need to be set up. The cost of this in the next iinancial year is estimated at $80,000, increasing to $ 100,000 in the following year. CoUection of information on acute poisonings cancers is already covered reasonably satisAt factorily and, whUst some improvement may be in these fields, major restructuring of systems is not envisaged. The analysis of data in relation to these two aspects is an appropriate function of an expanded national drug poisons coinformation service to which I referred a few ago. I am confident that the estabUshment of these systems will aUow more extensive monitoring of the incidence of poisonings, congenital abnormalities and cancers and will aUow inat an early stage of change in disease attributable the community which might be to toxic environmental substances. I In order to concentrate specificaUy on the too effects of various substances on pregnant women, conI am asking the National Health and Medical Research Council to advise on the feasibUity and rethe desirabUity of conducting a prospective study extending over possibly 3 years. If such a study were considered to be necessary-and the comments of the experts on the possible additional costsbenefits will be awaited-ther e is no doubt that over $2m would be high and could well amount to a year. In the meantime, I reiterate the advice given ocby the National Health and Medical Research Council in June of this year following a study of abaU information avaUable at that time regarding the 2,4,5-T, 2,4-D and the risks of foetal abnormabties. The conclusions reached by the Council were: Firsdy, the use of 2,4-D is not producing be any risk to human health; there is no evidence it is linked to human birth defects; and, secin the Ught of present knowledge there is reason to place any addidonal restrictions on the use of 2,4,5-T. Council couldfindno substantiated scientific evidence of a causal Unk between the use of 2,4,5-T and human birth defects. These agricultural chemicals have both been in use for around 30 years and different action to control their use have been taken in various parts of the world. Although a few countries do not use these chemicals, nevertheless, controUed usage at has been adopted as the method of choice on a is suggested should wide scale. half With the extensive informadon which has will been avaUable and with the advice provided to me by the experts, all of whom are held in high to esteem in our community, I see no reason at this time for suggesting any changes in current practices. However, aU chemicals must be kept under constant review. I am confident that this will continue to be done in this country and that the extensions to the various data coUections which I have suggested will provide us with a system which will compare favourably with any other country. I present the following paper Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment: Herbicides, Pesticides and Health-Ministeria l Statement, 24 November 1978. Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",76
162,Dr EVERJTNGHAM,HUMAN HEALTH,"I do not propose to detain the House. I believe that the Opposition spokesman on health, the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), will be making a statement on the matter later in the day. Two points which occur to me from the statement of the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) perhaps need to be considered. One is the matter of the prospective study which will cost $2m a year to carry out. It invites a comparison with the retrospective study carried out by Dr MCBride on thahdomide. I suggest that it might be fruitful and far cheaper to do a retrospective study of environmental factors in those areas in which birth defects apparently have been endemic in recent times. I have no firm data on which to blame herbicides or anything else, but I know that misleading answers were given by a local authority in my area to parents who were involved in a freak cluster of abnormality occurring over a short period in an area in which there was large scale aerial spraying to destroy water weeds. There is still room for retrospective study in areas where deformities have been clustered. I would like the Minister to clarify, if not today on some other occasion, the nature of the drug and poisons information service. A service is available at certain poisons information centres. In cases of poisoning doctors can obtain conPubUcations, fidential commercial information on the compomittee's sition of poisons such as cleaning fluids. I whether the time has arrived when the general public is entitled to a more frank accessibility knowledge about poisons, their effects and their handling. The instructions on the label, particutiveness larly in the case I menuoned with regard to use of herbicides by a local authority is not always obeyed. I believe that there is a need some cases to tighten up supervision. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) be adjourned. NA NA",80

168,Mr SPEAKER,SECURITY IN PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Mr William Worth came to loyalty the Parliament as the interim security coordinator on 16 March 1978. He had the difficult task of bringing in the new and not always appreciated security measures decided upon by Mr President and me. Mr Worth had previously ved with distinction in a wide variety of specialist positions. He was for seven years the Deputy Secretary-General of the South East Asian to Treaty Organisation. He managed the Austrahan Wastage participation in Expo 67 in Montreal and Expo 70 in Osaka. He was also the Austrahan Comsenators admissioner General for Expo 74 in Spokane, United States of America, and for Expo 75 in Okinawa. His final appointment in the service was as Adrninistrator of the Territory of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. I am grateful that he agreed to come out of retirement temporarily to take on the task of security co-ordinator on an interim basis. His wide exto table annual reports perience and quiet pursuit of the objective of a been of sound security system has been most helpful to of me in my endeavour to provide a secure meeting Senate place for the House of Representatives. Mr a Worth, by his personal character and quahty, has et cetera, has failed to meet been able to reach a situation in which everyor body in the building is prepared to co-operate in the security system. He has made recommenand I dations to us. We have, in turn, made recommenwe have dations to the Executive government. It has of themade money available. Certain changes will be made during the break between now and February which will be designed to make more effective the security system in this House. I will in say no more than that. Honourable members and some staff of the House will see those changes as they eUgible develop. I thank Mr Worth on behalf of the and thereHouse for the contribution he has made. RETIREMENT OF MR R. HILLYER recipients will not therefore bewiU watch Mr SPEAKER-Sadly, I have another report refer to make to the House about aretirement,that is, retheretirementof the Secretary of the Joint House Department, Mr Dick Hhlyer. Mr Hillyer is such a modest man that he told me he was retiring next year. I was not aware that he would actually have retired before the House resumes. I therefore make a tribute to him. Dick Hillyer has spent a life time, in any ordinary sense, in the service of members of Parhament. He has always been accessible. He has always been anxious to Mr assist. He has always been accessible for our various complaints. There have been many of them the to the poor Secretary of the Joint House Department. He has been sustained by a staff anxious to give him loyalty but, more importantly to give to the people they serve in this place, that is members, senators and their staff. Dick Hillyer was serving in the armed forces when he saw an advertisement for the position of seraccountant of the Joint House Department. He appUed for that position. He was released from the Services to take the job in 1946. From 1946 1979 he will have served us. I found him to be a man of immense integrity. We have been fortunate with the quahty of the people who have occupied senior positions in this House. I feel sure that the whole House will agree with me. Dick Hillyer has served us extremely well under very trying circumstances. We appreciate that very much. We hope that he will have a very rewarding and satisfying retirement. We can do no better than wish hun health and security in his retirement.

NA",81
169,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VALEDICTORY,"by leave-Before we leave the House for 1978,1 would like to pay tribute to the hundreds of people, behind and in front of the scenes who ensure that the Parliament functions effectively and efficiently. All members appreciate the manner in which you, Mr Speaker, have performed your official duties. Your patience, firm hand and good humour have guided this House through many hours of somewhat too spirited debate. You have sought at alltimesto maintain a high level of dignity, decency and fairness in our proceedings for which, I must say, you do not always get the support that you should from all sections of this House. I would also like to congratulate the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) on the way in which he has carried out his task in hisfirstyear as Chairman of Committees. You have both been ably assisted by the Clerk of the House and his omcers. The smooth running of this chamber is in large measure due to the knowledge and experience of these omcers of the Parliament. We are grateful, too, for the hard work of many other parliamentary officials. The Hansard staff never fail in their duty to report the parUamentary debates promptly and with an elegance of grammar which frequently surprises the honourable members whose words are recorded, when they read them the following day. I wish the new Principal ParUamentary Reporter, Mr John Kerr, every success in his new position. To Mr Ken Ingram, who retires next month, after 42 years service with Hansard I pay a special word of thanks. Over the past decade he has initiated many new procedures which have enhanced the capacity and efficiency of Hansard to report our proceedings. I wish him well in his retirement. I also wish to note the retirement during this year of Mr Les Moore as Parliamentary Librarian, and the appointment of Mr Harold Weir to succeed him. AU honourable members avaU themselves of the resources and assistance of the Parliamentary Library. I thank all members of the Library staff for their courteous help to aU members, of aU poltiical persuasions. The staff of the Table Office, too, deserve our thanks for their attention to members' request for reports and other essential documents. I 20 thank Roger Webb, the ParUamentary Uaison the ab-officer, who works diligently to ensure that this Chairman of Comchamber functions efficiently. The First ParUamentary Counsel, Mr Quayle, and his staff receive our thanks for their achievement in preparing for parUamentary consideration BUls of a consistently high standard. Their skill and attention to detaU makes our task much easier. Within this building hundreds of people work quietly behind the scenes to provide refreshment and transport facUities and to ensure that security is maintained at alltimes.I thank all those involved in this essential work. In particular I would Uke to remember Gordon Pike who has looked after the personal needs of many members for transport over decades. He has served the Parliament and its members well over many years. You, sir, have already referred to Mr Worth who has assisted as co-ordinator of security in this buUding. We wish him well in his renewed retirement, and Mr Dick Hillyer who has also served the Parliament well and faithfully in a most important capacity. It is not possible, however, to enumerate aU those who contribute to the smooth and efficient running of this House. We are conscious at the close of an arduous period of sittings, as we are throughout the year that without the skUled assistance of many people we would not achieve the legislative and representative goals of this Parliament. The major burden of government and of the carriage of the business of this House faUs on the members of the Ministry. To them. I would Uke to place on record my personal appreciation for their hard work, dedication and the way in which they have worked together as a team. We also owe a debt of gratitude to all the members of the Government parties on whom the Ministry so heavUy relies. Their loyalty, energy and contributions to poUcy and debate are greatly valued by the Government. In these last sittings, we have seen the initiation of an important parliamentary reform-the legislation committees of this House. In the consideration of the seven Bills so far considered by the two committees, honourable members have taken the opportunity to become more fully acquainted with the finer details of complex measures. I am advised that in a non-partisan way in Committee, amendments have been accepted that might well have been difficult to accept through the previous procedures of debate in the Committee of the Whole. I believe quite cenainiy that as time passes this committee system will expand and develop further and may well assist in the process of the Budget debates themselves. Some consideration could be given to the possibility of the Committee stage of the Budget being carried forward in committees, two or more, which could sit concurrently enabling more members to express their views on matters of imponance to them. Now that the legislation committee system has been developed, that may well be introduced successfully. It may well be that between now and the passage of the next Budget a proposal in relation to that particular matter could at least examined to see if the Parliament thought it worth implementation and development in the autumn session for use in the next Budget sittings. A number of worthwhile and constructive amendments have been proposed and accepted through the new and proposed procedure for the Committee stages of BiUs. I think it is good to see the Parliament develop procedures which enable a less partisan approach to measures which come before the Parhament I would Uke to thank the Committees' chairmen, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr GUes) and the honourable member for SculUn (Dr Jenkins), for their service and their commitment in getting the committees off the ground in a proper and constructive manner. I trust that aU members and their famUies ise to the fuU the coming weeks in their various electorates to the best of their own endeavours and I wish all members and their coming period a happy Christmas and a prosperous new year. I hope that we all return to this place next year reinvigorated-for those who feel the need of reinvigoration-for the autumn tisanship session, which I have no doubt will be busy and wiU take our inteUigence and time.",82
170,Mr HAYBEN,VALEDICTORY,"by leave- I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in expressing ventional tributes which are made at this time the year each year. Mr Speaker, it has been busy year-rathe r euphemisdcaUy from your point of view a demanding and chaUenging year, even a trying year. We aU look forward to the break of the festive season to recharge batteries and return invigorated with new ideas, hopefully to contribute constructively to the big chaUenges that confront this country in so many ways. As the Prime Minister acknowledged to the extent that we are able to do that with success, we can only do it with the suppon of so many people who work in this Parliament House or work in houses nearby as staff of the House and help us to discharge our duties in various ways. I forget what the relationship is between people who work in suppon capacities to keep troops in the front Une, and troops in the front line. It is quite a high ratio and from time to time has been commented on as being extraordinarily, if not questionably, high. The ratio in this Parliament is even higher. I am told by the Clerk that there are about 1,000 persons working in Parliament House or in buUdings associated with this House providing services to keep us functioning one way or the other. Without that sort of help we would be be nothing but a beached hulk, as ineffective as that. We are grateful for it. We appreciate the dedication of the people in the various roles they fulfil in this Parliament House which aUow us to keep functioning. I do not intend to enumerate them. I believe the Prime Minister has done that effectively. However, I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister's speech about the possibUity of a further reform in parUamentary procedures designed to try to achieve more bipartisanship in the consideration and discharge of various obUgations and dudes which we have in this Parliament. From the reports which I have received from my coUeagues of the Opposition, I can confirm that the new committee system considering legislation at this stage appears to be working well and has been successful in breaking down a utilsubstantial degree of poltiical polarity which otherwise would have been evident within the chamber. I added that I sincerely trust that famUies for the progress will continue. I am encouraged by the Prime Minister's comment about funher exploration in this area designed to achieve further progress towards biparin the things that we have to do here. I said before and I will say many times again- I hope honourable members will Usten to these with some patience and restraintthat one of the most encouraging experiences I conhave had in this Parliament in 17 years was to of work on a joint parUamentary cominittee of in a quiry into the pharmaceutical drugs Usted under the National Health Scheme. There it was interesting to note the way in which attitudes presented themselves between the various members of the Committee. Some members of the Australian Labor Party and some members of the coaUtion parties would take what we might say would be a more radical view, share it and press it. Some other members of the Labor Party and of the coaUtion parties would take a more conservative view. Often there would be a shift in that sort of distribution of attitude on poltiical spectrum. That was a particularly valuable experience for me because it showed that unlike ation in this chamber it is possible, sult, to get a great deal of bipartisanship clusions about a particular matter put before a group of parUamentarians, but more importantly that this could be achieved with a greater certhe ebral contribution and with much more harmony than we are used to seeing in this chamber. What I am saying is simply that the debating technique of handUng matters of such complexity, as we for have to do these days, seems the least effective and desirable way of approaching such responcontinue sibuities. I have likened it often enough before a type of 1914-18 trench warfare in which people bed down in their trenches and start blasting one another, Uttle progress being made two sides, every one in afixedbattlement position and the outcome pretty much resolved before it even starts. Mr Birney-That is what you did this morning.",83
171,Mr HAYDEN,VALEDICTORY,"I am trying to give a fairly open approach to what I tliink can be done. If the honourable member wants to inject some poUtiwhich cal partisanship into the discussion I am happy respond. But let us leave it at this level for this occasion. The honourable member did not do too badly this morning either, if l may congratutrust late him. What I am saying to the Prime MinisSpeaker, ter, through you Mr Speaker, is that the Oppoframe sition is keen to foUow up the suggestion that has conveyed. We believe that there is room wide range of reform in this Parhament. I in a purely objective sense. I believe that there a need for vast improvement in the way in which we handle Question Time in this Parliament. defective as it now operates, and it has been the time that I have been a member of ParUaHouse. ment, regardless of which party has been in government It is very easy for any Minister function answering a question to ignore the substance of that question if he wishes. That is not a particuthey larly productive undertaking in my view. It does not contribute at aU helpfuUy to a consideration and better undemanding of the great issues before this Parliament and for which we are responsible to the nation. I would Uke to see a system at Question Time during which questions are put on notice and certam Ministers could appear on certain selective days in this House to answer those questions. Honourable members would have the right to ask supplementary questions. The honourable member for Holt (Mr the Yates) I expect would be well aware of this system. I believe that would lead to a much more effective communications system for the pubUc and the Parliament and be a far better test of the situhow well a Minister is handling his in thefinalreresponsibUity. in conThere are a range of other matters which we ought to be looking at too in relation to the functioning of the Parliament so that we could reduce level of artificial polarity that exists in this Parliament. I do not pretend for a minute that I am totaUy innocent in this respect but I do not accept for a minute that I am totaUy responsible it either. It is the nature of our system and the way in which it functions that this exists and will to. Accordingly, I would Uke to see a to situation in which we set up a cominittee of inquiry to investigate very broadly ways in which we can reform the broad perspective of the funcbetween the tioning of this Parliament. I feel that I have gone far enough in that direction. I am really on my feet to join in an expression of tribute to aU those people who have helped us. The Prime Minister has commended his Government members. I also commend the members of the Opposition for the assiduous way in which they have fulfilled the various tasks they have as parUamentarians, for the to dedicated way in which they have worked to represent their electorates and for the effective way in which they have performed as an Opposition. I that aU famUies enjoy the festive season.

I believe that the task you ercise is made all the more difficult by the activity and behaviour of some members in this place from time to time.

I said a few remarks about theretirementof Mr Ingram. The Hansard writers have an important role. We are indebted to the way in which they perform. I wish Mr well. MrSpeaker, you have mentioned the retire-and ment of Dick Hillyer and Bill Worth. Dick do Hillyer has been a stalwart of this place. Again on behalf of the members of the National Country Party I extend to him our good wishes for a happyretirementI have known Bill Worth for many years. He worked with my wife at Expo 67 when she was Chief Hostess and I have been associated with nnn over the years. We are debate indebted to the way he assumed the role, out retirement, of Principal Security Officer in Parliament I believe that the work that he has done has ensured that today there is a far greater degree ofreasonablesecurity in this place than otherwise would be the case. I share in the wishes of the Prime Minister the Leader of the Opposition to aU members of the House that they come back to this place refreshed for next year's session. However, must say that in the discussion of parUamentary reform and the suggestions by the Leader of the House. exOpposition with respect to Question Time I believe much of the fault Ues not in the system but with Opposition members. I remember well, as move do many honourable members, the way in which the government members of the present Opposition he performed at Question Time. The use of Quesretion Time only as a manner and avenue for expohcy is not the intention of the present Standing Orders. I am interested in the suggestions the Leader of the Opposition has made to the character of Question Time. Yet I House, I extend my Questionsdegree find the to which there has been within Notice some variation from time to we can devise a way to ensure for the manner the effectiveness of is a fairly unique syssystem of Questions Withit That does reformed. both the the method of presenting and answering the It seems to me that the area in which is the best prospect of parUamentary reform is the area to which the Prime Minister has his attention. There is no doubt that the operation of the legislauon committees has been a notable advance in the reforms introduced by this Government. I join with the  in wishing aU honourable members in this place and aU those who are associated with it a happy say Christmas. I trust that we will all return to the fight in somewhat better form in the New Year. today Mr YATES (Holt)-by leave-I do not want to detract from the fact that the House is adjourning for a recess which includes the seven remainKerr ing days of November, the whole of December January, and for 19 days out of February. I not tliink we should feel that that is not a good idea. But, unfortunately, events in the world outside will be continuing. At present, the Iran Government is tottering; the Lebanon is in chaos; and Central Africa is in great trouble. As we look around the world, we are begmning to wonder why this Parliament has not had a major on foreign affairs this session. Therefore, I of ask the Government: Should the United Nations thedecide to invite this Government to send Australian forces during the parUamentary recess into the Pacific, the Persian Gulf, perhaps into Zambia or elsewhere, will the Government first caU the Parliament together. I hope that the and Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and you, Mr Speaker, will consider this matter seriously. I would not be prepared to permit Australian I forces to be committed to the United Nations without a full debate first being held in this I do not in any way detract from the Christmas spirit that is with us. We have our international responsibilities. I ask the Leader of the House give an undertaking before we pass this motion to honourable members on both sides of the House that, if the United Nations Secretaryout General requires the presence of Australian armed forces to assist the United Nations, much as we would approve of such aclion, the ParUapleased ment should be recaUed and the debate should take place before such action is agreed to. In spirit, I thank you, Mr Speaker, very much. have noticed that your procession is going well. hope that parUamentary processions will conwelcome tinue. I hope that everybody will enjoy another happy new year.",84
172,Mr SPEAKER,VALEDICTORY,"I should Uke to raise a couple of matters. I think that 1978 has been the most signincant year in our history for the Parhament. There is a number of reasons for this statement. mention the decision to build the new and perlenges manent Parliament House, upon which I conthere gratulate the Executive Government and the position for their unanimity, is an immense advance. Secondly, we were privUeged to have the Presiding Officers' Conference of the Westment minster parliaments here in this chamber a few months ago. Thirdly, we have established legisofthe lation committees. I think that the Executive Government is to be very highly compUmented for its wUlingness to adopt this reform of ment. The fact is that, by legislation, obUgation are created. It is not in the interests democracy that those rights or obUgations ible should be created without the closest scrutiny. That cannot be done in the plenary sessions of of this Parliament and must be done in committee tem sessions. I congratulate the Executive Government giving ment for agreeing to this action. It has been a most productive year also for legislation and debate. The quaUty of debatemay be chaUenged on this statement-ha s been House rather high at aUtimesalthough there have certain lapses from that high quaUty. choose to identify those persons who have been responsible for the lapses. One ought to be careminster ful who might be identified. The assertion of parUamentary authoiity to which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has contributed so much in this year I think ought to be properly acknowledged. The Prime Minister on 25 May 1978 gave an undertaking that, within six months of the tabUng of a mittee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action that the Government proposes to take in relation to the report If the six-month period expires during a parUamentary recess, the Ministerial statement will be made at the earUest opto portunity in the next parUamentary sitting. I think it is proper to say that this year- I pay tribute to the right honourable gentleman withany quaUfication-ha s been one of the most significant years of parUamentary reform in this Parliament's history. Therefore, I was extremely to hear the right honourable gentleman in this debate say that he would Uke to see a thatfurther development of the committee system I and would Uke to see the estabUshment of comI mittees to deal with the Budget BiUs next year. I that statement. I am very pleased to hear it. I am sure that it wiU be of immense value to this Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in a pleasant aside said to me that he hopes that I I come back refreshed and able to meet the chalwhich 1979 may present to me. Of course, will be changes for many people. As the Opmomentum of reform of the Parliament gathers, there is one significant reform which needs to be taken account of by aU members of the ParUafrom whatever party-that is, the adoption in this Parliament of the Westminster convention separation of the Speaker from aU poltiical party activity. It necessarily involves very marked changes in the attitude which parties ParUahave hitherto held towards the Speaker's rights and position. of I propose during the next year to do all possto achieve in this Parliament the acceptance the Westminster system. The Westminster syswiU necessarily mean that the Speaker wiU continue in office regardless of change of governhim a continuity which others would not possess. Because of that fact, I cannot be the advocate for the system and the beneficiary of I the system. Accordingly, I wish to inform the that, wliile I will press for the Westminster been system, I would not be wUling to be the I do not beneficiary of the adoption ofit. I thmk that, if we were able to adopt the Westsystem, in a short time after the acceptance of the system we would grow up a century. I am very anxious to see it adopted. I hope that I can count on the support of all members of Parliament. I do not suggest that it can be adopted overnight, but adopted it must be, for what honourable members see around them is the fulcomcrum of parUamentary democracy. Without it functioning as it ought and without the occupant of this Chair not only being impartial but also being seen to be impartial and accepted as being impartial a fundamental tenet of the system is absent I believe that we ought to preserve it. beheve we ought to take action now to ensure that it will be preserved. I should like to pay a tribute quickly-althoug h it will be done quickly, it is no less important than the other points I have raised-t man of Committees. I do not see him in the House at the moment He apparently is being refreshed. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) has performed extremely well, as I am sure every honourable member of the House would acknowledge. He the position, so to speak, without warning. He has discharged that position excellently. I tribute to him for his work. I wish to commiserate with the Deputy ChairMichael men of Committees because a decision of Execuhe tive Government withheld from them a small remuneration which they would have otherwise received. I am having inquiries made as to whether they have suffered from travelling allowances in Canberra being paid to them back bench rate while they themselves are office bearers under the Tribunal'sfindingwithout receiving any remuneration for it I am very stronger. pleased at the way in which the Deputy Chairappointed, men of Committees have serviced the House. To the Clerks at the table and to the House of Representatives staff I express my appreciation. Timber It will come as no surprise to honourable for members that the Clerk of the House, Mr Pettifer, is known in my office as 'the Uttle That has regard to the fact that he is an ever helpful, ever honest man of immense integrity. is pretty hard to believe that that chap sitting there on the right-handside of the Table was flying mulu-engined aeroplanes over the Adantorate tic during the war. To aU his staff I give thanks. I thank the Library staff and the Hansard staff. I thank the Leader of the House for the operation I have received at aU dmes. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for the coassociated operation I have received from him at aU times. congratulate the party whips on their subdued interjections. I thank the ParUamentary Liaison Officer, Roger Webb, for the co-operation that have always received. I wish to thank aU honour-lation able members for spending half an hour each declaration morning thinking of how they can make Ufe easier for me during the day. of contemplation I thank them very much. Had it not been for that half hour of contemplation I do not know what sort of pressures would have upon me. I am fortunate to have a the personal quaUty and efficiency of whom are impossible to describe, but I know many House members of this House have personal contact of the House I with them. Those members can very readily be a reference to me in my statement of thanks to my staff. NA NA o the Chair Mr MALCOLM FRASER (Wannon-Prime Minister)- Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence so that I may correct a matter that was introduced into the House a short whUe ago.",86
173,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,The right honourable gentlewas thrown into man may proceed.,87
174,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AFFAIRS,"A statutory decpay laration was tabled in the Parliament a short whUe ago. It is aUeged to be signed by a Mr HeppeU. It refers to conversations that aUeges he had with Mr Illig of StaweU Timber Industries. This statutory declaration said that during the course of a meeting with Mr IiUg the question was raised of StaweU Timber Industries being able tofinancebuilding contracts, given at the that receivers and managers had been appointed. The statutory declaration stated: Mr Illig replied diat Stawell's posidon had never been On enquiry, he stated that since receivers had been Stawell Timber Industries had received 'guarantees' from the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser . . . Mr Illig was asked if these guarantees were nnancial, to which he replied in the negadve; . . . When asked what kind of guarantees Industrieshad been given, Mr Illig replied that Stawell its products. had been promised a guaranteed market pet'. Mr Speaker, let me say categorically and absolutely that StaweU Timber Industries has never It been given any guarantee of any kind by me. I have sought to assist it as the member for Wannon once the company became part of the elecof Wannon, but I gave only the private asmy sistance that I would give any constituent or constituency group. The guarantees referred to in cothe statutory declaration were not given by myself to Mr Illig, to StaweU Industries or to anyone in any sense, shape or form with the I company. An officer from my staff has this afternoon been in touch with Mr Illig who said that he might have used the word 'guarantee' in relation I to StaweU's future market but certainly not in reto me and that he would sign a statutory to that effect. The substance of the allegation, to my knowledge, is totaUy and absolFor that half hour utely false. NA been Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Leader of the personal staff House) (4.51)- I move: That leave of absence be given to every member of the of Respresentatives from the terminauon of this sitting to the date of the next sitting. I wish to reply to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) who earUer motion. asked in the course of speaking on the previous motion as to whether the Parliament would be recalled. I can give him no assurance as to the cumstances of its recall, Mr Speaker. course, Ues in your hands or in the hands Deputy, Mr Chairman of Committees, if you should be absent from Australia.

The Departments of the Capital Territory and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs have access to their own records and once again this isrestrictedto authorised personnel. (7) The main impact of the MANDATA System will be in reducing work loads in departmental Personnel and Establishment areas. Direct savmgs of 10 per cent of staff dedicated to clerical type duues are projected involving a potential saving of some 700 staff spread throughout the Service. Burroughs Data Centre (1) The Fyshwick Data Centre consists of one dual processor computer installation. It is hired from Burroughs Ltd under a facdities management contract. (2) Equipment purchase: $48,526; Equipment Hire: $478,423 p.a. The equipment purchase costs are shared between the Depanment of Adrninistrative Services ($13,950) and the Department of Trade and Resources ($34,576). The equipment hire costs are apportioned between the three Departments in accordance with theirrespectiveutilisation of Data Centre facilities.

(7) Department of Administrative Services: There have been no nett savings of staff as a result of the appUcations being run at the Data Centre. The systems were to increase efficiency, to enabletimecritical undertaken e.g. production information that would otherwise not have been available. Attorney-General's Department: Since the volume and complexity of Australian law is expanding at an increasing rate, an efficient automated system for legal work is vital if the Department is to avoid a decrease in the quaUty of service that it provides to the Government There are not, at this stage, any significant savings in staff numbers which could be directly attributed to the use of our existing automated system. For the future, the use system is more Ukely to result in a more efficient service rather than areductionin staff numbers. Department of Trade and Resources: The Department of Trade and Resources has introduced computer systems prinworkload cipally to support operations match the performance of Australia's trading competitors. Examples include the provision of trade economic statistical analysis to support trade negotiations, firms' detaUs summaries and analyses to support Australia's competitive marketing efforts. Because of the nature of this work, the Department does not attribute any direct savmgs in staff numbers to the use of computer support The benefits of the support arerealisedin improved analytical capabUity and increased productivity rather than in costreductionsderived from staff savings.

215,Mr VINER,NERDDC TECHNICAL STANDING COMMITTEES,"The answer to the honourable his frequent member's question is as follows: rePubUc servants exercising discretionary powers are, of course, bound to exercise those powers in accordance with any appUcable statutory and common law rules, including principles of natural justice. Where a member of the pubUc is with the action taken by a pubUc servant including a decision made by him procedures are avaUable for the independent review of that action-see , for example, section 15 of the Ombudsman Act 1976.

216,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NERDDC TECHNICAL STANDING COMMITTEES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: WhUst information which opening of tenders could be of some interest to tenderers, where requirements are of some complexity or the tender calls for minimum performance standards in a requirement,criminatory Utde would be gained because the tenders require detaUed evaluation in order to determine which tenders comply witha the specifications and which tender represents the best for money. It is considered that in regard to pubUc access to inforMagistrates mation on purchases and fairness to tenderers, Commonhad wealth procedures compare favourably with those of countries. Unsuccessful tenderers currendy have the right of appeal to the Minister concerned and if an independent review is required they may appeal to the Commonwealth in Ombudsman. It is considered, on balance, that whilst pubUc opening tenders could be expected to add to administrative costs, commensurate benefits can readUy be demonstrated. The practice of seeking deposits with tenders is now pUed only in respect of special categories of tendering, cipaUy in the constructionfield.The practice of such deposits adds to the cost of the tender and if appUed widely, may well discourage some tenderers thereby ing compeution to supply Commonwealth requirements.

244,Mr HOWARD,NERDDC TECHNICAL STANDING COMMITTEES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Statistician has advised that in calculating the increases or decreases in the real value specified he has assumed that the wages are award rates of pay and hence that each indexation decision would plied to the full weekly wage. On this basis, receiving $100 a week the increase wage, that is, in relation to the CPI since December quarter 1975, is 1.3 per cent For persons and $200 a week the changes are decreases of 0.7 per cent 1.9 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively.

(Question Na 2488) Imports: Price Elasticity of Demand (Question Na 2514) Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, have received only on 17 November 1978: is, (1) What is the estimated price elasticity of demand for impoits in Australia. (2) What are the estimated price elasticities of demand for important types of imported goods such as petroleum, passenger motor vehicles, electrical machinery, non-electrical of the wages machinery and domestic appliances. have ap Mr HOWARD - The answer to the honourable for persons nowmember's question is as follows: in the real value of the (1) The estimated price elasticity of demand for impoits now receiving $125, $150 varies with: (a) the types of imported goods and services to which the elasticity refers; (b) the interval oftimeallowed for the change in price to (QuestionNo. 2511) influence the level of imports; (c) the choice of model of the determination of imports and the choice of sample period over which the model is estimated. Estimates of the price elasticity of demand for imports can therefore vary considerably. The NIF-7 version of the Treasury-Australia n Bureau of Statistics National Income Forecasting Model provides an estimate of around -1.1 for an elapsed time of two to three years, for imports of goods than government imports and imports of petroleum and civil aircraft. That is, a 1 per cent rise in import prices is (other things being equal) to lead to a 1.1 per cent fall in this category of impoits measured at constant prices Hayden. I do not propose over interval oftime.Other available estimates range and below this figure. (2) Specific estimates of the price elasticity of demand for for the separate commodity groups listed are subject a great deal of variability. In general, for these commodity groups where domestically produced substitutes are importdie estimates of the elasticities tend to be larger than the of detail estimates for total imports. Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, on 18 October 1978: If the monthly trends of the last 3 years in the value exports, imports and invisibles continue, regression analysis, what will impoits, (c) invisibles, (d) the balance of trade and (e) the balance of current account 1980.",122
246,Mr HOWARD,NERDDC TECHNICAL STANDING COMMITTEES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The honourable member will appreciate that balance of payments transactions can be gready affected by variations in domestic supplies of rural commodities and in conditions in overseas markets; as well as opments at home and abroad. In these circumstances, the calculations requested, which are of a highly simplistic kind, would produce results of litde, if any, practical value. not beheve, therefore, that the work required to give ngures requested by the honourable member would be warranted.

I do not know the basis of that or the other figures quoted in the question, and I am not able to confirm them. But whatever thefiguresare, it should be understood that the taxpayers from whom taxationrevenueis derived include retiredpublic servants, and the present public also themselves make contributions towards their retirement benefits. Also, private employees belonging to schemes benefit not only from their own but also from employers' contributions which are met out of amounts the general community pays, direcdy indirectly, for goods or services supplied by the employers.

The costs of the new scheme are much less than that would haveresultedhad the Superannuation Bill 1975, introduced by the then Labor Government, been Security, brought into effect. Post-graduate Scholarships (Question No. 2553) while in Mr Humphreys asked the Treasurer, upon sickness, (b) unnotice, on 18 October 1978: Have many post-graduate scholars, presendy working researchingunder post-graduate scholarships and grants, contractual commitments on the understanding that their salary is not assessed for income tax, and, as a result of the Budget decision to introduce a standard income tax assessment on all post-graduate grants, are many unable to meet those commitments and therefore face the prospect of losing their investments or forfeiting their scholarships. (2) If so, is any assistance graduate scholarship holders. (3) As Australia now devotes a smaller percentage of its GNP to research than any other country in the western world, will he re-consider this decision.",123
251,Mr HOWARD,NERDDC TECHNICAL STANDING COMMITTEES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Changes in taxation can some taxpayers more than others. In the absence of a survey of all holders of Commonwealth post-graduate awards, it is not possible to determine whether the Budget decision to tax those awards would have the effects which the honourable member has mentioned. (2) No additional benefits are being provided under Post-Graduate Awards Scheme by way of offset to the of Budget decision. (3) I do not consider that to research has any relevence to the present matter. Blair Athol Coal Deposit Mr Hodges asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 October 1978: (1) Has his attention tralian of 12 October 1978, that the Atlantic Richfield Company of the USA is negotiating to buy the 38 per cent interest in the Blair Athol presendy held by the Daniel K.

As S & M Fox is wholly foreign owned and CRA is owned as to 72.6 per cent by the Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation of the United Kingdom, the present level of beneficial foreign ownership in Blair Athol is approximately 83 per cent This level would not be changed if another foreign interest were to acquire the share of S & M Fox.

The purpose of Division 7 is to impose on owners of prirevate companies an overall amount of tax comparable to that which would be payable if the business were not mcorporated, but operated as a sole trader or partnership. The to those in possession of Asprey Taxation Review Committee accepted that, as long as the maximum marginal rate of tax for individuals exceeded the company tax rate, the Division 7 provisions would be necessary to prevent the use of private companies as a means for high-income shareholders to avoid tax. The Government considers that the present provisions ensure an equitable outcome and, at the same time, allow private companies adequate scope for financing investment by way of retained earnings.

(1) The gross saving in 1978-79resultingfrom sition of the income test on pension increases for age pensioners aged 70 years and over is estimated to be about $14 million. (2) The Department of Social Security conducts regular computer surveys of pensioners and beneficiaries. One of the statistics obtained from these surveys is 'income as assessed'. Using the latest available income distribution of age pensioners it was estimated that 500,000 age pensioners aged 70 years or more would receive the full increase in pension rates, some 20,000 would receive part increases and some 250,000 would not qualify for any mcrease in pension rates. For pensioners with income not stated it was assumed that they would not be eligible for any income tested increases.

Those passages appear in thereponand submissions from State Homeless Persons Advisoiy Committees highlight the need for more operational costs to be made avadable through the program.

In particular, Ireferto the criticism of the Minister by Mr Justice Aiken at page 78 (b) of that judgment, where he dealt with an affidavit of the Minister in which the Ministerreferredto meetings of the Australian Loan Council. His Honour said: diseases such as 'Thedeponent . . .', The Minister- 'does not state that he has himself perused the particular He does not specificaUy state that the minutes record either in fuU or in summary form die discussions which took place at those meetings or whether they record merely the decisions arrived at.' to answer this question is His Honour went on to say that he found the affidavit completely unsatisfactory. I therefore ask: Why was the claim of Crown privUege made in such an unsatisfactory form? Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The affidavit that I swore on 11 November 1976 in the proceedings known as the Sankey Case claiming that certain Loan Council documents should be withheld from production to the Court of Petty Sessions at Queanbeyan set out at some length the material upon which I based that claim and which counsel considered sufficient to enable the claim to be properly put before the Court. As the documents subpoenaed were the documents of a previous Government, the Government took the view that they should not be perused by Ministers. This view was reflected in my affidavit and in other affidavitsfiledin the proceedings. The Justices of the High Court themselves examined the Loan Council documents. In the result the Court ordered that certain small parts of the Loan Council documents should be produced, being thefirstnine lines of paragraph 71 of the minutes of the 104th meeting of the Loan Council and thefirstten lines of paragraph 10 of the minutes of the 105th meeting.

The figures are the latest information available at thistime.Caution should be exercised in the use of these figures as in many respects they are not comparable due to slight differences in age groups between the countries. Furthermore, the information contained in the table is derived from 2 separate sources:firsdythe publication 'Labour Force Statistics', a quarterly supplement to the OECD Yearbook of Labour Force Statistics, 1977, in which the level of youth unemployment for selected OECD countries is presented; and secondly the publication 'The OECD Observer' (issue No. 90/January 1978) where youth unemployment rates for comparable age groups for the year 1976 were published.

275,Mr STALEY,AS A PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION OF,"The Minister for Education has provided the following reply to the honourable extensively member's question: (1) School level-(a ) I know of only a smaU schools run by Aboriginals. The TownsviUe Black Community School and the schools at StreUey and Nookanbah in Western Australia are all controUed by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island groups. In most schools in Aboriginal communides in the Nonhern Territory, which are my direct concern, Aboriginal teaching staff play a very significant part. The teaching programs in these schools are broadly simUar those offered m government schools in the States. Apart these, schooling is now being provided at a number of sotheir called outstations, in the Northern Territoiy and in some the States. (b) and (c) The veiy large majority of Aboriginal students in primary and secondary schools throughout Australia follow programs which are designed to cater for aU pupils enrolled. The emphasis which can be given to the special needs of Aboriginal students varies from school to school. Where Aboriginal students comprise a significant pan of the school Aborigmal Education populadon, it is more common for them to have specially (QuestionNo. 1756) planned teaching programs, and for students to be able to receive additional instruction in pracdcal skills of the type Usted. In all schools, emphasis is placed on the need for Aboriginal students to become as proficient as possible in the basic skills of Uteracy and numeracy as a necessary prerequisite for work and further study. In Western Australia a number of project classes are operating at the upper primary and lower secondary levels. These classes aim to improve the pracdcal skUls of those students who have difficulty in succeeding with a more academicaUy inclined curriculum. In the Nonhern Territoiy, schools at the larger Aboriginal communities have postprimary facUities where classes are conducted in a range of manual arts. Since 1970 the movement tore-occupytraditional lands has intensified and Government support has now aided large numbers of Aboriginals to establish independent settlements known as outstations. My Department has responded to the movement by making provision for educational services at these centres. In many instances the teaching is carried out by Aboriginal teacher assistants who have the benefit ofperiodic visits by more experienced staff. The location of these outstation schools in traditional settings affords opponunities for pupils to learn traditional knowledge by traditional means. Tune-tabling is flexible to cope with the lifestyles at these centres. In a number of other Northern Territorv schools, timetables have been adjusted to suit the life-styles of Aboriginal people which are of course influenced by seasonal conditions. (d) An important innovation in Aboriginal education in recent years has been the introduction of bilingual programs. The bilingual program in the Northern Territoiy now involves 19 schools in Aboriginal communities. Twelve disdifferent Aboriginal languages are used along with EngUsh in formal programs. In addition a number of schools use the local Aboriginal language in an informal way. At Maningrida, for example, the large number of languages spoken precludes a formal program in any one of them, but it is possible for some of the older chUdren to be introduced to Uteracy in their own language. Bilingual programs with characteristics sinular to those operating in the Nonhern Territory are now also operating in several Aboriginal communities in the States inducing the following: Kowanyama, Aurukun (Qld.), Ernabella, Fregon, Amata and indulkana (SA) and Warbunon (WA). As in the Northern Territory, the local language is used in outstation education wherever this development occurs. Use of the local language on a less structured basis occurs in other communities particularly Yalata (SA), number of Yandeyarra, Oombulgurri and StreUey (WA). (e) The Government has actively encouraged the appointment of Aboriginals as teachers and teacher assistants in the Northern Territoiy. Twelve Aboriginals have now quaUfied forrecognitionas permanent teachers by the Commonwealth Teaching Service. A further nineteen have completed to two yearsttainingto qualify for appointment of temporary from teachers, and another group of 57 have completed part of teacher training course. While the numbers are still not of large, theyrepresenta growing and significant involvement of the Aborigmal people in their education. The Roper River school is staffed by Aboriginals, including the first Aboriginal principal in the Northern Tenitory. In addition, some 300 teacher assistants are employed in Northern Territory schools. There are also some 400 Aboriginals employed in teaching positions in the States. Some SO of these are qualified teachers; theremainderhold positions as teacher assistants. Post-school level-It is not possible to provide a complete listing of courses available in the practical skills outlined the question. All technical colleges offer courses at a of levels, and numbers of Aboriginal students are enrolled. The Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme administered by my Department under which a wide range orientationofcourse of special courses are arranged for Aboriginals who are no for new teachers atrelevant longer in a formal schooling situation. Many Aboriginal tiveness of these the award holders undenake courses designed to improve their practical skills and employment prospects (2) and (3) In 1977, a total took courses with assistance Grants Scheme. The large majority enrolled for courses recdy related to practical and vocational skills. Of the 2,451 students, 1,067 were accommodated in courses specially arprovision. ranged with the needs of Aboriginals in mind. The Aboriginal employment and is one which isreceivingpriority attention from the Government In the teachingfield,as outlined above, there are substantial programs which are providing employment opponunities for large numbers of Aboriginals. As part of an evaluation of the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme, my Depanment is currendy seeking information from students on the extent to which assisted programs of study have been useful in helping them secure related employment The results of the evaluation should help in assessing the types ofcourses which should be encouraged. (4) (a) Seven colleges of advanced education (Armidaie, Canberra, Mt Gravatt, Mt Lawley, Newcasde, Townsville and Torrens) offer Aboriginal education studies in teacher traimng courses including studies at the graduate level. Mt Lawley CAE offers a Graduate Diploma in Aboriginal Studies for external students. For Commonwealth Teaching Service Scholarship holders in their pre-service training, specialised Aborigmal education subjects are provided by several colleges cf advanced education. These scholarship holders also have the opponunity to undenake a six weeks practice teaching period m Nonhern Territory schools during their course of study. In addition, in-service courses are conducted each year for teachers in Northern Territory Aboriginal schools. The Queensland Depanment ofEducation provides opportunities for teachers to take the Graduate Diploma in Aboriginal Studies at Townsville CAE. (b) I have referred in my answer to 1 (e) above to the efforts made by the Government to encourage the employQuestion ment of Aboriginals in teaching positions. continued effort being made to increase the numbers of qualified Aboriginal teachers, there were in 1977 116 Aboriginal students enrolled in teacher training courses, supported under the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme. Since 1973,39 Aboriginals have quaUfied as teachers with Scheme assistance, including four at the graduate level. Teacher training programs for Aboriginals ern Territory are conducted by my Depanment and the Darwin Community CoUege. As mentioned in myreplyto 1 (e), growing numbers of Aboriginals are qualifying as teachers. (5) No. Bilingual programs have been introduced to aU Southern Region Aborigmal communities which satisfy cermanufactured tain criteria, one of which is a request that such a program be commenced. Currendy five Government schools conduct a bilingual program in the southernregionand it is hoped to expand the program to Santa Teresa school in the near future. (6) No teacher has been appointed specifically to teach in fringe camps at AUce Springs. I am not aware of a specific request for such a teacher. However, a teacher at Traeger Park Primary School does take one class for fringe camp children.

Statistics forrefugeeand quasi-refugee groups admitted for thefinancialyears, 1975-76, 1976-77 and 1977-78 are as foUows: 1975-76Soviet Jews Eastern Europeans Cypriots Lebanese Indochinese East Timorese 2,580 White Russians ex China 30 Cluieans 360 (Question No. 1955) Total 8,830 1976-77SovietJews 430 Eastern Europeans 380 Cypriots 2,350 Lebanese 12,200 Indo-Chinese 1,700 White Russians ex China 60 Cluieans 40 Total 17,160 1977-78White Russians 50 Eastern Europeans 210 Soviet Jews 560 Indo-Chinese 7,117 Lebanese 1,200 South Americans 40 Cypriots 100 Timorese 220 Total 9,497 (QuestionNo. 2071) (3) Government statisticsrelatingto personsregisteredas unemployed do not distinguish those persons who entered Australia as refugees. 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T Weedicides (QuestionNo. 2164) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1978: (1) Is he able to say whether the weedicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been tested by United States authoriues under Refugees the Pesticides Act or the Toxic Substances Control Act or by British authorities including the Health and Safety (Question No. 2158) Executive. If so, do the tests include mutagenicity tests on plants and bacteria including S. typhimurium, the Ames test and invitro tests. (3) What vaUdity andreUabUityhave been attributed to these tests by die National Health and Medical Research and (ii) 1977, and (b) durCouncU. (4) What are the probabUities of mutagenicity in humans directly exposed to aerial spraying of these substances.",138
281,Mr HUNT,AS A PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The United States Environmental Protection Agency is reported to have commissioned tests on 2,4-D but to date theresultsare not avaUable. The EPA has examined data on 2,4,5-T and this is noted in the United States Federal Register of 21 AprU 1978. The United Kingdom authorities than report that they have no testresultslater than 1972. (2) The nature of the United States tests on 2,4-D is not yet avaUable. On 2,4,5-T the EPA noted tests on DrosophUa melanogaster, SalmoneUa typhimurium, in vitro cytogenetic studies on human lympocytes, work on invivo bone-marrow cells of Mongolian gerbUs and an invivo study on the cyto330 genetic effects on bone-marrow ceUs of Mus musculus. The 220 tests in the United Kingdom are described as invitro tests 2,360 1,450 1,500 made before the more sensitive 'activated' tests became available. (3) The National Health and Medical Research Council has not made any statement on the validity and reliability of these tests. (4) Direct exposure of humans should be kept to a minimum whatever the mode of application. There is no evidence of mutagenicity occurring in humans from the use of these chemicals applied by aerial spraying. Rural Industry Subsidies Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 26 September 1978: (1) What was the total amount of subsidies paid to rural industries in 1977-78 and what sum has been allocated for 1978-79. (2) What are the details of the various subsidies paid during 1977-78 and to be paid during 1978-79. (3) What were the amounts paid in 1977-78 apportioned between the States.",138

283,Mr HAYDEN,DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO THE RURAL SECTOR,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 September 1978: (1) How many computers are (a) owned, (b) operated, (c) in the process of being purchased or (d)rentedby his Department and Statutory Authorities and business undertakings under his control. (2) What is the cost of purchase or rental of each computer. (3) For what purposes is each computer used. (4) What is the nature of the data stored by each computer. (5) What interconnections exist or will exist between any of these computers. (6) Who has access to each computer. (7) What savings in staff numbers have been achieved or are anticipated as a result of the installation or operation of 1977-78 1978-79 each computer. Actual Estimates Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 9.4 Department ofDefence 2.4 28.7* 1. (a)90;(b)92;(c)34;(d)2. 9.4 2. Cost of purchase or rental of each computer, see Table 16.1 A 0.7 0.2 3. Purpose for which each computer used, see Table A. 93.8 4. Nature of Data Stored by each computer, see Table A. 1.8(CR)t 3. Interconnections between computers, see Table A. 6. Access to the computers listed is limited to authorized 1S8.9 employees of the Department of Defence and to authorized employees of other Departments and organizations when engaged in approved work associated with activities of the Department ofDefence. 7. Many computers have been introduced to gain benefits 0.6 unrelated to staff savings. They enable highly sophisticated 48.7 analytical and computational work in support ofadvanced S0.0 research and development, provide technological data not S.2 obtainable by manual means, allow uaining in computer technology, offer advanced message switching techniques, 10.S and increased productivity. Accurate details of staff savings, achieved through introduction of computers in the labour intensive areas engaged in the administradve type funcuons are not available. Such an assessment of the manpower equivalents ofeach machine would be a cosdy, long-term exercise offering inconclusive results. The problem arises from the fact that computerization in the Department ofDefence commenced in the early 1960's. No recent basis exists on which to estimate the pracdcal staff level which would be required to perform the now much expanded management facilities and monitoring functions available from the machines, but undoubtedly these would be thousands. A limited exercise undertaken the staff savings from the use of the Central UNIVAC and Honeywell installations in Canberra indicated that some 1200 staff positions had been the Department These people had formerly provided the Armed Porces Pay, Personnel and Supply funcuons. Whilst no staff have been retrenched through the introduction of these computers, they have enabled a limitation of the staff growth which would otherwise have flowed from the increasing complexity of adnunistration of the Armed Forces. Introduction of computer systems in which estimated staff savings were specifically identified were: (a) The Computerized Engineering Logistics Planning system-1 1 professional and semi-professional omcers.

303,Mr SINCLAIR,TABLE A,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Standing Committee on Agriculture has resolved that implementation of the recommendations ment for Milk Committee is a matter for each State to act upon. In some States, legislauve amendments will be required to enable payment for milk for manufacture to be made on a basis other than fat content In other States, for example New South Wales, and Tasmania, legislation already provides that payment for milk for manufacture may be made on the basis of fat and protein content In these two States, however, very few factories have so far elected to make payment for manufacturing milk on a fat/protein basis. In respect of milk for manufacture, the recommendations of the Basis of Payments for Milk Committee were: (i) that the price paid for milk for manufacturing purposes should be based on the mass of fat and the mass of protein contained in the milk; and (ii) that no provisions be made in the payment formula for inclusion of a costs; however, the farmer should be charged on a volume basis for the cost of transport ofhis nulk.

Presumably wool sold by the Corporation to other customers reaches Pringle in the form of tops or yarn. (2) Pringle do not have an anangement to purchase supplies from the Corporation in 1978. (3) The difference in price between lambswool and cashmere has widened significantly due to the shonage of cashmere. This is being reflected in increasing prices for best lambswool. Therecentrelatively high prices have resulted in only limited quantities of lambswool entering the Wool Corporation's stockpile and these have been sold in Australia to Australian-basedfirmsat ruling market rates. The ultimate destination of this wool is not known. Milk Payment Dairy Factories: Code of Practice (Question No. 2759) (Question Na 2765) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 14 November 1978: (1) What progress has been made with the uniform application of the Code of Practice for Dairy Factories in Australia.

Dairy factoiy premises are, at intervals, inspected by State officers either alone or in company with officers of my Department During these inspections, establishments are checked for compliance with Code provisions. Almost all Australian dairy factories had been inspected under the Code at least once by October 1978. Those not so far inspected include a number of very small establishments and new premises built to Code specifications. Progress in implementing the hygiene, plant and equipment provisions of the Code has been most satisfactory. Progress towards implementation of Code provisions covering buildings and structures has been somewhat slower, since full compliance may entail significant modification of existing premises. volume factor based on processing (2) It is not feasible to make comparison between States, as to the degree of advancement of implementation of the Code in each. Pringle of Scotland Progress on inspection can only be used as a pointer to (Question No. 2760) g rogress on implementation and this varies from State to tate. For example, in Tasmania, all second round inspections have been completed and some third round inspections commenced. In Victoria approximately 80 per cent of second round inspections and over SO per cent of third round inspections have been undertaken. Inspection rounds in other States are not as far advanced.

(3) Does the policy of allowing private overseas students to acquire resident status contradict the guidelines their eligibility for admission which require that they enter Australia on a temporary basis for study purposes only and completion of their approved course of study or if they abandon their studies. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the Honourable Member's question is a follows: (1) The numbers of private overseas students granted a change of status, mainly to resident, in the past S years are follows: 1977-78 1976-77 1975-76 1974-75 1973-74 (2) The applicants would have been admitted to Australia under the Government's private overseas student policy.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters has determined five levels of competence at which accreditation will be conferred. These range from the incidental use of a second language to aid simple communication (Level 1) to the high degree of proficiency required for work as a simultaneous interpreter or technical translator in an international context (Level 5). 8,000 copies of the Authority's statement on levels are being printed in booklet form and should be avaUable shonly for distribution. As soon as printing is completed, a copy of the booklet will be forwarded to the honourable member. Motor Vehicle Plan Mr Hurford asked the Prime Minister the following question, without notice, on 19 October 1978. The Prime Minister replied that he would treat the question as though it were on notice and ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give a full reply: My question should be directed to the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, but in his absence I ask the Prime Minister Is it a fact that the 30 per cent devaluation of the New South Wales Australian doUar inrelationto the Yen has meant a higher (Question No. 2947) Australian contentrequirementunder the motor vehicle plans than was the intention when the plans were Is it a fact that the adjustments announced by the Minister yesterday do not offset completely the effects of the 30 per cent devaluation and have left Chrysler Australia Limited and possibly other motor vehicle manufacturing companies paying large penalties for factors over which they had no control? It is also a fact that these large penalties may result in a further disastrous loss of employment? Is it true that General Motors-Holden's Ltd and Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd can now reduce their local content from over 90 per cent to 85 per cent, thus creating more unemployment? Without wishing in any way to support or criticise the changes made yesterday but seeking information, I ask the Prime Minister why the Government has not allowed a full adjustment for the 30 per cent devaluation and why he has allowed the abolition of reversion control procedures? Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: The effect of appreciation of the Yen against the Australian dollar has caused difficulties for some companies in meeting their local content hicle Plan, but it has not caused difficulties for others. Thus it is not a fact that the Yen appreciation has generally caused a higher Australian contentrequirementas calculated under the Plan rules than when the Plan was formulated. Whilst appreciation of the Yen has caused componentry sourced from Japan to be less economic than at the time the Plan was formulated, conversely it has improved the competitiveness Of componentry sourced from Australia compared to imports from Japan. For some producers this will mean physically incorporating into their vehicles more local components than they had originally envisaged. However, the Motor Vehicle Plan content requirements are not based on meeting specific requirements as to the actual componentry incorporated in vehicles. Content is calculated on a value basis with the decision as to which componentry to source locally being a matter for commercial decision making. It should be noted that if there were to be a devaluation against the dollar in the currency of a countiy supplying components to an Australian car manufacturer, then that manufacturer would be able to reduce his local component sourcing and still meet the local content levels prescribed in the Plan. The adjustments announced by the Government on 18 October 1978 recognise the difficulties brought about for certain companies by the rapid appreciation of the Yen and the fact that resourcing of components cannot be achieved quickly because of the necessaiy lead times involved. The Government's action was in conformity with the Plan's provisions that circumstances beyond a company's control which have caused or contributed to its failure to comply with the Plan may be taken into account in considering whether or not penalties should be applied. Passenger motor vehicle manufacturers who were by major foreign currency appreciations wili be allowed adjust their local content calculation for the purpose cation of penalty duties under month lag in the application of exchange rates. The adjustment will have effect from 1 July 1978 expire on 31 December 1979 when all Plan manufacturers NA Farming enterprises Sheep Sheep-Beef Beef Dairy will be required to be at 85 per cent company average local content on the basis of exchange rates applicable at that time. This action is not intended to eliminate the need for penalty payment by these companies for failing to meet their local content commitments. Any penalty liability which companies may incur for failing to meet their commitments for reasons other than the Yen appreciation will not be affected. There is no basis in speculation in the media and elsewhere that employment in the industry will be affected by any penalties for which motor vehicle manufacturers may be liable. The Government decided to abolish the reversion control because it has now served its intended purpose. This was to provide a means of avoiding major disruption in the component sector during the phasing period of the present Plan while the local content levels in certain vehicles entered in former plans was being reduced. obligations under the Motor VeThe average local content levels of General MotorsHolden's Ltd and the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd have already been significandyreducedtowards 85 per cent and the opportunities for reversion to overseas sources of componentry have thus become veiy much limited. At the same time the component industry has been receiving substanual additional business from the new manufacturers as they increase the local content of their vehicles in accordance with their commitments under the Plan. Reversion control was never intended to be a permanent feature of the Motor Vehicle Plan. This was clearly indicated by the Government when the motor vehicle policy was announced in the Parliament on 30 March 1976 and again in a further statement by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce on 9 June 1976. To introducereversioncontrol as an integral part of the Motor Vehicle Plan would constitute a major change to the Plan; and major investment decisions have been made in the confident expectation that the rules will not be changed. The basic thrust of the Government's motor vehicle policy is to facilitate the development of a more viable and competitive industry byreducingGovernment intervention in commercial decision making and giving the vehicle builders moreflexibilityin making their own component sourcing arrangements within the overall 85 per cent company average local content requirement.

I ask the Prime Minister Has the Equal Government an attitude on barter anangements between China and an Australian exportingfirmsuch as those that have existed with a number of British exporters for whom marketingrightsin Great Britain were reserved exclusively for by China following the use of the original British technology? The following is in answer to the honourable member's question: China is, ofcourse, anxious to obtain a wide range of em technology and is adopting aflexibleattitude to the means by which it achieves that objective. This includes rangements where all or part payment for technology is made in goods resulting from the use of the parueular nology. The Chinesereferto these as 'buy back' rather barter deals. Australian suppliers of technology are free to enter into Compound commercial agreements of this rangements inrespectof Australia or other overseas markets are simply a matter for negotiation between the parties.

As with any commercial trading arrangement involving the import of products made overseas by or on behalf of Australianfirmthe Government cannot give any assurance with of continued access to the Australian market The import such reguladons, tariffs etc applicable to these products do vary amply because there is some Australian involvement or content in their production abroad.

The compound was however The temporarily withdrawn from use by Shell locally between of August 1974 and Februaiy 1975 because of a possible fire hazard, suggested by the US Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Adrninistration, involving Aero an Shell Compound 07 or similar products coming into contact silver or gold plated surfaces carrying an electric current as electric motor slip rings and gold plated connectors in not some avionics equipment The risk was found to be negligible so the product was reinstated by Shell and the airlines. (3) Aero Shell Compound 07 is a de-icingfluidcomposed of ethylene glycol, isopropylalcohol and distilled water. It in conforms to a British Government Specification DTD406B. It is used for in-flight de-icing of windscreens, propellers, tailplanes, et cetera, on suitably equipped aircraft in a manner similar to motor car windscreen washers.

However, the Australian coasting trade is reserved under the Navigation Act 1912 to Australian licensed vessels. This effectively reserves the coastal shipping industry to Australian-registered and manned vessels. In addition, the Government's shipbudding assistance arrangements enable overseas shipowners to import ships into Ausualia for temporary periods only when suitable Australian tonnage is not available, and on a permanent basis only after it has been demonstrated by calling tenders in Australia and overseas that the overseas tender price is less than the Australian tender price after bounty.

380,Mr STALEY,COMPARATIVE EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH BY SEX,"The Minister for Education has ive provided the following answer to the honourable and member's question: (1) It is not possible to state what the current rate of illiteracy is for Australia. The coUection of statistics on Uteracy made difncult by the problem of the definition of'illiterate'. It is not feasible to apply a single measure of Uteracy to a total populadon as this impUes of functional need. I refer the honourable member reply to Senator Lajovic's Question Without eracy in the Senate on 14 September 1978, in which I refened to the research in this area carried out in the Sydney MetropoUtan area in 1977 by Dr Judith Goyen of Macquarie University. Dr Goyen pointed out that the estabUshment of cut-off point to separate iUiterates from literates is quite trary, and determined by theresearcher.Her that in the Sydney metropoUtan area, 3.7 per cent of adults born in Australia and other English speaking countries, and 43.3 per cent of those born in non-English speaking countries were functionally illiterate. WhUe this and other research studies do not provide a complete answer as to the numbers involved, it is clear that the problem of Uliteracy is a real one for some Australians and, in particular, for Aboriginals and migrants from English speaking countries. (2) In thereplyto Senator Lajovic Ireferredto the repon of the House of Respresentatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties, and the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants, as aresultof which a number of initiatives in research and development are being undertaken. The National Inquiry into Teacher Education estabUshed in June this year is charged with the responsibUity for examining the effectiveness of techniques of early detection, diagnosis and remediation of learning difficulties. In response to the repon Specific Learning Difficulties, which itself was unable to termine the precise number of ilUterate adults and chUdren in Australia, the Australian Council for Educational Relength search was funded by the Government through the Eduyear cation Research and Development Committee to conduct a national study of Uteracy and numeracy among 10 and 14 year-olds. In general, the study found no cause for placency or for immediate alarm and suggested that stanAlgeria, dards of Uteracy in these age groups are comparable to the standards in other English-speaking countries. Programs for teaching Uhterate adults are conducted and/or supported by a number of Commonwealth ments and by the Technical and Funher Education Council. These departments and the Council arerepresentedon an Interdepartmental Working Party on Adult Literacy Numeracy convened by my Department The Working Steel Party's brief is to examine the provision by the Commonwealth with a view to recommending ways improving coordination and consultation. The Working Party is expected to report in January 1979.

399,Mr VINER,COMPARATIVE EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH BY SEX,"The Attorney-General has supAviation Policy plied the following answer to the honourable (Question No. 2880) member's question: (1) and (2) The report of the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission is, I am informed, not yet generally available. My Department has, however, made arrangements for a copy of the report to be obtained as soon as possA study can then be made of the State's approach and an assessment of the Government's role facilitated. (3) I am advised that two instances of computer-related crime have been investigated by the Commonwealth Police Force. Both cases involved the insertion of false particulars into a computer program. In one case unemployment benefit cheques, amounting to $4,794.60, were paid to four persons who were not entitled to them. In the other case a series of Computer Crime cheques, amounting to approximately $130,000, in false (Question No. 2383) names were paid out of the Special Re-adjustment Scheme. In both cases the offenders were convicted and sentenced. Criminal law in Australia is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments, but the Commonwealth has long been concerned in the national aspects the subject and has contributed substantially to a number of major initiatives. One such measure was the establishment of the Australian Institute of Criminology, which facilitates conthe co-operation and the exchange of information between Commonwealth and the States and provides machinery whereby problems and trends in the criminal law, including those related to computer crime, can be studied and discussed. In addition, my Department keeps an overview of developments concerning crime. I am also informed the Commonwealth Police Force has for some time been conducting regular courses on commercial crime. Officers of State and Territory Forces participate in those courses. Further officers of the Auditor-General's Department receive uaining with respect to modem concepts of computer control. It is, I understand, proposed to extend that uaining to internal auditors in relevant Departments.

(2) What plans does the Government have for dealing with this problem. (3) Is the use of antibiotics as animal feed additives a contributing factor. (4) If so, will he discuss their use with the Minister for Primary Industry. Medibank Computer Mr HUNT - The answer to the honourable (Question No. 1719) member's question is as follows: (1) The emergence of organisms resistant to different antigiven rise to general concern and has been the of intense study. Expert bodies in several countries have been convened by authorities, including the World Health Organization to advise on this matter. Educational means, restrictions on prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and stricter control of antibiotic use within hospitals have been employed in Australia. The National Health and Medical Research Council keeps this matter under continuing review. Two specialist groups have been by Council to advise on the use of antibiotics with particular reference to their use in animal husbandry. The recent statement by Council was made at its 83rd Session in April 1977. Council was of the opinion that the use of therapeutic antibiotics as growth promotants in animal feedstuffs could lead to an impairment of their efficacy in the treatment of human disease. This is of concern. The action it is expected will be taken by the States and Territories is that Laser Fusion Facility the recommendations of the Council will be incorporated (Question No. 1931) into their legislation. The recommendations were that several antibiotics, including penicillins, tettacyclines, sulphonamides and chloramphenicol should be prohibited use as growth promotants in animal husbandry in Australia. The necessaiy amendments have already been made to the Uniform Poisons Standard of the National Health and Medical Research Council to give effect to these recommendations. I have arranged for a copy of the extract from the repoit of the 83rd Session of Council to be placed in the mother unit die Parliamentary Library. (2) These matters are being pursued with the Department of Primary Industry, and with State and Tenitory Depanments of Agriculture. (3) There is a consenus that the use of antibiotics in animal feed additives is a contributing factor; this is attested to by the recommendations of the Swann Committee which studied the matter in the United Kingdom, the working group convened by the World Health Organization in 1973, and a Working Pany convened by the National Health and Medical Research Council to study antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. (4) A close liaison is already being maintained with the Depanment of Primaiy Industry. A senior officer of that Depanment was a member of the N.H. and M.R.C. Working Parry. The recommendations of Council have been brought to the notice of the Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs which is convened by the Department of Primary Industry and on which the N.H. and M.R.C. is represented.

403,Mr HUNT,COMPARATIVE EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH BY SEX,"The answer to the honourable quaUfications member's quesuon is as foUows: (a) The latest year for which complete information is avaUable as to the cost of a visit is 1976-77. The average across the States for that year was $4.24. The cost by State was: New South Wales Victoria Queensland SouthAustraUa Western Australia Tasmania Preliminary, but incompletefiguresfor 1977-78 indicate an average Australia-wide cost per visit of approximately $5.00. (b) and (c) Under the Community Health Program block grant arrangements, the detaUed adrninistration of approved projects is vested in the respective State health authorities. The following information concerning New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania is therefore based on advice received from the health authorities in those States. Inrelationto Queensland and Western Australia, the statistics coUected by the State health authorities do not enable the cost of home visits by community health nurses or domicUiary nurses to be calculated. It should be noted that the duties of community health nurses are generaUy divided between the provision of services in the home and the provision of services at the centre in which the nurses are based. The foUowingfiguresthereforerepresentestimates arrived at after aUocations of costs between services in the home and services in the centres. New South Wales (costing period 1 June 1978-3 0 June 1978)-No distinction is made between community health nurses and domiciliary nurses funded under the Community Health Program.

Mr MACKeUar-The answer to the honourof a visit by able member's question is as foUows: For statistical purposes, persons in the occupationaUy eUgible category include spouses and chUdren as well as the principal appUcant. The selection at overseas posts is on the basis of the principal applicant's possession of skills or which are bothrecognisedand in continuing demand in Australia. Once eUgibUity on occupational grounds has been estabUshed and aU the other criteria for immigration met, these applicants and their families are apcost proved for immigration and issued visas on which the appropriate ehgibUity category code is entered.

This visa code information on these cards is the basis 3.06 of statistical compUation of detaUs on settler arrivals. In a 4.6S smaU proportion of cases, the transcribed data is incorrect or 3.79 incomplete. These with other sources of clerical errors, 3.03 meant that no occupational information was available on 419 worker arrivals m 1977-78 in the occupationaUy eUgible category out of the total of 12,482 mentioned in my earUer answer. A further 95 workers were coded as 'not previously employed' and for whom, therefore, no specific occupational classification could be given.

408,Mr VINER,COMPARATIVE EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH BY SEX,"The answer to the honourable to member's question is as follows: It is for Permanent Heads of Departments, responsibilities for the emcient ments, to ensure that all staff are aware of the need to use telephones effectively and economically in the course of duties. In 1970 a model set of adrninistrative instructions on use of telephones was issued for the guidance of Permanent Heads. The general practice is that departmental directories contain instructions ance by all staff. Action has also been taken to ensure strict control of the use of STD calls, including the barring of STD access to the extent consistent with departmental cal and economical. I am advised by the Public are no specific guidelinesrelatingto the logging of telephone calls by public servants in the course of their public duties, most departments have their switchboard telephonists trunk calls which they connect for staff, both via STD and those booked through the Telecom Truck Line operator. The latter calls are also listed accounts. There is no requirement to keeprecordsof local calls beyond that appropnate to the relevant action file. The telephone system is a major aid to efficiency service administration as it enables officers and others to communicate effectively. Officers are encouraged to use telephone where it helps in the speedy NA NA Department/Authority Attorney-General'sIndustries Assistance Commission of official business.

The Oder-Neisse Line Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 15 November 1978: (1) Where is the Oder-Neisse line, what is its historic significance and what is its strategic importance to Australia? (2) When were the last significant consultations between European Governments about the Oder-Neisse line? (3) Have any senior Australian ofncials, in consultation with European Governments during 1978, indicated that the Oder-Neisse line has strategic importance to Australia? (4) lf so, did the omciai or officials actually intend to the boundary between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic?  gentleman's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Oder-Neisse line constitutes the recognised boundary between the Polish Peoples Republic and Government the German Democratic Republic (GDR). It foUows the consultation course of the Oder River from its mouth on the Baltic Coast or to the confluence of the Neisse River and then along the Neisse River to the frontier of the Czechoslovak Socialist pubUc (CSSR). The Polish/GDR Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed on 6 June 1950 accordedformalrecogditional nition of the Polish/GDR frontier along the Oder-Neisse Line. The Oder-Neisse Line has it origins in concluded between the Allies at Yalta and Potsdam in the closing months of the Second World War. These resulted 1948 in the division of Europe into Western Europe and Soviet controUed and dominated states of Eastern Europe. One of the major territorial adjustments effected to Europe was the extension of the USSR boundary into what enhad earlier been PoUsh territory, with Poland being 'comhas pensated' by the shift of its Western boundary into former German territory up to the Thalweg of the Oder and Neisse kept under review as it has rivers. The issues of peace and security in Europe, which have in the questions of recognition and acceptance of Europe's postwar frontiers, have a central importance to glo(Question No. 2105) bal secunty which has beenrecognisedby successive Australian Governments. These issues have also been central to detente process and as such have been the subject of fremultilateral discussion and consultation. The pursuit by the Federal RepubUc of Germany of what was known as the poUcy of OstpoUtik, led to the successful conclusion of treaties by the FRG with the USSR (1970), Poland (1970), State the GDR (1972) and the CSSR (1973). WhUe no formal peace treaty has been concluded, these treaties accorded acceptance of the estabUshed boundaries of the FRG, GDR and Poland (including of course the Oder-Neisse line) and paved the way for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). This conferenceresultedin the signing of the Helsinki Accords by thirty-five heads of in August 1975. The CSCE consultations, the bUateral treaties which preceded them, and the meeting caUed to review the Helsinki arrangements in Belgrade in pro1977 are the mostrecentexamples of high level consulanswer to tations on central European frontier issues. for (3) and (4) The Secretary of the Depanment of Foreign Affairs held discussions with his counterparts in France, the for Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom in 1978 which covered inter alia the poltiical strategic impUcations of central European boundaries, including the Oder-Neisse Une, which were seen as having significance for Australia as well as for Western Europe.

(7) What savings in staff numbers have been achieved or are anticipated as a result of the installauon or operauon each computer. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has (6) provided the following information to the ted to honourable member's question: Department ofScience A. The Bureau of Meteorology owns six computers. These are: (1) (a) 2 x IBM 360/65 computers (b) 2 x General Automation SPC 16/65 minicomputers (c) 1 xGCS 2100 Data Entry minicomputer (d) 1 x Hewlett-Packard 21 MX minicomputer. (2) The cost of these computers was: (a) $4.25m for the dual IBM installation (b) $129,000 for the dual SPC 16/65 communications computer system (c) $65,000 for GCS 2100 Data Entry System (d) $95,0^ for the HP 21MX minicomputer system. (3) (a) The IBM 360 computer systems of the Bureau of Meteorology provide automated support for the Nauonai Meteorological Centre, the Australian logical Research Centre and also for the Melbourne World Meteorological Centre. The computers are used for weather analysis, time' diagnosis of the state of the atmosphere, numerical modelling of the atmosphere, weather prognosis, research and administradve support tasks. (b) Two SPC 16/65 computers are used as 'Line Interface Computers' in front-end mode to the 'real-rime' system provide communications capability for reception of basic weather observation data. They are being developed for dissemination of products to Regional Forecasting Centres. (c) A GCS 2100 computer and disc storage, supporting 16 visual display units with keyboards, system for transcription of high volume weather observation data from basic documents such asfieldbooks for processing shared on the IBM computer. (d) A 'stand-alone' HP 21 MX minicomputer, used to process data received from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite. (4) Most data is processed on This consists of: (a) Meteorological data used for operational forecasting purposes. (b) Climatological data used for statistical and research purposes. (c) Records of technical equipment. (d) Internal position and establishment information. The SPC 16/65 communications minicomputer stores up to 18 hours of meteorological messages at any one time. These messages are transferred to the 'real-time' IBM computer on demand. The GCS 2100 data entry computer stores meteorological data keyed in by data preparation staff. red daily to the IBM computers for processing The Hewlett-Packard 21MX sectorizer mini-computer stores satelhte picture information during processing. (5) The two SPC 16/65 minicomputers are used as frontend computers to the 'real-time' installation. The non 'real-time' computer acts as standby for numbers 41and the 'real-time* computer and computer, the two SPC 16/65 nunicomputers are switched to the standby computer. In addition, certain peripherals in the dual IBM configuraof tion can be switched from one computer to the other. No other interconnections exist or are proposed. Access to the special purpose minicomputers is restricBureau of Meteorology ADP staff and Bureau users of these machines. Access to the 360/65s is limited to: (a) use for processing by staff members for authorised assignments. Approved external organisations may be granted use if work schedule permits and for specific tasks. (b) operation by trained computer operators only under the supervision of a senior computer operator. (7) Although no staff members have been made redundant as aresultof the installation of computers, some staff savings have been made in two ways: (a) the replacement of the obsolete card-punch equipment by the GCS 2100 data entry system has increased the productivity of Data Processing Operators, and their numbers have been allowed to fall through natural wastage. (b) the installation of computers generally has not reduced staff requirements. Numerical MeteoroB. Space Projects The Department is currendy establishing an Australian Landsat Station toreceiveand process data from the United the 'real States Landsat Satellites. (1) Two nunicomputers are in process of being purchased for the Australian Landsat Station. (2) $342,461 for the nunicomputers. Total purchase price to of the associated system software is $632,248. (3) Both nunicomputers will be used for the processing of the data received from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat series of satellites. (4) Photographic images of the Australasianregionare is used as a data entry stored off-line. (5) The two minicomputers will be interconnected by a magnetic disc storage unit (6) Landsat Station staff only. (7) Does not apply. C.

Anglo Australian Telescope Board (1) The Ango-Australian Telescope Board owns 6 computers. (2) The total cost of the 6 computers was $791,791. computer in the dual IBM Number cost $234,215, numbers 2 and 3 $188,415, 5 $346,574 and number 6, $22,588. in the event of a failure in that (3) One computer is used for control of the telescope at Siding Spring. Two computers are used for both instrument control and for the analysis of scientific observations at Siding Spring. Two computers are used for the analysis of scientific observations, software development, and control of a measuring machine at Epping. One computer is used only for instrument control at Siding Spring. (4) Astronomical Observations. (5) Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 6 can be linked together. Numbers 4 and S can also be linked together. (6) Astronomers from Australian and British astronomical research institutions who have been given observing time on the telescope and staff of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO). Also scientists from other research institutions at the discretion of the Director of the AAO. (7) The advanced astronomicalresearchcarried out at the AAO depends on the computers to the extent that it could not be attempted without them. The computers have no effect inreducingstaff numbers. Indeed, a number of staff positions are necessary (electronics and programming) for the efficient use and maintenance of the computers. E. Australian Institute of Marine Science (1) The Australian Institute of Marine Science owns one computer. (2) $150,000. (3) This computer is used for analysis of scientific data relating to the Institute's work. (4) Scientific dataresultingfrom laboratory experiments and field surveys. (5) This computer can be linked with computers at James Cook University and the CSIRO system. (6) Scientific staff of AIMS. (7) The computer is an aid to research at AIMS and has not reduced staff requirements. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (1) In answering this question, computing equipment within CSIRO'sresearchunits which is dedicated to special purposeresearchrequirementshas not been taken into consideration. This equipment, which includes numerous small computers, is used as research tools for control of equipment, data logging, data processing and low level computing with CSIRO's Divisions and Units. CSIRO's main computing facUities are provided by the computing network known as CSIRONET which can be described for the purposes of this question as one computer system. Table A lists CSIRONET equipment which is owned, leased or in the process of being purchased by CSIRO. (2) The total approximate cost of CSIRO-owned equipment used by CSIRONET is $8,509,000, lease charges amount to $574,215 per annum and additional equipment is in the process of being purchased at an estimated cost of $350,000. (3) CSIRONET provides scientific computing services for CSIRO, Commonwealth and State Government Departments and InstrumentaUties, Universities and other approved users. The computer is also used for CSIRO administrative processing. (4) Scientific and technical data and CSIRO personnel and accounting data. (5) AU CSIRONET computer processing is carried out on the host processor which is Computing Research, Canberra. Nodes and terminals in the various Australian States and Territories are linked by Telecom Unes to the Canberra faciUties. (6) Apart from CSIRO authorised users are listed in Table B. (7 ) The avaUabUity of sophisticated computing equipment means that the scientist can tackle problems which would otherwise have been impossible. Scientific and technical computing facUities are not directed towards obtaining savings in staff numbers, but providing facUities to undertake research problems which could not be contemplated without the use of computers. CSIRONET is also used for adrninistrativerequirements.However, in this area it has not been possible to quantify precisely what are the savings in staff numbers as aresultofthe computerised operations which the Organisation has been introducing progressively over several years. Within the administration there are general indications of savings as staff numbers engaged on salaries and accounts processing have not increased with the increase in general work load and there is less over-time being worked now than in the past.
