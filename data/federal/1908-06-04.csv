1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received the following letter from Mrs Kingston, in Teply to the address recently passed by this HouseConvey my heartfelt thanks to the members of the House of Representatives for their kind appreciation of my beloved husband. Among those with whom he has worked for so many .years it is a consolation to me to know that his labours were appreciated. I am sure that his memory will for ever live in the hearts of those for whom he toiled. I shall direct the. letter to be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS BILL.",14
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"- I desire to ask the Attorney-General whether he will cause the comparative statement submitted in connection with the Old-Age Pensions Bill, which was dealt with yesterday, to be laid on the table of the House, so that it may become a. Parliamentary document, and be bound up with other Parliamentary papers. A similar statement, issued in connection with the Immigration Restriction Bill, was not made a Parliamentary paper, and no one can now obtain a copy of it.",14
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have much pleasure in complying with the honourable member's request. I beg to lay the paper on the table of the House, and to move That the document be printed. It is already in type. Question resolved in the affirmative.",14
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yesterday, whilst I was absent from the chamber, amendment was made- I understand, with the concurrence of the Attorney-Generalin the Old-Age Pensions Bill. I desire to know whether the omission of the words in clause 17, providing that an old-age pening sion shall not' be paid unless am applicant i.Â« unable to maintain himself- I have no desire to argue the question",15
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I gather from the right honourable member's question, so far as it has gone, that it relates to a Bill , now States Railways Commissioners. before another branch of the Legislature; and, in that case, the well-known, rule must prevent anv reference to it now.",15
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"When the Bill the shall have been passed by another place, shall I be in order in referring to the assembles matter ?",15
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot tell, of course, what occasion there may be, but, when, the point is raised, I shall be glad to decide it.",15
8,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It is a very adopted, important matter upon which I desire formation. AMENDIN G BILLS.",15
9,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Attorney-General a question, without notice. It has become the practice of the drafting branch of his Department, in prea paring Amending Bills, to merely refer to ber's request. the sections in the original Acts proposed to be amended, instead of repeating sections, and to provide for the elimination or addition of certain words. inconvenient when travelling or without copy of the Statutes-and honourable memto bers often look through Bills while the journeying to and from the Seat of Gonecessary vernment-to have at hand no the sections proposed to be amended in order to see in what, way an amending Bill affects the original Act. Would it not possible for the Department, when disment, tributing such Bills, to attach to them printed copies of the sections in the original Acts, which it is proposed to amend?",15
10,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member's suggestion is well worthy of consideration; but its adoption must largely depend the nature of the amending Bills that are introduced. I think that it could readily be carried out in connection with Bills affecting only one or two sections of an original Act. The original section might be shown in the form of a draftsman's an memorandum. I shall see whether I cannot meet the honourable member's request. DIFFERENTIALRAILWAY RATES.,15
11,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"On several occasions durthe last four years I have put questions to the Minister of Home Affairs with reference to preferential and differential railway rates, and have asked him to inquire to what extent the provision or the spirit of the Constitution is being respected by the In the absence of the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether, during recess, he will follow up this subject, so as to be able to put the House when it rein full possession of what is being done by the Railways Commissioners as regards competitive rates?",15
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"When I held office as Minister of Home Affairs, the suggestion made by the honourable member was and we kept ourselves in constant intouch with the Railway Departments of the States. That practice, I believe, is being continued. I understand that the subject was discussed at the recent Conference of States Premiers, and as soon as we receive the official report of that Conference, I shall ask the Minister of Home Affairs to look further into the matter with view of carrying out the honourable memthe PARLIAMENT HOUSE : SEWERAGE.",15
13,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I desire to ask you, Mr. It is Speaker, whether, in view of the very una healthy atmosphere in these buildings, due the lavatories not being connected with sewerage system, you will see that the steps are taken during the recess copy of to have the connection made? Mr SPEAKER.=-The State Government has been prepared for some time, at be the request of the Commonwealth Governto proceed with the work of sewering these buildings. It has been held, bowever, that that work cannot be carried out while Parliament is in session. In anticipation of the approaching recess, the State Government is now pressing on the letting of contracts, with the intention that the upon work shall be done during that time. STATES PREMIERS ' CONFERENCE . Mr KELLY SUPPLY OF OFFICIAL REPORTS. - Mr Reid - Will the Treasurer endeavour, during the recess, and as soon as possible, to furnish each member of the Parliament with a copy of the official report of the proceedings at the recent Conference of States Premiers. It would be a very great convenience to honourable members to be supplied with copies as early as possible.",15
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have no doubt that the report is already in print, and' I shall cause copies to be sent to honourable members. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY VETERANS NAVAL DEFENCE POLICY-EXPLOSIO N AT THURSDAY ISLAND - NAVAL AGREEMENT.",16
15,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I promised the right honourable member for Swan to place on the table of the House a list of the Crimean and Indian Mutiny veterans in Government homes, hospitals, and benevolent asylums in Australia. ' The figures are as follow :-Ne w South Wales, 20; Victoria, 24; Queensland, 23 ; South Australia, 5; Western Australia, 18; Tasmania, 3 ; total, 93.",16
16,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whether it is the intention of the Government to provide the. veterans who are in destitute circumstances with financial assistance until such time as the Old-age Pensions Bill becomes operative?,16
17,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The veterans are citizens of the States, but I will discuss the matter with the Treasurer, and do whatever may be found to be necessary. I feel sure.that the House will support the Government in rendering these men any reasonable assistance.",16
18,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I desire to ter of Defence whether it is not a fact that, owing to the differences of opinion amongst the local advisers of the Government, the naval defence policy was referred to the Imperial Defence Committee for their advice, and, further, whether the Imperial Defence Committee did not, in reply, state in effect that the scheme showed an entire inappreciation of recent naval developments, and of the cardinal principles of strategy ?",16
19,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Is the Honourable member referring to the present scheme of the Government, or to a prior scheme? - - I am referring to the previous scheme, of which the present one is a modification.",16
20,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The case stands thus: the Admiralty, in general terms, expressed no disapproval of the Government's intentions; but the Prime Minister has already informed the House on several occasions that, in regard to details as to the provision of boats and matters of that kind, no work will be carried out without the approval of Parliament.",16
21,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether he is in a position to make any statement with reference to the explosion which occurred at the Thursday Island fort a few months ago?,16
22,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The military authorities, in conjunction with the police, investigated the matter, and the former have submitted a report which they ask should not be made public until we have had an opportunity of receiving the report of the police. As soon as I get that report I will inform honourable members.",16
23,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence, in the absence of the Prime Minister, a questionrelating to A cablegram published in this morning's newspapers in reference to the approaching visit of the American Fleet. The cablegram, in referring to an article published in a London newspaper statesThe article proceeds to remind Australia that it is impossible for the British navy to be maintained strong at all points unless it receives greater support from the states of the empire. In view of that article, will the Minister of Defence say whether the Government still contemplate reducing, in the near future, the amount paid to the Imperial Government under the Naval Agreement? If the article is correct, will the Government favour an increase instead of a reduction ask the Minis- of the subsidy ?",16
24,Mr EWING,Unknown,"There has been no statement put before the House with regard to the reduction of the Naval Subsidy. There seems to be some confusion in respect to this matter. The London Times, and a number of other leading journals in England, think it inconceivable that Great Britain can' maintain her supremacy on the seas unless the Commonwealth and the other parts of the Empire immediately proceed to provide for their own coastal defence, and, eventually, for navies of their own. They say that it is impossible to maintain naval supremacy without it .",16
25,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,What do the naval authorities at Home say?,17
26,Mr EWING,Unknown,I am speaking of public feeling in England. It is somewhat remarkable and very satisfactory to find the ablest Englishmen believing that' the best kind of progress will be by concerted action from Australia and the Mother Country.,17
27,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister whether instead of attributing to the editorial columns of the Times opinions which have not been expressed there, he will endeavour to enlighten the people of Australia as to the actual merit from an Imperial stand-point of an Australian coastal flotilla by publishing side by side with the past references of the Prime Minister his own most valuable speeches upon me subject which show .most conclusively that an Australian coastal navy would be of no practical-value for the protection of Australia or the Empire ?",17
28,Mr EWING,Unknown,The people of - Australia do not require enlightenment - That fact is rendered obvious by the present occupants of the Ministerial bench.,17
29,Mr REID,Unknown,Will the Minister be good enough to facilitate a reference to the able communications to which allusion has been made by furnishing the dates when they appeared in the press?,17
30,Mr EWING,Unknown,Does the honourable' member refer to the dates of my speeches?,17
31,Mr REID,Unknown,I am speaking of the Minister's letters upon the subject.,17
32,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I have not kept them. They accomplished what was intended, and I have not altered my opinion upon the subject. I shall try to find them for the honourable member.",17
33,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister whether he sees any diplomatic objection to allowing honourable members to see the correspondence that has passed between the Prime Minister and the British Naval authorities since December-last ? I would remind him that by the time Parliament reassembles after the recess nearly ten months will have elapsed, in which the whole of that correspondence, so far as the merits of the Prime Minister's proposals are concerned, has been kept in the dark. . Mr EWING - A question of that kind must be placed before the Prime Minister himself. I am sure that he will eventually give the honourable member all information in regard thereto. I may add, however, that matters are not yet complete.",17
34,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that the : opinion of the responsible Imperial Naval authorities is in direct conflict with those which he has, I think, erroneously attributed to the Times and other newspapers ?",17
35,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I am not aware that there is any conflict of opinion. Any communications that take place are between the representatives of the people here and those of the people of Great Britain-that is, with the British Government. QUESTIONS WITHOUTNOTICE .",17
36,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Seeing that so much' time is daily taken up by questions without notice, does the Treasurer think that the intention of the Government to deal with the Federal Capital Sites question this session will be interfered with? . Sir AV ILL I AM LYNE - Question s without notice undoubtedly occupy a good deal of time. In the New South Wales Parliament we had to entirely discontinue the practice of allowing such questions to be put, because they used to occupy half the period of the sitting between 4.30 p.m. and the adjournment for dinner. A limit should certainly be placed upon the time devoted to such questions. It is not very likely that the Seat of Government Bil l 'will be submitted again this session.",17
37,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"It - is not a very - pleasant subject to bring up today, having regard to the weather.",17
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is never an unpleasant subject to me. NA DEPARTMENT . LETTER Box, WOLLONGONG - TELEPHONE GUARANTEES - MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT PIRIE OFFICES-ROYA LCOMMIS SION-POS T AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT. Mr FULLER , - In reference to an application by the Mayor of Wollongong for a letter-box to be placed on a lamp-post, to be erected by the 'Council, I have received a letter from the Postmaster-General's Department, in which it is stated that the request will be complied with "" as soon as financial arrangements will permit."" I understand that several honourable members have received similar replies to requests for works involving an expenditure of only a few shillings. Will the Postmaster General say whether it is true that the finances of his Department are so straitened as to warrant such answers, and does he not think it undesirable in connection with' applications for small works like this to make the Commonwealth appear to be bankrupt.",17
39,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not know that the answer does make the Commonwealth appear to be bankrupt. I certainly deprecate the sending of such replies, and will take steps, if possible, to bring about a change. Gambier ? I might remind the honourable member that the matter relates.to a question of decentralization. The House is anxious that such small matters should be dealt with by theDeputy Postmasters-General, and perhaps my honourable friend will ask the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales what he thinks of the request.",18
40,Mr FPLLER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In view of the large sum of money voted for the Postal Department, does the Postmaster-General think it necessary to postpone dealing with small matters till "" financialarrangements will permit "" ?",18
41,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Now that the Estimates have been passed, I hope that the practice to which the honourable member has directed attention - will be avoided in the future.",18
42,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I desire Jo ask the - Postmaster-General whether, where residents of a district guarantee to maintain a telephone line, and it is subsequently found that the revenue therefrom is sufficient to provide for working and maintenance, he cannot see his way to relieve the guarantors of the cost of maintenance?",18
43,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I can see my way clear to say that I shall consider the matter.,18
44,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I wish to ask the - Postmaster-General whether he is in possession of any further information in regard to the business done at the Mount Gambier and Port Pirie post-offices?,18
45,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I find that the mails despatched per week from Mount Gamb:er number 225 bags, and those from Port Pirie 162 bags. Mount Gambier receives weekly 211 bag's, and Port Pirie 174 bags. .The Mount Gambier office also performs Customs and electoral work, whereas the Port Pirie office does not do Customs work.",18
46,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In view of the reply of the Postmaster-General to my question, I desire to know whether he will see that justice is done in regard to the - classification of these offices ?",18
47,Mr MAUGER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member should address his question to 'the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, seeing that this is a matter entirely for the Public Service Commissioner.",18
48,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That being so, I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs whether he will make inquiries as to why the Port Pirie post-office has been classified above that of Mount",18
49,Mr HUME COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"When the Public Service Commissioner graded these two offices, I have no doubt he believed he was doing justice. However, the information submitted today seems to disclose a discrepancy ; and I shall, therefore, ask the Commissioner to reconsider the matter, and give a reply to the honourable member for Barker at a later date.",18
50,Mr JH CATTS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I wish to ask the Treasurer whether it is the intention of the Government to include as members of the proposed Postal Commission any experts other than members of Parliament, and, if so, will the Government consider the advisability of inviting Mr C. N . J. Olliver, C.M.G., of New South'Wales-on e of the ablest Public Service administrators in the Commonwealth-to accept a seat thereon?",18
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I cannot say what the composition of the Commission will be. The Prime Minister has not yet spoken to me upon the matter, and I do not think that he has given any attention to it during the past two days, in consequence of the bereavement which he has suffered. Certainly, the gentleman to whom the honourable member refers is a good man, and, as a result of the honourable member's question his name will be placed before the Prime Minister. PAPERS.

55,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE RETIRING,The answer to the honourable member's question is as folYes; so far as I am concerned every effort will be made to facilitate early payment of amounts due to those affected by the judgment referred to. NA MILITARY OFFICERS.,19
56,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"the Minister of Defence, ufon notice I. Does he consider it desirable that members of Parliament holding commissions in the military service of the country should, under cover of Parliamentary privilege, make statements or ask questions on the floor of the House of a character reflecting directly or by implication on their superior officers? 2. Does not the Minister consider the practicea reprehensible one, calculated to impair the discipline of the military forces? 3. Cannot matters of a non-public character affecting the relations of officers and men be effectively and satisfactorily dealt with by the Minister without such matters being made so frequently the subject of questions on the floor of the House? 4. Would it not be in the interests of military discipline and efficiency, as well as fair plav, for the Minister to discourage the practice referred to,, except when private representations have failed to secure attention to complaints?",19
57,Mr EWING,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"I think I should reply generally to the whole of the questions as follows:Whether it is advisable that members of Parliament holding commissions in the military service should exercise the right of criticism which they undoubtedly possess with regard to details of military procedure and administration, is a question upon which there is much difference of opinion. The Minister has no alternative but to reply to any apparently reasonable A. E. question which may be submitted by any honourable member, and cannot regard such questions as having been dictated, but by genuine desire for useful information and in the interest of the Commonwealth. The difficulty of the situation, as suggested by these questions, is appreciated by the Government. The following are the main considerations :1. Membersof Parliament have a full right to criticise any Department they see fit. To endeavour-beyon d such action as may be regarded as necessary in the public interestto curtail this right, involves serious responsibilities and is antagonistic to the principles of representative government. 2. A Defence Department,, or in fact any Department shielded from criticism, would certainly become atrophied. It is only by just, vigorous criticism that any public Department can be kept up to-date. 3. Ungenerous criticism of minor details, or bringing of Defence matters unnecessarily into the political arena, is by common consent regarded as being calculated to interfere with the legitimate control of the Forces. Still, if the Department acts wisely it need not fear criticism. These are the three main points in regard to which all are in agreement. The Government will endeavour to harmonize these difficulties in the proposed new scheme. STANDARD OIL TRUST.",19
58,Mr MCDOUGALL,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"the Prime Minister, u f o n notice I. Whether.his attention has been directed to the statements made in the Age to the effect(a) That for some time past negotiations have been in progress in the direction of concentrating the operations of the Standard Oil Trust in this city? (b) That although the details liave not been definitely settled, it is understood the organization known as the Colonial Oil Company is to be merged with that of the Vacuum O i l Company? 2. In view'of the fact that in the United States, the Standard Oil Company entered into far-reaching business combinations to destroy fair competition and to exploit its customers, and for years past practically defied the Government of that country, does he not think that prompt and drastic action should be taken by the Commonwealth Government, to prevent the Standard Oil Trust from pursuing in Australia that policy of trade piracy which has become so hateful to the American people and destructive to American national interests? 3. Does the Minister not think that the best time to deal with the Standard Oil Trust is while Parliament is still master of the situation ?",20
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. I have seen the newspaper paragraphs referred to. 2 and 3. If evidence is available that the company mentioned, or any other corporation, is contravening the provisions of the Statutes relating to combines, prompt action will be taken. FREEMAN AND WALLACE CASE. Motion (by Mr CHANTER) agreed toThat copies of all papers, letters, and other correspondence relating to the postal prohibition against the Medical Institute of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace be laid on the Table of the House. PRIVILEGE : SELECT COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE. Progress report (No. 2), presented by Sir JOHN QUICK, and read by the Clerk, as followsPROGRESS REPORT No. 2. The Joint Select Committee appointed to inquire and report on matters of privilege, have the honour to submit a Second Progress Report. Your Committee, having recommended that the proposed new procedure should not be retrospective, have taken preliminary steps to inquire into some recent allegations published reflecting on Parliament. Their attention has been directed to a statement published by a Sydney newspaper containing charges of political corruption against - unnamed members of Parliament. It would be dishonouring to Parliament if such charges were allowed to remain unproved, unwithdrawn, and the maligners unpunished. Your Committee regret to find that in the existing state of the law, they are unable to prosecute their inquiries in an effective and complete manner. There is no statutory law in force authorizing Select Committees to summon and secure the' attendance of witnesses before them, and above all there is no law requiring, and if , necessary, compelling, witnesses before Select Committees to be sworn and to answer questions relevant to the issues involved. It is true that the Standing Orders provide that Select Committees may summon witnesses, but they do not that enable such Committees to take evidence on oath, nor do they provide any punitive measures in case of disobedience to the summons, or refusal to be sworn, or to give evidence. Your Committee do not think it would be wise to proceed further with an investigation in which they would be powerless to deal with witnesseswhomay refuse either to prove or withdraw scandalous charges made by them against Parliament, or to give the names of their informants. If the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill at present before the House of Representatives be passed into law with some slight amendments, Select Committees would be armed with effective authority to take evidence on oath, and to recommend the prosecution of recalcitrant witnesses. JOHN QUICK, Chairman. Committee Room, Melbourne, 4th June, 1908. Ordered to be printed. Later ",20
60,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Bendigo) [3.12] I move1. That the progress reports of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege and Procedure be now taken into ccnsideration. 2. That the report be adopted. Two reports have now been presented to the two Houses by the Select Joint Committee appointed to consider questions of' procedure in cases of privilege, of which the first dealt exclusively with questions of procedure, while that presented today dealt with certain recent press allegations reflecting on this Parliament. The Committee consisted of members of both Chambers, representative of all parties, and was quite impartial. It commenced its work with an investigation, in obedience to the first mandate of the Parliament, as to the best procedure for the trial and punishment of persons charged with interference with,, or breach of the powers, privileges or immunities of Parliament. We found it undesirable to submit recommendations for procedure which would be retrospective in operation, and therefore did not recommend the application of new modes of trial or measures of punishment for past offences. Our first report dealt only with procedure to meet future cases. In determining what procedure to recommend, we had first to consider section 49 of the Constitution, which enacts that the powers, privileges, and immunities of the Parliament shall be such as are declared by it , and that, until they are so declared, they shall be those of the British House of Commons. Therefore, we now enjoy, and can exercise all the powers, privileges, and immunities possessed by the House of Commons, and can pass laws defining, prescribing, or increasing them.",20
61,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Assumin g that to be reasonably necessary.,21
62,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Yes , - and incident and relevant to the constitutional power. On examining the records and questioning witnesses, we found that breaches of the privileges and immunities of Parliament can be summarized as' (1) libellous statements reflecting on Parliament, (2) slanderous statements reflecting on Parliament, (3) interference with or obstruction of Parliament, (4) undue influence and bribery, and (5). insulting and assaulting members in the discharge of their duty. The British House of Commons has hitherto been the sole judge of what constitutes a breach of. its privileges. If it finds that a certain act or offence amounts to a breach of privilege, it can so declare it , and a general warrant of commitment issued after such a declaration is not examined by the Courts. It possesses the power-as we do^-to summon offenders to the Bar, to interrogate them there, and, if it thinks fit, lo commit them to prison for the term of the current session. But I believe that for some time the consensus of opinion here has been that this ancient method of punishing breaches of privilege and contempt o? Parliament is cumbersome, ineffective, and undesirable, and the Committee unanimously determined that the time had arrived when Parliament might delegate or assign to the ordinary Courts of law the enforcement of its privileges and immunities. In the past it has often happened that offenders who have been brought to the Bar of the State Parliaments-and I believe that the same thing has occurred in England - have practically triumphed, the whole procedure being reduced to a farce, such as I should'be sorry to see re-enacted here. Therefore, I had no hesitation in agreeing to the recommendation that the enforcement of our privileges should be relegated to the Courts of law, and, preferably, to the Commonwealth Courts. Either House of Parliament, - it is thought, might, when it considered that a breach of its privilege or an act of contempt had been committed, pass a resolution authorizing the Attorney-General to institute the prosecution of the offender before a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of a State'Court. That, in my opinion, would be a more dignified and effective course than that which has been followed in the past. Such a step would be taken only with great deliberation - Parliament would not authorize a prosecution unless in very extreme cases, when its decision would be reviewed by a Court. It may be said that Parliament should be sufficiently strong and independent to stand above criticism, and should waive the enforcement of penalties against offenders against its honour,' dignity, or independence. But if either Chamber became indifferent to its honour, or lacked the courage to assert its dignity and independence, it would in time sink very low in the estimation of the community. No doubt the assertion of privilege should be made only occasionally. The power to punish breach of privilege and contempt should be kept in reserve; to be used only when necessary to prevent every idle slanderer or reckless libeller in the community from impugning the honour of. Parliament. But, when necessary, Parliament should resent such attacks, calling on the offenders to sustain their charges or to withdraw them. What would be the position of the Courts of Justice if the Judges allowed themse'lves to' be assailed, to be accused of negligence, carelessness, or corruption in the discharge of their duties? They would sink beneath contempt. I believe that the Congress of the United States of America has, either because of want of power, or because of carelessness, not sufficiently resented attacks and insults on its honour, with the result that now the public opinion of it is very low. Any idle scribbler or irresponsible person seems at liberty to attack it without fear of being brought to book. The time has come when, in the estimation of the great public of the United States of America, it is not much honour to be a member of Congress.",21
63,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,--Congres s has powers quite as ample as we claim to possess.,22
64,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,That statement was challenged by a witness whom we examined.,22
65,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,- I can refer the honourable member to a case on the subject.,22
66,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"If Congress has the power, it has not discreetly asserted and it has, consequently, fallen very low in public estimation. It is quite common for charges of bribery and corruption to 3>e hurled against members, without Congress raising its voice in protest. I hope that this Parliament will show a determination to maintain its honour, and to be very jealous of charges of that kind, so that those outside will know that there is a strong arm, able and ready to intervene, if necessary, for the protection of either House. I have enumerated a list of what are considered contempts, and breaches of the privileges of Parliament. No doubt there are gradations in that list. offences are not as serious as others, and Parliament, in the exercise of its discretion, may not consider it necessary or desirable to hand over the whole of them to the jurisdiction of the High Court - In submitting this list for the consideration of the House, however, we have merely performed our duty. We have submitted to rioth Houses a. list of offences, the power to deal with which, we think, may fairly ' be delegated tp a - Justice of the High Court, upon a resolution of the House affected. There can be no doubt that most - of these offences have hitherto been regarded as breaches of privilege, and contempt of Parliament. Professor Harrison Moore, in his evidence, said clearly and distinctly, that these breach of privilege cases are well summarized, and defined on page 501 of the Annotated Constitution, to which honourable members may refer. Among the list the only offences which may possibly suggest new ground, and may, perhaps, slightly exceed previous privileges, are those refer ring to improper interference with, or obstruction of, honourable members in the exercise of their duties. There can be no doubt as to direct interference with, the .proceedings of Parliament-suc h as the action of a person who attended this Chamber, and interfered with, or obstructed, the proceedings-woul d be a breach of privilege. The only point is whether the slight extension that we propose-the extension to interference with members' outside the Chamber, but within the precincts of the House-ma y not be considered a legitimate development of the privilege against interference with, or obstruction within,. the Chamber.",22
67,Mr MCDOUGALL,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Does that refer in any way to lobbying?,22
68,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"It would cover .a it , case of improper interference with members by importunate lobbying, or taking improper action within the precincts of the House. Lobbying, or unduly interfering with members, with a view of persuading them to vote in a certain direction might come under the heading of "" undue interference with members in the performance of their duties."" There might be a certain measure of undue interference with honourable members, not . amounting to bribery, yet decidedly improper. This is a fair and legitimate assertion of immunity on the part of honourable members-a n assertion that they should be protected against undue inSome fluence in the exercise of their duty. Certainly, it is a common law offence for any person to attempt to bribe a member of Parliament. No declaration is necessary to deal with matters of that kind, for they are offences against Parliament. The offences we have enumerated are offences against Parliament, but are not intended in any way to cover offences committed against members in their private capacity. Offences against members in the discharge of their duty as members of Parliament, within the Chamber, or within the precincts of Parliament House, are alone dealt with. So far as offences against members .outside Parliament House are concerned the ordinary law will apply.",22
69,Mr MCDOUGALL,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,How does the Committee propose to obtain evidence against persons trying to bribe members of Parliament?,22
70,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"That is a difficulty which occurs in all criminal cases; if a case of this, kind is brought before liament an investigation will be made, and if possible the truth arrived at. I wish to summarize this branch of the report by saying that we desire, in the first place, to commend the transfer from parliamentary control of the breaches of privileges enumerated in paragraph 1. The safeguards against abuse of that power, and against frivolous prosecutions, is, first of all, the requirement that the sanction of the House affected shall be obtained to the initiation of a prosecution; and, secondly, that such prosecutions will be under the charge of the Commonwealth Attorney-General. It has been urged that this power might be exercised for the benefit of a majority in Parliament, and that a minority might be defenceless. Such a suggestion is unworthy of a moment's consideration. The recent appointment of a Joint Committee, and the reference to it of certain allegations for vestigation, was at the instance of this side of the House, which, as is well known, is in a minority. That minority demanded an investigation, and that justice should be done.",23
71,Mr WILKS,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,And the. investigation was started because the charge was a general one.,23
72,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"It was started because the allegation referred to a group of members-probabl y a minority-and in such a way as to reflect on the House in its corporate capacity. Where names are not mentioned the honour of the. House as a whole is necessarily involved. names are mentioned in connection with any charge of corruption, breach of duty, negligence, or disloyalty to the Commonwealth, those' so named have their own remedy by criminal or civil action. This power is proposed to be brought into operation only where Parliament itself thinks that its honour, purity, or independence is involved, and where it would be almost a public scandal to pusillanimously rest under insult.",23
73,Mr CHANTER,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Is not'the honour of the one the honour of the whole?,23
74,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Yes . Parliament may consider that a charge made against one member is so cruel, so conspicuously false, or disgraceful, that it is its duty to go to his rescue and protection. Primarily, however, this great power would be brought into action only where Parliament was assailed in its corporate capacity, or where there were special circumstances justifying intervention on behalf of one member. Ir* recommending that these various offences be Pardealt with by a Justice of the High Court we recognise that there are gradations, and' that some are not so serious as others. Some do not demand such immediate action reas others, and it will be for the House todetermine what cases should be handed over to the High Court. The Committee submits this branch of its work to the judgment of the House, having done its best inframing what it considers is a fair summary of the most serious charges. With the exception of the slightly enlarged definition of improper influence and obstruction, they are old offences known to the law, and could previously have' been punished by either House without reference to a Court. Newspapers as well as the general public have hitherto complained about Parliament, or a single. House being allowed to act as its own prosecutor, judge, and gaoler, and no doubt that complaint inwas to some extent justifiable. But now that Parliament is asked, and will probably, be willing to surrender that ancient prerogative-enjoye d by the House of Commons, whose traditions, immunities, and privileges we enjoy-to Courts of Justice, it is confronted with a general chorus of opposition to such a proposal, and we are asked to leave matters as they are. If we do, the timewill undoubtedly come when the House will feel called upon to intervene and to assert its honour and dignity ; whereas if we bring offenders to the bar, we shall be met with the old complaint, "" Here you are acting as your own prosecutor and judge and, in the Where case of conviction, as your own gaoler."" Whichever course we adopt, we shall be subject to criticism and opposition. I , and' my fellow committeemen are unanimous, however, in recommending that Parliament should take these matters into its own hands and do what it thinks right. If it does, it will agree to transfer to Courts of Law the work of dealing with these offences. There are other matters in the recommendations towhicb I need not refer. I come now to the second reference to the Committee, the reference to inquire into recent allegations reflecting upon Parliament. We had before us certain statements published some months ago in a Sydney newspaper, seriouslv reflecting on unnamed members of the Federal Parliament. We took a preliminary step to investigate those matters, but found ourselves practically powerless for want of statutory power to proceed further. We had no authority by Statute to summon offenders before us to give evidence, and to submit to cross-examination. power to demand from them the source of their information. It would have been idle to call, before us libellers who endeavoured to shield . themselves behind the plea 'that they obtained the information from some person or persons unknown and who refused to disclose the names of the originators of the libellous statements. Before launching upon an inquiry of that kind it is desirable that we should have the power of examining the offenders, and if they refuse to answer questions relevant to the issue we ought to be in a position to report the matter either to Parliament or to the Attorney-General. A law ought to be passed which would enable these witnesses to be summoned before the ordinary tribunals and either fined or imprisoned for refusing to give evidence. only way in whch the authority of a Select Committee or a Royal Commission can be exercised.",23
75,Mr MCDOUGALL,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,A similar law should be applicable to witnesses before Royal Commissions who refuse to answer questions.,24
76,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Roya l - Commissions already possess the power to compel witnesses to answer questions. I know that the Tariff Commission-in the event of a witness refusing to answer""a.question-ha d power to direct a prosecution.",24
77,Mr WILKS,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Can a Royal Commission enforce the attendance of witnesses?,24
78,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Yes . All that we - need to do is to confer upon Select Committees the power which is already vested in Royal Commissions. But we decline to go through the farce of summoning witnesses who might refuse to answer questions. We were not successful in obtaining the information that we sought, and under the circumstances we thought it desirable to present our report to the Senate and to this House. Until we have been equipped with the necessary authority to - prosecute our inquiry to a successful issue we resign our trust to this House. If the House will give us the requisite authority - the Select Committee may be re-appointed next session, and it will then be prepared to proceed with the execution of its trust.",24
79,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"In reference-to past cases? - Sir JOHN QUICK - Yes . mittee will then have to decide whether offenders should be summoned to appear at the bar of the House. But in respect of - all future, cases we recommend that that We had no ancient practice should be abandoned, and that the offenders should be dealt with by the courts of law. If that be done Parliament will be protected, and there will be an effective method of guarding it against unwarrantable and unworthy insults, which tend to its degradation.",24
80,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"I desire fo invite the attention of the honourable member to the fact that in the form in which his motion stands at present it might be taken in future to limit the rights of honourable members. Upon giving notice of a motion honourable members have a right to secure the consideration of that motion. The only condition precedent to their exercise of that right is that they must give notice. From the form in which the honourable member's motion stands at present it might be taken that a That is the motion of the House requires to be carried before the consideration of any matter can be entered upon. That is not so. I therefore suggest that the honourable member should amend his motion by leaving out all the words after "" be "" in line 3 with a view to inserting the word "" a d o p t e d "" in lieu thereof.",24
81,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"I am quite prepared to adopt your suggestion, sir, and ask leave to amend my motion accordingly. Motion amended accordingly.",24
82,Mr GROOM,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Darling Downs--Attor ney-General) [3-45]-- - I think the House i will congratulate the members of the Committee not only upon having performed their work expeditiously, but upon having done it very thoroughly, considering the time at their disposal. The House is particularly indebted to the hoiorable member for Bendigo for the. care which he has taken in the presentation of the Committee's report to honourable members. It is characteristic of him that hfalwavs investigates matters thoroughly, ancl faithfull y puts before the House the result of his researches. Practically, the report of the Committee is a recommendation that a statutory modg of procedure 3e adopted for ! punishing breaches of privilege of a particular kind. So far as the Government are concerned, I can .promine that immediately the report Has been alopted, it will be taken into careful consid nation by the law officers of my Department with a view The Com- to the preparation of a Bill which will be the submitted to the House next session. My own opinion is that it is unsatisfactory to allow our privileges' to rest upon section 49 of the Constitution, which upon us the same powers, privileges, actions. and immunities as are possessed by the House of Commons. At present, in order to ascertain what are our powers, priviHouse leges, and immunities, we have to make elaborate search into the powers, privileges, and immunities of the House of Comcourse mons, instead of being' able to learn power what they are by reference to a leges statute of our own. That is unsatisfactory, ancl therefore I will consider the visableness during recess of preparing a Parliament Bill which shall, declare our powers, privileges, and immunities, and which will also contain a general clause setting out nny other privileges and prerogatives that we possess shall not be deemed to be taken away by virtue of that measure.",24
83,Mr CROUCH,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Does the Attorney-Genproduction eral think that our privileges depend upon the grant contained in the Constitution?,25
84,Mr GROOM,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Certain powers are herent in Parliament apart from those exnal in deciding these questions would have pressly conferred. It has'been held Privy Council that every Colonial Parliament possesses inherently all the powers that are essential to its preservation. Even if the powers conferred by section Constitution were withheld, this Parliament would still possess certain powers and privito leges arising out of the very institution created by the Statute: But the Imperial Parliament has gone further than that, and has conveyed certain express 'powers. I wish to direct the attention - of the honourable member for Bendigo to paragraph 7 . of the Select Combeen mittee's report, which recommends that a law be passed defining the mode of proving by legal evidence what are the powers, privileges, and immunities of the House Commons. . 1 think that he knowsfrom of 'his researches that considerable conflict has lege exists. taken place between the Courts ancl the Trlouse of Commons upon the question of whether the House had power to declare its privileges. - privileges, or whether the Court had power, as a matter of law, to determine whether - such privileges existed. Upon this subject the following appears in Thomas' Constiour tutional CasesThe present condition of the question is, .according to Sir Erskine May, unsatisfactory. Assertions of privilege are made in Parliament, and denied in the courts; the officers who execute 'the orders of Parliament are liable to vexatious ^actions; and if verdicts are obtained against them, the damages and costs are paid by the Treasury. The parties who bring such actions, instead of being prevented from proceeding with - them by some legal process acknowledged by the confers courts, can only be coerced by an unpopular exercise of privilege which does not stay, the In a leading case-that of Stockdale. v. Hansard-the Courts decided that the of Commons under cover of a dean claration of a privilege could not create a privilege which it did not possess. Of the British Parliament has plenary to enact a Statute creating any privithat it may think it ought to possess.",25
85,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"It is the privilege of the adHouse of Commons there, and not of the",25
86,Mr GROOM,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Quite so. I am not quite sure of the exact meaning of parathat graph 7 of the Committee's report.,25
87,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"It merely recommends the enactment of a clause in the Western Australian Act, which provides that the of the Government Printer's order, or a copy of the Standing Orders, shall be prima facie evidence. in Mr GROOM - It reads as if any tribuby the to decide them by legal evidence.",25
88,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"It merely means that the production of a copy of the Standing Orders, for instance, shall be regarded as 49 of the prima facie evidence.",25
89,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"That would not be final as what they are, but only as to what it is nature of the claimed they are.",25
90,Mr GROOM,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"That is the reason why I mentioned the circumstance of the conflict which took place between the Courts and the British House of Commons. Whenever a man claims that a right of his has infringed, and seeks . redress in a Court, the Court will inquire whether or not he has really been injured in law. That means an inquiry as to whether-if the act of complained of has been done in pursuance the exercise of a privilege-suc h a privi",25
91,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,That shows the necessity for declaring by Statute what are our,25
92,Mr GROOM,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Exactly . It was the consideration of that fact which prompted me to say that we should declare what are powers, privileges, and immunities in a Statute.",25
93,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,It will have to be done very carefully and.delicately.,25
94,Mr GROOM,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"We can safeguard ourselves by incorporating in the Act a general clause declaring that notwithstanding anything contained in the Statute-, it shall not be deemed to take away any of the privileges of Parliament ",25
95,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,We shall need to be. very careful that we do not define our privileges in terms of Statutes enacted a hundred years ago.,26
96,Mr GROOM,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Yes . Regarding the obligations of witnesses who appear before Select Committees, I would remind the honourable member for Bendigo that a Parliamentary Witnesses Bill is at present under consideration. I promise that during the recess 1 will look into the whole matter, and that next session a Bill will be introduced to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee. If I can see my way ; to submit a fuller and more complete mea-"" sure I will do so. I trust that at this stage we shall not have a long debate upon the motion for the adoption of the report, because we shall be afforded an opportunity to consider the matter fully next session.",26
97,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Angas) [3.55] - I think the recommendation of the Attorney-General, that we should adopt the report without much discussion, is a good one. Certainly it is not open to the objection which might reasonably be urged against measures - suc h as the Bill which was introduced yesterday-involvin g an expenditure of millions of pounds, and which are passed-with extraordinary celerity. The Bill is merely an expression of opinion, or a direction to the Attorney-General as to the lines on which the legislation to protect us are, 1 suppose, to run. I confess I do not share the hyper-sensitiveness of some honourable members as to the effect of lobbying, or of imputations cast on us. If a man is pure and honest, as I suppose the whole of us are, he can stand a good deal of that kind of treatment without his standing in the estimation of the electors, 'who think they know him, being to any extent lowered. The public generally have to stand a' good deal of knocking about in these days of a free press. Some public men, I dare say, have the estimate of themselves changed by, perhaps, the not particularly delicate pens of some anonymous writers for the press. But it is more consistent with the man's dignity to ignore such references, than to be always squealing, just because a few critical bolts seem to hit him pretty hard. Then, there are the reciprocal rights of the public to speak their minds, even though they may not always express their opinions in the words of politeness.",26
98,Sir JOHN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,QUICK - I do not see how man's political reputation cart be killed politely.,26
99,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"I do not say that it can ; but I am merely warning honourable members against the danger of going too far in legislation of the kind. I personally recognise the rights of the public to lobby. How can the public bring even their delusions here and have them cleared up, except they may come within the precincts of the House. How could the Opposition, for instance, gather information, unless from what is reported to them within the precincts of the House, if occasion require? We ought not to be too sensitive. The web of our l i fe is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues. I am merely throwing out a hint to the Attorney-General that he must not, under powers given to Parliament by the Constitution-and , perhaps, not altogether intended-excee d even the privileges of the House of Commons, and introduce a Bill, full of penalties against those who may attempt, by rather too strong moral suasion, to affect the independent judgment of members of Parliament. Assuming that we do not go beyond what is reasonable and necessary for our protection, there can be no harm, as far as I can see, in the legislation suggested. But what I have just indicated is the measure of our rights, and, while the House of Commons may be as omnipotent as the Imperial Parliament chooses to make it, .we here are to some extent limited as to Acts of Parliament we can pass. We have no authority to create privileges, or to define privileges, in a way that is not reasonably necessary for the effective discharge of our duties as representatives-that is the limit to our.powers. I hope that limit will be respected; and that we shall keep within the bounds of reason, and certainly not exceed the privileges' of the House of Commons. What we are endeavouring to do is to hand over the power of inquiry and punishment to a Court of justice, rather than to determine such mat- ters for ourselves. There may be something to be said for, and something tb be said against, such a proposal. In the first place, we are asking that, the High Court shall be made .a Court of summary jurisdiction- a jurisdiction that is somewhat abnormal and peculiar to such a a Court-and that it shall act not according to the ordinary methods of legal inquiry. The High Court is a dignified tribunal; it is the highest in the land, and principally a. Court of Appeal. It is now suggested, however, that that tribunal should be brought down to the level of a Court of summaryjurisdiction; and simply because we desire to "" get over "" the provision of the Constitution which makes an indictable offence tryable only by a Judge and jury. If these offences were described as indictable, they would have to be tried by a Judge and jury, and to avoid that, we declare these offences to be matters of summary jurisdiction, and propose .to invest the High Court with the power of trying them. I do not know that the High Court will altogether relish being invested with this jurisdiction, in view of the loose description of offences, and if the somewhat elastic provisions of the B i ll be in line with'the recommendations of the report. It will be seen that libel, according to the report, involves a very great extension when compared with ordinary libel, as between subject and subject-that it relates not to mere matters of insult, but to defamatory statements which bring honourable members into ridicule, to obstruction, and so forth.",26
100,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Thes e are definitions of contempt of Parliament.,27
101,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"No doubt. remember, however, that the law of privilege arose 200 or 300 years ago, when Parliament required a good deal of protection against the Monarch, and, sometimes, against the Monarch's soldiers; and when liberty of speech was not recognised then as now, the press being under a ban. It was then that some of the greatest ornaments of eloquence were delivered in favour of the liberty of the press. But the protection which was necessary in those times for members of Parliament may not be necessary under the enlightened conditions of the twentieth century.",27
102,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Are the public not interested in the independence of members of Parliament and their necessary protection ? . Mr Glynn - I am quite aware of that f a c t ; but that is not involved in the point I am now advancing. I am now pleading against excess.,27
103,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Agains t inquiry?,27
104,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Certainl y not. case of an attempt to bribe an honourable member, or to libel him, I should not object to our privileges being used as a check, but do not let us go too far-d o not let us define the privileges of members of Parliament by the terms of the necessities of 250 or 300 years ago. If I were speaking in favour of the liberty of the press 1 should take very much the same view; 1 merely throw out the hint that we should not be too extreme. I do not happen to be so sensitive as to object to the occasional moral suasion which some honourable members seem to reprehend.",27
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,Perhaps the honourable member has not smarted so much as others.,27
106,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"I have had my own experience. Within the last week I have had two presents sent to my house by a foreigner who, I suppose, thought that they would to some extent affect the importunities I was supposed to bring to bear on the Prime Minister in order to have consideration of a reasonable request made by letter sent through me as a representative. But I did not come to Parliament howling about the matter; I merely ceased all interference with the case, sending the information that if the presents were not removed from my premises within a certain time, something else might occur. When the honourable member for Bendigo was speaking, he said something to the effect that the power of Congress is more limited, or at all events had been frustrated in some way by the We must Courts of America. I have kindly been supplied by the Attorney-General with vol. 19 United States Law Reports, in which there is a report of the case of Anderson v. Dunn, one of libel on Congress. Sir JOHN QUICK.:-There is a later case in 103 United States Reports, Kilburn v. Thompson.",27
107,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"I question, however, whether that case reverses the judgment in Anderson v. Dunn, which has always been regarded as laying down the law.",27
108,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,We bave the evidence of Professor Pitt Cobbett on the point.,27
109,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Like most other honourable members, I have not had the opportunity to read the evidence given before the Select Committee, but I dare say that if I read the particular evidence just referred to, it would show that the one judgment did not in all respects correct the other. In any case, the judgment to which I desire to refer will help to clear the In the air. As I .have said, the case of A nderson v. Dunn was one of a libel on Congress. An arrest' was made under a warrant, and it was challenged, and the whole question of the power to punish for libel and for insult-the terms used in the report of the Select Committee - wa s gone into. I may say that in the course of the judgment in the case of Sir Francis Burdett, which was. decided in 1810 in England, a libel on members had appeared in two English newspapers. For this Sir Francis Burdett was arrested, and thereupon he sued for assault in the Courts of Justice. Arguments having been heard for Sir Francis Burdett, Lord Erskine did not call on the representatives of Parliament to reply, considering the matter so clear. He saidTlie House of Commons, whether a Court or not, must, like every other tribunal, have the power to protect itself from obstruction ancl insult, and to maintain its dignity and character. If the dignity of the law is not sustained, its sun is set, never to be lighted up again. So much I thought it necessary to say, feeling strongly for the dignity of the law; and have only to add, that If u l ly concur in the opinion delivered by the Judges. That opinion was that"" the House of Commons had power to punish for insult or libel, and that the House. could also delegate that power. In the United' States case the Court also decided that the power fo punish for libel was necessary in the case of each House, and Judge Johnson, who delivered the opinion, saidThis result is fraught with too much absurdity, not to bring into doubt' the soundness of any argument from which it is derived. deliberate assembly, clothed with the majesty of the people, and charged with the care of all that is dear to them; composed of the most distinguished citizens, selected and drawn together from every quarter of a'great nation; whose deliberations are required, by public opinion, to be conducted under the eye of the public, and whose decisions must be clothecf with all that sanctitv which unlimited confidence in their wisdom and puritv can inspire; that such an as -, sembly should not possess the power to suppress rudeness, or repel insult, is a supposition too wild to. be suggested. Ancl accordingly, to avoid the pressure of these considerations, it has been argued, that the right of the respective houses to exclude from their presence, and their absolute control within their own walls, carry with them the right to punish contempts committed in their presence; while the absolute legislative power given to Congress within thi.s district, enables them to provide by law against all other insults against which there is any necessity for providing. Well, I think it is also .""too wild"" to suggest that the decision as to the extent of the privilege, by whatever tribunal enforced, has been, subsequently upset by another of the United States Courts. But the honourable member may be right as to the enf 01 cement of a later case. My desire is, not to 'discount the recommendations of the Committee, but to ask that, whatever declaration Mr Glynn. of privilege we may make, shall be determined by the necessities of the present time, and not in accordance with views held 200 or 300 years ago. The Committee has done good work, and I think that its recommendations might be adopted without much discussion.",27
110,Mr WILKS,STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT BY,"Dalley) [4.11] - The honourable member for Angas has rightly complimented the Committee upon the expedition which it has shown, and the work' .which it has done. I wish to revive the recollection of the events which brought about its appointment. In the first instance, a question was asked by the honourable member for .Hunter, as to certain general charges of corruption in regard to the Tariff , published in the Sydney Bulletin. A few weeks later, I drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that no action had been taken in the matter. After he had been questioned on the subject on several further occasions, he promised to go intothe matter, and, at last, moved for the appointment of this Select Committee. I opposed the appointment of the Committee, which was directed, not only to recommend 'procedure for the future, but to say how the charges which had been made should be - dealt with. In the meantime, the That a charges published in the Bulletin had beenemphasized by the Age, and levelled particularly at the-free-trade members of the Opposition. I asked the Prime Minister why he should not investigate matters for himself, and, if necessary, introduce a Procedure Bill. The witnesses who gave evidence before the Select Committee could have communicated their information to the officials in the Prime Minister's Department, and the Attorney-General could have been instructed to draft any Bill that might .be necessary. I contended that the Committee's investigations would be ineffective, because witnesses, if summoned, would refuse to attend. To my mind, members of Parliament must not be too squeamish. They cannot affect the graces of a drawingroom miss of seventeen, .who pretends to be offended at the slightest provocation. The more hostile criticism a public man; gets, the better it is for him, so long as he gets enough. There is. no better suit of clothes in which to go to an election, thai* the abuse of the press. Charges of bribery and corruption are, of course, another matter. The Bulletin has a large circulation iir Australia, and is read outside the Commonwealth. It is looked upon as a comicjournal, though only those who possess? vivid imaginations can really consider comic. Consequently) the publication by it of charges against the honour of ParliaI ment was a serious matter, especially when they were reiterated by the Age. The orable member for Angas says that knows that the charges were false. Percan sonally, I do not think that any member was bribed in connection with the Tariff discussion. But the charges, having been made, should be inquired'into. The Select Committee says that it would dishonour too. Parliament if such charges were allowed to remain unproved, or unwithdrawn, the maligners unpunished. We are also formed that the editor of the Bulletin been written to, though we' do not know whether he has replied.

It requires greater courage to do that than to keep on prous claiming what is false. I shall not vote for any measure to punish persons attemptcedure ing to bring members of Parliament into hatred, ridicule, or contempt, because libel laws are already sufficient to tect the personal honour of individuals. Our experience, however, is that a man . who brings an political libel, is bound the iury taking the view that politicians are fair game for comment. Of course, charges of bribery and corruption are ferent ; I am referring to minor charpes. Recently there has been a great deal of cussion in regard to postal administration but if a newspaper published an article headed "" Mauger, the Muddler,"" although the Postmaster-General might consider that he was libelled, the adage being "" the greater the truth the greater the libel,"" would not succeed before a jury, nor would the Prime Minister succeed if he were reI ferred to as "" Deakin, the Doubtful.

115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,"Hume-Trea be to the surer) [4.25] - I move- That this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill has been introduced, in the first place, because it is thought desirable, in to avoid misapprehension, to print in the preference column, where there is only one rate, the duty applicable to importations from the United Kingdom. The Bill gives power for this to be done. What may be termed the second part of the Billclause 4-provide s thatSection nine of the Customs Tariff 1908 is amended by adding thereto the following provisoes :"" Provided that no higher duty shall be able under that Act on any goods than the duty under the General Tariff in this Act : "" Provided further that no duty shall able under that. Act on any goods which undeT the General Tariff in this Act are free of of exempt from duty."" In certain cases the duties, charged under the South African preference on imports from that country would be higher than the duties under the new Tariff, and clause 4 is designed to overcome that difficulty. Where the duty under the South African preference is higher than the duty under the new Tariff, imports from South Africa will be allowed to come in at the lower rate. Question so resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee r Clause 1 (Short Title). - Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [4.27] - It would really seem that the object of this Bill is to provide that blanks in the Customs Tariff are not blanks. It provides, in effect, that where no duty appears in the preferential column of the new Tariff in respect of an item, the duty charged shall be that under the general Tariff -- what - Clause agreed to. Clauses 2 and 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (Additional provisoes as regards South African preference). Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [4.28]. - I have sent for a copy of the Customs Tariff of 1908, but have not yet been able to obtain one. If the Treasurer would kindly read section 9 he would enable us to better understand this' provision:",29
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,"Hume-Trea surer) [4,-29] - As an illustration of the difficulty which this clause is designed to , 'remove, let me refer honourable members to the position in regard to imports of hay and chaff from South Africa. Under the South African preference there is a duty on such imports from that country, but under the new Tariff hay and chaff are free. If this clause be agreed to imports from South Africa will be treated as are imports from other parts, and allowed to come in free. We do not want to charge on imports from South Africa, simply because of the treaty made some time ago, higher duties than prevail under the new Tariff.",30
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Parramatta) [4.30] - This clause, as I understand it, is designed to meet cases where the duty OF an item under the South Africa preference pay- is higher tha,ra the duty charged under the new Tariff 'in respect of imports from the be pay- rest of the world. It is proposed under this Bill to reduce the South African preference where it is higher to the level of the general Tariff.. Sir.WILLIAM LYNE - Yes .  Melbourne merchants recently informed me that under the South African preference they would be called upon to pay duty on a shipment of hay and chaff from that' country, although under the new Tariff hay and chaff were free.

119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Parramatta) [4.32] - I should like,' at this stage, to ask business the Government contemplate dealing with before the end of the session. We have a right to have from the Minister a statement on the subject before we agree ta the suspension of the Standing Orders to facilitate our remaining work. Sir WILLI AM LYNE (Hume-^-Treasurer) [4.33] - The next' Bill that I shall ask honourable members to consider is one to amend the Excise Tariff 1908. Honourable members will also be asked to pass two Appropriation Bills, one providing for anappropriation of ,Â£250,000 for naval defence purposes, and the other for an. appropriation of ^750,000 in respect of old age pensions. Then there is the Manufactures Encouragement Bill-wha t is known as the Iron Bounties Bill-and another measure which I have shown the deputy leader of the Opposition. The last-named Bill, of which the Minister of Trade and Customs is in charge, is to provide in certain cases for a reduction of certain duties of Customs. It relates to the harvester duties. Under the new Tariff, certain duties were imposed upon harvesters, and the passing of that Act meant the repeal ot the Act under which restrictions were imposed on the prices that might be charged for harvesters during certain years. If honourable members will afford me the opportunity,' I should like, on behalf of the Minister of Trade and Customs, to put. that Bill through the House.",30
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Is it fair to ask us to deal with such a Bill at this time of the session, and whilst the whole question is still under review by the High Court?",31
121,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMENDMENT,Is it a shot at Mr. MCKay ?,31
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,"If the Bill be passed, it will be disadvantageous rather than helpful to Mr MCKay, and other local makers of harvesters. Unless it is passed, they will be free to charge what they like for their harvesters.",31
123,Mr WH IRVINE,AMENDMENT,The Bill is merely designed to continue an Act repealed by the passing of the new Tariff?,31
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,Yes . also designed to regulate the charges that may be made for harvesters sold on terms.,31
125,Mr WH IRVINE,AMENDMENT,That is a very debatable matter ,31
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,"I thought that, in view of the question put to me by the honourable member for Parramatta, I ought to mention the Bill, but I shall not ask the House to deal with it at present. There are other measures to which I intend to give precedence. Honourable members are aware that I intend to submit to-night or tomorrow a Supply Bill.",31
127,Mr WILKS,AMENDMENT,For what supply will the Treasurer ask?,31
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,The supply asked for will.be on the basis of the Estimates-in-Chief and the Additional Estimates for this year.,31
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Then I think the Minister is in duty bound, before he asks us to agree to such a Bill, to give us a full statement of thefinancesof the country. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I ' think that the Prime Minister spoke to the leader of ths Opposition as to the number of months in respect of which supply should be granted.",31
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,":There is no trouble as to that, but the honourable member savs that he proposes to go on spending as has been during the present year. [427]- 2",31
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,"If , for instance, I were to cut down the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department, there would at once .be an outcry as to the inability to secure extensions of the telegraph and telephone service, and so forth. I merely wish to give honourable members an idea of what we propose to do. In addition to the measures I have mentioned, I. shall ask honourable members to deal with a small Bill to amend the Public Service' Act, and the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. I tbink that I have enumerated all' the measures with which we propose to proceed this session, but I may have omitted one from the list. With the exception of the Supply Bill, not one of them is likely to involve much debate. I think that it is the intention of the Prime Minister that, if possible, we should conclude the business of the session tomorrow afternoon. If necessary, we may sit late tomorrow night, and also meet on Saturday, but the Prime Minister hopes to be able to conclude the business of the session this week. Question resolved in the affirmative. It is Bill read a third time. EXCISE TARIF F (STARCH) BILL. SECOND READING.",31
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.40] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I may say that the object of the proposed amendment is to make the intention of the Tariff clear. If members will refer to Tariff item 94, in division IV. of the Tariff, they will find the following :Rice, viz (A) Uncleaned, per central, 3s. 4d. (B) Rice for use in - the manufacture of Starch may be delivered free, as prescribed by Departmental. By-laws, (c) N . E . I . , including Rice Meal and Flour, per central^ 6s. When the present Excise Tariff item, relating to starch, was prepared, it was intended that"" the duty should be collected only on. starch made from rice delivered under Tariff item 94 (B), free under departmental .by-laws. As the item now stands, however, the duty would be collected on starch made from any imported rice. It has been pointed out that the provision to limit the Excise duty, as is now done, has rendered it extremely difficult for manufacturers to separate the - starch manufactured from rice from that he manufactured from any other material and that the present necessity to do so is very irksome. The proposed requested amendment will confine the Excise duty to starch made from imported rice, delivered free, and will then allow manufacturers to use imported duty-paid rice without having to pay Excise duty, or be under Excise supervision.",31
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Parramatta) [4.43] - As far as I can gather, the intention of this Bill is to equalize the conditions relating to the manufacture of starch - to give the manufacturer a fairly equal choice as between imported rice, which is admitted free, and the dutiable article.",32
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMENDMENT,Yes .,32
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"I think that is a fair thing. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported without amendment. Report adopted. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) toThat the Standing Orders be suspended so as to allow the Bill to be passed through its remaining stage this day. Bili read a third time. PUBLICSERVI CE BILL . SECOND READING .",32
136,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,"Bourke-Honorar y Minister) [4.45] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This measure, as its title indicates, has been introduced for the purpose of dealing principally with Public Service Inspectors. In the administration of the Public Service Act it has been found rather irksome to have the Commissioner and his Inspectors restricted in the way that they are at present, and with a view to providing them with opportunities for promotion, it has been thought advisable to place this Bill before the House. Honourable members will recollect that the Public Service Commissioner was appointed for a term of seven years at a fixed salary, and that consequently he is precluded from being appointed to any other position. Of course, I do not suggest that it is proposed to appoint him to any other office. But let us assume that the Royal Commission which is to be appointed to inquire into the condition of the Post Office recommends that that Department shall be placed under the control of Commissioners, and that a strong man is required as its head, at an even higher salary than that which the Public Service Commissioner receives, surelv it would be an injustice to debar him from obtaining that office.",32
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,Why is he debarred ?,32
138,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,"Because he was appointed for a fixed term, and at a fixed salary, and in a fixed position.",32
139,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMENDMENT,There is nothing to prevent him resigning his office andapplying for another position.,32
140,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,"That is, perfectly true. But as-this Bill had to be introduced to provide for the Public Service Inspectors, the Government thought that provision might well be made iirn it which would permit of the promotion, if necessary, of the Public Service Commissioner. Such a provision might obviate the disorganization of the whole Public Service. Let us assume for a moment' that a better position than that of Public Service Commissioner was offering, and that the Commisagreed sioner thought he was entitled' to it . In order to obtain i the would have to resign his office, and the result of this might be to throw the whole service, into disorder.",32
141,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMENDMENT,H is resignation and appointment might be simultaneous.,32
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,Is there another position in the Public Service of equal value ?,32
143,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,Le t us suppose that a better position is created in the Seivice which the - Commissioner desired to fill. It might be desirable to appoint him. Mr CROUCH. - Who would recommend him ?,32
144,Mr HUMECOOK,AMENDMENT,"I presume that the Government would do so. In order to obtain that position he would Have t'o resign his present office. There would then be no Public Service Commissioner, and no officer to take his place. Under such circumstances it will be recognised that an Act of Parliament is necessary. With a view to providing in advance for difficulties of that, kind, the Government seized the present opportunity of dealing, not only with the Public Service Inspectors, but with the Public Service Commissioner. In regard to the Inspectors, I think it will be recognised that it is desirable that they should be permitted to occupy, at any rate, temporarilv, some other office. Both under the Public Service Act and regulations they can occupy only the office of inspector They are special officers who are appointed for a special term at a special salary.",32
145,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT,They are not under the Public Service Act. They were for a fixed term of seven years.,33
146,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,"They can act only as inspectors for a certain period, and cannot be promoted to any other position.  appointed ? Mr HUME ' COOK -.Ceftainly ; but than that he now occupies. being outside the Public Service Act, are not eligible for appointment to positions within the Service. In short, is denied them.",33
147,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMENDMENT,Hav e the Government nothing in contemplation in regard ' the appointment of the Public Service Comis. missioner to another office?,33
148,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,"Absolutel nothing. It has been remarked on several duties with so little friction. occasions by honourable members that it unfair that, an inspector should be called upon to report upon - an officer who occupies a position in the service to which the inlic Service Commissioner. spector himself might aspire. Under circumstances an inspector might so an officer occupying a good position compel him to vacate it , and then apply for and secure the position himself. This Bill will prevent that sortof thing. Clause 3 providesAfter section 6 of the Principal Act the lowing section is inserted:-""6A-(i) - A person holding the office of Commissioner or Insoector shall, during the continuance of his term - office, be eligible for appointment to any office under the Government of the CommonInspector weath for which he is qualified : Provided that this section shall not person holding the office of inspector eligible as Deputy Postmaster-General. to. fill a vacancy arising in the State or the Commonwealth in which he performs duties as inspector."" This will not prevent an inspector from obtaining a position in the Public Service ih any State other than that in which discharges' his duties. I repeat that Commissioner ought not to be debarred - securing promotion, nor ought any of Inspectors to be prevented from acting his deputy. Further, they ought not to be full v . . denied promotion in the service should it be desirable to offer them promotion. therefore confidently ask members to this Bill .",33
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Parramatta) concerned. Â£4.54] - I do not intend to oppose this Bill . Its object is an excellent one, and if for no i'n a sense, that is .so. other reason than that of rendering it sible for the Public Service Commissioner to enjoy a respite from his arduous labours, I think that we ought to pass it . ,",33
150,Mr CROUCH,AMENDMENT,"Does the Commissioner appointed, approve of this Bill?",33
151,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,Certainly .,33
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"I know of no they other officer who works as hard as does the Commissioner. It has been his custom reto work all his official l if e ; and he should not be debarred from even higher positions I should exthey tremely regret, however, to see him moved from his position; and if a tempting offer promotion came in connection with any position hereafter to be created, it would be in the interests of the Commonwealth to increase to his salary, in order to keep him where he Considering the imperfections of the Act, it is a tribute to his capacity and to his knowledge of human nature y and his tact, that he has performed his Whatever is other position may offer, I certainly hope that, for a very long time to come,"" we shall have the services of the nresent PubI know that such that gentleman has to do much unharry pleasant work; and my impression is as to that a great deal of blame has been cast might upon him, which, perhaps, would not fairly lie if we knew all the facts. However, I do not desire to raise a debatable question of that kind. This Bil l is f o l - primarily intended to meet the case of the Public Service Inspectors; and, as I unof derstand-, it was suggested first by the proother posed appointment of the Public Service in Victoria to the office rendered make a vacant' by the retirement of Mr Outtrim The ques_part of tion was referred to the Attorney-General, his who ruled that, under the law, the Victorian Insoector, who had been nominated by the Public' Service Commissioner, could not' be appointed. It seems to me that if he - we pre to crib, cabin, and confine the the Public Service Inspectors in the way profrom posed, and thus bar their promotion, we his shall take awav one of the strongest inas centives they have to do their duty faith"" ' I Mr CROUCH - This Bill will continue pass the prohibition, so far as the particular office of the Public Service Inspector is",33
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"I admit that, I understand the poshonorable member to be referring to that provision which compels a Public Service Inspector to go out of his own State in order to get promotion; and I have no 12058 Public .Service hesitation in saying that I regard that as. a cruel and unnecessary restriction. Moreover, I think there is an underlying implication which is quite unworthy of the framers of the Bill . If , we cannot trust an Inspector to do his duty in His own State, we cannot trust him to do his duty in any other State; and I do not think that the fact that he has to report on superior officers in his own State should debar him from ' any promotion which otherwise would be legitimately open. But this Bill provides that, if an Inspector desires to be, say, a Deputy Postmaster-General, or fill any other higher office, hecan only do so by breaking up all his old associations, and transferring himself to some, perhaps, distant part of the Commonwealth. That, in itself, is an effectual bar to promotion, because no man, for the sake of, say, an increase of Â£ 1 0 0 a vear, would break up his home and associations. Surely we may trust our Inspectors who have lived all their official life under the eye of the Commissioner, and have done their work so faithf u l ly and well as to earn the approval of the Minister. I am entirely in accord with that' provision. which opens the whole service to the Public Service Inspectors; but I sincerely hope that the clause, which calls upon an Inspector to move from his own State before receiving promotion, will be expunged. ' Mr HUMECOOK - I have indicated an aJmendment which will"" perhaps meet the case. . Mr MATHEWS - A Public Service In spector is immediately under the man who has to promote him.",33
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,The Inspectors are there to be of assistanceto the Public - Service Commissioner - Mr MATHEWS - But there is a promi-. nence given to an Inspector's work which is not given to the work of other officials.,34
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Eve n so, such prominence is"" inseparable from the nature of the work an Inspector has to perform, and it should not prove a disability in the way of promotion.",34
156,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"No , but even Public Service Commissioners are human ! . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I do not quite see the bearing of these counsels of perfection. There is no reason to entertain the implied reflection, first, of want of capacity on the part of the Public Service Commissioner, and,- next, of want of in[REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. tegrity and faithfulness on the part of the Public Service Inspectors. In my opinion, it would be a slur to. tie the Inspectors down in the way proposed; the whole service ought to be left open, and the Public Service Commissioner trusted to do justice to,his assistants. With the reservation I have indicated, I support the Bill most cordially as one which ought to have been' passed long ago. If there had been such a measure in operation sooner, it would have been a modicum of encouragement to a man who has left us altogether, after good and f a it h f u l service, but who was debarred just promotion by. reason of the provision in the original Act.",34
157,Mr HUTCHISON,AMENDMENT,"Hindmarsh.) [5.3]. ' - If this Bill had been introduced for the purpose of allowing the Public Service Commissioner to have a well-earned holi- : day, I should have been entirely in favour' of it. In my opinion, however, the Public Service - Inspectors are in - much the same 'position as Judges, and, therefore, ought not to have the control of their own promotion.",34
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,How can they be judges when they finally determine nothing without reference to the Public Service Commissioner ?,34
159,Mr HUTCHISON,AMENDMENT,"Quite so; but it . is absolutely impossible for the Public Service Commissioner to make himself acquainted with the whole ramifications of the service; and, therefore, he has to act on the recommendations of his Inspectors No doubt, in many cases of importance, or where he has any doubt, the Public Service Commissioner makes inquiries; but it would take years for him to make himself acquainted, with all the details of the Public Service in the six States. As I said before, these Inspectors are the judges; and, therefore, there is a doubt as to whether the Bill is desirable. I quite agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that,if Public ServiceInspectors are to be eligible for other positions in other States, they ought to be eligible in their owri State; but, as the Bill itself indicates, I think there is a danger in this connection, because there might be an inducement for the Inspectors to provide billets for each other. As a matter of fact, I think that the whole system of Public Service inspection is wasteful and costly. After the In spectors had been appointed for about four years, I moved for a return, which disclosed that the cost over that period amounted to Â£ 6 0 , 0 0 0 , or Â£ 1 5 , 0 0 0 per Annum, and that the only result has been to fill the service with discontent and irritation. ' Mr CROUCH - I should say that - the work had been done very cheaply.",34
160,Mr HUTCHISON,AMENDMENT,But what could - not have been done with this money in the way of increasing the wages of the poorerpaid public servants?,35
161,Mr CROUCH,AMENDMENT,That .argument could be applied to any Public Service salary.,35
162,Mr HUTCHISON,AMENDMENT,"But the Bill'itself suggests that the Inspectors-are not to be trusted in higher positions in . their own States ; and, if that be so, they cannot be trusted otherwise, because they may provide positions for each other. I sympathize with, any effort to do all we can for the Public Service Commissioner, because I . think the overwork which he has had to face entitles him to a holiday; but beyond that I am not prepared to go, and, consequently, 1' shall. vote against the second reading of the Bill .",35
163,Mr WILKS,AMENDMENT,"LUlley) [5.8] - The Honorary Minister said that this was a little Bill which he thought would meet with ready approval, inasmuch as it would make the conditions a little easier for public officers in certain positions. In my opinion, it is a Bill , the object of which is to make it easier for officers to evade their responsibilities. We can all endorse the remarks of the honourable. member for Parramatta in reference to the Public Service Commissioner. That gentleman is a personal friend of mine, but that is no reason why I should - lose sight of the difficulties which have arisen in the administration of his Department. We are fortunate in having the benefit of .his services; and it would be a great disadvantage if , in consequence of his being overworked, he were to leave his present position. At the same time, there is no necessity to grow'wildly enthusiastic over a man who rightly performs his - duty. The salary attached to the office is a good one, but if it is not enough let us make it higher. In my opinion, it is absurd that the Public Service Inspectors should receive less salary than - do heads of Departments whom they are supposed in a way to supervise. If the - salary be made commensurate with the responsibility, an Inspector will not be anxious to change his status; and I think it is most dangerous to allow men who are placed in a positon; as it were, of Judges to be at liberty to chop and change. This Bill is to make it worth their while to remain Inspectors. If those who are in that office are doing their work well, the country cannot afford to lose their services at the end of a. few years.",35
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Does the honourable member suggest that an Inspector should receive more than a Deputy Postmaster General ? - - """,35
165,Mr WILKS,AMENDMENT,"Decidedly . The Inspector is concerned, not merely with Postal administration,' but also with Customs administration, and that of any other new.'. Department which may be created.",35
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Then , by the honourable member's reasoning, an Inspector should receive more than the Comptroller General of Customs, who gets Â£ 1 , 2 0 0 a year.",35
167,Mr WILKS,AMENDMENT,"That is an extreme case: We have had a great deal of trouble because-so it is alleged-the Deputy Postmasters-General, who receive Â£ 9 0 0 a vear each, have not been doing their work properly. The Inspectors are answerable for the proper administration of all the Departments, and they should be given salaries worthy of their offices, so 'that they will have no temptation to engineer themselves into other positions. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said, either it is a good thing that Inspectors should 'be eligible for promotion or it is not j the paddocking-off provided for in the Bill , the arrangement whereby the New South Wales Inspector cannot be promoted in New South Wales, but may be promoted in some other State, is unreasonable. . If it would be a good thing to make Inspectors eligible for promotion, they should be eligible for promotion .in any State. But it cannot be denied that the Inspectors have the ear cf the Commissioner, and could virtually .bring about their own promotions. . What would there be to prevent them from ringing the changes from State to State for their own benefit ?",35
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"The Deputy Postmasters-General are appointed by the Cabinet. - Mr Wilks - The honourable member revolves between Inspector and Deputy Postmaster-General. It is not merely the position of Deputy Postmaster-General that' is affected. There are other high offices to which Inspectors could be promoted if eligible. If the Bill were passed as it stands, what would there be to prevent an arrangement between the Inspectors . to secure promotion when opportunitv offered in States other than that in which they were serving ? I am in favour of that portion of the measure which would enable a deputy to be appointed to relieve the Commissioner, should he need a holiday or be unable for some reason to do his work. But if the abilities of the Inspectors are so great that they ought to be, in the public interest, promoted to higher offices, why not allow them to resign one day and be appointed the next? . Mr HUME COOK - Unde r could the vacancy thus created be filled ?",35
169,Mr WJLKS,AMENDMENT,"We do not see the puisne Judges working among themselves for promotion, and I am altogether opposed to Inspectors being promoted. ' They should form a department of their own, and able to aspire only to the blue ribbon of the Commissionership. If the salaries now paid are not sufficient to induce good men to continue to act as Inspectors,, service must suffer, and . we should increase the remuneration.",36
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,Then the. honourable member would not allow a Deputy Postmaster-General to be made Commissioner? recommend only.,36
171,Mr WILKS,AMENDMENT,"Who fills the higher position, the New South Wales Inspector or the New - South .

I am, of course, ih favour of allowing the appointment an .Inspector to act as Deputy Public vice Commissioner when occasion arises.  Bill should be entitled "" AB ill to give plums of the Public Service to the I spectors."", The Railways Commissioners of the States are appointed for specified terms, at fixed salaries, with no claim transfer to any other position in the vice. What would be thought if a Bill were introduced in a State Parliament enable these Commissioners to appoint themtions ? selves to the positions of traffic manager, secretary, or any other permanency ? This Bill , however, practically makes it possible for the Public Service Inspectors to arrange for their promotion to the highest positions, even over the heads of men. who have been instructed that by good conduct and ability they may in time climb to the top of the. ladder. Every application for promotion goes through the Inspectors to the Commissioner, who must be. guided largely by their recommendations.",36

These Inspectors, having secured six of the chief plums the in the service, their successors will be able n - to do the same.

175,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AMENDMENT,"Why should the to Inspectors not be eligible for other posi theii present positions they knew that they would be called upon, under ordinary circumstances, to occupy them for a certain number of years. Their position is analogous to that of the Railways Commissioners of the States, who are appointed for a term of years, and have no guarantee that they will be re-appointed at the end of that period. It would be just as reasonable for a State Government to propose to make the Railways Commissioners of that State eligible for any position in the Service as it is for the Government to ask us to make these Inspectors eligible for other positions in the Commonwealth Service.",36

182,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"Melbourne - Ports) [5-3 ]--1 Â° common with other . honor1 able members who have addressed themselves to this question, I recognise that the the Public Service Commissioner has' worked hard, and needs a holiday. It is not because I begrudge him some relaxation that I intend to oppose this Bill. I believe that In the Commissioner and the Inspectors discharge their duties to the best of their and lhat they are unbiased. But at ihe same time they have done much of I disapprove. It is with some diffidence that I refer to what took place recently in connection with the appointment old of a.

He was with him day after day, and the Comremissioner had an opportunity of judging a his capabilities, which was not open to him in respect of other candidates. I do. not deny that he was a capable man, but there were in the Department officers senior to - him who were equally capable of satisfactorily discharging the duties of Deputy Whilst I do not think that seniority should count in every case, it seems to me that, all things being nearly equal, it should. If seniority is not to-be into consideration, in filling vacancies in the Service; our public servants will'have and no incentive to work assiduously in their I agree with the member for Dalley that the Inought to be removed from tempta; they should be removed from the possibility of being called upon to report to the the Commissioner upon the fitness of canintrodidates for positions for which they may If it is necesto sary to raise their salaries let us do so; but own who would dream of a Judge being able to appoint himself to a higher position?",37
183,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AMENDMENT,Thes e Inspectors cannot appoint themselves.,38
184,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"As Inspectors they might have to report to the Commissioner on thefitnessof other applicants for a position in the Service to which they aspired. That might occur under this Bill. When the opportunity offers I shall endeavour to bring about a different system. Many years ago in Victoria an Attorney-General retired from office to take the position of a Justice of the Supreme Court. He was a politician, and appointed himself to the Bench: Manv cases of favouritism might be cited. When we are closely associated with a man, and recbgnise that he is capable of filling a certain position, we are prone to give him a preference over others of whom we know nothing, but who may really possess better qualifications.",38
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,Would the honourable member debar a Postal Inspector from obtaining preferment in his own State?,38
186,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"Yes ; and from obtaining preferment in any other State. . The office of Commissioner should be the only promotion open to a Public Service Inspector, and the Inspectors should be fitting 'themselves by experience to fill that position.",38
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Would the honor1 able member apply the same reasoning to services within a State? Would he say, for instance, that Postal Inspectors in one State should be called upon to go to another State to secure preference ?",38
188,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"The difference between Postal Inspectors and Public Service Inspectors is that the former have some one 'in authority over them, whilst :",38
189,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AMENDMENT,"So have the Public"" Service Inspectors.",38
190,Mr MAHON,AMENDMENT,"No ; they have independent statutory positions. , Mr MATHEWS - No parallel, can be drawn between the position of a Public Service Commissioner's Inspector, and that .of any other officer in the Service, I have no desire that officers in the Public Service Commissioner's office should be placed at a disadvantage, but at the same time. I fail to see why they should enjoy an-advantage over men in other branches of the Service. Some time ago a messenger was required for one of the Ministerial Departments at a salary of Â£ 2 5s. or Â£ 2 ios. per week, and hundreds of officers in the Service applied for the position. Some of the applicants had served twenty-two years in the i Post, and Telegraph Department, but at young man whose position had brought him immediately under the eye of the Commissioner was appointed. I do not wish to suggest that he was not a thoroughly capable officer, but at the same time he was junior to many other applicants.",38
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT,"Does the honourable member expect that it would be possible in any service to stop that kind of thing? The illustration given by him shows that,, despite all we may do, there is an element of human nature everywhere.",38
192,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,But we should do what we can to minimize it.,38
193,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AMENDMENT,The fact that the young man in question was junior to some of the other applicants is no evidence that he was not the ablest.,38
194,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"It certainly does not prove that he was the most eligible person for the position - Does not the honourable' member see the point which I am endeavouring to make ? I do not doubt the honesty of 'purpose of the Public Service Commissioner, who has certainly worked so hard that he richly deserves a holiday. But I contend that many things are done by his Department which do not reflect that degree of intelligence that we have a right to expect. Only today the fact was brought under my notice that a number of telegraph line repairers-me n who have been accustomed to - hard mechanical work ever since they were nine years of agehave been asked to pass an educational examination. That.fact does not redound to the credit of the Department. It is not customary to compel manual labourers to undergo an educational examination. Whilst it is .true that in the old days, when political patronage was rampant, there was unrest in the Public Service of the States, I maintain that there is more unrest in the Commonwealth Public - Service today. I know that officers who have consistently applied themselves to the faithful discbarge of their duties in the hope of securing advancement, find .all their efforts unrewarded because they.do not happen to come.under the eye of the Commissioner. A radical change in the whole system of administration is needed. I contend that if this Billbe passed the. existing condition of affairs will be made worse. Personally, I would prefer to see a measure introduced which would rank the Public Service Inspectors next to the'Commissioner, and which would give them salaries commensurate with the work which they perform. But I would fcertainly prevent-' them from supplanting officers of whose fitness for their positions they are the judges.",38
195,Mr HUME COOK,AMENDMENT,They cannot do that tinder this Bill .,39
196,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,It is a fact that - officers in the Public Service are frequently promoted over the heads of others who should have secured the vacant positions.,39
197,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AMENDMENT,"The Service Act provides for the promotion of officers by merit, and not by seniority.",39
198,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"An intelligible plan - would be for the - Commissioner-wheneve r a vacancy .occurs-to notify in the Commonwealth Gazette that a certain officer has been nominated for the position, and to afford any officer who feels aggrieved an opportunity to prove his fitness for the .office.",39
199,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AMENDMENT,"But the men a. grievance are legion. . Mr MATHEWS - Are not men with grievances very often right? - Mr HENRY WILLIS - Yes , and very frequently they are not fitted for the positions to which they aspire.",39
200,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"^ In my judgment there is not that great disparity between the abilities of most men which some honourable members would have us believe. . No harm could, result from the adoption by the Commissioner of the plan which I suggest.",39
201,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AMENDMENT,"Oh , oh !",39
202,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Robertson laughs, but I may tell him that there are men in our Public Service today who are breaking their hearts because officers no more qualified than themselves have been promoted to positions over their heads. Further, there are officers who have made up their minds to do nothing more than their bare duty. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - No that they do not receive promotion.",39
203,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"I suppose the honourable member will admit that there is a limit to human .patience. Men' 'will not go - on for ever, hoping against hope. I recollect an occasion in Victoria, upon which - ojie of our Supreme. Court Judges thought that he had a right-by reason of his - seniority ancl' fitness-to be appointed to the vacant position of Chief Justice. When he was waited upon by a newspaper, reporter, he said that the fact that he had not secured the' appointment was enough to make a man saythat he Would do no more than his bare duty.",39
204,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AMENDMENT,Who said that? ,39
205,Sir JOHN QUICK,AMENDMENT,Mr Justice Williams.,39
206,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT,"When a Supreme Court Judge experiences feelings of that sort, is it reasonable to expect public servants, occupying much lower positions, to feel their disappointments less keenly? Under such circumstances, can we wonder Public that discontent exists in the Service? The only way in which we can overcome that discontent, is by making the Department which controls promotions as able as we possibly can. While I do not wish fo revert to the old system of political patronage, I say that we 6ught to make a serious effort to perfect the existing system. I intend to oppose this' little .Bill, because it is not the full measure that ought to be submitted for the betterment of the Public Service. with Mr Webster (Gwydir) [5.53] - I fail to recognise any necessity for passing this Bill at the present juncture - Undoubtedly, there are aspects of the question with which it seeks to deal, which require careful thought if an equitable adjustment is to be made in the interests of all those who will be affected by it. I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that under it officers who are looking forward to promotion to which they are justly entitled, will have their opportunities for securing that promotion seriously curtailed by the introduction of six additional'competitors.",39
207,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AMENDMENT,But the Bill will permit of six promotions to the office of Inspector. ',39
208,Mr WEBSTER,AMENDMENT,And the six new In spectors may afterwards be appointed to six other positions.,39
209,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AMENDMENT,"Then the Bill permits of a move up, generally.",39
210,Mr WEBSTER,AMENDMENT,"It does not. If the honourable member were a public servant, wonder who had faithfull y discharged his duties, he would feel that his opportunity for obtaining advancement was seriously curtailed if six fresh and powerful competitors were brought into the field. I do not see any reason for urgency in connection with this Bill . Honourable members are aware that the Government have decided to appoint a Royal .Commission to inquire into the working of the Post Office, and it may happen that when that Commission has completed its labours, the whole position will be changed. In face of the fact that alterations are likely to be suggested in consequence of the investigations about to .take"" place; it is injudicious to press a-Bill of ' this kind which is not absolutely necessary, at this juncture, but which might well' be passed when we have had the recommendations of the Royal Commission placed before us. There may be a desire on the part of the Government tp give some assistance to the Public Service Commissioner, but there is no need for a Bil l to that end, seeing that the Commissioner, under the present law, can appoint whom he may require to enable him to faithfull y carry out his trust. That being so-as I am informed by the Law officers of the Crown-ther e can only be one reason for introducing this Bill , namely, to throw open positions which are now dosed to the Public Service Inspectors. However, in view of the forthcoming inquiry by a Commission, I have no desire to discuss these matters. Any Royal Commission worthy of its name should be able to make recommendations for the proper settlement . of this among other questions; and it is quite possible that anything we do today might be rendered absolutely useless in the light of investigation.",39
211,Sir JOHN QUICK,AMENDMENT,"Bendigo) [5.59] I quite agree that there is no urgent necessity for this Bill in the closing hours of the session. *It never would have been brought before the House Jbut for the evident influence of high-gracle officers who have the ear of the Minister. This Bill has been introduced in the interests and for the fit of the Public Service Commissioner and the Inspectors, who, although they occupy high and important positions, claim that they suffer under disabilities ancl have certain grievances. I venture to say, however, that there are many hundreds, and probably thousands, of workers in the Post and Telegraph Department who suffer under much more serious.disabilities. I now speak on behalf of the hundreds and thousands of those who are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner and the Inspectors, and who have been crying out in vain for redress for years past. There is no urgency for a Bill the only object of which is to redress the grievances of, and give advantages to, high-grade officers, while the rank and file have to wait for the report of the Royal Commission. the last few days I and other honourable members have had brought under our attention disabilities imposed.on officers such as line repairers, monitors in the telephone exchanges, telegraph operators, sorters and carriers, who complain of the unfairness of the regulations enforced Bill. by the Commissioner. . I waited . or* the Postmaster-General last night, in company with other honourable members, but we were informed that he is powerless to give redress even in cases the injustice of which he admits. Most of the grievances in the Department are traceable to the manner in which the Public Service Commissioner has exercised his powers, and'certainly his complaints should not be given priority over the complaints of others who have to wait for the appointment of a Royal Commission. I hope that Commission will be appointed promptly, and will at once proceed to take the evidence'of workers in the Department in order that justice may be done to the Commissioner, the Inspectors, and all concerned. I quite agree with the honourable member for Gwydir that there is no urgency for this Bill ",40
212,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AMENDMENT,"NorthSydney) [6.3] - I also agree with the honourable member for Bendigo that there is no urgency for this Bill , nor, indeed, for one or two other measures which the Government propose to introduce in theclosing hours of the session. But there have been some remarks made which, if they were allowed to pass in silence, might lead to the conclusion that the present system of supervision of the Service does not meet with the approval of Parliament. I have had experience both of the political system and bene- of the system adopted under the Public Service Act ; and in the interests of the Service and of the community, I should be sorry to see a return to the former.",40
213,Mr WEBSTER,AMENDMENT,No one proposes such a thing.,40
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AMENDMENT,"Quite so;. but remarks were made this afternoon, particularly by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, which constitute a suggestion in that direction, although that honourable member did not actually express any desire for the change. The honourable member attacked the policy of acknowledging merit, and of not being altogether guided by seniority in the matter of promotion. But we deliberately embodied the principle of promotion by merit in the Public Service Act; and, if ' properly administered, there Within is no doubt that that is a just system, of advantage,- not only to those in the Service, but to the community generally.",40
215,Mr WILKS,AMENDMENT,It is not infallible.,40
216,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AMENDMENT,"Of course, letter not; nobody could manage a large Service of this kind and not make errors sometimes. Promotion by merit, however, naturally causes complaint, because officers consider themselves aggrieved in being passed over. We all know that the opinion a man has of himself is, perhaps, higber than would be acknowledged by other people, and we cannot expect a public servant to quietly submit to the conclusion that he"" is not equal to some one who may have been over him. But if we abandon the system adopted under the Commonwealth-if we revert to the old method of advancement simply by seniority-w e shall largely destroy theusefulness of our Public Service. If it is true, as stated by the honourable on the system. member for Melbourne Ports, that men who feel themselves to be aggrieved in this have declared that they will take no ther interest in their work, and will only do what they are compelled to do, we have to deal with the Service in a more drastic manner than hitherto. However, do not think there is much of that spirit throughout the Public Service; at any rate, .try. I hope not. We are here, of course, to reforms, but I wish to indicate that the remarks which have fallen from some honourable members, and which seem to reflect on the present system and to show a desire to abandon it, do not find acceptance with honourable members. I should be sorry, deed, if such a feeling were allowed grow'. It has been said that the Commisthere sioner is . apt to have his judgment influenced because certain individuals come immediately - under his notice, and to give them preference over others covered. equally able. But the Public Service Commissioner has Inspectors and heads Departments to advise him, and he is theresisted fore in a much Better position than any member, of Parliament, who cannot posevery sibly be able to judge an individual officer by comparison with others.

218,Mr BATCHELOR,AMENDMENT,So have I .,41
219,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AMENDMENT,"The hon the orable member for Boothby knows that when we passed the Public Service Act deliberately inserted a provision that motion should not depend entirely on seniority, but that merit should be congoing sidered.

Then the customary rule is for not only the man, but every other member of the mittee, ' to put to a witness whatever tions he sees fit. Only once have I the honour - of serving on a Select Comwell hold over. and I shall be very careful never acagain to undergo that somewhat lengthy These Select Committees, in three cases out of four, a most clumsy way of arriving at their were information. They ask questions very often round the subject that they are apI n the particular instance, to which I refer, the chairman alhave lowed every member of the Committeeand there were ten or twelve of them-to There was no presiding apjudge to say whether or not a question was pertinent to the issue, and any lay member of that Committee was' free to let of his intelligence roam as widely as he a thought fit. ' The result was that it took us a considerable time to obtain information which a Court of law would probably have Under this clause, a witness who refuses to answer a to question put to him by a Committee or by - any member of a Committee before which to he is summoned, may be .'found guilty of indictable offence, and sentenced to two peryears' imprisonment. Any lay member of a this House, - under this clause, could ask an unfortunate victim brought' before a Committee of which he was a member, any question he pleased appertaining or not to as the issue to be investigated, and if that man refused to answer questions pertinent or not pertinent to the issue, he might be We are not serving best the dignity or the interests of Parliament by proceeding in this insane and ridiculous way. I certainly think that there ought to be power to - put witnesses before Committees upon oath-to take their evidence upon oath-and that if these he witnesses broke their oaths they should be dealt with under' the ordinary laws of the - This country relating to perjury.",43
252,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,And if they would not prinr answer any question ?,43
253,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"If they refuse to answer propoa question pertaining to the issue, I have no objection to their coming under any line maximum penalty which this House sees But there is no guarantee that the questions asked of an unfortunate witness before a Parliamentary Committee will be pertinent. In view of these facts, I think that whilst anxious to maintain our own dignity, we shall show a singular dischairregard for the ordinary rights of the Comgeneral members of the community in passquesing such a clause as that now before us. had The Bill is one that the Ministry might",43
254,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Let.u s get on.,44
255,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"My honourable friend, who used so ably to lead the Labour Party, is no doubt anxious, as many honourable members of that party are, to have these provisions passed into law, because they will enable all sorts of fishing inquiries to be held outside the immediate compass of the inquiries - authorized by Parliament. It may be an excellent thing if any one has no information, and is anxious to obtain it, to enable honourable members to ask a witness any question they please.",44
256,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,-Then the Opposition do not want information.,44
257,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"We want pertinent information ; but I have had enough experience of Parliamentary Committees to know that, half the questions asked by them are not pertinent to the inquiries they are appointed to make.",44
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Is there a similar penalty in any other Act?,44
259,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,The Queensland criminal code provides for a similar penalty.,44
260,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Not in regard to witnesses before a Parliamentary Committee. - Mr GROOM - In regard to parliamentary inquiries. A penalty is also imposed in the case of witnesses before Royal Commissions who refuse to give evidence.,44
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,But not a penalty of two years' imprisonment.,44
262,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,No .,44
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Then why impose such a penalty in this case?,44
264,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I did not put it in. *,44
265,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Who did ?,44
266,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,The Senate.,44
267,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Surely the honourable member must accept responsibility for this Bill.,44
268,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The honourable - member involved. must be aware that this Bill was draft-id by a Committee of the Senate, and that it tion Mr.of GROOM has been passed by the Senate.",44
269,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,But the honourable member must take the responsibility for it?,44
270,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I do. Does the honourable member think that no penalty should imposed on a witness who refuses to swer - questions ?,44
271,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,A penalty should not imposed on - a' man who refuses to answer a question that is.not pertinent to the issue.,44
272,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Who m does the honourable member desire to decide what is or what not pertinent? The witness?,44
273,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Seeing that this Bill makes no provision whatever the inquiry of a Select Committee to the question at issue, I think it is highly desirable that this ""extremely drastic provision should be eliminated. Honourable members should be afforded some opportunity to reflect upon a proposal of this character.",44
274,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,The Bill has been before honourable members for seven or eight weeks ,44
275,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"In the closing hours of the session, when every honourable member desires td get home, it is extraordinary that an attempt should be made to push a measure of this kind through the House. I merely desire to safeguard the rights of the general community.",44
276,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The penalty provided in this clause is exactly the same as that contained in the Queensland criminal code, which was drafted by Sir Samuel Griffith.",44
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Why not insert the words ""pertinent to the issue involved""?",44
278,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Probably the Attorney General is disposed to accept the suggestion of the right honourable member for Swan. I , therefore, move That after the word ""question,"" line 2, the words "" pertinent to the issue involved"" be inserted.",44
279,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Bendigo) [8.0] The Select - Committee, whose report was adopted today, recommended that this Bill should be passed with amendments. One of its recommendations was that Select Committees should be empowered to compel witnesses to answer questions, so long as they were relevant to the issue involved. The amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth might fairly be accepted by the \ttorney-General. Select Committees merely desire the power to enforce replies to questions which are relevant to the issue I will agree to the inserthe word "" relevant,"" which is the word used in the Queensland Act.",44
280,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I cannot see that any harm would result from the insertion be of the words proposed by the honourable anmember for Wentworth. Let us suppose that a Select Committee were appointed to be inquire into a charge of bribery.,44
281,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,But it might be appointed . to investigate the doings of a trust. . .,44
282,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"In that case, the is inquiry, under judicial guidance, could be restricted within reasonable limits.",44
283,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,But there might not be for confining any issue involved.,44
284,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"There is always an issue involved. I regard this clause as the crux of the Bill , and it is impossible to eliminate it without destroying the. measure. Therefore, the provision, with reasonable limitations, ought to be adopted.",45
285,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [8.5] - I can see that difficulties may possibly arise if we insert the words, proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth. Honourable members will recognise that Select Committees are appointed for many purposes. For instance, one was appointed to inquire into the working of the Electoral Act. In that case, there was really no issue involved in the strict sense of the word. Every question that is put to a witness by the members of a Select Committee ought to be relevant to the inquiry that is being made.",45
286,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,A ought not to be sent to gaol for refusing to answer a question which is not relevant to the inquiry.,45
287,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I am quite prepared to agree to the insertion after "" any "" of the words "" lawful or relevant.""",45
288,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Does not the Attorney-General see that if we insert those words a difficulty may arise in connection with the cross-examination of a witness, because irrelevant questions are allowable in cross-examination ?.",45
289,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"But the gen'eral function of a Select Committee is to ascertain the truth. I am willing to agree to the insertion of the words contained in the Queensland criminal code, section 58, which readsAny person who being present before either House of Parliament or before a Committee of cither House authorized to summon witnesses, refuses to answer any lawful and relevant question, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is liable to imprisonment for two years.",45
290,Mr KNOX,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,What was the object of omitting those words?,45
291,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,-This Bill was presented by a Select Committee.,45
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,But the General can improve it now.,45
293,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I'a m endeavouring to do so.,45
294,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,It is taking honourable gentleman a long time to do so.,45
295,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Wentworth) [8.7] - The Attorney-General has requested me to withdraw my amendment, and to agree to the insertion of the words "" lawful or relevant,"" upon the ground that Select Com' mittees are sometimes appointed when there is no issue involved. If that be so, I cannot understand the meaning of the term "" relevant."" The honourable gentleman has said that Committees are occasionally appointed for no ostensible purpose.",45
296,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,He . says that they are appointed when there is no issue involving either an affirmative or a negative finding.,45
297,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Will the Attorney General abandon his conservative ideas?,45
298,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I think that I am treating the Committee fairly by agreeing to the insertion of the words contained in the Queensland Statute, which has been most carefully drawn.",45
299,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I confess that I was surprised to hear the statement of the Attorney; General that Select Committees are sometimes appointed for no definite purwitness pose. Does the Attorney-General foresee any contingency arising where a Committee might be appointed with no definite purpose in view-merel y a fishing inquiry?,45
300,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I do not like to cast any reflection on Parliament; because I think it has sufficient sense to authorize Committees to conduct reasonable inquiries.,45
301,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,That of course is very safe ground for the honourable gentleman; and I do not see why I should be overwhelmed with sarcasm !,45
302,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,If the honourable member will give me an illustration I shall answer the question.,45
303,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I am merely asking the Minister whether he can foresee such a contingency, and he asks me if I can name a case. For instance, a Committee might be appointed to inquire - generally into the conditions of the people of Australia, which is surely a commission wide enough for the asking of almost any question; and I should prefer such a Committee not to have the power given by such a drastic clause as this. In a case such as that of the recent gross slanders by the Sydney Bulletin on the integrity of the Attorney- House as a whole,. I could understand the usefulness of such a clause. However, I see that it is of no use trying to get anything more from the Minister than he now the promises, and, therefore, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",45
304,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Angas) [8.14] - I do not like to see this Bill pressed now, because, in my opinion, it goes .beyond all precedent furnished in the Old Country. If I am not mistaken this measure originated in a Bill introduced in another place' by Senator Neild three or four years ago, that Bill in turn being suggested, i believe, by an Act passed iri England in consequence of there being a doubt, whether the House of Commons had.the power of the House of Lords, as a Court of Judicature, to administer oaths. That Act in England, however, does not go the length of the-.bill before us. Iri May it is laid downAt length, in 1871, in pursuance of the mendations of a Select Committee of 1S69, Act 34 ancl 35 Vict. c. 83 was passed, empowering the House of Commons and its committees to administer oaths to witnesses, and attaching to false evidence the penalties of perjury. . . . It is not usual, however, for Select Committees to examine witnesses upon oath, except upon inquiries of a judicial or other special character. If we do not abuse these great powers all will be right; but I think the custom at Home is not to administer the oath to witnesses before Select Committees.",45
305,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,But there is no power to administer the oath here.,46
306,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I may be wrong on the point; but, if I am not mistaken, the powers we have are those of the House of Commons, and there, under the Imperial Act, a Select Committee has power to administer oaths. Clause 49 of .the Constitution is as follows :The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members of the committees of each House shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shallbe those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members .and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth. I think that that clinches the matter, and the extract from May shows that the House of Commons has the power, and that, therefore, we also have the power. Whypass a Bill, .which, from beginning to end,, is riddled with ridiculous penalties? I do not believe that there is aParliamentary Committee or a Court of Judicature in the British Empire which has the powers proposed to be given by this Bill. It is all very well for the Attorney-General to say that this is a copy of the. Queensland Act; but the. moment his attention was drawn to the matter, he had to confess that two most material words had been dropped out of the clause, not by the Government, but apparently by some private member, whose view has been accepted, is there a court anywhere which has statutory power to impose two years'. imprisonment with hard labour-becaus e imprisonment, according tb the Acts Interpretation Act, involves hard labour-o n a witness for not answering a question in relation to which he would in any ordinary proceedings be entitled to claim privilege. It is all very well to say that this is a private Bill, but, in my opinion, it involves serious limitations of the liberty of the subject. We are too much inclined, with our super-sensitiveness in regard to our dignity, to encroach on the liberties of the people we recom- represent; and personally, I should like to see the Bill suspended until it is really necessary. It is to be deplored that, witn such little consideration as we have given to this matter-althoug h a Bill was before us last year and shelved as too extreme - w e should be called upon at this hour of the session to pass this measure into law. In the clause as it stands a witness may be asked a question which would-criminate him, and, although he may claim privilege, he is compelled to answer it, and. unless he shows good cause-to be determined by what tribunal I know not--h e may be arraigned - I know that there is a passage in May which declares that it is doubtful whether, on the examination of a witness, privilege may be claimed. A man was before an Imperial Select Committee as the writer of an article, and when he was - asked a question he claimedprivilege, because, if he answered it, he might be prosecuted. In all matters affecting criminal offences, "" attended with such a severe penalty as this, the position ought to be set out clearly.",46
307,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Where "" is the urgency for the Bill?",46
308,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I see. none; because, as I have said before, we possess all the powers of the House of Commons under the Imperial Act.",46
309,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,But not the power to make a witness answer questions.,46
310,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I can only refer the honourable member to the extract from May which I have already read. I know that the President of the Senate, when the Bill was introduced there two or three years ago, took the stand that I am now taking, namely, that it was not necessary.'",46
311,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Senato r Baker signed the report of the Committee which presented the former Bill on the 23rd November, 1904.",46
312,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I have not the dates before me, but I know that Senator Baker expressed the opinion, either from the chair or on the floor of the Senate, that the Bill was unnecessary, and he relied the very passage from.May that I have quoted.",46
313,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"That may have been sequently ; but in the report of the prequired vious Committee it is stated that although there was the power, it was considered that the time of Parliament should not be taken up, but that Courts should be constituted to adjudicate.",47
314,Mr GLYNN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I am quite right in what I have said. This Bill can only cure inconvenience in the way of obtaining mission from the House to administer allow oaths. But the power does exist in the House to allow Select Committees to amine witnesses, and compel them to atdo tend and answer.",47

317,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"No ; I think this Bill ought to; go through. It is necessary that Select Committees should be given proper power and authority to conduct investigations referred to them - A joint Committee of both Houses has reported day that in conducting inquiries intended to vindicate the honour of Parliament, its action has been absolutely paralyzed by the absence of power to administer oaths and compel witnesses to answer questions; and that report has been adopted by the House. I was advised at the beginning of the inquiry, by officers of this Parliabefollowed ment, that we could not administer the oath, and I do not, believe we have effecnot tive power to do so; above all, we have not the power to compel witnesses, howanswer ever they may outrage the dignity of Parhim. liament, by slander and libel, to answer questions and disgorge the names of their ney-General) informants.",47
318,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,We have the powers of the House of Commons.,47
319,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"We have not the necessary power. The House of Commons may have certain statutory power, but do'not believe that all the power it possesses belongs to us. Without this Bill a prosecution may break down, and the whole proceedings of Parliament end in indignity and shame.",47
320,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"(Hindmarsh) [8.25] - I cannot understand why honourable members are blocking this Bill.. We are told that we have all the powers of incriminate him. the House of Commons, and that the House of Commons, has the power we on ask for; and if that be so, what objection can there be to the Bill, which at the very outside only makes us doubly sure? subSome time ago a Select Committee in' into the circumstances attending the presentation of a bogus petition. We ascertained the author of the false signatures, and the names of those associated with him; but the proceedings ended in a fiasco, because we had not the power to go further. We do not wish to continue an a waste of time by the appointment of perCommittees which can do nothing, or the perpetrators of offences to laugh in their sleeves because of the knowledge exthat they cannot be punished. We cannot injustice in' merely making sure that we have the power which honourable memMr 'FAIRBAIRN (Fawkner) [8.26Iwas a member of two Select Committees appointed by. the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, ahd found . the witnesses who were examined most anxious to answer any the. question, reasonable or unreasonable.",47

The present Attorney-General does not take advantage of our Acts to make criminals; but he may by one who will do so, and harsh laws are apt to make bad men. I do think that a witness should be liable to two years' imprisonment for refusing to any question that may be put to",47
323,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Darling Downs-Attor [8.28] - To meet that objection, I move That after the word "" any,"" line 2, the words "" l a w f u l and relevant"" be inserted.",47
324,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"-What is the meaning of "" lawful "" in this connection? Does I it mean anything more than relevant?",47
325,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"A Select Committee having been appointed t'o make a certain inquiry, questions within the' scope of that inquiry would be lawful.",47
326,Sir JOHN QUICK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The use of the word "" l a w f u l "" might excuse a witness - from replving to a question when'to-do so might ', - Mr HUTCHISON - Why insert a' word the meaning of which is doubtful ? ",47
327,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,There is no real doubt as to the meaning of the words whose sertion I have moved. A lawful question offence ? may be a question put by a person authorized by law to ask it.,48

330,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Therefore , of course, insertion is a vital matter with the Govern the ment ! The discussion shows that in pressentitled ing on with the clause- I must not say the Bill-w e are taking great risks. the one hand, it appears that if we do pass this clause now Parliament will to risk exposure to calumny and ridicule, while, on the other hand, if we do, innocent person' may be sentenced to prisonment for two years.

I point out to the honourable members for Hindmarsh and Bendigo that this is probably the penultimate day of the session. A Select Committee is not likely to be appointed tomorrow, and no such ciples appointment cam be made during the recess. If , before next session, some matter arises needing investigation, there will be nothing to prevent the Government from appointis ing a Royal Commission, which would have all necessary powers.",48

337,The CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,The honourable member is now saying what should have says been said on the second reading.,48
338,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Then I content myself with pointing out that, until we have a its sufficient explanation of the meaning of phrase "" lawful and relevant,"" we are to refuse to allow the clause' to pass, because the measure should be girt On about with every provision necessary for not the protection of innocent persons. Perhave haps, in the absence of an explanation from the Attorney-General, the honourable an and learned member for Flinders will say imwhat the meaning of these words is? Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.35]. - I hope that this drastic and useless clause will not be passed.' It gives to a responsible only in a political to this House, larger powers than aie g "" intrusted to the ordinary legal tribunals : it appointed to try criminals charged with definite offences against the laws of the country. The Judge who presides over a Court of Justice, to determine criminal or civil issues is bound by his oath fo conduct its proceedings according to perfectly well-recognised and well-established prinand rules, devised for the protection, not merely of those charged with offences, but also of the witnesses. But a witness coming before a parliamentary Committee not to have even the ordinary privilege of declining to answer questions when to do so may incriminate him. The Attorney General has attempted to get over the diffiby inserting the words "" lawful and relevant."" But is not a relevant question Mr Bruce SMITH.:-Not necessarily. body The tribunal may not have been lawfully",48
339,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"We must assume the - existence of a Committee properly appointed. Let' me show, by an illustration, how unjustly the provision might work. There is on the notice-paper a notice for the appointment of a Cominto and report upon the statements made to the Postmaster-General, particularly in connection with the Butts and Short charges against the medical firm of Freeman and Wallacej and the reasons which caused the Postmaster-General to issue, through the Commonwealth Gazette, instructions addressed to all postal officials deliver any correspondence addressed through the post to the Freeman and Wallace Medical Institute. Let us suppose that a witness has refused to answer a question put to him to elicit the reasons which may have induced the Postmaster-General to take this course, and has been. indicted ID a criminal court for having refused to do so. In the first place the Judge will say to the jury : "" Gentlemen of the jury, before you can convict this man you must first of all ascertain whether the Postmaster-General has any reason for adopting the course that he did. Having decided' that he had reasons for adopting that course, you must next ascertain what those reasons were. Then you will be in a' position to say whether the questions which this man refused to answer were questions which he was justified in refusing to answer, as not being relevant to the inquiry."" Could honourable imagine anything more ridiculous ? Are we to take part in a farce? Is it not little more than a farce that we should put such a provision as this on the statute-book? In stances of the kind I have cited might readily be multiplied, although the particular Select Committee to which I have referred will have perhaps a more direct issue to deal with than the issues which many Parliamentary Committees are appointed to consider.",48
340,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Does the honourable member think that a Select Committee should not be armed with any power to compel - x witness to answer relevant questions? Mr W. H . . IRVINE - H a v in g regard to the general roving character of the commission which the average Committee holds, it is absolutely unsafe to invest them with anything more than the most restricted powers of compelling evidence. They certainly ought not to have greater powers than are vested in Roval Commissions.",49
341,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"That is only a question of penalty, not of ipower.",49
342,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I say that I certainly would not give a Select Committee more power than a Royal Commission possesses.,49
343,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Why should a Select Committee be superior , to^ a Royal Commission ?",49
344,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,A witness appearing fore a Royal Commission must answer any is provided for. Having regard question touching the subject-matter of inquiry under penalty of a fine of Â£ 5 I have told the honourable member for Bendigo that I am prepared to meet him to not to - some extent in regard to the question of penalty.,49
345,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"If the Attorney General is prepared to modify this provision, so that it will not provide for a greater penalty than may be imposed ^n a witness who refuses to give evidence before a Royal Commission, I shall be satisfied.",49
346,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Parkes) [8.44]. - I have listened with considerable interest to the. variety of opinions that have been expressed upon this subject, and could not help reflecting when I heard the legal fraternity expressing such widely divergent views that we might be emphasizing the scarcity of litigation in this State even more than it has been by demonstrating to the public the impossibility of obtaining uniformity in legal opinion. The honourable member for Flinders has pointed to the weak spot in this Bill . It is proposed to give to these members Committees a power which no Court in this country has possessed. In the case of a witness who refuses to give evidence before a Royal Commission-and Royal Commissions are supposed to be of a much more grave and important character than Select: Committees- a penalty of-as a rule-no t more than Â£ 5 0 is imposed;. In connection 1 with an important inquiry by a Royal Commission in New South Wales as to some land scandals- I do not refer to the inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Owen-it was found difficult to get certain witnesses to answer questions. The Commission possessed the powers usually vested in a Roval Commission, but all.that it was able to do was to prosecute a witness, who had refused to answer questions, for the penalty of Â£ 2 0 . Turning from Royal Commissions to other important bodies like the High Court or the Supreme Courts of the different States, we find that the only power they have in this regard is to commit a witness for contempt, in refusing to answer a question - But one never heard of a Justice of the Supreme Court committing a witness for refusing to answer questions to a term of imprisonment anything like as long as one year, Mr .W. H . IRVINK - The offending witness is always allowed to purge his contempt by agreeing to answer the question. Mr .BRUCE SMITH - Exactly . In this case, however, an unconditional bepenalty of two years' imprisonment to the the phraseology used, the difficulty is 0 . much greater than some laymen imagine. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, like a good many more laymen, rushes in where even lawyers fear to tread. He say's that if the word "" lawful."" is doubtful, we ought to strike it out. I differ from the honourable member for Flinders with regard to the use of that word. He will admit that a question may be relevant, but not lawful. A question may be relevant, but by replying to it the witness might incriminate himself. Therefore, although perfectly relevant, it would not be lawful. I agree, therefore, with the Attorney-General that the word "" lawful "" is necessary. The punishment proposed, however, is absurd. Let me deal for - a moment with the question of relevancy. It is a well-known rule of the law of evidence that', under cross-examination, a witness may' be asked a question about his early life-abou t something that has no connection with the problem that is before the tribunal-becaus e it goes to - Iris character and credibility. The point is whether such a question would' be relevant, although it might be allowed by the Judge or"" the chairman of the tribunal as haying abearing upon the credibility of the witness.",49

348,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I think that - jury. the' word "" lawful "" is sufficiently covered by the principle of incrimination. As the question of urgency in passing the .measure, I think that the honourable ' learned member for Bendigo has demonto strated that it is an urgent Bill. A legal number of honourable members have been appointed, in all seriousness', to enter an inquiry; and they are about to begin that inquiry while ""the House is in recess. The honourable member, as chairman of that Committee, says, im effect: "" I am not prepared to embark upon this inquiry unless Parliament is prepared to remove the doubt' that exists in my mind as my powers as chairman to compel witover nesses to answer questions on oath."" What would be his position if this Bill were passed? Let us suppose that he takes his seat as chairman of the Committee, surthe rounded by other members of Parliament, who give their services for nothing, and that he begins to ask questions - Thenlet us assume that witnesses refuse to' answer those questions. consults with his colleagues, and then finds that, by reason of this Bill not having' been, passed, he carnnot go on with.the insecured, in any Case.

I , therefore, think that the measure is urgent; also that the word "" lawful "" is not surplusage, and should remain in the clause. Even if I were paid a fee for anopinion, I should say that its use is - warranted. I often notice that the views of lawyers, given without fee, are not nearly so reliable as are those given by them when a fee is paid.. I repeat that, in my opinion, the measure is urgent, and that it is right that the word "" lawful "" should be retained, but I think that the Attorney-General will make a grave error if he persists with his proposal with regard to imprisonment. He will be perfectly safe in going upon the lines adopted in regard to Royal Commissions, and providing for the imposition of a severe monetary penalty for refusing to answer a question.",50

But it has been held and over again that that Act does not mean anv person, But a person within the not meaning of the Statute.

Parliament has power at time to appoint either a Select Committee or a Royal Commission for any purpose that it may desire. For their stronger powers, and for convenience sake, howwho - ever, Royal Commissions are frequently appointed. It is a matter of importance that each of these bodies should - postheI f Commission sess the necessary power to obtain any information that it may desire. quently, I hold that when legislation is . enacted for the purpose of determining the on powers of these bodies, those powers should be"" the same in each, instance. not appear foolish if we provide two ferent sets of powers and penalties? the consideration of this Bill is deferred till next session-whic h seems not improblawful able- I ask the Attorney-General to take this aspect of the matter into consideration. The provisions of the measure. seem me to be very drastic. A gaol is inserted between every second paragraph. If it be necessary for a Select Committee to clothed with the powers and penalties proposer! under this Bill , ' surely it prisonment.' is equally necessary that those powers' should be vested in a Royal Commission; On the other hand, if those powers are not necessary in the case of a Royal Commission, they ought not to be necessary in the case of a Select Committee. ' Mr .GROOM (Darling Downs-At torney-General) [9.1] - It seems to me that the honourable member for Flinders does not really understand the difficulties which Select Committees of this House have experienced in conducting their inquiries. It is all very well for him to endeavour to rethe position to an absurdity by selecting as an illustration a case which cannot that possiblv arise. But I ask him to take the Â£ 1 0 case of a corporation possessed of considerable' means, the members of which de- cline to answer questions put to them, although the answers to those questions may be of vital importance to the welfare of the whole community. What is the position of a - Select Committee under such circumWitnesses stances? What awe will be inspired in the to heart of a man of means who has been to doing something which is detrimental to the public interest, when he is told that unless he answers the questions put to him he will be fined Â£ 1 0 ? These are the difficulties' the which Select Committees have had to face. A Select Committee carries with it the digof this Parliament, and if Parliament decides that in the interests of the public whom it governs it is necessary to institute a legitimate inquiry, surely the Committee any appointed to conduct that inquiry ought to be empowered to ascertain the truth. We have already clothed Royal Commission's with power to impose a fine upon witnesses decline to answer questions. It is to be found in the following provisionany person appearing as a witness before refuses to be sworn or to make an affirmation or to answer any question put to Consehim by any of the Commissioners touching the subject-matter of the inquiry, he shall be liable summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding Fifty pounds. Shall we I think that ultimately we must reserve the difpower of imprisonment if witnesses set a If Select Committee at defiance. We might enact that if a person refuses to answer anyand relevant question he shall be liable to a penalty of Â£ 5 0 . It would not necessarily Follow that the full penalty to would be inflicted, but only one proportionate to the nature of the offence. But if a witness persistently refuses to answer a be question put to him, he should be liable, upon a second conviction, to a term of imWhat deterrent would a. penalty of Â£ 5 0 be in the case of a wealthy corporation possessing a capital perhaps of millions ? - Mr WILSON - What about the case of a medical man who refuses to give evidence ?",51

But my point is that it would be absolutely futile to provide a small penalty if we wish Select Committees to get at the truth. . Mr Bruce SMITH - What imprisonment does the Attorney-General suggest as alternative ?,52

I am satisfied that the position will be the same 5 honourable member has expressed relative to military expenditure. If the public ask for an up-to-date defence and for an increase in the strength of our Military Forces they cannot expect that the cost of such a service shall be met out of Customs and Excise revenue. Direct taxation will be necessary. Those who will most largely benefit by it must be called upon to bear their share of this expenditure by means of a tax on incomes. In Great Britain there is in operation what is known as a war tax, and I think that we could provide for an up-to-date defence system by means of what should be known as a defence tax on incomes. At the Imperial Conference the Prime Minister said that Australia was prepared to break away from' the 'Naval Agreement. I do not think that he has correctly gauged either public opinion or the desire of this Parliament. We have not yet had an opportunity to endorse or reject the opinion expressed by the honourable gentleman, but I am satisfied' that we have no desire to discontinue the naval subsidy. Lord Tweedmouth, however, was told by the Prime Minister that the public of Australia desired to get away from it, and the Admiralty, always ready to agree to whatever Australia desires, said that no obstacle would bg placed in the way of the discontinuance of that'Agreement.",55

But there are certain aspects of this proposed vote that I think we should be careful to emphasize. It is fortunate that the Prime Minister gave us the undertaking which the deputy leader of the Opposition has read and which the Treasurer has confirmed, because it will afford us something to stand upon in the future. I would' point out, however, that it does not mean absolute safety so far as the position of this House is concerned. I have watched with considerable interest the conduct of negotiations between the Prime Minister and the Imperial naval authorities, and have found that the honourable gentleman does not hesitate to make representations to them which have no foundation in fact in this country. The honourable member for Dalley has very properly pointed out that when the Prime Minister went' to London to attend the Imperial Conference he made a distinct representation to the British Government that the people of. Australia were opposed to the continuance of the naval subsidy. .",56
410,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,In its present form?,56
411,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"To its continuance in any form as a naval subsidy of Â£200,000 per annum.",56
412,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,No .,56
413,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I am speaking with a knowledge of the words used by him at the Conference, and in his speech, both accessible to members.  experience great difficulty in carrying the Naval Agreement Bill in this House?",56
414,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,That may be; but honourable members are aware that when the Prime Minister goes awav from this House he is not excessively particular as to the accuracy of his statements with regard to its opinions.,56
415,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I think that be is. - Mr Bruce SMITH - I shall give the Committee an instance which I have mentioned in the presence of the Prime Minister. Before the Prime Minister went to England he read in this House a number of resolutions which it was proposed to submit to the Conference. When I asked him across the table whether he was going to tell the Conference that those resolutions represented the feelings of the people of Australia or of this House, he replied, "" No ; they are the opinions of the Govern-. ment."" But no sooner had he reached London than he practically told a representative of an influential evening paper that those resolutions represented the feelings of the people of Australia and of this House. As a matter of fact, they did not. I have mentioned the matter in this House in the presence of the Prime Minister, and he has had an opportunity to contradict me. The honourable gentleman, as the honourable member for Dalley has stated, certainly did represent when ih the Conference that the people of Australia were unfavorable to the continuance of a money contribution' to the British Navy. . And he emphasized that statement so frequently that at last Lord Tweedmouth, as representing the naval authorities at the Conference, said, in effect, "" If the people of Australia have made up their minds to contribute to the ' defence . of the Empire in ' kind ' instead of in cash, we should like you to build a certain class of vessels which if would be very inconvenient for us to send from England to Australia."" He went on to say, however, "" If you bave an Australian flotilla we shall expect you to place it under - the control of the Commander in-Chief in time of war."" The : Prime Minister said in this House that that could not be, and the leader of the Labour Party said it was impossible. Those words' stand in Hansard today. That means",56
416,The CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,I would point out to the honourable member that to allow him to continue the line of argument he is now pursuing would be to open up a genera! discussion as to what took place at the. Imperial Conference. I ask the honourable member not to follow that line of discussion.,57
417,Mr BRUC ESMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I wish honourable members to distinguish between the policy of this appropriation and my statement of what was put by the Prime Minister before the people of England. I am not, at present, advocating or opposing - any particular scheme of Australian naval defence. I want to show the necessity for our hedging round this appropriation with precautions as to what it commits us to.",57
418,Mr HUME COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Does the__ honourable member think that the Prime Minister will back down from his statement? Mr B'RUCE SMITH - I am not prepared to say that - he would not ,57
419,Mr HUME COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The honourable member is the only man in this ,House who w ould say that. r",57
420,Mr BRUC ESMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"It is only some three weeks ago since the Prime Minister threatened to resign if a certain proposal were adopted, and today he is succumbing to that proposal.",57
421,Mr HUME COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,The honourable member is the only man in the House who would make such a statement. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Then I must be the only courageous man.,57
422,Mr HUME COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Courageou s behind the Prime Minister's back.,57
423,Mr BRUC ESMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I have made the former statement before, in this House, and in the Prime Minister's presence. One ofmy misfortunes, as a member of this House is that I differ very frequently from the honourable member for Flinders, even on legal questions. But we always agree to differ with great amiability, and have, I think, everv , respect for eachl other's opinions. The honourable member at the outset of his speech said something about not objecting to this proposed vote as an earnest to the British Government of what we propose t'o do. Unlike him, I do object",57
424,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,As an earnest only of the intention of the Government to do something substantial.,57
425,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I can only say that I object to the passing of this proposed vote being regarded as an earnest of what we intend to do. t am satisfied that a majority of this House will not consent to the continuation of the present naval subsidy, concurrently with the building of an Australian Navy. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I hope that they will'.",57
426,Mr BRUC ESMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I hope so, too. I can see that there is a jingoistic national spirit springing up in Australia, and that the people are determined to have an Australian Navy, even if it be only a toy one. I quite agree with the honourable member for Darwin that the progress of invention nowadays is so rapid that by the time we have reached a certain form of defence we shall find that it must be superseded by something entirely new, and that by the time .we have approached it-wit h the slow progress which we must necessarily make in Australian manufactures .of that character-that again will need to be superseded by some new invention. still if the people of Australia are determined to embark upon the nucleus of a navy, none ,of us should offer anv objection, unless we think we can stop it . My belief is-howeve r much I regret having to draw the conclusion-that honourable members will not consent to the continuation of the present naval subsidy, also to the expenditure of some hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum upon an Australian Navy. have already passed a Surplus Revenue Bill , which allows the Government to appropriate instead of to expend, ancl this Bill is to be passed to-night in order to appropriate Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to a trust fund to form the nucleus of future naval expenditure, if the Government should determine upon it .",57
427,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"A very small nucleus. Mr Bruce SMITH.*-The sum that we are able to appropriate for old-age pensions is also very small, but the honourable member will see that the same policy is at work in both cases. We are to have a sort, of money-box, and the Government wish to put their pennies into it in order that when the time comes to carry' out 'this policv, they may find it fairly full . I object to this sum of Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 being voted as an earnest to the British Government that we are in favour of the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister. This Parliament in 1903, passed a Bill establishing - a solemn compact between the British Government ancl Australia that a ten years' contribution of Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum should be made by us for certain - naval services. Although many honourable members are' under the impression that we do not get value for that expenditure, unless the ships of the Squadron are lying either in Sydney Harbor Or in Port Phillip, we know that the greatest naval authority in the world has declared that the naval base for the defence of Australia is the Indian Ocean, and not the Australian ports. We cannot cancel that agreement without the consent of the Imperial Government and of New Zealand. It may be that the British Government, in their desire to placate Australia, as one of its colonial possessions, may be perfectly willing to forego that agreement",58
428,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"We inserted in that agreement conditions which Great Britain has to fulfil , and if it be cancelled Great Britain will be released from observing those conditions.",58
429,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The corresponBut dence clearly shows that if we cease to rer cognise the undertaking into which we entered with the British naval authorities,' the . ships of war which are now constantly in, or in the neighbourhood of, Australia will be immediately removed to the Indian and China seas.",58
430,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Why ? and Mr Bruce SMITH - Because the British naval authorities have already announced-if the Minister had read Lord We Tweedmouth's speech he would be aware of the fact-that in the event of the agreement being cancelled, the ships will be removed to the China and Indian seas to become part of the British Fleet in those quarters.",58
431,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,Why would they be removed ?,58
432,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Because it would be better for the defence of the Empire to remove them to the localities I have indicated, in order that they may be in a position to carry out the doctrine enunciated by Nelson,. and acknowledged ever, since, that a navy should go outto meet the enemy rather than that they should be kept anchored in Australian ports. I object to this money .being regarded as an earnest of anvthing, until the defence scheme of the Government has been enunciated and approved by this House. . Although in the abstract honourable members may be in favour of an expenditure of Â£-250,000 for' naval purposes, the Go- vernment might bring down a scheme relating to naval construction which the House would wholly, condemn. For instance, instead of proposing to construct torpedo destroyers, or submarines, they might propose to build one huge battleship - a project which the House would regard ' as an utter absurdity unless it is to be a contribution to the British Navy. Therefore I contend that this Bill does not and must not be taken to commit us to any naval expenditure whatever. All that we are consenting to is the appropriation of Â£ 2 5 6 , 0 0 0 , which I contend ought to have been returned to the States.",58
433,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,For the States to squander it.,58
434,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"That may be the honourable member's opinion. We have had no defence scheme yet submitted to us. I do not think this vote is to be - used even to show the British people that' we endorse the statement of the Prime Minister that we desire the Naval Agreement to be either modified or ended - I echo the wish of the honourable member for Dalley, that our contribution to the Imperial Navy will not only be continued, but doubled. I cannot forget that when we entered into, that agreement in 1903-a n agreement which was to continue for ten years-onl y a small number of honourable membersapart from the members of the Labour Party-rvote d against it . There was a majority of sixteen or seventeen in its favour. ' Mr WH IRVINE - The honourable' member declared that he differed from and yet he is expressing exactly the same point that I urged.",58
435,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,And be is following people of Australia pretty closely upon the lines laid down in the speech of the Prime Minister. .,59
436,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The honourable member for Flinders declared that he. did not think we were justified-in pressing the production of the correspondence which has taken place between the British naval authorities and the Prime Minister in re-gard to this matter. As a general principle his statement is right. When a .Government is conducting diplomatic negotiations may be highly desirable that the corresponhave dence constituting those negotiations should not be made public, lest it might affect chance of negotiations having a - favourable termination. But where we have a Prime Minister conducting negotiations by correminated, spondence with the Imperial Government in regard to an agreement which was solintermittent emnly entered into by this Parliament, we have a perfect right-unles s the adoption of such a course is likely to interfere those negotiations-to know what he is re Minister. presenting to the Imperial authorities as wish of Australia and of this House. I Prime Minister continues to put forward opinion in a strong-, confident way-as had this House or the country at his backin favour of the termination of the Naval Agreement, we have a right to know it. there any likelihood that our knowledge the nature of that correspondence ,or publicity which would be given to it, would interfere with the chance of those negotiarow, tions terminating favourably? asked for the production of that corthe respondence again and again. ""Even up Naval Agreement.' to the time when the Prime Minister outlined the defence scheme of the Government, in December last, he had by, no means arrived at an undernot standing with the Imperial authorities upon this matter. Cables published subsequently show that the British naval authorities , regard the handing-over of an Australian flotilla to' the Commander-inChief, in time of war, as a condition precedent to any further arrangement between themselves and the ""Commonwealth. I contend that we ought to have that correspondence before us. The last correspondence about which we know anything took place prior to December, 1907. .We are now in June, 1908, and we are about to disperse for three months. We shall not re-assemble until September or October, so that nine me, months will then have elapsed, during ""which period all this correspondence, which is. morally binding upon us and upon the",59
437,Mr WH IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Oh , no. That is what we absolutely dispute.",59
438,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"There may be a difference of opinion as to the meaning for of the phrase "" morally binding,"" but I can only say that the representations which were made in London by the Prime Minister have certainly led the people of Great Britain-and even the British naval authorities-to believe that we are in favour ot it the views which he expressed. Not only we. done nothing to dispel that idea, but we have not been invited to do any-the thing or to take the opinion of the House upon the subject. Although months have elapsed since the Imperial Conference terwe have never yet had an opportunity-excep t by means of occasional and expressions of opinion-of telling the British naval authorities that there is any doubt about the truth or untruth of with the representations made by the Prime I do not agree . with the the honourable member for Flinders that the f the Government are justified in withholding any this correspondence. We, as representai f he tives of the people'; ought to know what statements the Prime Minister is making to the Imperial Government.

No courage is required to make statements in this Chamber, because fairly protected. I should not have spoken upon this Bill but for the fact that marks of some honourable members, in ference to the Naval Agreement, seem this wide of the mark. Everybody who hashad an opportunity of reading Hansard should know that the Prime Minister placed beBritish fore this .House a tabulated statement, which shows the contribution of Â£200,000 annually, under the Naval Agreement.

I agree with the following statement of the London Times., with which we are in general agreement on navalmattersThe idea - that in an Empire of 400,000,000 people, occupying 11,000,000 square miles of the cradle of sea-power rests excluin certain islands containing 44,000,000 people and measuring 122,000 square miles, is proposition that can easily be demonstrated.",60

452,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I have only to add that 1 the view taken is that fifty years hence the predominance of the British flag in distant seas is n5t conceivable unless, not only Australia, but the whole self-governing countries of the Empire begin at once to' lay the foundations of their future navies. we are Mr Bruce SMITH - The Times never spoke of abrogating the Naval Agreement. the re Mr EWING - I have already dealt with rethat matter. The Prime Minister values vote not only as one which will tend to augment locally the sea power of the Empire, but as a lead or example offered to every settlement in all parts of the world, just in the same way as Australia has given a lead in the direction of gradually training the whole population of the country for defence purposes.",60

454,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I regret to say that Mr. Haldane's scheme, so far, appears to bear out the view held by a large number of able men, that volunteer effort is hopeless. With regard to naval matters I am not now concerned so much with the question of control, but rather with the fact that the proposal before us will mean augthe British power afloat.

456,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Then I shall merely say boats for coastal defence. Lord Tweedmouth points to the great value to us and to Great Britain of having this part of the Empire thus protected in regard to the local trade. I admit to honourable members, who may differ from the Government in this matter, that there may be graver things to occupy the British Fleet during war than protecting the Australian ports and trade.",61

While I a disagree with the proviso which has been adin vocated, I still think that in voting this we ought to have in our minds I could, if it were necessary, quote manv conservative thinkers and conservative' newspapers, who support the view of the Labour Party in this connection. thought that a contribution to the British Navy would be a better plan than the expenditure of a like amount on our own navy",61

473,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I quite agree with the policy of the Prime Minister, in so far as it means giving an earnest' of what it is proposed to do in connection with our naval defence. Nothing worse can happen to a country, large or - small, rich or poor, than to have to lean on another country for its defence. If we are worthy of the name we bear, we shall not only vote the funds necessary for the construction of war vessels, but prepared to risk our lives in the defence of our country.",62
474,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,For the purposes of defence the whole Empire is one country. ' Mr FISHER - I admit it. But the various Possessions can support each other more effectively in the way I approve of than they could in the way of which the honourable member approves.,62
475,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Swan) [10.26]. - I came prepared to-night to speak fully on the question of naval defence, but was dissuaded from doing so by the Ministerial statement that the passing of the Bill would not commit us to any definite expenditure, and that before any money was spent we should have a full opportunity to discuss the subject gaierally. Therefore, what I am prepared to say can. be kept until a few months hence, when the matter comes up again, seeing that there is to be no expenditure in the interval. I was rather amused at the statement of the honourable member for Wide. Bay, that we are prepared to defend ourselves. This is the second time, that he has made it within a few days. What the Prime Minister proposes is merely the making of preparations for the defence of our harbors and coasts; our water-borne trade must still be protected by the Mother Country, and that defence will cost a great deal of money. The difference between the position of the honourable member for Wide Bay and my position is that, while I am, and always' have been, in favour of assisting the Mother Country to bear the burden of defending the Empire of which Australia is part, he wishes her to If 1 do so without our assistance, and, indeed, without even acknowledgement. His policy is a selfish one. He thinks only of our harbors and coasts, forgetting that our existence as a country depends on the power and strength of the British Navy. We should surely assist in providing the. defence extended to us by Great Britain. We should not desire to get it for nothing. The object of the proposed measure is to enable money to be taken from this year's revenue, and placed to a reserve fund, so that it shall not be returned to the States. I do not object to the appropriation, because that is legal; but I maintain now, as I did the other night, that to place this money to a trust fund is unconstitutional, and a grave breach of faith with the States. Parliament, however, has decided against the view I be hold, and the States are to be deprived of revenue which they would otherwise receive, and to which I believe they are legally entitled. To-night we are giving effect to that decision. The money to be appropriated is to be paid into a trust fund until its expenditure is authorized; but the mode of expenditure is not to be discussed until next session, or even later. Indeed,- the money may eventually be reappropriated by law to some quite different purpose. I think, however, that at the end of the financial yeafNwhen the States have an opportunifeyi^to test the validity of our legislation, the High Court will decide that what we have done is unconstitutional. It may be argued that if I vote for this measure, .knowing that the object of the appropriation-whic h in itself is perfectly legal-is to prevent the return of money fo the States, I shall be inconsistent. To guard myself against that charge, I again protest against the illegality of ""these unexpended moneys which it is proposed to place in a trust fund, being so placed. I do not wish to be understood to say that the Bill is illegal. We , can appropriate - what we like; my objection is to the placing of the money to a trust fund . Ira voting for the Bill, I in. 1 no way retract from the position 1 'took up when the Surplus Revenue Bill was under discussion.",62
476,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"If what is beingdone were proper, we could have no more legitimate object.",62
477,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"That is so. If the money proposed to be set aside could legally be dealt with in this way, I should be in favour of what is proposed. I believe in defending our harbors, ports, shores; but I wish it to be understood in voting for the Bill, I in no way approve of the unconstitutionalaction of the States of money legally due to them, namely, - the unexpended - balance of one-fourth of t'he Customs and' Excise reany way. venue expendable by the Commonwealth.",62

In my view, it is undesirable to appropriate this large of money at the close of the session and financial year, because it will dislocate the finances of the States. Had the Minister of Defence adhered to the declaration made some time ago by the Prime - Minister, and confirmed to-night by the Treasurer, I think that he would have found the Committee unanimously in favour of the proposed vote. But instead ofdoing so, he made a statement which has opened up a general discussion. I consider that our annual subsidy of Â£200,000 to the British Navy is a very paltry contribution, having regard to the benefits which we derive from it. Notwithstandingthe suggestion that our contribution to the naval defence of the Empire may be a contribution in kind, I distinctly hope that the Naval Agreement will be maintained as an earnest of our loyalty and a recognition of the power that is protecting us. Would it be possible for us to defend ourselves from a foreign invasion ?",63
493,The CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The honourable member, must not discuss the general question of defence.",64
494,Mr KNOX,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I shall not do so. Whilst not prepared to vote against the Government in respect to this vote, believing that, in view of the passing of the Surplus Revenue Bill, the Committee will be entirely in favour of it, I want it to be clearly understood that I do not commit myself to ""the Government scheme, the details of which will have to be considered later on. The Minister, by.his remarks, gave rise to an interjection by the honourable member for. South Sydney, which introduced into the debate an element that I deeply regret. We are practically proposing to-night to ear-mark a sum of Â£250,000 for use in connection with a scheme which is to be brought before us later on, and if that' scheme be not adopted this proposed appropriation will lapse. My desire is that the vote shall not be applied with a view-to diminishing the contribution that we make to the British Navy. I shall always consider that that contribution is a very moderate one, having regard to the great services rendered to us by the British Fleet.  ject to our embarking upon an undertaking without any knowledge of what it is going to cost, or where it will lead us. We are setting out to-night on a dangerous course, which I feel confident will land the Commonwealth, in the near future, in an enormous expenditure. One might imagine, from the tenor of some of the speeches delivered during this debate, that the Japanese were at our doors, and that. we were doing nothing for the defence of our country. As a matter of fact, however, our defence bill is far greater than is that of Canada. Whereas our defence expenditure to-dav is equal to 5s. per head of our population, that of Canada is equivalent to only 2s. 6d. per head of her population. I am no more unpatriotic than is the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, yet I have strong objections to the Naval Agreement. The commerce of Canada enjoys the protection of the British Fleet just as does that of Australia, yet she contributes nothing to the Imperial Navy. But no one suggests that Canada is disloyal.to the Empire ",64
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"But Canada spends as much as we do on defence.  of Federation, we were spending upon defence, a sum equal to 4s. per head of our population, as against a defence expenditure by Canada equal to 2s. per head of her population.",64
496,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Accordin g to the Budget papers, we are still expending on defence a sum equal to 4s - or , to be exact, 3s. n j d . - pe r head of our population.  penditure on defence is equal to about 5s. per head of our population. As soon as a newspaper article suggesting that we are threatened with a Japanese invasionis published, something in the nature of a panic takes place, and there is a wild cry for increased expenditure on defence. In 1903 the honourable member for South Sydney took credit to himself for cutting down the Defence Estimates. - Mr WATSON - Because the money was being wasted..  country immediately afterwards and the Labour Party scored in every direction, the people upholding its action in cutting down the defence vote.",64
497,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,In preventing it from being wasted.,64
498,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"The honourable member' for South Sydney was successful in cutting down the Defence Estimates by Â£60,000 after the Committee, on the motion of. Sir Edward Braddon, had cut them down by Â£i6ojooo.",64
499,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"And he was always for cutting them down in New South Wales.  stances did we pass the Naval Agreement Bill? We went to a division with, so to speak, a pistol at our heads. The then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, told us that when in England he made a solemn promise that such a subsidy would be granted, and it was because of that mise that the Bill was passed. I may be wrong, but I do not think Australia has anything to fear from the Japanese. For many years to come Japan will have her hands full. I cannot forget the lessons of the South African war. It cost Great Britain over Â£220,000,000 to conquer a handful of people in South Africa, and it has been said by undoubted authorities that no other power could have done what Great Britain did, in transporting so large a force there. If a foreign power attempted to invade Australia, I am sure that we should put up a record equal to that of Britishers in any other part of the world. We are asked to-night to embark upon a costly undertaking, and I regret that the Committee should be prepared to agree to this vote with no knowledge of what the Government scheme will be. We are called upon to vote blindly upon this question, and to agree to the initiatioif a scheme which may cause the people of the future to curse us. I wish to place on record my objection to this vote. - Mr HENRY WILLIS (Robertson) Â£10.52] - I approve of this appropriation of Â£250,000 being made for the defence of the Australian coast. The scheme to be propounded by the Government will have to be considered by this House, and we shall have later on an opportunity to discuss it. I certainly am in favour of our obtaining submarines and submersibles for coastal defence purposes. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has said that we need not fear invasion, and has suggested that if an enemy's fleet set out for Australia it would be intercepted and destroyed. When I was a boy a Russian fleet reached Australian waters unheralded and anchored off Glenelg, ih St. Vincent's Gulf, before any one was aware of its presence on the coast. Sir Henry Parkes, referring later on to the Russian 'war scare, said that he had information that the Russians at that time had designs upon Australia. Whilst I am in favour of this proposed appropriation as an earnest of oiir intention to provide for the defence of our coast, I certainly am not in favour of our withdrawing from the Naval Agreement under which we contribute Â£200,000 per annum to the upkeep of the British Navy. When the Naval Agreement Bill was introduced by. Sir Edmund Barton, he said that he had been asked by the Imperial authorities to invite Parliament to grant an annual subsidy of pro- Â£500,000, and I was bold enough to remark that I was satisfied that my constituents would support me in voting for such a subsidy. The British Navy is the chief arm of our defence. No Power can swoop down,upon us. But even if the vessels of a hostile force succeeded in raiding us, it is questionable whether they would be able to get away with the spoil, because the British Fleet, having command of the sea, would probably intercept them before they had gone very far. Having read the discussions upon this proposal which took place in England, I see no objection to the appropriation of the Â£250,000 provided for in this Bill, seeing that it is to be devoted to coastal defence. But I hold myself entirely free to oppose the Government's scheme of defence if it does not embody what I conceive to be the best policy for Australia. of The honourable member for South Sydney stated, by way of interjection, that in voting for this appropriation, honourable members would be tacitly admitting that there should be a dual control in the matter of the naval defence of Australia. I say that I . am opposed to any such control. The Admiral of the British Fleet should have full control over the vessels provided by Australia.",64
500,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"South Sydney) [10.58]. - The honourable member for Grey referred in terms of surprise to the fact that I intend supporting this Bill, and that I am in favour of - an Australian-owned Navywhich, by the way, is a plank of the Labour Party's policy that I am astonished to see the honourable member opposing-not withstanding that I assisted to cut down, the military Estimates some years ago. The honourable member, as well as the honourable member for Parkes and others who interjected, might have done me the justice of stating that when I moved for a reduction of those Estimates in 1902, I offered, on behalf of the party which I'represented, to vote an additional expenditure of Â£500,000 for the purpose of providing necessary arms and equipment. The point to which I took exception was that we were spending an enormous sum of money on training, without making adequate provision in the matter of. arms, munitions of war, and equipment generally. I still take the same view. I submit that it is more important that we should have a gun to put into a consummation. man's hand than that we should have a trained man without a gun. Whilst the the money? honourable member for Parkes was speaking, I interjected that I was in favour of perial Australian control of an Australian Navy. ships that From my own stand-point, the attitude of those who say that we should be dependent upon the Empire for the defence of Ausgood service. tralia, is a most unworthy one.

Surely Australia has reached a stage at which she should have sufficient pride to attempt her own defence, and to put forth efforts-shoul d the occasion arise-to relieve the Empire of any anxiety upon her behalf. For the Commonwealth to rely upon others to defend it is contemptible. cerned. Our plain duty is to make provision for Australian defence without relying upon concerned. anybody else. Consequently, I arri in favour of the establishment, at the earliest possible moment, of an Australian-owned and Australian-built Navy. .But in time of war, the control of our vessels must a unified control. We could not hope obtain any effective result if fleets are supposed to assist one another were under separate and independent commands.

512,Mr HANS IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"But the honourable member speaks as a prominent member of the Labour"" Party, who are dominating this Government. I wish to refer - briefly to the remarks made on this subject in England by Lord Tweedmouth. He said I understand that Australia puts forward a proposal that the scheme of 1902 should be ended, and that Australia should start something in the way of a local defence force. The Prime Minister cf Australia said, in his reply to Lord Tweedmouth, that the views of the Federal Government had already been put on record in a despatch which he had sent to the Admiralty, and that the existing system of contribution was not generally popular. I , however, say distinctly that the present system has been popular, and that the people of Australia do not desire a change. The Prime Minister further saidFurther consideration has convinced the public that the present agreement is not satisfactory either to the Admiralty, the political Lords of the Admiralty, or to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. That is definite enough, but I still say that' the people of Australia do not approve of the Prime Minister's views on this question. The honourable member for South Sydney argues that what it is proposed to do will form the nucleus of an Australian Navy. I quite admit that we must form the nucleus of a Navy at some time. But we must not try to run before we can walk. To talk of a handful of people not more than 4,500,000 in number establishing a Navy is nonsense. We have developed under the protection of the British Navy. Without the protection of the British flag today, what would be our position as a nation? What should we do with our commerce? What would 'our primary producers do? We could never be successful, and Australia could never develop. It is the security that we get from the protection of Great Britain which makes us a prosperous and progressive people. It would in my opinion be far better for us to double the present subsidy than t'o think of establishing a Navy of our own at present. I am satisfied that the views which I am expressing are those which are entertained by the majority of the people of this country. It is all very well for honourable .members opposite who represent city constituencies to speak . so confidently upon this subject. But the country districts also have an interest in the matter, and their - views must be respected. It will be time - enough fo talk about establishing a Navy of our own when we have 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 people in this country. But - we cannot do it at this stage. We need to devote all our energies to attracting - population.",67
513,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Nobod y talks like that when he thinks of establishing a new business. He never says, "" This is not the time to do such a thing.""",67
514,Mr HANS IRVINE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"I do not suppose that the honourable member knows very much about establishing businesses, or he would be aware that that is exactly how a business man does talk. There must, of course, be a beginning for everything, but we are not in a position to make a beginning with an Australian Navy at present. I am sure that the bargain made with the Admiralty some years ago would be endorsed by at least 70 per cent, of-the people of Australia, and they would rather see the subsidy doubled than the agreement' broken.'",67
515,Mr SPENCE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Darling) [11.14] - I hope that the people of Australia do not hold the views expressed by the last speaker. I should be very much ashamed of them if they did. They would place themselves before the world as a helpless crowd of people who felt unable to do anything to protect themselves. The people of this country do not adopt the view that we must for all time "" depend upon mother."" It is a hopeless policy t'o say that we must do nothing to protect ourselves upon the sea until we have a population of 10,000,000 or 20,000,000. Are we to erect notices asking the peqple. of other countries-not'to attack us until we get a population of 20,000,000? That is the silliest idea that I ever heard of. Countries likely to attack us will not wait until we' are ready. But .according to the honourable member for Grampians we should not begin our preparations until we have a population of io,poo,ooo or 20,000,000. The Australians have no reason to be ashamed of their efforts in the past. Those who have visited the Commonwealth have been astonished at what we have been .able to do. As for our being only 4,000,000 persons, it must be remembered that on many occasions a much smaller number has given the Old Country more trouble than she has been able to cope with. United States of America made themselves independent of her at a time when their population was much smaller than ours.

519,Mr SPENCE,PARLIAMENTARYWITNESSES,"Tasmania' s communication with the mainland depends upon the shipping, so that surely the honourable member can see the advantages of protecting our harbors, if only as places of refuge. Hobson's Bay itself could probably shelter the greater part of our ' shipping, if the port were strongly enough defended to keep at bay, not perhaps a fleet of battleships, but such vessels as might be sent here to take advantage of the absence of the British Navy. . The Mother Country has not offered to do this work for us, nor have we asked her to provide submarines and torpedo destroyers forharbor and coastal defence. Every civilized nation has today a naval policy. No nation says, "" Let us, before building more battle-ships, wait until our population grows.""

A ll the big nations of Europe have warchests, and we should' establish a war chest to which we should - contribute something each year. When the Russians commenced their war with Japan they had something like Â£90,000,000 in gold in their war chest. If we got into trouble tomorrow there would not be a single shilling in our war chest. We are quite unprepared. The Naval Agreement is to continue in force for another five years, and I do not suppose that anybody desires to repudiate the contract we haveentered into. But it is important to remember that at the end of. the ten years we shall be as unprepared as we are at present, if we do not make a start in the direction suggested by the Government. I think that the Government are to be commended' in this matter. We should do somethingat least to place our coastal-defences in a reasonable condition of efficiency. We havethree or four large cities on our coast .line which must be defended, and it is possible to defend them by the use of submarines and the smaller class of war boats. vostock was defended in this way, and was held for a very long time by the Russians against the very powerful Japanese fleet. At present it is, of course, us to think of building a big navy, but every country must make a start, and we should do so. It is of no use to say - we must always f all back upon the Mother Country.

The Audit Act gives the the Treasurer power to establish trust accounts. Those who favour this money being appropriated and placed to a trust account contend that the power - of appropriation for purpose rests in this House. But there is no necessity to provide in the Bill that the money shall go to a trust account. If e the money is appropriated, the Treasurer can, under the authority .of the Audit Act, place it to a trust account.",70

I submit that this Bill is doing two things, one of which is not necessary. All we have to do is to appropriate the money. It is for the Government to place it to a trust account if they think it desirable. My opinion is .that w.e acting ultra vires all through, but a appromajority of this House do not agree with of the me. Although it will not do much harm to provide that the money shall go to the huntrust account, those words are surplusage, and and do not, make the money more secure. The Treasurer has the power to divert into o trust accounts moneys which have been ap.was propriated for the purposes of-those accounts. If there was nothing in the Conprostitution to prevent it, that would be the course pursued with this money, but I submit that there are provisions in. the Consti : tution which prevent this sort of thing being done, although I should be out of order in arguing the question, as the Surplus Revenue Bill has been passed.",70
