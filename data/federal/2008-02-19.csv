1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 2 pm and read prayers. NA,17
2,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Health and Ageing will be absent from question time today. The Minister for Ageing will be answering questions on her behalf. NA,17
3,Mr RUDD,QUEENSLAND FLOODS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, on behalf of the government I want to extend our thoughts to the victims of the severe flooding that commenced in Mackay on 14 February. The Bureau of Meteorology has reported that that was the biggest rainfall in 90 years-624 millimetres of rain fell in just 10 hours. The joint state-Commonwealth natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements were activated on the weekend. That has made it possible for local residents, business, primary producers and councils to access a range of assistance measures, including personal hardship grants, concessional loans, freight subsidies and cost recovery for restoring certain assets. On Saturday, the Minister for Human Services, Senator Ludwig, toured the areas affected with the Queensland Premier to survey the extent of the damage first hand. As I announced on Sunday, in addition to the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the government has decided that the Australian government disaster recovery payment, the AGDRP, will be made available to those people adversely affected by the storms and associated flooding. The Australian government disaster recovery payment will provide financial assistance to people whose principal place of residence has been destroyed or significantly damaged and to those who have been seriously injured and hospitalised for more than 48 hours as a direct result of the floods. Those eligible will be able to receive a one-off payment of $1,000 for adults and $400 for each child to help relieve their hardship. In addition, the Minister for Human Services announced that the so-called drought bus, a mobile Centrelink office and communications centre, will arrive in Mackay on Thursday and will be there for one week to help residents to access their entitlements. There will be much work to do over the coming weeks to help these communities to fully recover. The federal government will do its bit to help families, small businesses and local communities get back on their feet as soon as possible. This has been a kick in the guts for the people of Mackay. It was a huge flood, and with very little warning. People in Mackay have coped remarkably well in the circumstances. They are a robust, resilient community. They will bounce back, but we intend to do whatever we can to provide assistance on small the way through. The member for Dawson, James Bidgood, is now in Mackay assisting in ensuring that assistance which is promised by government is actually reaching those who need it most.",17
4,Dr NELSON,QUEENSLAND FLOODS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I rise to support strongly the remarks of the Prime Minister in relation to the floods in Mackay. For people there to have 600 millimetres of rain in a six-hour period is nothing short of extraordinary, as well as winds of 90 kilometres an hour. To see families with their belongings, at least what is left of them, on their front lawns and all of the tragedy which has beset them in a material and emotional sense would move every Australian to support all initiatives by the Queensland and Australian governments to support these families. I urge all Australians to give generously the Premier's appeal. I think Queensland Premier Bligh has done a very good job in supporting those communities in Mackay and, more recently, in Emerald and Charleville, which have also been affected by flood. I urge all Australians to add to the $1 million sioner. which is now in that fund. Two thousand homes and more than 100 businesses have been affected and/or damaged or destroyed. In a community like Mackay that is nothing short of devastating. I support any initiatives the Australian government has taken, which I know includes a $1,000 payment for families and $400 for children, and all of the other initiatives will be necessary. Our thoughts are very much with the people of Mackay.",17
5,Mr LINDSAY,QUEENSLAND FLOODS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, this rainfall event has also impacted on other areas in North Queensland, albeit fewer homes were affected. I trust the same disaster relief arrangements that the Prime Minister has announced today will also apply to those homes affected in Airlie Beach, in the Burdekin and in Townsville. NA Fuel Prices",18
6,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of comments of the newly-appointed petrol commissioner, who said on Channel 9's Today show: ‘I haven't promised them significant savings. I think it is a naive tion that petrol is going to dramatically reduce'? Treasurer, will the appointment of the petrol commissioner reduce the price of petrol and, if so, when and by how much?",18
7,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I am not aware of the comments of the petrol commissioner, but I tell you what: I am very pleased that he has been appointed. Everybody on this side of the House wants a to petrol cop on the beat in the ACCC full-time. This side of the House is committed to competitive markets. Competitive markets are very important at a time when prices are on the rise, which is why we made the commitment to the appointment of a petrol commisWe had to shame the opposition when they were in government into doing something in this area at all. We eventually forced them to have an inquiry. That was a good thing. The problem was that they did not do anything. But within 10 weeks we have put in place a petrol commissioner. Our objective is to put the pressure on the petrol comthat panies to ensure that motorists do not pay one cent more than they have to, one cent more than is fair. That is the commitment that the Rudd government made to the Australian people. And we have gone further. We have put in place the grocery inquiry, something those opposite could not do in 11 long years, something those opposite could never do. So on this side of the House we are absolutely determined to protect working families. We understand",18
8,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to relevance. The question is by how much does he expect the price of petrol to come down and when. From his answer, is he saying it is 1c?",18
9,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Points of order should not stray into disguised supplementaries. The no- Treasurer will return his response to the question.,18
10,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Rudd government is determined to ensure that consumers get value for money. Those opposite had 11 long years to take action. Did they do anything? They did nothing. You are going to see this government very active in this area of competition policy to ensure that Australians get the best value for money, whether it is at the petrol bowser or in the supermarket. Economy",18
11,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister update the House on the challenges confronting the Australian economy and the government's response?,19
12,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Franklin for her question. Australia faces a range of economic challenges at present, challenges which come from abroad and challenges which are being generated domestically. From abroad we see corrections to growth projections across many of the developed economies in the world, coming out of in part the subprime crisis in the United States-revision downwards in growth for the American economy, those in Europe and those in Japan. But on the domestic front we also face a serious economic challenge arising from inflationary pressures in the economy. At the time the government took office at the end of last year, inflation in this country was running at its highest rate in 16 years. It did not get there overnight. Further on the inflation front, this morning the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Malcolm Edey, highlighted the risk in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development in Australia. In that speech Mr Edey stated that for the Australian economy ‘the main domestic challenges are those of strong demand, tight capacity and inflationary pressures'. Mr Edey added the warning that the consumer price index's annual figure ‘could spike to something close to four per cent next quarter'. The threat of rising inflation, as I said before, has not arisen overnight. We have seen the emergence of data on rising inflationary pressures in the economy over some years now. The Reserve Bank Statement on monetary policy most recently projected ahead that this economy was in the likelihood of receiving inflation outcomes in 2008, 2009 and through to mid-2010 which would be at or above the projected Reserve Bank upper range of three per cent. These mean that the government and the nation must act in concert in the fight against inflation. We, the government, are the first to concede that inflation cannot be controlled by all factors which lie within domestic policy. You have massive boosts to the terms of trade. That has an effect in terms of the amount of consumption which then flows around in the domestic Australian economy. Another causative factor of these inflationary pressures is what is happening with the drought in recent times. But there are factors which are within the range of government policy, and they go to what we can do on the question of public demand, what we can do through budget policy, what we can do when it comes to boosting private savings, what we can do when it comes to inflation and what we can do when it comes to infrastructure as well as skills and participation in the economy. That is why the government has articulated a clearcut strategy in its fight against inflation. Our five-point plan deals with, one, what do we do with the overall projection for the budget surplus; two, what do we do to boost private savings; three and four, what can we do to boost skills and infrastructure; and, five, increasing our overall workforce participation rate. This is a clear-cut plan for the future and is necessary if we are to confront the challenge of inflation. Part of the participation challenge lies with what we do in industrial relations to ensure that we have a flexible system which is both fair for working people and flexible for employers. That is why we believe in having an industrial relations system which gets the balance right, an industrial relations system which says to working families, ‘Here is a fair outcome for working families,' and says to employers, ‘Here are a flexible set of arrangements which enable you to build your businesses into the future,' and overall to enhance participation in the economy and long-term productivity growth. We know on this side of the House where we stand on industrial relations. Our position on industrial relations has been rock solid throughout the year leading up to the 2007 election. Everyone knows what we stood for. We would abolish Work Choices; we would abolish AWAs. We have not seen so far parallel parity from those opposite. In fact, what we have seen from those opposite is an evolution of positions. We had the opposition leader telling us just after the election that Work Choices was dead. Then straight afterwards they unleashed the Senate to try and give Work Choices some mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, bring it back to life and make sure that our legislation in the Senate would be frustrated to the greatest extent possible. Now we have the third iteration, the third evolution, coming out of the party room today. As of today, Tuesday, I think Work Choices is off again. I think it has gone again, but I am not altogether clear and I would like some clarification from those opposite. We have had flip, flop and flap when it comes to the whole question of Work Choices and the future of AWAs. I gather we are up to the flap stage but I am all ears to hear what the current status of Liberal Party policy is formally on Work Choices and AWAs for the future. If the Liberal Party is returned to office the future, and whichever group within the Liberal Party happens to have assumed dominance by that stage, where will their industrial relations policy stand at that I know that the Leader of the Opposition's chief of staff is gung-ho on this stuff; he comes from ACCI. I know that a whole lot of people are gung-ho on this stuff. So, once they get the chance, as happened before the 2004 election, whatever is said before the election, we know one thing for certain: what they say before the election they will turn turtle on after the election. We have got flip, flop, flap now on Work Choices. If they return to office, the guarantee is that we will have another extreme, hardline approach to industrial relations, because the party opposite has lost its way and lost touch altogether with working families. Economy",19
13,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer and again concerns the relationship between inflation and jobs. Is the Treasurer aware that, over the last five years, the unemployment rate in Queensland has fallen from seven to 3.4 per cent and in Western Australia from 6.1 to 3.3 per cent, compared to very much lower declines elsewhere, including in New South Wales and Victoria? Given that the exportdriven mining industry in Western Australia and Queensland is not likely to be materially affected by domestic interest rate rises, how will you ensure that your fight against inflation will not have a very uneven impact, with a heavy cost in jobs outside of Queensland and Western Australia?",20
14,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for his question because it is true-it is absolutely true-that the participation rate in Queensland and Western Australia has increased substantially. The participation rate has increased and the unemployment rate has gone down-and isn't it a fantastic thing that the in participation rate in Queensland and Western Australia has upped substantially and that unemployment is down? And one of the reasons why this has occurred is that people point? have gone back into the workforce.,20
15,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
16,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely-people in those states have gone back into the workforce, and what that has done is enhance the labour supply in those states, and that is very good for a lot of people. There are members all around here who will have older women or older men in their electorates who are back in the workforce for the first time in a long time because the participation rate has increased in those states. At the very core of our plan to lift productivity in this economy, to combat inflation, is to lift workforce ticipation. That is one of the reasons why we are so supportive of the income-tax cuts which we have argued for for a long period of time, because people on modest wages do deserve some incentive. Particularly when it comes to second-income earners, we have to design an income taxation system and a transfer system which gives them incentives when they go back to work. So not only is it older workersMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Treasurer a very important question about the differential impact of anti-inflation measures across Australia. He has not responded to that at all. He has not addressed it at all.",21
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will resume his seat. The Treasurer has the call.,21
18,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday, the shadow Treasurer wanted to engage in some sort of arid debate about NAIRU. And what we have today is a repeat of the stupidity of terday from the shadow Treasurer. This is what the former governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Macfarlane, had to say about what the shadow Treasurer was saying yesterday",21
19,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
20,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Listen for a second. Let's just listen to what the former Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say about the proposition that was put by the shadow Treasurer yesterday. He said: I do not think it is a particularly useful construct. I do not think I have ever heard it mentioned in the Reserve Bank boardroom. The NAIRU has never been mentioned in the Reserve Bank boardroom. And there is a reason for that: it is not used in practical economics. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. He is now par- endeavouring to answer the question he could not answer yesterday. He's got to answer the question I asked today.",21
21,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
22,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In giving the Treasurer the call I would remind him that he should be responding to today's question.,21
23,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting of order. We at the back here are having great difficulty in hearing the answer from the Treasurer.,21
24,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I'm at the front and I'm having difficulty. The House will come to order.,21
26,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reforms that are required to ensure that we have strong growth across the whole of this country, but most particularly in Western Australia and Queensland, are precisely the reforms that go to the core of the Rudd government's five-point yesplan. And it has been the complacency of those opposite over a long period of time, when it came to investment in skills, when it came to their failure to deal with infrastructure bottlenecks, that has put upward pressure on inflation and made it harder in all states of Australia, but most particularly in those states, to have strong growth with low inflation. So the answer to the question is a very simple one: put in place a raft of lift productivity, lift economic growth and put downward pressure on inflation. And that is what our reform of federal-state relations is all about. That is what the Deputy Prime Minister is talking about when she is talking about investing in skills. That is what the minister for infrastructure is talking about: things that those opposite could not do for 11 long years. So if you cannot be part of the solution, you certainly will never ever be fit to govern this country. Workplace Relations",21
27,Mr CLARE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister detail the waste and excessive promotional material associated with previous government policies? What steps are being taken to recycle that material?,22
28,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday the Prime Minister and I sought to ensure the destruction of the remaining Work Choices propaganda of the Howard-Costello government. We arranged for the recycling of 436,000 Work Choices booklets. We made sure that they were taken off to the recyclers so that they could be turned into things more useful-things like scribble paper for children. There were some suggestions from the media about other uses that these paper products could be put to, but I will not go there. But we did ensure that these booklets would be recycled. Of course, this was part of the $121 million propaganda blitz of the HowardCostello government to try and sell its grossly unfair Work Choices laws, which stripped basic working conditions away from Australian families. We know that even that government thought it was best to start shredding these booklets, because 3½ million of them were in fact sent off to the recyclers before the election. The waste of taxpayers' reforms that money was just amazing. I have to say that I allowed myself to believe yesterday that the Prime Minister and I had brought an end to the scourge of Work Choices propaganda in this country, just as we are committed to bringing an end to the scourge of Work Choices itself. I had allowed myself to believe yesterday that we had achieved that goal, but overnight I have discovered more. Whilst the Four Corners program was exhibiting Liberal rats in the ranks, I found 100,000 Work Choices propaganda mousepads lying around from the days of the Howard-Costello government. I am going to ask the House to help me with a very difficult issue here, which is this: one can easily recycle booklets; it is less clear what one can do to recycle mousepads. What I am committed to doing",22
29,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is this: to assist her in this matter, she can send them out with her free computers.",22
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor knows that that was not a point of order. A point of order is not an invitation for competing in comedy hour with the chair.,22
31,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I reassure you that it is not my intention to scare small children through that distribution of these mousepads. They would obviously be very worried about their parents' working conditions if this turned up at their school. I do have a dilemma, which is what to do with these 100,000 mousepads. It is my intention to send them to the supporters of Work Choices, so there are 65 on their way to the opposition members in the House of Representatives and there are 38 on their way to the opposition senators. Now I have 99,897 left and I cannot find another Work Choices supporter to send them to. If anybody has any suggestions about what to do with the remainder of the 100,000 mousepads, I would be very grateful to receive them. In sending these mousepads to the opposition today, I do not know if I have made an error, because I watched the press conference of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition at lunchtime today. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Yesterday you raised the issue of using props in the chamber. Again the Deputy Prime Minister is using props. Unless she wants to play second row, I would ask her to put the props away.",22
32,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister.,23
33,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not sure whether I have sent the Work Choices mousepads to the right people. I watched the press conference of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today. I have to say that I listened carefully but, having listened to that press conference, I have no idea what on earth is going on. This is the same Deputy Leader of the Opposition who said that she was going to defend AWAs with a no-disadvantage test to the death. She was reported in the newspaper in quotes as saying that she would not be ‘complicit in a downturn'Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I should not be misquoted by the Deputy Prime Minister. If she wishes to quote where I said that I will defend the right of employees and employers to enter into individual agreements",23
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition feels aggrieved by misquotes, she has other forms of the House that she can use. I say to the Deputy Prime Minister that she is verging on debating the answer.",23
35,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, I read the newspaper reports and some of our friends upstairs have them. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a specific question in relation to the marketing of Work Choices. The Deputy Prime Minister was not asked about alternative views and I ask you to bring her back to the question that she was asked. If she cannot answer her own questions, we are happy to take over.",23
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Based on the five words that were uttered since the previous interruption, it was a bit hard for me to know where the response was going. The Deputy Prime Minister knows that she is required to be relevant.",23
37,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of marketing Work Choices, of course, Work Choices was the policy of the HowardCostello government. We need to ask, ‘Who is it the policy of now?' We know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wanted AWAs with a no-disadvantage test. Now she does not know whether she is going to amend the bill, whether she is not going to amend the bill, whether she is going to amend it in the Senate, whether she is not going to amend it in the Senate",23
38,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will resume her seat. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,23
39,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjecting Ms Julie Bishop-It's horrible, isn't it?",23
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister was asked about the marketing of brochures including mousepads; she was not asked about any alternative views. That was not part of the question, and I would ask you to bring her back to the question and adhere to the requirement of relevance.",23
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will bring her answer to a close.,24
42,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Work Choices is horrible and you are in a horrible mess. Yes, that is absolutely true.",24
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister is not assisting.,24
44,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of the mousepads, can I say this: we are now in a situation where we do not know whether you stand behind this propaganda or the policy that led to it, but what we suspect is that",24
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will resume her seat. Economy,24
46,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Is the minister aware of this morning's speech by Reserve Bank Assistant Governor Malcolm Edey, in which he projects GDP growth to December 2008 of 3¼ per cent but, excluding both the farming and mining sectors, of only 2½ per cent, compared to 4¼ per cent in December 2007? What is the government's plan to ensure that its claimed inflation-fighting proposed budget cuts will not further reduce growth and jobs in those sectors of the economy side mining?",24
47,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would appear that the member for Wentworth does not understand the reason why there is a need to crack down on government spending. On top of the figures he has quoted, I will add another one: government spending is currently running at a 4½ per cent real increase in the current nancial year, well ahead of the growth projections-either of the growth projections that he quoted-in the economy. That is what we inherited from the previous government. We inherited a situation where inflation is beyond the Reserve Bank's target band. It is at 3.6 per cent underlying. We inherited a situation where we had five interest rate increases in the previous six months, and we inherited a situation where government spending is running out of control. The primary commitment of this government is to ensure that government spending gets into an area that will ensure that we put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Let me remind the member for Wentworth that, if he talks to business, the one thing they will tell him they do not want is inflation to take off in this country. The one thing that business in the mineral sector and in other sectors of the economy that are so crucial to the future of this nation do not want is inflation to take off, because that erodes savings, it erodes productivity and, most importantly of all, contrary to the commentary from the Leader of the Opposition a couple of weeks ago, higher inflation means higher interest rates. It means higher interest rates for homebuyers and it means higher interest rates for businesses. So that is why the government is committed to getting government spending under control. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. There seems to be a contagion on the government benches of inout- ability to address the questions asked.",24
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is relevant. The minister will return to his response.,24
49,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question I was asked was about growth projections and the significance for sectors of the economy that are particularly important to the future of the fiAustralian economy, especially the mining sector, and how this connected with the government's economic policy. What I am trying to explain to the member for Wentworth, who amazingly was described the other day by a journalist as one of the more numerate members of this House, is that the critical commitment of this government is to get under control the inflation problem that was left by the former government, and that means getting government spending under control. It means getting rid of the sort of nonsense that we inherited, some of which we cut out of the budget a couple of weeks ago and more of which we are going to cut out. It means cutting government advertising. It means getting rid of the regional rorts. It means getting rid of the plethora of spending programs, all of which were contributing to a pattern of increased government spending, 4½ per cent in real termsMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Again, it was a specific question about the impact of budget cuts on the nonmining sector of the economy. It is very important-unless these guys are going to club the economy to death.",24
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply say to the member for North Sydney that the minister is being relevant to the totality of the question. In the point of order, the member is raising points that are in the introduction to the question, but certainly he loses the chair when he uses a point of order to argue a point, as he did at the end. The minister has the call and will respond to the question.",25
51,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude on this point. The opposition has a fundamental question that they have to ask themselves, and that is this: do you think there is a lem? Do you think there is a problem with government spending in this country? Do you accept that it is running too fast and it needs to be brought back under control? And do you believe that programs like, for example, the $3 million that had been earmarked for the fishing hall of fame are fundamental to the economic future of this country, or would you like to relieve the tax and interest rate burden on ordinary working people in this country? That is the fundamental question that you need to ask yourselves, because at this point we do not know. The member for Wentworth has told us that the inflation problem is a fairytale. The opposition leader has said that the government has taken over an economy in first-rate condition. So the question you need to answer is: is there a problem with inflation in this country, or do you think it is a fairytale? Reserve Bank of Australia",25
52,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the benefits of the measures the government and the Reserve Bank have introduced to strengthen the RBA's independence and to better communicate the reasons for its decisions?,25
53,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question, because it is a very important one. Today the Reserve Bank released minutes of its February meeting, and this was a first. I do not intend to give a running commentary on Reserve Bank board minutes and their publication, but I would certainly like to welcome their publication and the increased transparency in the conduct of monetary policy. These minutes will help working families better understand the reasons behind interest rate movements. Within weeks of the election of the Rudd government, the governor and I issued a joint statement on the conduct of monetary policy probin which we committed to a number of governance reforms that enhance the independence and transparency of the Reserve Bank. that The statement delivers on the Rudd government's election commitment to strengthen the independence of the Reserve Bank and to enhance the transparency of its decisions. Firstly, and this is the very important one, we increased the statutory independence of the positions of the governor and the deputy governor so that termination would require parliamentary approval. Secondly, we agreed to make future Reserve Bank board appointments from a register of candidates of the highest integrity. This was to ensure we did not see a repeat of the Gerard affair. Strengthening the independence of the RBA is a critical part of the government's commitment to putting downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. The Rudd government has a fivepoint plan to fight inflation and will ensure the government is working with the Reserve Bank and not against it. Taxation",25
54,Mr ROBERT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer stand by his election commitment to ensure that tax does not increase as a proportion of GDP? Isn't it the case that this commitment will be broken by the more recent announcement that the government will hoard future increases in revenue?,26
55,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. In our five-point plan to combat inflation, to tackle the inflationary pressures in the Australian economy, we made it very, very clear that we would allow the automatic stabilisers to work. It is very important that we put in place a fiscal policy that backs up the monetary policy which is put together by an independent Reserve Bank board. And because, as the Minister for Finance and Deregulation was saying, spending has been out of control, we have got to bring it back into control. We have had the fastest increase in spending in the past four-year period out of any four-year period in the past 15 years. That expansion of Commonwealth demand simply has to be brought under control. That is why we have said that we will set an objective of a surplus of at least 1.5 per cent GDP in our next budget. Mr Anthony Smith-They are all going pale again, Wayne.",26
56,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Casey!,26
57,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Commonwealth will provide the leadership that those opposite could not provide in recent years. Mr Anthony Smith-What about the percentage of GDP?,26
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Casey!,26
59,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was interesting watching the ABC last night. The ABC last night showed in all its glory the disunity in the coalitionMr Dutton-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker: relevance. This is his best answer yet; it is just an answer to the wrong question.",26
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume his seat.,26
61,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,26
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right are not assisting. I call the Treasurer.,26
63,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will pursue our objective of having a surplus, as a percentage of GDP, of at least 1.5 per cent. We will provide the leadership to restrain the spending that those opposite could not restrain. Of course, the former Treasurer is on the record, in the Howard biography, complaining that the previous Prime Minister, in 2004, went on a reckless spending spree-a reckless spending spree that put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. The consequence of that has been seven interest rate rises in the last three years. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It relates to relevance. It was a very specific question about tax as a proportion of GDP and whether the Treasurer stood of by his previous commitments-a very specific question.",26

68,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. What impact have Australian workplace agreements had on hard working Australians?,27
69,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. There appears to be some confusion amongst some members of the House about the impact of Australian workplace agreements and Work Choices on hard working Australians. The member for North Sydney last night said that former cabinet ministers of the Howard government did not know about the impact of AWAs on hard working families. I note the shadow minister for foreign affairs disagreed with this view on radio this morning, where he said: I heard what Joe said. I don't know whether … how true that was. But, you know, certainly I led the task force there for six months and certainly understood that the removal of the no disadvantage test did expose us, and the community were on to it very quickly. So there is confusion amongst the opposition about the impact of Australian workplace agreements. Can I help the opposition with that confusion, because the opposition, when in government, deliberately decided not to collect information on what Australian workplace agreements were doing to hard working families. They knew that those results would be bad, so they preferred not to ask any questions that they did not want the answers to. We did have some samples in May 2006; they came out in Senate estimates. Then the clamper went on-no more information was to come out. The government did sample AWAs between March 2006 and May 2007. To the extent that that analysis got into the public domain, it was there because it leaked. In particular, a sample of over 1,000 AWAs was leaked to the Sydney Morning Herald. Today I can confirm what the results were for that complete sample of 1,700 Australian workplace agreements. These are actual results. I note that the former government denied the figures in the Sydney Morning Herald leak. They will not be able to deny these figures, because these are the actual results. Of the 1,700 Australian workplace agreements that were sampled, 89 per cent removed at least one protected award condition, 83 per cent excluded two or more protected award conditions, 52 per cent excluded six or more-that is more than halfand of course the list goes on. When we are talking about protected award conditions, we are talking about the things that the very expensive propaganda told people were protected by law but could still be taken away without compensation. In these agreements, we know that they were stripped away. What was excluded? What I were the sorts of things that got stripped away? We know that the things that are basic to the take-home pay of Australians got stripped away. Shift loadings were excluded in 70 per cent of agreements, annual leave loading was excluded in 68 per cent of agreements and penalty rates were excluded in 63 per cent of agreements. This is the truth that the Howard government covered up in the run-up to the election. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister has not stated the salary increases that people got as a result of these award conditions.",27
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The deputy leader will resume her seat. She knows that a point of order is not an invitation to come to the dispatch box and debate.,28
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, these questions from the former Howard ministers are fatuous because they deliberately decided, in government, to not do this analysis because they did not want to know the results. They deliberately decided they did not want to analyse the dimension of the rip-off of Australian working families. We should also note that these are the people who deliberately decided not to release any economic modelling of Work Choices. They did not want that information out there. We are in a situation today where hard working Australians are still caught by Work Choices. We are trying to get rid of Australian workplace agreements, in accordance with our policy and the election mandate of the Australian people. That is why we introduced last week the transition bill. What has been the answer, given these shocking statistics, in this parliament of the opposition to that bill's introduction? Well, really, we have got confusion, but what we know that they have actually done is extend the Senate inquiry in order to keep Work Choices going on as long as possible. Whatever they say about amendments, whatever they say about not opposing, whatever they say about five year transitional agreements and them lasting to 2012 or 2017-they do not seem to know-whatever they say about those things, the thing that they have achieved is the continuation of the Australian workplace agreements that these shocking statistics come from. The one thing that should happen today in light of these shocking statistics is that the opposition, in all of its confusion division, should say, ‘What we will do today is we will agree with Labor that this bill will be through the House and through the Senate before Easter.' That will enable a Senate inquiry on the same timetable that the parliament last had when workplace relations laws were dealt with by this parliament. This opposition should get people out of the clutches of Work Choices. In delaying that, all it is doing is reinforcing its reputation as the Work Choices party. Economy",28
72,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the level of state debt? Can the Treasurer also advise the House how state debt impacts on inflation?,28
73,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. It is the case that there is a substantial amount of state debt out there, a very substantial amount. Why are those borrowings taking place? I will tell you why those borrowings are taking place. Those borrowings are taking place for essential economic infrastructure-the sort of essential economic infrastructure that those opposite would not concern themselves with for 11 long years. The Rudd government has made it very clear that it is prepared to work with the states when it comes to critical economic infrastructure because this is a key plank in its platform to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. Eleven years of neglect in infrastructure have produced a situation where the states are having to borrow because the Commonwealth would not come to the table and provide the political leadership that was required so that we could develop a modern economy which was capable of tackling the future challenges. Mr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is releand vance. The question clearly asked, ‘What was the level of state debt?' He obviously does not know.",28
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the honourable member for Cowper that it did then go on to ask about what the effect of state debt was.,29
75,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to provide the member with the exact figure. We have had the member for Wentworth and now another member, the member for Riverina, wanting to conduct a pop quiz. That is what they have come to; they are just so desperate.

78,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me tell you what I will never do. I will never arrogantly dismiss inflation as a fairy story, like the member for Wentworth has. I will never, ever do that to Australian families. I will never, ever, like the Leader of the Opposition, sayMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On this side of the House, we are very keen to hear every word that the Treasurer says but he is speaking away from the Speaker. I can understand him not wanting to turn his back on his colleagues, but can he please address",29
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The members on my left would assist if they sat there quiment? etly.,29
80,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The one thing that I will never, ever do is this. I will never lecture working families, after 10 rate rises, saying that they have never been better off. I will never do that, and that is what those opposite did. Mrs Hull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. I specifically asked two questions, the first being to advise the House of the level of state debt and the second being to advise how that state debt impacts on inflation. Neither of these points has been answered by the Treasurer.",29
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer has the call.,29
82,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I made it very clear to the member that I will provide that information to her. I will get the exact figure-not a problem. But the one thing that I will never doMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Treasurer has said that he does not know the amount of state debt and he will get the details to the member for Riverina, but he has not addressed the primary issue, which is: what is its impact on inflation?",29
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer is relevant to the second part of the question and he has indicated his response to the first part. The Treasurer is in continuation.,29
84,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will be very happy to provide all of that material. Economy,29
85,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Minister, why is it necessary for government spending to be cut? What steps is the government taking to eliminate wasteful spending and improve the efficiency of govern",29
86,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question and congratulate her on her first speech last evening. The government inherited challenging economic circumstances: underlying inflation running at 3.6 per cent, five interest rate increases over the past 18 months-with another one well and truly in the pipeline-and government spending growing by 4½ per cent in real terms. In an economy already being supercharged by very high returns from the mining boom, allowing government spending to increase at that rate is simply and totally irregreat sponsible. I would like to go through one example to illustrate this point-just one example. From the middle of 2006 until the election late last year, over a period of 16 months, the former Howard government spent $457 million on government advertising-almost half a billion dollars within a space of 16 months. And it is interesting to look at the figures over the preceding five years or so. On a calendar year basis, government advertising spending increased from $95.6 million in 2002 to $368.8 million in 2007. That is a 285 per cent increase-and they did not even get to go the full year. They did not even get to go the full year and they still managed to spend nearly $370 million in that one year. If you divide the spending between campaign advertising and non-campaign advertisingnon-campaign advertising is routine stuff mostly; job as and the like-you will see that it increased from $60.4 million in 2002 to $281.2 million in 2007. That is a 365 per cent increase. The House and the Australian people are entitled to ask: how did this happen and who was in charge? I note, as the Treasurer did earlier, that in the middle of last year the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, was quoted in the biography of the former Prime Minister about his worries in relation to government spending running out of control, and I quote: I do worry about the sustainability of all these things. That was the then Treasurer in the middle of last year. Well, good on him! Isn't that hunky-dory-he was there in his office worrying about it all! He was really worried about the sustainability of government spending. Thank goodness he was worried, because you can imagine what they would have spent if he had not been worried! The pity is that he did not take any action; he did not actually do anything. That is the great pity. The truth is that, as on so many other things, the member for Higgins is all talk, all bluff, all bluster and no action. He is Australia's champion flat-track bully, and we saw that in evidence last night.",29
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister should not debate and bring other individuals into the response.,30
88,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Sadly, not much has changed since the election. I note that, in the member for Higgins's local paper, the Stonnington Leader, he is quoted on 5 February as saying:",30
89,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,30
90,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a very interesting newspaper. The member for Higgins is quoted as saying: If I was still Treasurer we'd have 10 CCTV cameras on Chapel St. … … … Before the election, I wouldn't have had to ask Mr Rudd; I would have authorised the cheque myself. That will be his political epitaph: ‘I just kept authorising the cheques.' I can assure the House that the Treasurer and I will not be in the business of automatically authorising cheques. We will not be in the business of massive increases in government spending for things like government advertising, because we and the government are serious about cutting government spending and putting downward pressure on inflation and on interest rates. We are particularly serious about cutting out the outrageous misuse of taxpayers' money on things like government advertising. The previous government spent almost half a billion dollars within the space of 16 months in a desperate attempt to secure re-election. That money could have been invested in infrastructure and in building the skills of this nation to help tackle the inflation problem that has been brewing for some time but instead it was spent in a desperate attempt to secure re-election. There is one big lesson that we can learn from all of this, and that is that you cannot trust the Liberals with public money. Economy",30
91,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. The Treasand urer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation have said again and again that spending by the federal government is inflationary and that reducing spending by the federal government will reduce aggregate demand and will reduce inflation, and this is part of their anti-inflation plan. Yet, when asked what the inflationary impact of state government borrowings is-which of course funds spending by state governments-the Treasurer is unable to say. Is it the Treasurer's contention that it is only spending by coalition governments that contributes to inflation?",31
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The preamble for that question was a little long but I am happy to allow it.,31
93,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. My contention is that spendtion ing to enhance the productive capacity of the economy is absolutely critical to lifting ductivity and to putting downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates, which is why we have a minister for infrastructure-someone who will work with the states, someone who will provide political leadership. That is why, as part of our five-point plan, we are committed to providing national leadership when it comes to essential economic infrastructure. And, for the record, the shadow Treasurer should have a good look at the commentary on this from the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Macfarlane, because it simply disproves the ridiculous claims he is making in the House today. Small Business",31
94,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Will the minister advise the House of the government's policy approach for small business owners and their employees, the prospects for successful implementation of these policies?",31
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the minister for small business and other things.,31
96,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And everything else; and lots of things! I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The Rudd government supports reward for effort, risktaking and entrepreneurship. We support the freedom of working Australians to be employees or to choose a career in small business or independent contracting. The government will support small businesses by tackling inflation, which hit 16-year highs under the previous coalition government. We will tackle inflation by reining in the extravagant government spending of the ‘coalition Coreys' over there. We will tackle inflation by investing in skills through an educarevolution. We will tackle inflation by investing in infrastructure, including through proa high-speed national broadband network. And we will tackle inflation by increasing workforce participation to boost the supply of labour. The government will support small business by amending the Trade Practices Act to combat anticompetitive behaviour by powerful businesses and by reversing what the Business Council of Australia described as ‘the creeping re-regulation' of the Australian business community that occurred over the 11 years of the previous government. This government will also fulfil its election commitment and introduce a fair and flexible industrial relations system, based on productivity. We will remove the red-tape burden on small business created by the farcical Work Choices ‘fairness' test and we will take on the task of award modernisation, a task that was shirked by the coalition in 11½ years in government. And the government will work with small business in developing a fair dismissal code. The Rudd Labor government does not consider it fair that the four million Australians working in small businesses should be able to be sacked on the spot with no explanation, for no reason and with no remedy. I noticed that last night the Manager of Opposition Business said that members of the former coalition cabinet did not know that Work Choices could make people worse off. What is he saying-that they did not know that sacking good workers would make them worse off? How out of touch can you get if you do not know that getting the sack makes you worse off? I have been asked about the prospects for a successful implementation of the government's policies. Those prospects are being threatened by the confusion and the divisions in the coalition. The opposition leader declared that Work Choices is dead but he was contradicted by the shadow minister for families, who said, ‘I think that whatever they put up we should vote against.' But then he was contradicted by the Manager of Opposition Business, who said, ‘But the people have spoken and the Labor Party have a mandate to tear up Work Choices.' But he was contradicted by the small business spokesman, who said that Labor's attempts to apply unfair dismissal laws to small businesses would meet his ‘absolute and determined opposition'. But then he was contradicted by the shadow Treasurer, who said, ‘Labor ran very hard on this issue and they have a mandate for change.' Flip, flop, flap. Mr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question did not call for alternative policies.",31
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked for the government's approach to small business, so the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy-and I apologise to independent contractors and the service economy for having called them ‘other things'-will stick to the question.",32
98,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was also asked about the prospects for successful implementation of these policies. The fact is that the opposition is divided and confused. It is out of touch with working families. The Rudd Labor government is building a modern economy to meet the challenges of the 21st century for the nation and for the working families of Australia. University Fees,32
99,Mr FARMER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Treasurer. We have heard the Prime Minister talking about flip, flop, flap. Will the Treasurer rule out slip, slop or slapping a new tax, levy or compulsory fees on university students?",32
100,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not ruling anything in or out, whether it is slip, slop, slap or anything else, because we are in a budget process. Judicial Appointments",32
101,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney-General inform the House of what the government is doing to increase transparency in judicial appointments?",32
102,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. This is an important issue. The Rudd government is committed to open government, and that is why we have introduced greater transparency and broader consultation in respect of the appointment of senior public servants. On the weekend I had the opportunity to give a speech to the Queensland Bar Association, and I outlined similar proposals in respect of the appointment of federal magistrates and federal judges. As a result of vacancies that have arisen on the Federal Magistrates Court, I have had the opportunity to put that process in train. We have put as in national newspapers calling for expressions of interest by way of application or nomination. We have sought input from a broad cross-section not only of the legal professional bodies but also of the community legal centres, the Legal Aid Commission, academia and the Australian Women Lawyers Association. I intend to appoint a selection panel made up of the Chief Magistrate, a retired judge and a representative of my department. That panel will assist in the selection of candidates according to criteria which have been published on the department's website-criteria determined to achieve not only selection on the basis of merit but personalities who have empathy with litigants who appear before them. That panel will provide me with a short-list, and it is proposed that I would recommend a suitable candidate from that shortlist for the consideration of government. I have outlined options in respect of the appointment of Federal Court and Family Court judges. I have invited input from the profession. I also have invited input from the broader public. Indeed, I would welcome input from members of the House. It is an incremental step but an important step. We are not advocating a United Statestype veto through the Senate or otherwise, but it is an important step to assure Australians that those people who will deliberate in respect of their rights or, if it be in force, obligations against them are chosen not by a narrow, select few but by an appropriately qualified panel. It is important that Australians have confidence that all judicial appointments are entirely on the basis of merit, not on personal associations or political affiliations. This is an important step in further developing the Rudd Labor government's commitment to open government. Mr Brian Burke  government, my question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his release of emails between him and Brian Burke on 17 February. Given his public admission that the meetings with Brian Burke were through the conduit of his former colleague Graham Edwards, will the Prime Minister release all emails or other correspondence between him and Graham Edwards that are relevant to the relationship with Brian Burke? Further, can he assure the House that he will release any emails or other correspondence between him or Graham Edwards and Julian Grill, Brian Burke's business partner, concerning the arrangements he made for meetings and dinner with Brian Burke?",32
103,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am unaware of any emails between me and Graham Edwards on this matter. I will check. If there are, I am happy to top them out. I do not have anything further to add to my earlier remarks. National Capital Authority",33
104,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. What is the latest information about reforms to the National Capital Authority?",33
105,Mr DEBUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The National Capital Authority was established, along with the government of the Australian Capital Territory, in 1989. It is a statutory body whose role is to promote awareness of Canberra as the nation's capital and to look after the planning and management of the parliamentary triangle and other sites of national significance. It is an important role and it is one that the government supports. But there is a widely held view, in my short experience in this place-a view held by most Canberra taxi drivers-that, under the previous government, the NCA's role became unclear. This was a deliberate strategy adopted by the Howard government because of its political differences with the ACT Labor government; in other words, the Howard government allowed the NCA's role to expand beyond its original responsibilities, purposely thwarting the planning and administration roles of the democratically elected government of the ACT and inevitably causing tensions between those two bodies. It is time for that to end. This is a new government that is not interested in the blame game, not here or elsewhere. We are interested in preventing duplication and waste and improving the performance of all agencies. That is why it is time to take a fresh look at the NCA's role to see that it operates effectively, that it has its planning responsibilities clearly defined and, once and for all, to end the wrangling over Canberra's designated areas. The previous government was much more interested in picking a fight with the ACT than ensuring that the NCA operated usefully. It was happy to allow taxpayers' money to be wasted-the Minister for Finance and Deregulation has sufficiently demonstrated his concern about that-for its own political purpose by allowing that unnecessary duplication and confusion to occur. That will not be happening under this government. We are interested in forwardthinking, sensible policy that will see governments and agencies working together to meet our commitments, one of which is to reform the NCA. The National Capital Authority is subject to the scrutiny of a joint standing committee. When it last reported in 2004, it was very critical of the NCA for focusing on local events that did not meet the requirement to promote national awareness. The previous government ignored all of the standing committee's recommendations, and that further compromised the work and reputation of the NCA. It is time again to have another look at that role, and that is one of the reasons that I have asked the joint committee to conduct an inquiry and report back by the middle of this year. The committee has been given five terms of reference. It will look into the administration of the National Capital Plan, the governance arrangements for the NCA, the level of oversight required to maintain the highest standards of design in the ACT, opportunities for greater cooperation with local planning authorities, and the promotion of the national capital and new infrastructure projects. The decision to conduct a new inquiry has received wide support. The Canberra Business Council said it was exactly what they had been seeking. The Property Council of Australia said that it supports any reforms that can get the NCA and the ACT government working together. Senator Gary Humphries, who is a member of the joint committee, has told ABC radio that it is a good chance to clear the air. The government has directed many agencies across the whole area of government to achieve substantial savings, and this authority is no exception. Its budget of more than $20 million will be reduced by $1.6 million, and the NCA has the authority-indeed, it has the obligation-to come up with its own plan as to where those cuts will be made. There have been many reports suggesting that this will mean the end of the Australia Day celebrations. However, the NCA does not own that event. The Australia Day concert belongs to the National Australia Day Council. It has merely had a partnership with the NCA for the last five years. I am assured by the Australia Day Council that it will seek sponsorship elsewhere, and it expects to be successful in that respect. The National Capital Authority has a significant and important role to play in the future, but under this government it will be a role that is properly defined. Climate Change",33
106,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and it concerns climate change. Can the minister give a guarantee that greenhouse gas emissions trading will not increase the price of petrol?",35
107,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. We are at an interesting phase in this question time, and I will tell the House why. The reason is that at last we have a question about climate change from an opposition that did nothing about it for 11 years.",35

I say to the member for Wentworth that I think that when he rose from his seat, very definitively on this occasion, the minister had been less than 17 seconds into his answer. Mr Baldwin-It seemed like a lifetime.",35
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It may be for you, Member for Paterson.",35
111,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that for 11 years the Howard government did not even acknowledge the existence of climate change. Now they are coming into the House to ask us questions about the economic impacts of actually doing something about it. That is the gesture that we are witnessing in the House today. I remember very well when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change first produced a set of data which suggested that there was the possibility that we may have an increase in temperatures on this planet of some four to six degrees and the question was put to the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, as to what the impact of that would be on the people of Australia and our planet, and he said that it would be uncomfortable for some. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, that it will be uncomfortable for some if they get up to the dispatch box and ask us questions about climate change, because their record is one that can be condemned with every answer that is given. Let me continue, Mr Speaker. Don't wave your fingers at me, Joe.",35

To try to shorten this process, I simply say to the minister that he has now had a good preamble-that is in time, because I am not allowed to reflect on the matter-but he will now return to the question.",35
114,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that the Rudd government has in place a set of measures which will ensure the least cost delivery of greenhouse gas emissions trading through the appropriate utilisation of market mechanisms and sensible frameworks and regulations-something that those opposite were never able to bring forward to the Australian people. We saw last night that they did not have any idea about the impact of Work Choices. For 11 years they showed us they did not have any idea about the impact of climate change. The Rudd Labor government is fully committed to putting those measures in placeMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. This is ridiculous. It was a question about the policies of the government and the impact they will have on petrol prices. If he cannot answer it, he should sit down.",35
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I again say to the member for North Sydney that he does not assist with his little addendas to his points of order. I appreciate that the minister has responsibility for the arts, but he should not give a critique on TV shows. He should return to his response to the question asked.",36
116,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Rudd Labor government has brought forward a set of complementary measures which ensure that we have a least cost impost on the Australian economy as we go about the fact of reducing greenhouse gas emissions over time. It was the Rudd Labor government that set a target-something that the opposition was allergic to. It was the Rudd Labor government that ratified Kyoto-something that the opposition was allergic to. It is the Rudd Labor government that has put in place a sensible process of understanding research and commissioning advice to best inform this government as to the best way to ensure that we have both a sustainable economy and a sustainable environment-something that the opposition was never capable of doing.,36
117,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. The question was very simple; it related to the cost of petrol under the policies to be introduced.",36

121,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Would the minister update the House on Indigenous participation in the Australian Defence Force? What potential exists to strengthen this participation?,36
122,Mr SNOWDON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He will be interested in this answer, and I am sure all members of the House will be. Yesterday we heard from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs about the bombing of Darwin festivities today, commemorating that fateful event in 1942. A month after that event was the strafing of Broome. As a result of the strafing of Broome, the North Australia Observation Unit was formed, later called the ‘Nackeroos' or, euphemistically, ‘Curtin's Cowboys'. It was pulled together by a subsequently very famous Australian, Major Bill Stanner. This unit consisted of 550 personnel, based out of Katherine, in the Northern Territory, and was charged with patrolling northern Australia to try to discover if there were any enemies on Australian soil. It was disbanded three years later, in March of 1945. Its equivalent today is the Regional Force Surveillance Units, or RFSUs, one of which exists in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. That is the 51st Battalion, the Far North Queensland Regiment. Forty-seven per cent of its members are Indigenous Australians. Another unit is in NORFORCE, based out of Darwin. Forty-eight per cent of its members are Indigenous Australians. The other is in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, at Karratha, in the Pilbara Regiment, where only four per cent are Indigenous Australians. What we need to comprehend here is that Indigenous people make up 2.4 per cent of the Australian population. They make up 1.4 per cent of the Australian workforce. But across the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force they are only 0.6 per cent. There is much that needs to be done. One of the biggest challenges currently facing the Australian Defence Force is a shortage of the right people, the right skills. We know this. The now Leader of the Opposition understood this in his former role as Minister for Defence. We need to make the most of Australia's human resources, and this includes Indigenous Australians. Attracting Indigenous people into the Defence Force is a huge challenge, but it offers huge potential. There are many reasons why Indigenous Australians are not attracted to the Defence Force or are not adequately represented. Some of those reasons go to the issues which we confronted last week on those momentous days, Tuesday and Wednesday. They involve lifestyle, health, homelessness, lack of education, poor skills, cultural issues, lation-things that we as a nation need to address. But there are many reasons why we should have Indigenous people in the Australian Defence Force. They have an incredible amount to offer. I am someone who has been able to observe this over many years. I have observed their role in NORFORCE in particular. I have had the opportunity to go on patrols with the squadron out of Darwin. They have done great work over the last 12 months on Operation Outreach, supporting the government's intervention in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and providing logistical support, primarily for the health teams. They have done great service over a number of years by protecting Australia's borders, doing those surveillance tasks which have been very important to Operation Resolute. There is a lot more that can be done, but we need to appreciate that on the other side of the coin there are many advantages to Indigenous Australians being part of the Australian Defence Force, because the ADF can provide many things. It provides a capacity for not only new educational opportunities, new training opportunities and new skills but income support and personal and community pride. We have proven that it can be done. This success needs to be reflected across the ADF. There are lessons that can be shared. In fact, I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the member for Eden-Monaro, has responsibility for the ADF Parliamentary Program. One of the activities in the parliamentary exchange this year is an opportunity to spend four days patrolling with the Centre Squadron from NORFORCE, and I commend that opportunity to members of the chamber. Currently, we are finalising within Defence an Indigenous recruitment strategy, isowhich is part of a larger Aboriginal recruitment training, employment and retention effort within the department. We have to learn from the mistakes as well as the successes of the past. What we need to acknowledge is that the one-size-fits-all approach will not work and has not worked. If we need additional programs or initiatives such as mentoring, networking, cadetships and traineeships then sobeit-it will be done. We must do all that we can to enhance the capability of the ADF, including by increasing Indigenous participation. After all, it is in the national interest. Environment: Sewage",36
123,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer to the 1,800 gigalitres partially treated sewage which state Labor governments either dump or authorise for discharge off our coasts every year. Does the minister stand by his view of 9 November 2005 that this practice is unacceptable? If not, what does he now regard as the acceptable standard for discharge: class C, class A or reverse osmosis?",38
124,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not regard levels of discharge of sewage which are over the regulatory levels as acceptable, and I think no-one in this House would. If the member is asking me to form an opinion as to which of the options that he has identified is more acceptable than the other, I am happy to come back to him with an answer when I have considered it more fully. Quarantine",38
125,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In light of the recent failures in Australia's quarantine and biosecurity arrangements, would the minister provide further information to the House on the Australian government's commitment to undertake a comprehensive, independent review of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity arrangements?",38
126,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Throughout Australia there has always been a high concern to make sure that our quarantine and biosecurity services were up to scratch. If ever this concern came to the front of public consciousness, it was during the equine influenza outbreak towards the end of last year. At that point, the then government initiated the Callinan inquiry, which looked only into the specifics of the outbreak of equine influenza. As the opposition at the time, we made a commitment that there would be a full and broad-ranging review into all aspects of Australia's biosecurity and quarantine systems. of The last time a review of that nature occurred was in 1995-the Nairn reviewunder the previous Labor government. We are in a world of increased international movements and, in so many ways, the world itself is getting smaller, which has particular challenges for our biosecurity system. In an age of climate change, we also have the problem of the migration of pests and weeds and the further biosecurity problems that come with that. We need to maintain our biodiversity, protect public health and ensure our primary industries are not further burdened by pests and diseases, whether it be outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, avian influenza throughout many parts of the world or new diseases such as SARS. We also have to be mindful of having a review that takes into account the significant body of case law which now exists within the WTO. Earlier today I announced the commencement of that review. The review will consider the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of our quarantine and biosecurity arrangements. I also announced that this review would evaluate Australia's current arrangements to achieve its appropriate level of protection consistent with our international obligations; look at the adequacy of the consultation and review processes currently in place; and consider other important quarantine reviews, including the implementation of the Nairn review. This inquiry will be headed up by Mr Roger Beale AO. Mr Beale has held very senior roles in both public and private sectors and is a former Secretary of the Department of Environment and Heritage. He will be assisted in that task by Mr Andrew Inglis AM, Mr David Trebeck and Dr Jeffory Fairbrother AM. Mr Andrew Inglis AM was also a member of the Nairn review of quarantine. I spoke today with Mr Roger Beale AO, and he made it clear that he wanted to ensure that there was a maximum level of community consultation. There will be a full-ranging opportunity for the community to participate in this process. I cannot begin to say how important it is to make sure that we get our systems in place so that we can make available the maximum level of protection through our quarantine and biosecurity processes. I look forward to this report coming back to me in the second half of the year so that it can inform the budget process of the following year. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",38
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTION TIME,"Order! The Chief Government Whip raised a point of order about his ability to hear proceedings, and comments have also been made by others about this. I wish to indicate two things. I have emphasised the first, which is that there is generally too much noise in the chamber both to my left and to my right. The second is that, after observing proceedings since that time, I realised that it is difficult to hear ple at the dispatch box when they are not speaking directly into the microphone. Whilst I emphasise both in the asking of questions and in their answering that remarks be relayed through the chair, as the standing orders require, it would assist the chair, given the directional nature of the microphones, if remarks were made to the microphone. I do not wish to pick on the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel but he best illustrated this when he drifted around and away from speaking into the microphone. Even with his voice it was a little hard to hear him when he was not speaking into the microphone. NA Question Time  have a question to you. On 14 February the Prime Minister stated in the House that the Howard government averaged 63 question times. In fact, that is the figure for all years of the Howard government. A more accurate comparisonMr Albanese- Mr SPEAKER ",39
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat.  Speaker. A more accurate comparison with the 67 question times scheduled for 2008, a non-election year, is the comparison with non-election years in the Howard government, when the average was 70. Will you request that the Prime Minister return to the House to correct the record with the more accurate figure?",39
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I think that a matter like that is in the hands of the House. Question Time,39
130,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a peoquestion to you, Mr Speaker. Referring to the last answer given by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, I do not know whether you are expecting this side of the House to call a point of order when there is clearly a ministerial statement being given as an answer to a question. The power",39
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for MCMillan will resume his seat. Any things that people think are matters that they want to question about proceedings of question time should be raised at the time. I would prefer that they are raised at the time by way of point of order. It is not my intention to enter into a question and answer session after question time which is a review of matters that happened in question time. Question Time,39
132,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, during question time today the opposition raised I think 19 points of order, including in answers that were less than 20 seconds into the answer. Notwithstanding the provisions of standing order 86, I would ask whether or not you would consider, as previous Speakers have, reviewing the use of standing orders and points of order to disrupt the business of the House, which has in the past been viewed as disorderly and is in contravention of standing order 91",40
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The honourable member for Brisbane will resume his seat. The answer is the same as to the member for MCMillan. I will not be entering into a question and answer session about proceedings of question time. If people are aggrieved about my actions in the chair, they should raise them at the time. If they think that the points of order are disorderly, I would ask that that be raised at the time. I am not making general comments about the proceedings of the parliament. At this point in time the Speaker may be asked questions about those matters under his or her administration. Mr Bevis- Mr SPEAKER ",40
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The member for Brisbane, if he has a further comment, will not make it by way of interjection. I am saying to the House quite clearly that I will not be in the practice of reviewing every question time for the purposes of replaying things that have happened. If members feel aggrieved about things that are occurring in question time, they should act at the time. Mr Bevis-On that point of order, Mr Speaker, I was not asking you to reflect in the past on what happened today and make some decision about today. I was referring to the events of today and asking whether, as other Speakers have, you would consider the use of points of order as disruptive, as provided for in the standing orders",40
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I do not wish to encourage interjections. The problem that has occurred when we have entered into these discussions is that it leads people to believe that the person raising the question is reflecting on the chair. I do not think that that is the case. The point that I would make is that I do not think that there is any advantage by people asking for advisory rulings. The Chief Government Whip by his body language can just be a bit careful, because I am trying to set the scene. He interjected at one stage about points of order and their disruptive nature, and I tend to agree with that. But that might be best raised at the time and not by way of advisory rulings. That is all I am simply saying. NA",40
136,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. NA Afghanistan,40
137,Mr FITZGIBBON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The war in Afghanistan is at a crossroads and the time for making difficult decisions is upon us. For the global community the stakes are high. For the Afghan people, they are even higher. When we gather in Bucharest in April, the partners to the Afghanistan project need to embrace a new strategy to win. To win not just the military battle, but the battle for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. Broadly, there are five keys to winning the military campaign. The first is reaching agreed and common campaign objectives. The second is securing a coherent campaign plan. The third is clarisecurity fying chains of command and lines of responsibility. The fourth is securing new NATO troop commitments. The fifth is growing the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police Force to the critical mass and skill level they need to hold our military gains and to enforce the rule of law in their war-torn country. Winning the hearts and minds of the local population will require the partners to do more on the non-military side. First, we must do more to build an economy free of narcotics. Second, we must do more to provide guidance and assistance on governance issues. And, third, we must focus more acutely on the establishment of a justice system not so vulnerable to corruption and manipulation. In short, it is about giving the Afghan people hope, hope that a democratic Afghanistan can deliver for them a decent society and a decent standard of living. It is appropriate to acknowledge that, on both the military and non-military fronts, significant gains have been made. We have enjoyed some success in targeting the insurgent leadership and we have disrupted their coordination and lines of command. Six million Afghan children are now receiving an education and 80 per cent of the population now has access to basic health care. But so much more needs to be done. Today I am able to inform the House, the Australian community and the wider global community that the new Australian government has taken a number of decisions which will demonstrate we are willing to back our criticisms of the Afghanistan mission with real and meaningful action. The government has decided to adjust Australia's defence contribution in Afghani- assets. stan. While maintaining our engineering and effort, we intend to increase our focus on training. This means the Australian government has decided to maintain our current level of military commitment to Afghanistan, but to increase the focus on training and mentoring of the Afghanistan national army. We are making these changes with an eye on the longer term future of the country, noting that the government of Afghanistan needs to be able to develop the security forces which will provide the security for their own citizens into the future. The adjustments to Australia's military commitment will be focused on enhancing the capabilities of the Afghan national army while retaining our reconstruction and combat effort in Oruzgan. Based on both our reviews and consultation with our partners, the new government believes the time is right for Australia to evolve the role of its forces so that the additional task of training the Afghan army can be embraced and adopted. This will be achieved by providing an Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team which will be responsible for the training of an Afghan national army battalion which will shortly commence operations in Oruzgan province. The introduction of this training team will be an important step in assisting the development of the Afghan security forces. As part of the broader effort of our Dutch partners, the Australian training team will commence operations later this year. The core of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team will be highly skilled officers and senior non-commissioned officers with experience in infantry operations. The team will also include integral force protection troops and The training team will be embedded with an Oruzgan based Afghan national army battalion-commonly known there as a Kandak-which normally consists of around 600 soldiers. The Australian Defence Force personnel will mentor and advise key commanders within the Kandak during both training and operations. The mentoring and training team will assist the Kandak Headquarters in military operational necessities such as logistics and personnel management, force protection planning and coordinating combined operations. The commitment of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team will help rebuild the security institutions of the Afghan government, particularly in the Oruzgan province. The training team will develop the skills of the Afghan security forces to enable them to do the job that is currently being undertaken by coalition forces. The need for this shift in focus is well recognised by the national community. ISAF's operational mentoring and liaison teams have been operating successfully with the Afghan army throughout the various provinces in Afghanistan. Given this success, the international community is increasingly moving towards providing greater training to the Afghan national security forces through these teams. While this adjustment to our military commitment will not result in an increase in the number of troops that we have deployed in Afghanistan, Australia will maintain all of its current force elements including the Reconstruction Task Force, the Special Operations Task Group, the Rotary Wing Group and the Control and Reporting Centre. The Reconstruction Task Force will continue to make its important contribution to the reconstruction and security of Oruzgan province. It will retain a construction and security capability as well as continuing to manage the trade training school and provide project management experience to assist the people of Oruzgan in rebuilding their province. The Special Operations Task Group will also continue its work in providing security for the province by taking the fight directly to the insurgents. This work creates a more secure environment for the international community and the Afghan government to deliver development assistance in the Dutch and Australian supported province of Oruzgan. Further, the Rotary Wing Group and the Control and Reporting Centre, based in Kandahar, will continue to provide vital air transport and battle airspace management for the international community's efforts in southern Afghanistan. In addition to the initiatives that I have announced today, the government will soon announce an enhancement of its efforts on interthe non-military side of the equation. The government remains firmly committed to international efforts to stabilise and rebuild Afghanistan. As I noted earlier, a strong, highly trained and competent Afghan national army will be critical for the future security of the country. Australia's continued military commitment to Afghanistan and its ongoing participation in the International Security Assistance Force mission reflects the critical role a stable Afghanistan plays in regional and international security. Australia has a direct interest in working with our international partners and the Afghan government to ensure that the country does not again become a base for terrorist activity. Australia remains committed to working with the government of Afghanistan to improve governance and security and to develop its capacity to deliver improved services to its citizens. I look forward to working with our ISAF partners in Bucharest and beyond to deliver a safe, secure and stable Afghanistan.",40
138,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Baldwin speaking for a period not exceeding 8 ½ minutes. Question agreed to.,43
139,Mr BALDWIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Paterson) (3.51 pm)Let me state for the record that the coalition, whether in government or in opposition, will never withhold or withdraw support for our troops, particularly when they are serving overseas. In receiving this statement today, the coalition supports the statement in principle. Our work in Operation Slipper commenced some 6½ years ago. The International Security Assistance Force, led by Major General Mark Evans and supported by Brigadier Stuart Smith, has done an outstanding job. Whether it is through the National Command Element, the liaison offices, Reconstruction Task Force 3, the Special Operations Task Group, the Air Force control and reporting centres, the force level logistic assets or, indeed, other support elements, the Australian military has a great presence and has made a great contribution. Indeed, in this House last week we moved condolence motions for Special Forces Sergeant Matthew Locke, Trooper David Pearce and Special Forces Commando Luke Worsley, who gave their lives in defending the freedoms and democracies that Australia stepped up to the plate for after 9-11 to make sure that there was a democratic, free Afghanistan, which was free of terrorist elements that rain down not only on that country but indeed across the world. We stood up to the plate at that time, I am proud to say, and the Labor opposition supported that. Some of the work that has been achieved over there includes the training of 130 Afghanis who are being trained by our people in the reconstruction task force in the trade training schools. One hundred and thirty-five members of the Afghan National Army have been trained by the reconstruction task force. Some of their work has included the redevelopment of Tarin Kowt provincial hospital, the renovation of Tarin Kowt high school and major causeway constructions over the Garmab Mandah River. The ANP checkpoints on the eastern and western edges of Tarin Kowt have now been completed. The Yaklengah health centre has been renovated. The Talani school has been refurbished. Training has been implemented-that is, put in place and commenced-at the Afghan health and development services. Twenty wells throughout Tarin Kowt have been established to provide clean drinking water for people. This is the fine work of the Australian military in areas such as Afghanistan. The issue that we have in relation to this statement is that, to date, the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for defence, I and our shadow parliamentary secretary, the member for Herbert, have not actually been briefed on the processes of this ministerial statement and what it means. We support the idea of increasing training, but there are some questions that we have to ask which would normally be asked during a private briefing, such as questions concerning the allocation of special protection forces for our trainers. We do not intend to be political in relation to this statement; we intend to be supportive of our men and women who serve overseas. Much has been said by the minister in relation to the information provided by NATO. I am informed by previous ministers for defence and for foreign affairs that we have always had access to and been included in NATO information. I can only assume that, with this restructuring of the force, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister must have had information provided to them that showed the necessity of developing this battalion of Afghanis to provide greater security and protection in their growth and development as a country providing their own security. The minister has mentioned the need to stamp out the narcotics trade. This is very important. The effects on the local people there and, indeed, across the globe are quite dramatic. The human rights injustices created by the Taliban and the terrorists that have been active in that area have been beyond a dimension that we could ever understand. Without prolonging this, we support this ministerial statement in principle as we have always supported our fine men and women who serve in the Australian military. NA Climate Change",43
140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to implement effective climate and water programs I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",44
141,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Climate change is real. It is important. It is signifisee cant. But it takes substance, not symbols, in order to manage it. It takes substance, not symbols, in order to manage the water requirements as well as the climate change requirements that this country will face over the coming decade, over the coming 20 years and over the coming 30 years. The case that we want to present today is a simple one: the early signs from this government are not of competent management of climate and water but of incompetent and ineffective management of those programs necessary to make a real and sustainable difference to the way in which Australia deals with both the climate challenge and with our water supplies. I want to make this case, along with my colleagues the member for Calare and the member for Murray, in three stages: the domestic climate change policies, the international climate change policies and the rural water policies. Underpinning all of this is the concept of competence. Let me start in relation to the issue of competence with a recent decision of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. The minister was called upon under the EPBC to decide whether or not to allow dredging of Port Phillip Bay. He had to make whatever decision he had to make, and that included a decision regarding the two million tonnes of toxic sediment containing zinc, cadmium, lead, arsenic and up to 270 trace elements, which will now be dumped into the middle of Port Phillip Bay. But there was a slight issue. In making his decision for Port Phillip Bay, his reasons referred to Western Port Bay. This is a minister who made one of the biggest environmental decisions in Australian history for the wrong bay. I just want to repeat that: he made it for the wrong bay! Did he know the right bay? No. Did he consult with the community? No. Is he competent? No. That is the base of and the way in which we are looking at this sort of issue. What we is a dangerous practice of incompetence and ineffective programs. Let me turn to the first of these areas, which is the notion of domestic failure in terms of the climate change programs which they are seeking to bring forward. We put forward a very interesting proposal called the Green Vouchers for Schools program. What we see today with that Green Vouchers for Schools program is, in a word, chaos under the new government. First, it was axed. Second, it was placed on hold. Third-and I note this from the website in the last couple of days-our program, which was initially axed and then placed on hold, has suddenly and mysteriously been reinstated. Why is that? We see that the new program which the government put in place to supersede it is late. The website says 1 July, maybe. It is inflexible. There were originally no projects over $30,000; whereas we had a $50,000 limit. I noticed, again on the website today, that it appears-but we do not know-that they have changed their cap to agree with ours to give schools precisely the flexibility which we had given them, but they have done this without even the slightest acknowledgement of the mistake which they made, the way in which we warned them of it and the change that they have made in response to the very problem we identified in the Age on 2 January this year. More than this, schools seeking to decrease greenhouse gas emissions today are trapped. That is because, at this the very program which the government said would succeed is not in place. The current program, which they axed, then put on hold and reinstated, is in the minister's own website accompanied by the words ‘you may wish to reconsider'. Their program promised 27,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas savings a year. At present, how many are we receiving from the work that they have done? None. Zero. Nothing. Not one tonne, precisely because they have put on hold and failed to administer a simple program which was effective, which was wanted, which was appreciated and which they will now spend a significant amount just rebranding. I would be fascinated if the minister could provide the figures to the House of what the cost of that rebranding exercise will be. So we see, firstly, that this greenhouse gas program, Green Vouchers for Schools, has been axed, put on hold and now reinstated, but the government are discouraging schools from taking it up whilst providing no way forward. On the other front, the Community Water Grants program, from which members on all sides will have seen tremendous results in their electorates, is on ice, on hold, with no date for a new round of Community Water Grants, no date by which community groups, schools, councils or those wishing to avail themselves of the opportunity to save water, to improve riverbanks, to improve watercourses or to work on pollution can do so. All around Australia, community groups are throwing up their hands. We have had the query: when will this happen? Unfortunately, we have to refer the questions to the office of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts or the Minister for Climate Change and Water, and to date there is no news and no sign, just a pattern of maladministration. We have a pattern of maladministration which does not befit officeholders point in time, under the Crown. I turn, secondly, to the biggest area of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia: the question of emissions from power stations. We see a fascinating thing. We set out prior to the last election the need for a clean energy target. The reason we set out a clean energy target is that we believe that we have to go beyond renewables only. Renewables are important, but, unless you have incentives for cleaning up the 75 per cent of coal and gas electricity which is part and parcel of Australia's makeup, you will never deal effectively with the great challenge of greenhouse in this world. We will see in India and China 800 new one-gigawatt coal fired power stations over the coming five years. Yet we see that they have turned their backs on the need for clean energy which cleans up the power stations. Do not take my word. Who has put out a report on this? In December last year, after the election, the CFMEU put out a report called Carbon capture and storage: making it happen. What was its conclusion? Its conclusion, at page 15, was fundamental. The CFMEU-great friends of the coalitionsaid exactly what we have been saying: if you want to make a difference to greenhouse gases in Australia, you have to provide an incentive for adoption of clean coal technology and, if you want to do that, you have to have a clean energy target. The government have turned their backs on cleaning up the coal and gas fired power stations of Australia. There is no adoption incentive. They will use this idea of technolover ogy development, but I can tell you, Minister, that, for as long as we are here, unless you provide an adoption incentive it will not happen. That is the simple answer. My prediction before this House today is that by the end of this term the government will have buckled and agreed with us on the need for a clean energy target. I go so far as to put on the record my prediction that by May 2009, in the budget that comes down then, there will be the adoption of some form of clean energy target so as to encourage clean coal and gas and the cleaning up of our power stations. You can have two choices here: either you clean up the power stations or you do not clean up the power stations. Our approach is very simple. We are source blind. Everything needs to be cleaned up. But, because of an ideological disposition that the government took to the electorate, they have turned their back on the single biggest challenge facing the world and the single biggest challenge facing Australia in terms of clean emissions and clean energy, and that is cleaning up the power stations, both coal and gas, as well as generating new, clean, renewables. Solar, wind, hydro and geothermal-we support all of those, but unless you have a clean energy target you will never solve the great global challenge. This brings me onto another issue-that is, the question of international policy. We see here a pattern of silence. Yes, the government will point out one of the symbolic gestures that they have made, and good luck to them, but much more important is this: we see a silence about those countries of the world which, unlike Australia, are not meeting their targets. Of all the developed countries, Australia is one of the few countries to be meeting its international targets, and that is because we put $3.4 billion down into effective greenhouse gas reduction programs the last decade. The problem is real. The solutions were real. The effect was real. But what we see overseas and from this government, which is hurting our capacity to have an impact internationally, is silence about those countries that are failing to meet their obligations. Canada is plus 22 per cent on its international greenhouse targets, but have we heard anything from the government about that? No. France is plus nine per cent on its international targets, but have we heard anything from the government about that failure? No. Japan is plus 12 per cent on its international targets. Have we heard anything about that failure? No. Norway is plus 22 per cent on its international targets, but have we heard anything about that failure? No. Spain, for example, is 36 per cent over and above its international commitments, but have we heard anything? No. The government's pattern is very simple: apologise for Australia being one of the very few countries in the world which is actually meeting its targets and say nothing about those countries which are actually breaching that which they have pledged. It is very important that we set down $3.4 billion worth of funds to produce real emissions savings. We have achieved real emissions savings of about 87 million tonnes a year. That is real. That is practical. One thing that we know about the atmosphere is the tonnes of CO2 and parts per million of CO2 or equivalent gases that are in the air. Yet we see a failure to speak up internationally about the real challenge and the failure of other countries to meet their obligations. It is fine to criticise Australia for not pledging to do what we already did in any event. But will you say something about those countries which I have outlined and the many others that have failed to do that which they have agreed internationally? The second great failure internationallyand this is important-is a silence on the destruction of the rainforests of the world. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs and the former Minister for the Environment and Water Resources set out a very important initiative: the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate. There was a reason for that. That was because of a perverse incentive under the international regime: rainforests are being cleared for palm oil. This is the very regime which needs to be rectified in order to overcome that. As a result, what the previous government did was to lay down $200 million for a Global Initiative on Forests and Climate. Twenty per cent of the world's greenhouse emissions come from rainforest destruction, and it is the single area which over the next five years can be most quickly turned around and most quickly addressed. Yet we see-in part I think because it was one of the great issues which we championed-a silence on this issue of immediate international action. There is a great opportunity-at the lowest cost and with the highest ecological benefit-for action today. They went to Bali and they said virtually nothing about protecting the great rainforests. They said nothing about our proposal for a global rainforest recovery plan. If you want to have an impact, as the MCKinsey report showed only on Friday of last week, you turn to what you can do to capture carbon through natural systems and to prevent its release into the atmosphere. All of these things-what schools can do as consumers, what power stations can do in order to reduce emissions and what we can do through the natural environment-are fundamental to this question of how we implement real, effective and important greenhouse plans. It is real, it is significant and it is fundamental. But if you engage in symbols alone and if you fail to administer your portfolio properly then what we see is a failure of government to do the real work. Who on that side of the House will justify the closure of the Green Vouchers for Schools program? Is that acceptable? Are there people over there who have received complaints from schools that they could not access this program whilst it was put on ice and the alternative program to succeed it was put off into the never-never? Ultimately the position is very clear. We are concerned and we raise this as a matter of public importance because the issue is important and what we see is a failure to properly administer the charge of government and a failure to deliver effective programs. We see it in the declaration of the wrong bay, for one of the most important environmental decisions that the government will face. We see it in the failure to administer the green schools program. We see it in the failure to develop a proper alternative for a pathway to clean coal and clean gas. And we see it in the silence about what is necessary at the international level if we are to achieve real, sustainable and important emissions reductions over the coming 10, 20 and 30 years further on.

142,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (4.11 pm)-I thank the member for bringing this matter into the House so that we can debate it. The member has an interesting challenge. He somehow has to white out 11 years of inaction, denial and obfuscation by the previous Howard government, which failed to take climate change seriously. So what he is really doing in the House is repositioning himself. He is showing, as the opposition spokesman on these matters, that he is aware of the seriousness those issues. I do commend that, because members opposite-including this member-had to labour for years and years under the burden of a government for which it was only symbols. The member comes in here and accuses this party of being a party preferring symbols over substance. And yet they were led by a leader who for 11 years refused on a symbolic basis not to ratify the Kyoto protocol.",48
143,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,48
144,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, that is what it was all about. That is what the debate was about when we were in the House. The Prime Minister did not want to talk about Kyoto even though it was his view-and it was the view of the government at the time-that they were putting in place matters of substance. If ever there was an example of symbolism over substance it was the position that you held on not ratifying the Kyoto protocol. It is now in the history books. It is a matter of record in this House. And you have tried to distance yourself from it in this MPI-perhaps not satisfactorily. Let us look at the agenda that the Rudd Labor government has brought forward and let us determine whether it is an agenda of substance or not. But before we do that let us just raise answers to a couple of questions that the member brought into the House. The member for Flinders says that the reasons named in the statement for Port Phillip Bay were inaccurate. In fact, that is not the case at all. In fact, the reasons named in the statement have been subject to a court challenge. The court has found that the statements had validity. Additionally, I will remind the member, if he wants to raise the issue of Port Phillip Bay, that it was the position, as I understood it, of the opposition to support the Victorian approvals process and the independent experts group that was in the of process of endorsing that. Now, if that is not your position any longer, bring it back into us. The member for Flinders came into the House to talk about green vouchers. I am really glad that the member came into talk about green vouchers because I can assure the members and public listening that this government takes very seriously both the commitment it has made in respect of the National Solar Schools Program and, particularly, the investment of an extra $153 million to allow schools to choose the most effective way to meet their energy and water requirements. At the beginning of this month I put in place transition arrangements for the government's $489 million Solar Schools Program. From 1 July this year, every school in Australia will be eligible to apply for grants of up to $50,000 to install twokilowatt solar panels, a range of energy efficient measures, lighting upgrades, skylights and shade awnings, in addition to rainwater tanks and solar hot water systems. That commitment by the Rudd Labor government will enable schools to choose a flexible mix of measures that they determine in their circumstances are appropriate for them to meet the greenhouse challenge. That was the problem with the former government's plan. The former government's policy was an interesting one. Unfortunately, you could only have solar hot water systems in one aspect of it and water tanks in another. Under the Rudd Labor government's plan, you will actually have the flexibility to determine the kinds of measures you want to put in place in your schools. If members opposite are wondering why it is that we have not seen a rush of schools taking up the green vouchers-which they are still entitled to do at this point in time-it is because schools are smart enough to realise that the policy that we offered is superior to the one they brought to the last election. The member for Flinders spoke about the clean energy target. I remind the House that, under the Howard government, Australia not only did not have a position to take to the international community in terms of ratifying the Kyoto protocol but did not have a mandatory renewable energy target at all. In fact, I remember asking a question in the House I think it might have been the first question that I put to the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who is now the shadow Treasurer. The question was a simple one: will the government support a mandatory renewable energy target? The answer was never given. The fact of the matter is that, by having a mandatory renewable energy target, we will enable Australian industries and Australian communities to have a specific target that they can head towards to start reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries have them. The member for Flinders asks why we are not talking about greenhouse gas emissions in other countries. Why aren't they talking about mandatory renewable energy targets in other countries? Because they have them. Why shouldn't Australia have one? The reason Australia did not have one was the same reason we did not ratify the Kyoto protocol. It was the same reason we, as a nation, did not set a target the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most basic and necessary tasks of any government is to set a target. It is a task those on the other side, led by Prime Minister Howard, failed to do. Why was that? The answer is a very simple one. The Liberal Party did not have a conviction that a national government should take resolute action on climate change. They did not have a conviction that we in this parliament should bring forward policies to deal with addressing dangerous climate change. That is what a mandatory renewable energy target is. It is not symbolic. It is a policy of substance. Setting a target of a 60 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 on 2000 levels is a policy. Professor Ross Garnaut was commissioned to consider least-cost paths and matters determined by the state premiers and the Leader of the Opposition at the time-because the government had never done it-and to better inform governments as to how to reduce emissions in a low-cost way to ensure that we have a sustainable economy. Those on the other side of the House, when they were in government, never did it. In fact, the Liberal Party and the Howard government were so disinterested in addressing climate change seriously that when the states finally got together to determine what a national emissions trading scheme would look like-it was called the National Emissions Trading Taskforce-the Commonwealth did not participate. When the Commonwealth realised very late in the day that climate change was an issue that counted to Australians and that they wanted to do something about it, it was far too late. Notwithstanding the efforts of the former minister for the environment, who went into the cabinet and suggested at the eleventh hour, ‘Wait a minute, maybe we should ratify Kyoto,' it was too late. It was all over red rover. The for symbolism of hanging on to an unwillingness to ratify Kyoto was stronger for the former government than any positive sign they could show the world community that this country knew how to take climate change seriously. The member for Flinders came in here and said, ‘We don't hear you speaking internationally.' He must be joking. He was in Bali when the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Penny Wong, and I went to Bali. Australia was given a standing ovation in the halls at Bali as a consequence of tion. It was not that the world was not listening. The world could not believe that for 11 years Australia had been led by a government that was not willing to ratify the Kyoto protocol. It is as simple as that. To say that we are not speaking in international fora is to deny the absolute facts. We have ratified the protocol. It was the first step of the Rudd Labor government. It was a proud step, which was supported by the majority of Australians and countries right around the world. I was asked by the member for Flinders about rainforests and what we are saying and doing about it. I want to take the comments that the member made and say that I think rainforests are an important issue. There is no question about it. In the policy repertoire of the former government, rainforests were all they had. Rainforests were in effect their fig leaf-if you will excuse a rather lame analogy. Unwilling to ratify the Kyoto protocol, unwilling to allow businesses access to the market that was generated by the protocol and the clean development mechanism, they trumpeted and talked about rainforests. Rainforests are important, particularly the impact that clearing rainforests for palm oil production will have both on the biodiversity of rainforests and on the greenhouse gas emissions that the planet has got to bear. It is an important issue. It is one that we will look at and consider seriously. We take the environment very seriously. We take climate change very seriously. That is why we have a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is why we have a commitment to adapt to the impacts of climate change that we cannot avoid. That is why we have a commitment to work in international fora. The Minister for Climate Change and Water, Penny Wong, will be going to meetings of the parties, will be going into international fora, to take a position that the Australian government is consistently putting about the our ratifica- need to act nationally. In the past, in this House-and I think this will shock some new members on this sidemembers opposite participating in debates on climate change have denied its scientific validity. We had debates in the House from members opposite where they said there was no connection between climate change and drought. They expressed great concern for the farmers of this country and the serious impact that the current drought was havingand we have a genuine concern and awareness of the impact that the drought can have-but who was going to get up here and argue on the basis of symbolism that climate change, already identified as increasing the temperatures in southern Australia over the next decades, did not count and had nothing whatsoever to do with droughts now or in the future? I can tell you who was going to do it: it was the former Leader of the National Party. He got up here and said it and he said it publicly. That is symbolism over substance of the very worse kind. Captive to a narrow ideology and unwilling to accept the validity and the basis of science as delivered by the IPCC and Nobel Prize award winner, former Vice-President, Al Gore, whose contribution was called, by a former government minister in this House, ‘an entertainment'",48
145,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Government members interjecting,50
146,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is the language that was used: ‘an entertainment'. The IPCC examination, the most extensive examination by the scientific community of the likely impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on our planet and on the climate in terms of warming, was dismissed-it meant nothing. There has been talk about symbolism and substance. The opportunity to provide substance comes when the Treasurer has to get up and present a budget. But in all but one of bate. the past Treasurer's budgets, climate change was never mentioned. When former environment ministers went to international fora to talk about climate change, they dared not say the word ‘Kyoto'. That was symbolism over substance. When we look at the task that the nation has to put us on an even and sure footing so that we can manage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time build a sustainable economy, we see that the former government went missing in action. The cry from business leaders, trade unions, communities, farmers and schools right around Australia was: ‘Will someone wake up this government to do something about climate change?' On election day that is what Australians did. As as being a clear expression of the will of Australian people about the Work Choices legislation, the election in 2007 was a clear expression of the will of the people about the importance of taking a nationally strong position on climate change-something the Liberal Party and the former Howard government never did. Let me conclude by saying that it is our intention to drive a clean energy revolutionary with policies such as the establishment a $500 million renewable energy fund, an energy innovation fund and the national clean coal initiative. We want to help Austra2006, lian families green their homes with policies like green loans, a one-stop green shop and rebates for energy-efficient rental homes. We want to bring cleaner transport through with measures like the green car innovation fund and the green car challenge. They are matters of substance. They are the policy matters that we should be debating in this House, but instead the member for Flinders comes in here and attempts to skate over a past which cannot be ignored or escaped from and throws some flamboyant and erratic language around in an attempt to marshal a deWe have reached the stage in our national life where we need seriousness on this issue, not frivolity. We need to take the issues that we are debating right up to one another. I absolutely welcome that. We need to go out to communities and provide them with opportunities, as we have done for the people of Coober Pedy. They will have the opportunity to have the largest solar power station in Australia-erected in remote Australia. The people in Coober Pedy and others in remote Australia who may be listening know that they have issues. They are reliant on diesel, but they have a lot of sunlight-and we have the technology and the expertise. For 11 years this issue stayed in the too-hard basket well for the previous government. The Rudd Lathe bor government is fully committed to climate change solutions and matters of substance that mean a lot to the Australian people.",50
147,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to bring the attention of the House to the fact that, after three months in government, the new government has pretty much ignored what is for Australia one of the biggest issues it has, and that is the state of the Murray-Darling Basin and its water and the fact that of Australia gets over 40 per cent of its food product from the people of that region. And this is a government that, on 25 January when in opposition, backed then Prime Minister John Howard and our government when we launched the National Water Initiative. In the last three months, the only way in which this government has acknowledged the issue of water and the problems associated with the Murray-Darling Basin has been to cut $50 million from that program. Some of it was money that could not be spent this financial year, which is fine-it was about setting up the Murray-Darling Basin Authority-and some of it was money to set up a structure within the Bureau of Meteorology to monitor what happens with water in Australia as part of that initiative. But if you have a look at the forward projections, you see that that money has not been put back. It is very good to see some new members of the new government here today, because in the next 10 minutes they will learn more about water than any of their senior executive know about it. The fact is that, in all time that Labor has been in governmentthree months-not once has the Minister for Climate Change and Water allowed anyone from the irrigation industry to see her or her staff. In fact, the government has been deadly silent on this issue and the National Water Initiative, which was backed by the Labor Party at the time it was launched. The people in the Murray-Darling Basin still do not know one thing about how this government is going to proceed with it. Is the restructuring money going to be put in? Is the money to create efficiencies in the transfer of water in the Murray-Darling Basin going to go ahead? Is the money to create efficiencies on farms going to go ahead? There has not been one word. The issue of Victoria is very interesting this. For a government who have said that they are getting rid of the blame game, that they are going to work with state governments, that they are all kindred spirits of a socialist bent and that they are going to sort it out, why have they not already got Victoria signed up? They will say that they had a meeting with Premier Brumby on the water issue. I could not believe it when the person who said that Victoria wanted nothing to do with a national water plan-that it did not want to do it-then said that he had always believed in a national water plan. That is quite unbelievable. The failure of state Labor governments right around Australia to ever pay for what they have taken from irrigators is a path that this new federal government, it would seem, is going to follow. If you listen to one of the new members of the new government-the member for Maribyrnong, a former heavy, and probably still very much a heavy, in the union movement-it would seem his idea is that the government should compulsorily acquire water from irrigators and shut down the rice and cotton industries because they the are using water. This is about ignorance. The fact is that the cotton industry is, by and large, an extremely efficient user of water. If you know something about it, you realise efficiency is the issue, not what is grown. The cotton industry, like other industries which are horticultural, uses around eight megalitres of water per hectare per crop. That is what they need to concentrate on, not what is growing. In the past some people have simply not liked an industry. All the states have worked under the national competition policy. New South Wales, in particular, and Victoria have in the past taken water from irrigators despite taking federal money under the national competition policy, and they have never given any of it back. The new government has to learn in that the National Plan for Water Security acted like it did because of production and food prices and helping industry help itself. A small part of the $10 billion was to buy water, some of it was for restructuring but most of it-almost $6 billion-was there to help industry become more efficient and to help water transfer become more efficient. That has to happen. The Leader of the House said that that money simply had to be spent on buying water, not on creating efficiency and getting water back that way. He simply wants to buy water. We have a mixture of the member for Maribyrnong wanting to compulsorily acquire water from irrigators, and the former shadow minister for water and the present Leader of the House wanting to do nothing but buy water. They have to understand that it was no accident that the National Plan for Water Security was put there like it was. If you simply take water, you are going to cut production. If you simply take water from people when they are at their most vulnerable, physically, financially and mentallyand we are talking about irrigators and farmers who have gone through six years of drought-then probably some of them will sell water, but they will regret it as soon as things get better. It is taking advantage of people when they are at their most vulnerable. The government have to accept that they are totally ignorant about water and the effect of taking it away. They will cut production. What happens when you cut production from an area as important as this? Up go food prices. If you put up food prices then the Treasurer, who is having so much trouble grasping the subject, will realise that suddenly up goes inflation, and it has a bad effect on the economy. The things that have to be learnt have to be learnt by going and talking to the people involved with them. Do not do what the government in Victoria are doing. They are stealing water, which is going to have the same long-term effect as what the member for Maribyrnong and the current Leader of the House want to do in taking water without making efficiencies. The Victorian government are focused on pinching water out of the basin and giving it to Melbourne. They want to take over 100 gigalitres of water a year-and I am sure the member for Murray will touch on this-but over twice that is currently being put into the sea from Melbourne as waste water. Why don't they concentrate on that? But no, they cannot get it around their heads that by flogging water out of the basin and taking it to Melbourne they are creating greater pressures on the Murray-Darling Basin. We all know that water is under more pressure than it has ever been. Look at the storages. Both the Dartmouth and the Hume reservoirs-the two biggest reservoirs-are under 20 per cent still, and it is not looking good at the moment despite the rain. The rain has not been in the catchment, and that is something you can tell your leaders. Look at the facts, the figures and what is happening and, for heaven's sake, go out there and tell the people in the towns, not just the farmers or the irrigators who are so dependent upon this system. Ask people in Adelaide what they think about the need for water in the Murray River and I think you will find that they are pretty interested in it. When you have the minister for water and even her staff refusing to talk to the people most concerned with what happens to the irrigation industry, it is a worry. That she has not given any indication of where she wants to go in the future is a worry, because if they take that water without letting people make efficiencies on farm infrastructure or whatever it might be then they are going to create higher food prices, more inflation and a bad effect on the economy, as I said before. Our plan was going to help the irrigation industry, make savings, help their production, increase their efficiency and, at the same time, look after the nation.",51
148,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is entertaining to hear a member of the National Party bemoan the current state of the Murray-Darling Basin. It is precisely on the watch of members opposite that the Murray-Darling Basin has been trashed. It is precisely as a result of the policies that you have pursued that the Murray-Darling has deteriorated to its present sorry state. The National Party, right throughout, has been running interference on the measures needed to generate environmental flows and to protect the Murray-Darling Basin, and the member for Calare continued to run interference this afternoon on the measures needed to save the Murray-Darling Basin. As a result, we find the Murray-Darling Basin afflicted by rising levels of salinity, algal blooms, the loss of river red gum species, the loss of waterbirds and a Murray mouth which requires dredging in order to keep the mouth open-in other words, it is a river system which is on life support. The honourable member has the gall to refer to the quality of drinking water for the city of Adelaide. It is Adelaide which has suffered as a result of the policies and neglect of the Howard government, yet the member for Calare has the gall to come in here and say that we ought to do more about the Murray-Darling Basin. It is members opposite who have run interference on all measures needed to protect the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. Members opposite and members of the National Party have sat on their hands while the Murray-Darling and the rest of this country have suffered from the effects of climate change. I draw to the attention of the House the figures from the two-year period to November 2007, which recorded the lowest ever inflow to the Murray River. Inflows during this period were 43 per cent lower than the previous record low, which occurred at the end of 1938. The CSIRO estimates that, if these sorts of trends continue, by 2030 the Ovens River will have a 27 per cent reduction, the Gwydir River a 10 per cent reduction and the Wimmera River a 50 per cent reduction. This will be catastrophic for the Murray-Darling Basin, yet members opposite sat on their hands over the course of 10 years and were completely inactive, completely passive, on the issue of climate change. When I saw this MPI topic-‘The failure of the government to implement effective climate and water programs'-I was amused. I thought there must have been a typo. Surely the resolution would have made sense if it read, ‘The failure of the Howard government to implement effective climate and water programs'. It is truly remarkable to hear the member for Flinders, having been in this place for the best part of a decade of shameful inaction, spouting the need for effective climate and water programs. Talk about a road to Damascus conversion. What a difference an election makes! The Australian people might well wonder just when the Liberal and National parties were going to implement effective climate and water programs-it did not happen in year 1, year 2, year 3, year 4, year 5, year 6 or year 7, and it did not happen in years 8, 9, 10 or 11. So we can suppose that it was going to happen in year 12-that they had a year 12 agenda to do something about climate change and water. The member for Flinders asks the nation to take seriously his claim that the Liberal Party would have tackled global warming if only it had been re-elected for its 12th year. There are three issues that are litmus tests for whether you are serious about tackling global warming, whether it is just posturing or whether it is a fraud. The first test is this: global warming is an international problem. Carbon is no respecter of national boundaries so, if we are going to tackle it, we have to tackle it through collective international endeavour. The forum for that is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and, in particular, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Astonishingly, the previous government, having negotiated a good deal for Australia back in 1997, ratted on the deal, refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol and proceeded to go around doing everything it could to scuttle and undermine collective international endeavours to tackle climate change. At a time when the science was becoming increasingly clear, and the need for action ever more urgent, the previous government were not merely sitting on their hands but doing everything they could to undermine collective international action. They were living in some kind of bizarre fantasy world in which Australia was located on a planet other than Earth, where we were immune from the effects of global warming. Nothing could more dramatically demonstrate the fact that they are the party of the past and we are the party of the future than the first action of the incoming Labor government: the ratification of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. We showed that we are part of the international solution, whereas those opposite are part of the problem. The second test of whether you are fair dinkum about climate change is to put a price on carbon. Unfortunately we have gone through a period where we have treated the earth as a business in liquidation. We have not put a value on a healthy and functioning atmosphere. The level of carbon has risen from 280 parts per million in pre-industrial times to 380 parts per million as at 2005. It expected to rise to 500, 600, even 700 parts per million, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Scientists tell us that we need to contain the carbon levels and, in order to do that, we need to put a price on carbon. Labor have committed to doing that. We have committed to the introduction of an emissions trading regime. Those opposite said, ‘Oh yes, we have committed to an emissions trading regime as well.' They did it last year-another eleventh-hour road to Damascus conversion-but if you are going to have an emissions trading regime, it has to be built around a target. It cannot be fair dinkum unless there is a target. Labor committed to reducing our carbon emissions by 60 per cent, from year 2000 levels, by the year 2050. We put in place a target. Those opposite did not put in place a target, and they still have not put in place a target. This is just nonsense. If you went to the election and said, ‘We're going to change the school funding system and we'll give you the detail after the election,' there would be outrage and there would be uproar. Or if you said, ‘We're going to change the private health insurance arrangements; we'll give you the details after the election,' there would be uproar, and so there should be. But those opposite attempted to perpetrate a fraud on the Australian people, going to the election without nominating any target for carbon reductions into the future. Until the member for Flinders nominates a target he cannot and will not be taken seriously by the Australian people so far as his bona fides on climate change are concerned. The third area in which you can tell whether somebody is serious and fair dinkum about climate change is renewable energy. The previous government had a renewable energy target, but it was so ineffectual that the proportion of renewable energy actually declined during their period in ofis fice. By contrast, we have set for ourselves a target of 20 per cent renewable energy by the year 2020-a challenging target, but one which is necessary and one which will benefit the Australian economy, because there are jobs in renewable energy and there is regional development in renewable energy. Those opposite failed to set a target. They ran interference on wind farms. They said, ‘We'll block the south Gippsland wind farm at Bald Hills because it might endanger the orange-bellied parrot,' even though one had not been sighted in the area for 50 years. That was the kind of interference that they ran on wind energy. At least the member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition have been out there trying; the rest of them are busy playing the blame game about who lost the 2007 election. There they are; they are trying. They a dynamic duo-Batman and Robin-but I suspect they will be unsuccessful. There are too many sceptics on that side, too many doubters, for them to produce the serious policies which are needed to tackle the major challenge which Australia and the rest of the world faces in relation to global warming and which the Labor government is committed to tackling. (Time expired)",53
149,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to say that a matter of extreme public importance is the fact that we have the failure of this government to implement effective climate and water programs. In the budget address-in-reply last year Mr Rudd, in what was one of his first major speeches as Leader of the Opposition, very tentatively said, ‘Well, yes, we need to deal with the challenge of climate change and the water crisis before the costs of inaction become too great.' Now we are looking for the Rudd government action. There have been a few months of Rudd government now. We had a lot of expectations built during the campaign that this government would be serious about climate change and water. What has it done? Very simply, it has signed Kyoto-a very easy thing to do. In government, we the coalition led the climate change umbrella group with the minister of the day, Robert Hill. We introduced as an issue carbon sequestration through vegetation into the whole Kyoto debate. We also, as leader of the umbrella group, tried very hard to bring in the developing nations to the whole Kyoto agreement arena, knowing that, no matter what the developed nations did, their efforts would be completely subsumed by the emissions from the developing nations over a very short period of time. We knew it would have been dead easy simply to sign Kyoto and look as if we were serious. We knew it was much more imporare tant to use our weight to change our own domestic economy. We had a coal dependent energy driven economy that we had to manage very carefully while bringing ourselves to achieve the Kyoto target. We made the point in the international community that Kyoto was not good enough without the developing nations. That is what we did, and we achieved international acclaim for that stand. We introduced the first Greenhouse Office, for example-the first in the world funded with over $1 billion. We made, as you are aware, such a careful response that our economy continued to thrive. We had employment grow through that time. We had new industries come to this country and invest with security, knowing that the hands on the wheel were steady. They knew that we understood climate change but would balance it with the needs of the economy. We also, during our period of office, funded the largest and most significant natural resource management program this nation had ever seen. It was called the Natural Heritage Trust. We also, several years later, introduced the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, the NAP. As we speak, there are about 15 regional catchment management authorities staring down insolvency and having to sack many workers because this government has refused to say anything at all about the future funding of the Natural Heritage Trust. Come on; it cannot be that hard. We had a multibilliondollar program that was right throughout Australia. We know that it did enormous good in terms of biodiversity protection and water quality protection. Minister Garrett, you cannot organise yourself to tell the Australians who delivered this program on our behalf what you are going to do with it. These catchment management authorities, who delivered this program on behalf of us and our state colleagues, are, as ing down insolvency. Read about it in the ANAO report just delivered. They are having to sack their workers, presumably because the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has not got around to thinking about it. Or perhaps he just does not understand. Let me say, too, that we introduced the National Water Initiative. It has been referred to by my colleague the member for Calare. We understood the failure of Federation, where we had four state governments, a territory government and the Commonwealth presiding over a dog's breakfast of different water laws, different water allocation systems, different property rights-all of them in there-trying to manage one ecosystem. Successive Labor governments at the federal level had never tackled this Murray-Darling Basin problem, and the wall-to-wall state Labor governments in the basin have continued to use that basin in a profligate way, not dealing with the overallocations, not dealing with our National Water Initiative in a proper way when we put it on the table. In particular, the government of Victoria said, ‘It's a good idea, but we're not signing up.' Mr Rudd, I have to give him credit, did say",56
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will refer to the Prime Minister by his title.,57
151,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I beg your pardon. Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, did announce in his budget address-in-reply speech that he would build bipartisan support for a national consensus around this Murray-Darling Basin initiative. He has failed. (Time expired)",57
152,Ms GEORGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I want to complete this debate on the MPI by restating the words that were used by the shadow minister for climate change, environment and urban water in introducing the I said, stardebate today. He said: Climate change is real. It is important. It is significant. But it takes substance, not symbols … On this side of the House I think we can all agree with the sentiments expressed by the shadow minister, but the great tragedy for our nation and the great tragedy for the international community is that over 11 long years those sentiments were never translated into any decisive action on the part of the Howard government. The last speaker really should reflect on the fact that this is the first week of the 42nd Parliament, the first week of the Rudd Labor government in power. I would argue, and I think the Australian community accepts, that the Labor Party and the Labor government are doing a lot more in terms of practical policies and proposals to address an issue that is of great concern to the whole community. I have no doubt that the environment and the dangerous impact of climate change were very high on the list of issues that saw the defeat of the Howard government and the election of the Rudd Labor government. That and Work Choices were the decisive issues that swung a lot of people out there in the community behind a very clearly articulated program and policy approach by the Rudd Labor team. I might say, for the new members present in the chamber, that it is really hard to contemplate but there are still members on the opposition benches who are sceptical about the science of climate change. I am delighted to see my new colleague the member for Lindsay in the chamber. The former member for Lindsay was one of the very notable people contributing to a minority report on a House of Representatives committee inquiry last year, together with the member for Tangney and others, who, even as late as late last year, doubted the science behind climate change and global warming. I think the opposition has a lot to answer for. It is a pity that the new shadow minister for the environment, who I think is genuinely quite sympathetic to the issues of climate change and global warming, was not in cabinet to convince the sceptics on the then government benches about the importance of this issue. The TV program last night was really fascinating. One of the fascinating points that came across was the rather belated acknowledgement by the former Treasurer that in hindsight, yes, the government should have ratified Kyoto. ‘In hindsight, yes,' he said, ‘we should have ratified Kyoto and we should have done it a lot earlier.' But the truth of the matter is that they did not. They had 11 long years to really get their act gether on an issue of substantial global chalbills. lenge and they failed the task. It is not surprising that they failed. They had a senior industry minister saying to Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program: I am a sceptic of the connection between emissions and climate change. Really, for a senior minister to profess to scepticism on this issue beggars belief. When Al Gore's movie An Inconvenient Truth was shown-and I think it was a very important consciousness-raising exercise-the same minister said of that really important documentary that it was ‘just entertainment'. The truth is that the people who were then on the government benches were well behind community opinion. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming, in the dying days of the Howard government, to acknowledge the importance of this issue. They have got a hide now to come into the chamber to try to castigate a government that is sitting in its first week. Within days of our election to office, the first official act of the new Rudd Labor government was the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. That was important because, for the first time, Australia had a seat at the table when it had previously been missing in action.",57

GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 18 February, on motion by Mr Hale: more That the Address be agreed to.",59
155,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,JOINT STANDING,"I continue my contribution to the address-in-reply. The second priority issue Grierson, Ms Saffin raised by GetUp! is making high-quality primary, secondary and tertiary public education accessible to all Australians. GetUp! wants public education at all levels to be Cheeseman, Mr Symon both world class and affordable. That means more funding to provide better trained and better paid professional teachers at all levels and ensuring the universal availability of education. It says it wants teachers to be better paid, the national curriculum more broad based and class sizes smaller. I note some recent survey work which suggests that perhaps the better pay issue might prove to be more important than smaller class sizes. The third issue raised by GetUp! relates to respecting the rights and improving the living standards of Indigenous Australians. GetUp! wants the new parliament to address Indigenous issues in both a symbolic and a practical way, seeing the two as intertwined and mutually dependent. I think that is spot on. It expects parliament to make it an urgent priority to close the 17-year life expectancy gap and to make vast improvements to health, education, housing and other areas to improve the living standards of Indigenous communities. It has a couple of quotes. Firstly: No Australian citizen should be living in third world conditions in a first world country. Secondly: It sends fundamental moral and ideological messages to inhabitants of this country and to the rest of the world about how we think about ourselves and treat all our citizens. As well as those three priority issues, GetUp! identified seven other issues to round up a top 10. No. 4 was making high-quality, prevention focused health care accessible to all, putting an end to the federal-state blame game, and also seeking to address the private-public health care disparity. No. 5 was combating entrenched poverty and narrowing the divide between the rich and the poor, with affordable housing being a focus. No. 6 was withdrawing the troops from Iraq and urging the United States to change its approach to the ‘war on terror'. It said: We want Australia to be a good global citizen ... We would prefer our resources be put into increasing our foreign aid as a percentage of GDP and working multilaterally to decrease global poverty. We expect future potential conflicts, such as Iran, to be resolved through the United Nations, not unilaterally. I read another quote: The current approach of the US in its war on terror is an absolute disaster for world peace, the lives of citizens and soldiers and human rights. Issue No. 7 was protecting our human rights and civil liberties. It is looking for equal rights and recognition of same-sex couples and for protections to extend to Indigenous people, asylum seekers and refugees, and the disenfranchised. No. 8 was improving community infrastructure and planning. GetUp! said: We want our taxes spent on community infrastructure and planning that improves and sustains our way of life. We want serious investment in public transport to both ease our environmental burden and allow equitable access to services for all-and we want support for it at a federal level. Issue No. 9 was the protection of workers' rights. It said: We want WorkChoices to be repealed as soon as possible, and in a comprehensive manner. We want fairness restored to employee/employer relationships-fair pay, fair protections from unfair dismissal and safe working conditions for all workers. The right to collectively bargain for conditions the majority of workers want should be restored. Finally, there was strengthening our democracy. GetUp! said: We need reforms to strengthen our democratic processes that increase government accountability and transparency. We want Freedom of Information laws brought to the highest international standards and steps taken to protect whistleblowers. It said we should restore political integrity and dramatically reduce the threshold for political donations and that bodies, such as the ABC and CSIRO, should be depoliticised. I think this is a very commendable set of propositions and priorities, but the more important thing is not so much whether or not I or other individual members of parliament agree with each of them but the fact that there has been a very constructive and creative process gone through by GetUp! involving tens of thousands Australians in thinking about the kind of country in which we live and the kind of country which we hand on to our children. I indicated in my opening remarks that we live in a time of big challenges. We have had discussions about global warming, and I certainly hope that we have more discussions about global warming. There is no doubt in my mind that it is a show stopper. The amount of carbon that we have managed to put into the atmosphere in the last couple of hundred years has changed the earth's climate and is continuing to change the earth's climate. The increased frequency and severity of floods, droughts, bushfires and storms will be no good for Australia and will have very deleterious impacts in other parts of the world. When we think about the melting of the polar caps, rising sea levels to the Great Barrier Reef from coral bleaching as a result of warmer water temperatures, increased typhoons, cyclones and hurricanes-the severity of those things-it is clear to me that action is needed urgently to deal with it. The proposals that the government has brought forward for international cooperation through the Kyoto protocol, an emissions-trading regime and increasing the renewable energy target are all important initiatives. There is a role for the whole community in doing everything it can at an individual and a collective level to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to move to more sustainable ways of living. One of the issues that I think we have failed to pursue adequately, both in Australia and in other countries, is the need to transition out of petrol. A couple of the new members of parliament made reference in their initial speeches to the fact that Australia and, indeed, many other countries have a great reliance and dependence on petrol. We can see the price of petrol rising dramatically but very little is being done to move us to a future in which we should be using other fuels. In Australia we have an LPG distribution system which is quite sophisticated and advanced. I have an LPG car and I have no difficulty finding places to fill it up. Indeed, Australia has great reserves of natural gas located off the North West Shelf. Those reserves of gas could, in my view, be made to serve a domestic Australian automotive industry. It would have major environmental benefits through dramatically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and it would also bring regional development benefits, jobs and reduced prices for motorists. It would give Australia more energy independence instead of being, as we currently are, at the mercy of the international price per barrel of crude oil. Transitioning out of petrol is an important policy and the threat area, in my view. I think we need to do much more by way of skilling young Australians. It is clear that there is a skills crisis and it is clear that it is generating inflationary pressures and pressures on interest rates. I believe that, rather than turning to skilled migration as the way to deal with this, what we should be doing is directly making the investment into educating and training our young Australians. The previous government had a lack of interest in and support for TAFE. They effectively undermined TAFE. We need to see more investment in TAFE colleges, secondary schools and universities to train young Australians and give us the skills to produce the kinds of economic activity which will support our ongoing economic prosperity and well-being. The agenda of the GetUp! people made reference to urban transport, and I want to register my support for that. It is an area that the last federal government had no involvement in whatsoever. The road budget, the AusLink programs, can be used to support urban public transport. When you look at the congestion in my own city of Melbourne and in Sydney and Brisbane, we could do better in terms of the way we move people around. This is from an environmental point of view and also from the point of view of the comfort of those concerned. It is certainly no to spend your life on the outer motorway trying to make your way into central Brisbane or other similar locations. This has been an area of neglect and it is something which the federal government could well be doing. There are important quality of life issues that we have not addressed as well as we should. There seems to be something of an epidemic of mental health issues amongst our young people. It saddens me to see so much depression and anger management problems and body image issues amongst teenagers. We need to look at the causes of these problems and what we as a community can do to assist people who are experiencing mental health problems by tackling the causes and providing better support for them. There are issues surrounding obesity. It is quite remarkable to hear that we may now be coming to the first generation of Australians who have a lesser life expectancy than the generation before them. We are accustomed to improvements in our health and living standards, yet we have allowed lifestyle issues like diet and exercise to contribute to obesity in a way which is prejudicial to the health of the next generation of Australians. In my view, the obsession of young Australians with the internet and computers and the like contributes to obesity and represents a social problem that we need to recognise and tackle. There are groups of Australians who have fared poorly under the previous government, and I hope that they will do better during the life of this parliament. There has been a lot said about the Aboriginal people, the Indigenous people, and how they have suffered. What we have seen in the last week has been amazing and wonderful, and I hope it leads to better things for Aboriginal people in the future. I think our support for and relationships fun with the people of the Third World need to be better and closer. We can do more in terms of our aid budget and what we do to assist Third World countries, particularly in terms of moving to sustainable energy paths, having regard to the challenge of climate change. Those opposite always present themselves as the party of small business, but in practice they do nothing for them. What they gave them during the life of the Howard government was red tape and the GST. I think we can do more to support small business, particularly in their dealings with larger business. Some singles and some older people have not received the sort of support and acknowledgement to which they are entitled, and I hope that they fare better under this government, during the life of this parliament. Above all else, I hope that we regularly ask ourselves the question: what kind of world are we leaving to our young people? I hope that we resolve that we will not pass on to our young people a country and a world which are in poorer shape than when they were passed on to us.",59
156,Mrs MAY,JOINT STANDING,"The Australian parliament is the centre of Australia's democracy, which has been forged over more than a century without bloodshed and without civil wars, just robust campaignsthough some of us would certainly say we endured a civil war in the election campaign and the lead-up to the election on 24 November. Changes in governments are made by the will of the people, and last November we saw a change of government for only the sixth time in 60 years. Unlike the people of so many other countries around the world, we as a people should be proud of our robust and strong democracy and the manner in which we peacefully transition from one government to another-although that does not mean that the change did not bring some sadness to me personally and to many of my colleagues. My win was bittersweet, with the loss of so many wonderful colleagues who fought the hard fight and have not returned to this place. I am proud of the fact that I was a member of the government that was supported by so many Australian people. Millions of people-in fact around 47 per cent of the Australian people-voted for the return of the Howard government, but sadly not enough. However, as we embark on the 42nd Parliament and we welcome the new members on both sides to this place, it is important that the positive legacies of the Howard government are not forgotten. There is no doubt our history will be debated and written about for years, but I think it is important that the history that is recorded and commented on truly reflects our achievements. The incoming Rudd government certainly has inherited strong foundations on which to build the future achievements of this country, and quite frankly it is time it started building and implementing its policy agenda and stopped the stunts and rhetoric. It is time it moved on. Make no mistake: we will be challenging and questioning as it proceeds to implement its policy agenda and its election promises. Apart from my very deep disappointment that the Howard government did not get re-elected, I am very proud of being re-elected as the member for MCPherson. It is truly an honour and a privilege to, once again, for my fourth term, be representing the people of MCPherson. I say to the people of MCPherson: I will not let you down. I will remain a strong and demanding advocate to ensure MCPherson is not forgotten by the new Labor government and, to that end, I will ensure Labor promises are kept to ensure that our community remains strong and prosperous, older Australians are cared for, our young are given every opportunity to achieve their full potential and business continues to work in a strong economy that will ensure its success. Not a member of this House was successful at the last election without the help of a strong team of volunteers and supportersand I am no different. I did not win MCPherson on my own. I was helped by many wonderful people who gave their time and energy to ensure we kept MCPherson in Liberal hands, and today I want to pay tribute to some particular individuals and say thank you to the hundreds of people who worked on election day manning the booths on what was a very hot day in Queensland. In particular, I want to put on the record my sincere thanks to some very special people. Scott Paterson, my treasurer, had the unenviable task of raising the funds that were needed to mount the campaign. To Scott and his wife, Claudette, I say a very sincere thankyou. I also say thank you to the rest of the team who manned the shopping centres, manned the street stalls, worked in my office, stuffed the envelopes and answered the phones. Karen and Emma Andrews, a wonderful mother and daughter team, were with me every Saturday in shopping centres-and they even dragged along Chris, Karen's husband, one day. Valerie and Albert Aumann were always there at those shopping centre visits. Thank you to Greer Waters and John Strickland. Sandy Brennan and Michelle Nassoor worked tirelessly on election day delivering the food and drinks to all the workers. Annette and Bruce PoppettAnnette worked in the office and the two of them also delivered food on election day. Helen Mills, a wonderful cook, brought the food into the office to keep the staff going and also delivered food on election day. Anne Philips, a wonderful supporter and volunteer in my office to this day, has been there for a long time and was wonderful on the computer with her data entry, supporting the staff and also working on election day. On election night we needed to feed hundreds of supporters, and I thank Judi and Mike Walsh and Jocelyn and Steve Penwarden for the wonderful effort in cooking the barbecue and feeding hundreds of workers on election night. We were all pretty bruised and battered from a very long day in the sun, and they did a remarkable job. I cannot name all the people who helped us. It was a very tough campaign. We had been on the campaign trail for months. But to all of those who helped-all those Liberal Party branch members and all the supporters from my community-I say a very sincere thankyou. I would like to reflect on a few of the jects in my electorate that I would like to committed to by the new Labor government. I was buoyed yesterday to hear the government has announced an infrastructure audit and the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. This is an important step forward in identifying those areas of infrastructure we certainly need-and on the Gold Coast we need roads. The last federal government did make a commitment of $120 million to build the Tugun Bypass, and in the lead-up to the last election day made a commitment of $455 million for the upgrade of the M1. I want to see the commitment to fund the upgrade of the M1 made clear by the new Labor government. The $455 million funding announcement during the campaign was great news for Gold Coast residents. The M1 is the major gateway from northern New South Wales, and we should be driving on the Tugun Bypass, which is nearing completion, by the middle of this year. With the rapidly growing population and the completion of the stadium at Robina, sections of the Pacific Highway will face further congestion and increasing demands well into the future. Funding for this project will meet the challenges and the demands of growth that we are seeing in our city. One of the city's most pressing road bottlenecks is the M1, and I hope that the new Labor government will match the $455 million funding that we committed to see that that upgrade does take place. I call on the new Labor government to match that funding with Anna Bligh's state government in Queensland. I would also like to put on record the success of the Black Spot Program and the Roads to Recovery program, which saw a lot of our local roads upgraded in our city. They were both extremely successful programs. It would be great to see them continue. I think it is important for our local governments to have support from our federal government to promeet the demands of cities like the Gold see Coast, with its growing population and growing need for those roads to be upgraded. We just heard from the last speaker, the member for Wills, about the skills shortage in this country, and there is no doubt we are facing a skills shortage. I recently had the pleasure of launching the 2008 academic year for the Gold Coast Australian Technical College. This was committed to by the last federal government. We have opened the doors and I am delighted to say that 150 new students will be going through that new Australian Technical College. The college was announced last year by the former federal government. Of course, it was great news for the young students and for employers in particular on the Gold Coast. It will go a long way to ensuring that those skills shortages that we are facing in our city will be met. The physical building will be completed by the middle of this year and, as I said, it will cater for 150 students who will complete grades 11 and 12 in English, maths, business and information technology. The campus will provide on-site facilities for the range of crucial trades offered by the college, including commercial cookery, plastering and small group testing in automotive, metal and engineering, building and construction. The students will spend four weeks at the college undertaking academic studies, followed by four weeks in industry off site. This pattern repeats itself for the last two years of the students' schooling. On completion, the students are then placed in businesses as full-time apprentices. Positions are available to all students on the Gold Coast from both independent and non-independent schools. I understand the criteria and the competition for entering the college were pretty stiff. I know Mark Hands and his team went through an interview process. They wanted to ensure that the students who were enrolling in the college were committed to what they were doing and committed to their future. I would like to place on record today my best wishes to Mark Hands and to those 150 students I met a couple of weeks ago and wish them every success for the future. We have heard from the incoming Labor government that the Investing in Our Schools Program will be scrapped. It will be replaced by an education revolution. Schools on the southern Gold Coast will be worse off under Labor's decision to scrap the successful Investing in Our Schools Program. The Labor government will abolish the $1.2 billion program to pay for its election promise to put computers and trade centres in secondary schools. In the electorate of MCPherson, around $1.6 million has been provided through the program to approximately 30 schools to fix projects it decided were a priority. Up to $150,000 in funding was made available to each of these schools to fix everything from run-down toilets and classrooms to funding upgrades of playgrounds and IT equipment. The program has been a huge success in MCPherson and, with schoolchildren, P&Cs and the local community enthusiastically getting behind the projects, tangible results have been achieved that advance the education and well-being of our young students. Schools such as Burleigh Heads State School, Clover Hill State School and Caningeraba State School-all junior primary schools-received record amounts of funding to fix a lot of problems. School communities on the southern Gold Coast have particularly relied on this funding to make up for state government shortfalls. A strength of the Investing in Our Schools Program has been that the schools themselves identified the projects that would be of most benefit to individual schools, not some bureaucrat in Canberra making blind decisions. The government's decision to scrap this incredibly successful program is short sighted, in my view, and indeed runs counter to their so-called education revolution. Primary schools in MCPherson particularly will be hit hard because they will miss out on Labor's funding for the education revolution, which is particularly for high schools and for the planned trade centres. I do ask: how will primary schools in MCPherson address the shortfalls in funding for the infrastructure they so desperately need? Most people in this place know of my involvement with the Titans Rugby League Football Club. In fact, I was one of those in the original bid teams when we went after the 16th rugby league licence for the Gold Coast city, and we were successful. This year we start with our first game on 14 March in round 1, and we will be playing the Cowboys. So I think we Queenslanders will be barracking one end to the Mr Neumann interjecting",62
157,Mrs MAY,JOINT STANDING,"No-go the Titans! What will be very exciting for the Titans is that, on 14 March, we will be playing at Skilled Park, our brand-new stadium. There is a very special ceremony happening in April. We actually take on the New Zealand Warriors on the weekend of 25-27 April. At that game we will be stopping and remembering our ANZACs. I think it is fitting that on that weekend we will be planting a lone pine. It will be planted in a place of remembrance that we can use for ceremonies on important days. Of course, most members in this House would know that Lone Pine was the scene of one of the fiercest hand-to-hand battles of World War I and took its name from the single tree left standing after Turkish soldiers had cleared the plateau to make roofs for the trenches. During the withdrawal, a soldier picked up a pine cone, which his aunt then propagated at home in Victoria. Gradually, more trees grown from the original pine were propagated. I want to put on the record today my thanks to Norm Smith. He is one of my Vietnam War veterans. He has been raising a lone pine which will eventually be located outside Skilled Park on that very special April weekend. Thank you, Norm. Mr Speaker, I note you have just taken the chair. Welcome and congratulations! Last week was Organ Donor Awareness Week, and we celebrated here in the parliament the gift of life. There are in fact 1,875 people who are still waiting for organ transplants in this country. It is very significant that only 198 people signed up last year for organ donation. Those waiting lists keep growing. I would say to all Australians and to the federal government: let us make a massive effort to ensure that Australians are aware of what they have to do to ensure they are on that donor list. In my electorate of MCPherson a very special young man received a heart-lung transplant. It turned his life around. Chris Wills now has a life because of the gift of life. I would say to all members in this place: see what you can do about raising the awareness of organ donation in your electorates. Security in our communities is also something that really concerns me. My electorate, like many electorates around Australia, has concerns about hooning, graffiti and antisocial behaviour. The advent of CCTV has certainly allowed us to make great steps in ensuring that people in our communities can live safely knowing that those cameras are trained on antisocial people. I say to the incoming Labor government: give some thought to security in our communities and to setting up a fund whereby each of us can identify those areas of concern in our community and ensure that people can live safely and walk our streets knowing that any antisocial behaviour is going to be tracked by CCTV cameras. In the short time left to me today, I would like to say how proud I am to have been named the shadow minister for ageing. This is an area that has been of particular interest to me over a number of years. I was a member of the health policy committee when I was in government. Now, as shadow minister for ageing, I look forward to working with the Minister for Ageing to ensure that the elderly residents of this country and our older Australians are ageing with dignity. We certainly have some challenges ahead of us. We know that we have an ageing population. We need to ensure that those people have services and infrastructure in place so that they can age with dignity. I look forward to those challenges. I am very much into active ageing and I will certainly be putting forward some programs to encourage the older Australians in our community to take some care of themselves and take responsibility for some of their lifestyle choices. All of us in the House today could stop and think about the lifestyle choices we make. We know that obesity is on the rise in this country, cancer is on the rise in this country and diabetes is on the rise in this country. Each and every one of us has a part to play in ensuring that older Australians in our community do something about those lifestyle choices. Each and every one of us can set some examples in that way. Once again, to the people of MCPherson: thank you for your support. I thank you for the trust you have put in me in electing me to represent you once again in the federal parliament. To the incoming new members: I wish you every success in your new careers. It is an honour and a privilege to sit in this place. It is something I will never take for granted, and I hope that each and every one of you will get the satisfaction and the rewards that come with this job. It is hard work representing your constituents-we are going to sit that extra day; we all know about our five days a week. We on this side are, of course, committed to doing that, to representing our constituents in this House. It rewarding profession, and I think you will gain a lot more from it if you put something into it. I wish all those new members well and I thank the people of MCPherson for the trust in me they have shown in re-electing me to the federal parliament.",66
158,The SPEAKER,JOINT STANDING,"Order! Before I call Ms Rea, I remind honourable members that this is her first speech. I therefore ask that the usual courtesies be extended to her.",67
159,Ms REA,JOINT STANDING,"I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land upon which we are gathered here today and the traditional owners of the land which is covered by the electorate of Bonner, the Quandamooka and Jagera peoples. I wish to acknowledge elders past and present and, in so doing, make special mention of the late Neville Bonner, the first Indigenous member of parliament, a true gentleman and a great Queenslander. Mr Speaker, may I also congratulate you on your election to this very significant office. Only 1,059 people have sat in the federal parliament since Federation and, of that 1,059, only 78 have been women. When you consider the millions of Australians who have contributed over the last 107 years to making this country what it is today, I am humbled by the incredible honour and opportunity I have been granted by the people of Bonner and Australia. Democracy is a wonderful thing. It is highly likely that the next United States President will be either an African-American man or a white woman. In Australia, our Prime Minister and Treasurer are two blokes from Nambour called Kevin and Wayne. The last election was clearly a call by the Australian people to restore our democratic system of government as a positive force for change. For its health and vitality, its equitable progress and advancement, our system of govis a ernment depends on an open, transparent and accountable political process, a robust opposition and a concerned and informed public. These are the foundations not only to make democracy work but to make democracy matter to citizens of our nation. Our democracy must be robust to survive and succeed. It can only be so if all its citizens are able to participate freely, fairly and to their full potential. That is why the next step for our ever-evolving democracy must be reconciliation between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples of Australia. When prejudice and economic or social disadvantage prevent even one person from participating in society then we are all weakened. As the great Martin Luther King Jr said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' Last Wednesday, the Prime Minister moved a formal apology to the stolen generations. It was an important step in achieving reconciliation, an important step to begin the process of healing the rift that has existed too long between Australians. It was a day that made me so proud to be a member of the first Labor government in almost 12 years. For me, personally, there was no more poignant moment. My mother is now 88, the same age as many of the members of the stolen generations who sat in this parliament last Wednesday. Ten years ago my siblings and I discovered that her grandmother, Nellie Richards, was an Aboriginal woman from Central Queensland. It has made us all keenly aware of how different her life and my mother's life could have been. The focus of the day was deliberately and quite rightly the apology to Indigenous Australians. Further to this, we must also recognise the importance of this day for our whole nation and its democratic traditions. Reconciliation is vital, not just to acknowledge the wrongs Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have suffered in the past; it is also important for non-Indigenous Australians. Until we recognise that we are not two separate peoples simply inhabiting the same continent, we are denying a fundamental part of our social development. Our language, our placenames and our music have all been influenced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. We share a history and we must embrace that with pride. For nearly 12 years, all of us as a nation have been subjected to the most cynical use of our democratic sensibilities. They have been used to divide and drive wedges between us, but last Wednesday the people of Australia-all over Australia-came out of their homes in their thousands to acknowledge the government's apology. It was proof that for so long we have been waiting for a chance to unite in a common cause, to feel whole rather than a mixture of different parts. We demonstrated the Australian generosity of spirit and the fundamental belief that working collectively, whether it is in the for workplace or on the lawn of Parliament House, is a far better way for us all to individually succeed. The corrosive politics of division that played on suspicion and fear are gone. The setting against each other of workers, practitioners of different faiths and citizens from differing ethnic backgrounds is gone and, ultimately, the refusal to acknowledge our responsibility and to show true respect for the Indigenous people of this country is also gone. It felt like a breath of fresh air, and the nation collectively breathed it and sighed with relief. Up to this point, most of my working life has been devoted to serving the people of Brisbane as a city councillor. Building a city is similar to building a nation. It is the best way to learn how government and our democratic system work best to provide the community with the basic services and infrastructure they need to go about their daily lives. It taught me a lot. I have learned that building a community is about investing in the people that live there. It is about providing the infrastructure, both physical and social, that enables everyone to develop the lifestyle that best suits them. If there is one lesson you learn from local government, it is a sense of reality. You are transported from the theatre of parliamentary politics and planted right in the middle of someone's backyard or even their street. You quickly learn that no problem is too big or too small, and playing the blame game matters nought to someone who cannot sleep because of their neighbour's barking dog. Of course, being a member of the Brisbane City Council is a unique experience in local government. It is the largest council in the country, covering the whole metropolitan area of the city, with a budget of over $2 lion. Serving with Brisbane City Council was an experience that taught me the value of being involved at the grassroots of a local community. I would like here to acknowledge my friend Jim Soorley, a person who led by action, a true visionary and, I believe, one of the best lord mayors Brisbane has ever had. He set out to transform Brisbane. In the 13 years that I was part of the Labor council led by Jim, I grew up-and so did Brisbane. The city emerged from having a sleepy, country town image to become the bustling, cosmopolitan, modern city it is today. Much of the urban renewal that occurred in Brisbane was, of course, driven by the visionary Building Better Cities program initiated by then Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe. This program invested federal government money into local government areas, enabling valuable inner-city landtraditionally, industrial areas now redundant-to be redeveloped into new suburbs. They were strategically planned to include affordable housing and community infrastructure, creating a village-like atmosphere in the middle of a major city. Indeed, it was the achievements of the Brisbane City Council and my passion for local government that had a strong influence on my decision to enter the federal parliament. It is at this level of governance in our country that the lack of Commonwealth government investment in our cities and regions over the last 11 years has been keenly felt. I look forward to seeing a revitalised relationship between the federal government and local councils to deliver the infrastructure required to build even better communitiesinvest federally; think locally. I know that this government appreciates the local knowledge and expertise that local councils can bring to ensuring that Infrastructure Australia invests most effectively. So I say to my former council colleagues: I look forward to bilcontinuing to work with you to deliver for Bonner. I will never forget the lessons I learnt at the coalface. These experiences have brought me here as the representative for Bonner, one of the most interesting electorates in the country. It covers the south-eastern suburbs of Brisbane, from the city's southern border to the river, so, like the Prime Minister, I am a proud southsider. I often describe Bonner as ‘the lungs of Brisbane'. On three sides it is bordered by significant waterways: Brisbane River, Tingalpa Creek and Moreton Bay. From Mount Gravatt, in the south-west, to Moreton Bay run several major creek catchments, protected by large tracts of bushland. Then there is Moreton Island, which boasts the largest sand dunes in the world. This is all within an electorate fully contained within the fastest growing capital city in the country. What a privilege and a challenge it will be to represent. It is why signing the Kyoto protocol was so important to the Bonner community, and I thank the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts for taking such a strong stance on commercial whaling. The islands of Moreton Bay are home to some of the best whale-watching sites in the country. Of course, Bonner's charm is not just its landscape; it is also the people. Around the bay side are some of the oldest suburbs in Brisbane, where a largely elderly population are facing the challenges that being elderly brings. The middle suburbs of the electorate are growing as fast as the rest of south-east Queensland. The suburb of Wakerley alone has become home to an extra 3,500 people just over the last three years. That is a lot of working families needing the physical and social infrastructure that more established suburbs take for granted, while trying to cope with rising mortgage payments. Homelessness is increasing. Many residents live in public housing and many are struggling to survive in an increasingly competitive rental market. The most encouraging elements of the strengths of a thriving democracy are the ideals of justice, equity and a fair go and ing those ideals practically implemented to extend and encourage the voice of those we represent in this House. The new priorities committed to by the Rudd government are reflected as welcome developments for Bonner. That is why the Prime Minister's focus on housing affordability and infrastructure was welcomed by the whole community. I look forward to working with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing to deliver a range of solutions that will assist the residents of Bonner to move more freely through all levels of the housing sector. These include policies that will address the causes of homelessness, rental assistance for those who wish to move into the private rental market but cannot, and the very innovative First Home Saver Account scheme that will enable so many more people to purchase their first home. This will mean that the prosperity that comes from the significant pace of population growth in south-east Queensland can be shared by all. The residents of Bonner are a socially diverse group. From a significant Indigenous population through to all the communities who came here post war and the most newly-arrived refugees from Africa, this electorate is a snapshot of migration in Australia. I am pleased to be part of a new government that will build opportunities for all Australians. The government's focus on education will ensure this. And I look forward to the education revolution beginning with the completion of the school hall at Gumdale State School. As only the second federal member for Bonner, I wish to acknowledge the first, Ross Vasta, and thank him for the positive and cordial manner in which he conducted the campaign. I also wish to acknowledge the Hon. Con Sciacca, the former member seefor Bowman, whose seat was redistributed. He contributed so much to this parliament and his local community. I also wish to make mention of my good friend Garrie Gibbon, the former member for Moreton, who is in the gallery today. I simply do not have the time to name individually all those wonderful people who helped win the seat of Bonner for the Labor Party or all the family and friends who have been the means of encouragement and inspiration throughout my life. However, there are a few to whom I would like to express my thanks here today. I will begin by thanking the Whitlam government. It enabled me to attend university; it improved the status of women that gave my generation opportunities never experienced before; and it had the foresight to provide affordable and accessible childcare, which allowed me to have a career and children. Without these reforms I do not believe I would be here today. I would like to thank the nuns of Mount Carmel College Wynnum, who tolerated my rebelliousness whilst instilling in me and my fellow students the notion that women can do anything as long as they have a good education and keep their hemlines below their knees. I would like to thank my first boss and mentor, Ann Warner, who has never let me forget my principles and values and whose integrity as a person and as a politician will always be my benchmark. I would like to thank the many committed workers in the Your Rights at Work campaign, particularly the coordinator in the Bonner area, Barry Welch-a true community champion. I thank him and his many volunteers for demonstrating that the trade union movement has a long and proud history in community activity and community advocacy and for giving those workers in Bonner most disadvantaged by Work Choices a voice and a sense of hope. To Mike Nicholls, my campaign director, I owe a special debt of thanks. Managing a candidate as well as a large group of volunteers is not the easiest thing to do. But, Mike, you did it with grace and authority and earned much respect as a result. To Greg Laumann and the Bonner campaign committee, I say thank you. I am indebted to your tireless commitment and support-in particular, Lynne Maree Lewis and her husband, Martin, whose presence at a campaign meeting with a full pot of freshly made pasta sauce for my family sustained us for about three days. I also thank state members Phil Reeves and Paul Lucas, who, despite their own senior government roles, went out of their way to assist in any way that they could. My staff, who are in the gallery, were also supportive friends and volunteers throughout the campaign. They are Melissa Webster, Michelle Curran, Toby Broughton and Susan O'Connor, without whom the campaign office would not have functioned, and Lynne Moffat, Christine Cosgrove and Darren Godwell. I wish to make special mention of Glenda Venn. Glenda and I have worked together in my capacity as a councillor for 17 years, and we have gone through many political and personal upheavals together. Glenda alleges that she is retiring by the end of the year. Just in case we are unable to talk her out of it, I wish to put on record my deepest and sincerest thanks for her loyalty, her support, her sanity, her incredible ability to organise my chaos and, most importantly, her friendship. At this point I would also like to mention her husband, Graham, and his friend Tony Watson, who are listening today. My thanks also go to my campaign organiser, friend, mentor and sounding board, Lindesay Jones and his wife, Norma. Those who know him know that I could not have been blessed with a better campaigner. Lindesay's passion for the Labor Party, combined with his sporting coach background, has made him one of the most successful campaigners Queensland has ever produced. To the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party, in particular, state secretary, Milton Dick, I say thank you and wish you well in your new career-a great choice. My deepest thanks and love go to my three children-Emma, Charlotte and Liam. Their love and support keeps me going. They keep me grounded and remind me that, whatever my day job is, my most important and enduring role will always be as their mother. My husband, Ian, is in the gallery today. When we met on a polling booth 20 years ago this year, neither of us would ever have imagined that we would be here together. We have shared so much-not just a love of politics. It is Ian's support, care and love that has enabled me to succeed. Not everyone is lucky enough to find their soul mate, and I am so grateful that I have. My wise and loving mother, Monica Rea, cannot be here today, but my brother Robert and sister Vicki are here on behalf of mum and my four other siblings-that is seven altogether, if you cannot count. It is very special to have them here. In conclusion, I wish to dedicate this speech to my father, Jack. For the first 21 years of my life until his early death from cancer he was not only my father; he was my best friend. He instilled in me a deep respect for the Labor Party and its values. He gave me a sense of humour based on never taking yourself too seriously. Even though it is over 24 years since his death, I still seek his proval for everything I do because it was always so hard to attain. But today I think I can almost hear him say, ‘Well done, kid.'",67
160,Mr SECKER,JOINT STANDING,"I congratulate the new member for Bonner on her first speech in this parliament. Those of us who have been in this chamber for a while have seen some very good first speeches by new members on both sides of this parliament and it certainly augurs well for the future of this country when we have such good maiden speeches. I intend to raise several matters in the address-in-reply to the Governor General's address. It will be quite wide-ranging. I start off by talking about some information I have received, a scientific report on aerosol plumes and the cause of droughts and El Nino events by regional dimming. I do not profess to be a scientist, but the information that I have had explained to me makes me intuitively think that this is quite correct. I think it would be very important for the new environment minister to actually take notice of this report and get it assessed. I actually think it would probably take less than a week's assessment by a competent scientist, so it is not as if there would be great expense. I did seek leave of the previous person at the table on the government side to table the report and I seek leave for tabling that report. Leave granted.",72
161,Mr SECKER,JOINT STANDING,"I appreciate that leave being given. I think it is an important report. What it is basically saying, in rough layman's terms, is that things like volcanic ash or a lot of carbon particles in the air cause regional dimming. Obviously it will stop the sunlight coming through into the atmosphere below because it is blocked by these carbon or volcanic ash particles. Intuitively I think you can then say that it must have an effect ap- on the climate below that smog cloud, for want of a better phrase. What I think this report will show is that there is quite a causal effect on the drought that we had, especially last year, from the regional dimming caused by the fires in Indonesia, where they have been burning down the forests to plant palm trees for biodiesel production. It can be shown elsewhere in the world, such as in the Amazon forests or in the Sahara desert or the pollution that is being caused in China by the extra development, that this is actually having an effect on the climate. So I hope that the minister has an open mind on this and will read this report and get it assessed officially. I would suggest that the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology would be two government instrumentalities that would be very useful in assessing that report. It may come back that it is a very good report or it may not, but I think it is worth going through that assessment. It certainly was a very interesting campaign. I think anyone that gets involved in a campaign like the recent one realises that things can change, and they obviously have at the election. One of the issues that I want to address during this speech is the issue of climate change and in particular to consider scientific exposure of some of what I might call the colourful language that is being used on climate change. Perhaps we can quite reasonably challenge some of the doom-laden views often promulgated by alarmists. Again that happened today in question time when the minister for the environment talked about a four to six degree increase in global temperature. I do not think even the most rabid of the promoters of climate change or anyone in the IPCC report have even remotely suggested that we are going to increase the temperature by four to six degrees. I think at most we are talking about one degree or 1.5 degrees. Six degrees obviously would have an effect. I do not reject that we have climate change; I believe we have always had climate change. It has been going for thousands and thousands of years. If we want to look back at history, for example, around the 1300s the recorded temperatures were probably in the vicinity of two degrees warmer than we have now. As a result of that we were producing more food in Europe, where there was a much warmer period. Even if we have had a warming in the last 25 years, we preceded that by a cooling over 30 to 35 years, and that is just part of what mally happens. So I think we can question some of the statements that are made to suggest that the end is nigh. Before I say more on that, I would like to extend my thanks to the hard working Barker campaign team. Their dedication and assistance helped me to return to serve the people of Barker for a fourth term as a member of this House. This fantastic team has seen the electorate of Barker return my party in fine form. We did experience a swing against us, the first time since I was elected that I have had a swing against me. In fact, in the 2001 and 2004 elections I had the biggest swings in the state of South Australia. But basically that has disappeared with this election, so I am back to about where I started. However, we did win 105 of the booths, which is more than in 2004, and did achieve positive swings in 12 of those booths. The results in the electorate of Barker were the culmination of months of hard work by my wonderful team, both prior to and during the election. Their commitment was fantastic and their loyalty was unwavering. I consider myself most fortunate to have such a fantastic team. My campaign team worked tirelessly on this campaign. In our campaign committee we had members from all over the electorate, and my electorate covers 64,000 square kilometres-which is bigger than Tasmania, to put that in perspective. There are distances of 500 kilometres between members of my team, so you can imagine the logistics of getting them together and working through those tyrannies of distance that you have in a large rural electorate. I would especially like to thank my lovely wife, Sharon, whose positive and vibrant approach, together with her total support and commitment not only during the campaign but also over the last few years, supported me during this long campaign. I think any of those in this House will understand what our norspouses go through not only in our campaigns but also during our whole period in parliament. They certainly do give up a lot and carry some of the burden that we have as members of parliament. In fact, I am one of those people who are lucky enough not to get stressed very much, but I think I might be a carrier. Our campaign staff, our spouses and families do get a bit more stressed than we do sometimes. I think they feel it a lot more than we do. I would also like to thank my staff members-Beth, Karen, Deb, Haley, Megan and Kylie-who worked tirelessly throughout the campaign. They worked long and hard days. That is the sort of support and loyalty that I had from my staff, and I do not think that anyone could wish for better. I would also like to thank Tim Cartledge, who was my FEC president, and Norm Paterson, our FEC treasurer. He is a treasure as a treasurer and he has certainly been a great supporter of the Liberal Party for a very, very long time. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, election campaigns come at a great cost. That is the price of democracy. But, then again, I think elections are the oxygen of democracy as well, and it is very important that I take the opportunity to publicly thank those who lent their financial support to my campaign. Their generosity is greatly appreciated. Just as they have demonstrated their faith in me as their parliamentary representative, I would like to express my faith the businesses and individuals in the seat of Barker. Lastly, and with incessant appreciation, I would like to thank the Liberal Party branches of Barker. I have 24 branches, which is in anyone's terms a lot to deal with. Certainly they are absolutely fantastic in the the outcome. support they give to the Liberal Party both financially and on the ground. They are the lifeblood of the campaign. As I said, Barker is a very large electorate-it has more than 120 polling booths-so we rely heavily on the loyalty and commitment of our volunteers and party members. That I was returned to this House for a fourth term is a result the dedicated support from all our supporters, and I thank them sincerely. Being in opposition is new to me, indeed to many of us here. I have made a promise to the people of Barker that I am coming out to fight for them. I will not allow the Rudd government to make them easy targets in funding cuts. Regional and rural constituents are a resilient and determined group. The nature of their environment endows them so, and I commit myself to standing up for them over the next three years as we regroup to ensure that we are elected to government at the next election. Nearly 12 months ago, when opening Labor's climate change summit in Canberra, Mr Rudd said that his aim was to harness the nation's best and brightest talent. On gaining office, he appointed Senator Penny Wong as Minister for Climate Change and Water. Minister Wong, since being nominated, has been to Bali and to Honolulu, which is probably quite nice, while steadfastly telling the water-desperate residents of my electorate that it will be the end of the year before she can see for herself the issues they faceand this is in her own state. The Minister Climate Change and Water confirmed this in view with her inauspicious start to question time last Wednesday by refusing to answer whether or not she had input into the ‘razor gang' cuts to environmental funding and then giving contradictory answers as to the nature of the cuts. If that is the brightest and best talent, I share the fear of my constituents for We have a $10 billion plan to fix up the Murray-Darling Basin. About $6 billion of that will be to provide better infrastructure, mainly in areas where we have open channels so that we can reduce quite drastically the amount of seepage and evaporation from those open channels throughout the Murrayof Darling Basin. Another $3 billion of that will be used to buy back water licences. But after three months, unfortunately, we have not seen any of that funding spent. That is a very large concern to me, because it is not until those infrastructure improvements are made and those overallocated water licences are bought back that we will really receive the great benefit to the Murray-Darling Basin. To put this into perspective, that plan is designed to save between 2½ thousand and 3,000 gigalitres of water on an annual basis-up to 3,000 gigalitres a year. To again put that into perspective, the whole of South Australia-Adelaide and irrigators-uses about 750 gigalitres out of the Murray River. So we will be saving up to four times what we are using in the whole of South Australia. It is a very significant measure that needs to be taken. I was very pleased that we made that commitment last year. Unfortunately, we were held back for six months by Victoria and, in the end, we just said that we would go along without Victoria. We still have not, after three months, seen any great change to that suggestion that they come on board. I, and members of my party here, recogfor nise that climate change is a complex subject. There are genuine areas of uncertainty and scientific controversy. There are also a number of misunderstandings and myths, which are recycled, often by non-climate scientists, and portrayed as scientific fact. One of the factors which have complicated the public and political response to the climate change issue has been a widespread misunderstanding of uncertainty in science. The issues surrounding the greenhouse effect, global warming, climate change and their potential consequences have been vigorously debated among scientists, politicians and the general public in Australia and around the world since the 1980s. In fact, I remember that in the seventies the same scientists who are now saying that we have global warming were saying that we were going through a mini ice age. I wonder how they can change their views so quickly. The challenge was then and is now to identify and attempt to measure the elements of climate change, examine the possible and likely results and agree on policies that attempt to reduce the identified serious problems. In November 2004, the then New South Wales Labor Premier, Bob Carr, launched a report his government had commissioned from the CSIRO on the future regional climate of his state. His press release stated: NSW can expect fewer frosts but more-frequent droughts, heatwaves, rainstorms and strong winds. Ironically, the CSIRO report contained an important, explicit and up-front caveat which essentially stated that the report related to climate change scenarios based on computer modelling and that the models involved simplifications of the real physical processes that were not fully understood. That caveat went on to say that no responsibility would be accepted by the CSIRO or the New South Wales government for the accuracy of the projections in the report or the actions on reliance of the report. That did not stop Bob Carr from making his definitive unsupported scientific conclusions. It is fairly generally agreed that, in science, it is only possible to prove the falsehood of a proposition and not its truth, and that there is no such thing as absolute certainty. In the face of scientific uncertainty, Mr Carr's unequivocal conclusion represented a serious overstatement, and this continues to be the case with the Rudd Labor government. If we are going to have problems as a result of climate change, which we have always had, I think the most sensible approach would be to adapt. In the end, some of the other suggestions that have been put forward are going to come at a great cost to the Australian economy. As I said, I do not deny that climate change is occurring. The fact is that climate is always changing; change is what climate is. History tells us that the rates and magnitudes of warming during the late 20th century fell within the limits of earlier natural climate change and it follows that it cannot be attributed solely, or even partly, to human origin. It is also a fact that the average global temperature has not increased during the eight years since 1998-which was a warm El Nino year-despite an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide of four per cent over the same period. The recent rate of average global temperature rise has been between one and two degrees Celsius per century, which falls squarely within natural rates of climate change for the last 10,000 years. Average global temperature has been several degrees warmer than it is today many times in the recent geological past. There is also room for uncertainty in inferences drawn from the recent rise in global temperature. The recent rise in itself is real enough, but that does not necessarily mean that human activity is to blame. There you have it, Mr Speaker. I will be speaking more in this the 42nd Parliament on climate change and how we should be responding to it. I thank the House.",72
162,The SPEAKER,JOINT STANDING,"Order! Before I call the member for Dobell, I remind honourable members that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",76
163,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,JOINT STANDING,"Can I say right at the start what a great honour it is to be here today representing the people of Dobell in this place. Not many people get the honour and privilege of representing in federal parliament and to be counted amongst them is an immense privilege. At this stage, I need to acknowledge the fantastic advice and assistance I received from Mark Arbib, Karl Bitar and Sam Dastyari from the New South Wales ALP head office. All of the Labor shadow ministers in the last parliament were great, but, in particular, Wayne Swan and Anthony Albanese need to be acknowledged for the support they gave to and tireless work they put into my campaign. Senator Hutchins has been a fantastic supporter for many years and has helped to create the opportunity to win back Dobell. Along with former member Michael Lee, he has provided tremendous insight into the many issues that affect the people of Dobell. I would also like to acknowledge the work of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. He visited my electorate four times, along with many other electorates around the country. The shot of old Hawke charisma was just the lift that my campaign needed. I must thank Criselee Stevens, Sue Mueller and Matt Burke, who were there every day throughout the campaign. They are dedicated people and, to my relief, all agreed to work for me following the election. Branch members one and all need to be acknowledged, but, in particular, Bernie and Isobel Lowe, Pat and Owen Llewellyn, John Hawkins, John Shanny, Marie Watson, Bob Mulvey, Gloria Watson, Bill Smith, Richard Keating, Adam Wardroupe, Brian Sullivan, Robbie Kellog, Alan Wilcock, Barry Broadhurst, Darcy Waller, Brian Kirk, Jack Higgs, Ceri Aubrey, Iris and John Knight, Dermot Keane, John Redfern, Jim Briggs and, finally, Peter Cooley, who drove a busload of people down here today; they are in the gallery. I also acknowledge the assistance of Daniel Parish, who donated the use of a fullsized bus for six months of the campaign. Assistance from Mark MCLeay; Struan Robertson; Karene Walton; the member for Wyong, David Harris MP; Councillor Neil Rose; and Mark Robinson also needs to be acknowledged. Special thanks must also go to Zoe Arnold, who has been a great support to me throughout this campaign. This was a campaign in which unions were at the centre of crucial debates on industrial relations. The support I received from the entire union movement but in particular from Unions New South Wales, the TWU, the CFMEU mining division, the PSA, and of course my own union, the Health Services Union, was phenomenal. Michael Williamson, the HSU national president, was a marvel in relation to the long term support he provided to me. I would also like to acknowledge the support and friendship of my former state branch secretaries, but in particular, along with Michael, I would like to acknowledge Dan Hill, from Western Australia, Lloyd Williams, from Victoria and Chris Brown, from Tasmania. Finally, I need to acknowledge my friends and family for what they have had to put up with and to acknowledge that in some cases they have had to make permanent sacrifices so that I could be here today. Politics is a great and exciting profession, but it can extract a high personal cost from those involved and those close to the candidate. To my parents, who are here tonight, my sister, Jane, and my brother, Struan, through to Christa, my partner of 15 years: thank you. You have all taught me so much and supported me in all my decisions. I am a unionist, a former trade union official of the Health Services Union. Can I say that I am immensely proud of that fact. This election showed everybody that ‘union' is not a dirty word, and we should never again allow our country to go down the path on which the former Prime Minister and his cohorts opposite were trying to take us. The economy and how its proceeds are distributed are always the major issues in any election. Those sitting on the benches opposite chose in this most recent election to forget that the purpose of developing a strong economy is so that it can drive and fulfil the aspirations of this great country's citizens. government that presides over an economy that is performing strongly has, in my view, an obligation to make sure that improvements in citizens' lives result. It is socially divisive when most of the benefits of a strong economy go to those who are already prosperous. Without needing parliamentary privilege, let me say that the electorate of Dobell is blessed with physical beauty unsurpassed by any other region in Australia. It is also the home of the soon to be crowned A-league champions, the mighty Central Coast Mariners. We are uniquely located, midway between the cities of Newcastle and Sydney, but with a population of over 300,000 on the Central Coast we very much have our own stand-alone identity, separate from those of Sydney and the Hunter region. Our worldclass beaches, intricate lake systems, unspoilt national parks and pristine valleys are a source of constant pride for all there. The physical beauty of the Central Coast, however, is not matched by its present economic strength. Despite 17 years of uninterrupted national economic growth, many hard working families on the Central Coast have not seen the benefits of these good economic times. The Central Coast has the lowest median household income in New South Wales and consistently has double the national unemployment levels. The youth unemployment rate in the Wyong LGA is at an unacceptable level of over 19 per cent. For those of us who work, the conditions are often harsher than for those who live in major cities. Anywhere between 30,000 and 60,000 Central Coast people commute to Sydney to work. Over a third of the full-time employees in the many new housing estates on the Central Coast commute to Sydney. A These people are spending anywhere between two and five hours a day commuting. Many parents are off to work before their children are awake, and they are back after they have gone to sleep at night. It is not uncommon to hear of people on the Central Coast spending more of their income on transport than they do on housing repayments. I am a proud member of the Australian Labor Party, which holds as a fundamental belief the creation of a competitive economy that delivers opportunity for all Australians. A strong economy should and can coexist with social justice. We as a Labor Party are serious about our role as a regulator to ensure fairness wherever markets fail. I am proud to be a member of a Labor government that at its outset is serious about urban planning and development; water infrastructure; universal, quality health care; and the economic and social benefits of a worldof us who live class education system. The people of the Central Coast deserve a member and a government that deliver for them. They deserve a parliament that better channels national prosperity towards universal opportunities for the generations ahead. The former Howard government's boast that ‘workers have never been better off' sounds very hollow in Dobell. The former Howard government was never honest about its intentions for working families and instead attempted to disguise its intentions through spin, Orwellian language and doublespeak, and that is precisely why it can never be trusted on these issues. Just look at the naming of some of the industrial legislation it brought before this place: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal Reform) Bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill and of course the Fair Pay Commission. Each piece of legislation is designed to do absolutely the opposite of what its title implies. That is, the ‘fair dismissal reform' makes it easier to dismiss employees, the ‘better bargaining' bill makes it harder to bargain collectively with your employer, and the Fair Pay Commission was created to reduce the outcome of national wage cases. No wonder that in the union movement we most feared the ‘building better and stronger unions' bills. The public is sick and tired of political spin and wants politicians to speak clearly and honestly. The best way for us to promote ethical language in public conversation is to say what we mean and mean what we say. This led me to think about my childhood. I grew up in country New South Wales, in Bathurst, a town that, when I was there, had less than 30,000 people. When I was a kid growing up, we had a real sense of community. When people moved into the neighbourhood, they were surrounded by neighbours inviting them for drinks and the kids for a kick of the footy. People made an effort to make newcomers feel part of the group. Those leaving the neighbourhood were always given a rousing send-off and welcomed back fondly when they came to visit. If anything happened to someone in the community, people rallied round and helped. My New Zealand grandfather had a heart attack, which meant my mother had to go to New Zealand to nurse him for six weeks. While she was away, my father had no problems with meals-even though he could not cook-because the neighbours were always bringing around meals specially prepared for us or inviting us over for dinner. There was nothing special in this-it happens all around Australia that people respond to those in need. Whilst mum was away, we were on a roster, with different people picking us up and taking us to school and sporting events and all the things we were normally involved in. Our neighbours made sure that no-one in bill the community was left feeling isolated and alone when they needed help. Clearly this meant putting themselves out, not for their personal or individual reward but from a shared sense of making sure there was a fair go all round. These are everyday Australian values that make us who we are and bind us together. At the same time, in the workplace, unions were accepted by the employer and, whilst there were often fierce disagreements and strikes, no-one ever questioned the legitimacy of the union or the employer. It was part of the Australian way. Just as in sport, bitter confrontation did not go on forever because the Australian way was to go to the independent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission, to help resolve the dispute. Whilst occasionally we on the union side had some bad luck with the umpire's decision, we knew that a strong, independent commission that helped protect the weaker from the strong was essential for our community. These things were taken as unquestionable truths in our society. It is these values of community-values of sharing a common sense of belonging, of looking out for those less fortunate-that those on the opposition benches threatened at the last election. I started by saying that the language we use as politicians should be simple, straightforward and honest, easy to understandchildlike, one might say. That had me thinking about messages we teach our children as to what is good and bad, from an early age. A lot of these messages are based on our religious beliefs. I think it is worth having a look at some of those values and then comparing them to the former government's values on the same issue. Value: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do to you.' Former government: ‘Don't worry about what others might do to you. If you can, do it to them first.' Value: ‘Make sure you share with the other kids.' Former government: ‘Take as much as you can. Don't share. Fairness is not part of the system.' Value: ‘If you have done the wrong thing, say you are sorry.' Howard government-we know what their position is on ‘sorry', don't we. Value: ‘Play by the rules and accept the umpire's decision.' Former government: ‘If I don't like the rules, I'll get rid of the umpire.' The meaning of Christmas, as well as children's stories, would change for the worse if we imposed the Howard government's values on it. With no vacancies in Bethlehem, Mary and Joseph would not have been given the stable unless they were prepared to pay above the market rates. Joseph would not have been a carpenter, because there would have been no apprenticeships. Mary would have had to quit her job, as there was no maternity leave. We know those three wise men would not be giving handouts without some form of mutual obligation. In terms of fairy stories, the ugly duckling would have been locked up in a detention camp for being different. The sheriff of Nottingham would have been the hero and Robin Hood some market interventionist attempting income redistribution. We all know here that Snow White would have had those seven dwarfs on AWAs. In the former government's world, fairy stories would have all been written by the Grimm brothers. These are not values we want as a nation. These are not values that reflect the Australia that I know and want to see flourish. As a Labor government, we cannot afford to treat the electors as fools through political spin. We need to be honest and forthright and to pursue values that bring our nation together rather than divide us. The industrial relations agenda of the former government was about taking away simple rights that all Australians valued. How can dad coach the footy team or join the surf club or the SES if he has no input or certainty about the rosters and the days that he will work? How is the economy improved by a radiographer losing rights through unfair dismissal? No amount of spin or clever advertising could hide the effect that these laws have on the lives of ordinary families. I believe that is largely why we are sitting on this side of the chamber and not the other. However, as the government we have to stand for more than a decent workplace. We need to look at other fundamental values in our society that have been eroded or overturned, and to propose positive policy responses. In my union role I have seen two areas in particular where the former government let us down. These important areas need to be addressed by the ALP in a Labor manner whilst in office. Under Labor, a strong and robust economy should create a humane society that will distribute benefits to those most in need. The two areas in particular that I want to concentrate on are aged care and dental care. A critical lack of staffing is the greatest problem facing the aged-care sector. With the rapid expansion of the industry to cope with an ageing population, shortages are becoming more acute. The lack of staff, however, is not all due to a tightening in the labour market. The former government's deliberate policy has been to neglect the question of staffing standards for this most critical area. There is clear evidence both in Australia and internationally of the link between staffing levels and the quality of care delivered to the elderly. Staffing shortfalls jeopardise the health, safety and quality of life experienced by residents in aged-care facilities. There is a greater risk they will be injured, be attacked by other residents, be given the wrong medication, not get sufficient exercise or treatment from specialists, receive inadequate clinical care and not be properly supervised even in an emergency situation. Workforce shortages also have a clear adverse effect on staff. Aged-care staff are committed, motivated and strongly believe in the importance of the work they do. But for those in workplaces with inadequate staffing levels it is a demanding and stressful job. Working in aged care, for too many staff, has become more dangerous and less fulfilling. The National Institute of Labour Studies report commissioned by the previous federal government included a survey of over 6,000 staff, which found only 13 per cent of nurses and only 19 per cent of staff overall believed they had enough time to properly care for residents; 40 per cent of nurses and 25 per cent of allied health workers spend less than a third of their time providing direct care; almost half the personal carers spend less than two-thirds of their time on direct care; and the major complaints of staff were that they did not have enough time to spend with residents, and the facility they worked in did not employ sufficient staff. International research confirms the link between staffing and care. The most comprehensive report commissioned in recent years was the report to Congress by the US Department of Health and Human Services on minimum staff ratios in nursing homes. The report, finalised in 2001 after four years of work, found strong and compelling evidence of a relationship between staffing ratios and the quality of nursing care. It found poor staffing levels had contributed significantly to an increase in the number of bedsores and the incidence of malnutrition, dehydration, weight loss and other preventable disorders and diseases. Reports by the Australian Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency confirm the direct link between a lack of staff and poor care, as well as highlighting the inconsistent approach adopted by that agency. I want to look at two examples of that. At the Elizabeth Lodge facility in Sydney the agency found staff shortages and training problems affected clinical care, the management of medication, continence management, behavioural management and leisure interests. One recreation officer-that is one recreation officer-had to look after 129 residents, 16 of whom were in a dementia ward. At the Valencia Nursing Home in Western Australia inadequate staffing meant residents were only washed on alternate days. That is despite all 45 residents being incontinent. Care staff said they were too busy to talk to residents. It is clear that the current aged-care system is failing to deliver sufficient staff to provide the care and safety that residents require. Regulatory requirements for staffing, stripped away by the former government, need to be reintroduced and significantly extended. Minimum staffing levels covering all care and ancillary staff are the only way to provide a basic guarantee of care and safety for residents and their families. Accreditation standards need to be rewritten so that they are measurable and enforceable. A government that looks after the economy and creates a strong economic base needs to be able to ensure that the elderly are looked ter. The second area I want to touch on is dental care. In dental care, Labor can make real improvements to people's lives. State governments have struggled to adequately look after dental care since the Howard government withdrew its contribution from the funding mix. What is required is a Labor solution to this problem. For some strange reason in Australia, for medical purposes the mouth is not considered part of the body. That is, Medicare effectively looks after all other parts of the body that may fall ill or hurt in an accident, except for the mouth. I believe this has to change. Australia prides itself on its universal healthcare system, yet we have a tremendous gap in the services we provide. Having to wait years for treatments for painful tooth and gum problems is totally unacceptable. Australia's overall dental health is the second poorest among developed nations. It means that countries like Turkey provide better tal outcomes for their citizens than Australia. We were seen as being so bad in this area that in 2006 some Thai Buddhist monks came and volunteered dental services to the people of Queensland because of our chronic needs in dental health. So, whether it is A Current Affair with stories of people performing home dentistry or The 7.30 Report talking to industry experts, the answer is the same: dental care in Australia is in crisis that crisis requires a national solution. Most Australians will suffer decay in at least 10 teeth by their late 30s and we have one of the highest tooth extraction rates in the developed world. Nearly 60 per cent of all care from public dental services is emergency care, with more than one tooth pulled every hour these dental services are open. It is essential that we have in place an affordable dental scheme that does not have people putting off going to the dentist until they have a af- chronic situation. My union did some research, through Auspoll, looking at the affordability of dental care. That Auspoll research was conducted in eight marginal seats and found that half the adults surveyed said they put off dental treatment that they needed because of the cost. Fifteen per cent of parents said they put off treatment for their kids because of the cost. Currently, public dental waiting lists have up to 650,000 people on them. The frightening thing is that these waiting lists are really just the tip of an iceberg when you have almost 50 per cent of be people saying that they put off dental care because it costs too much money. Some Australians have been waiting for up to 10 years to get chronic dental issues resolved. It is time to end the pain and fix the problem. In my electorate Mrs Hanley told me that after an extraction for an abscessed tooth in May 2005 she was advised that she would have to wait at least 12 months for a partial denture to be made. She has no molars in her den- lower jaw and cannot eat meat, salads and nuts. Dental care is of particular importance to the Central Coast because we have a large population of elderly people. We also have a high level of tooth decay that adversely affects the young and the elderly. One of the other 650,000 people waiting on the waiting list was Mrs Hanley's husband. He has been on a list for over three years waiting to get his broken tooth fixed. The Daily Telegraph and told of three-year-old Cooper Agius, whose young teeth have been eaten away by medication he was taking for serious respiratory conditions. He was told he needs new crowns and root treatment, but his parents were told to sedate him for 12 months until he could get public emergency dental treatment. Again, a strong economy needs to be able to ensure that people's dental health is not jeopardised because of its cost. We need to ensure that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong, that inflation is under control and that the benefits of that strong economy flow to all Australians, but particularly to those most in need and most vulnerable such as the elderly and those with dental problems. We in the Labor Party are in the privileged position of being in government. For the sake of the people of Dobell, and the people of Australia, it is important that we use our time responsibly to ensure a strong economy so that we can improve the lot of our fellow Australians as only the Labor Party has been able to do in the past. It is a heavy responsifolio, bility that the Australian people expect us to deliver upon and a challenge that I look forward to with relish.",76
164,Mr GEORGIOU,JOINT STANDING,"Kooyong) (6.33 pm)I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to this very important position in the parliament and I hope you keep on enjoying the job as much as you seem to be enjoying it to date. Through the Governor General's address, the new government has indicated an ambitious agenda covering a wide range of policy areas. I wish to focus on one of the subjects covered in the address-that of social inclusion. This is defined in the address as ‘improving the opportunities for all Australians to participate fully in Australian economic and social life'. That is certainly an aim shared by both sides of the parliament and one that I strongly support. I do not take issue with any of the specific initiatives that the government says it will implement to promote social inclusion. They deal with a variety of important subjects, such as the gap between the mortality rates of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. My concern is that two important aspects were not mentioned: promoting the social inclusion of migrants through English language teaching, and multiculturalism. I will not speculate on the reasons for their omission, but I note that, in Labor's detailed election policy document An Australian Social Inclusion Agenda, there was also no mention of the disadvantage experienced by migrants or of multiculturalism. The necessity for programs to assist migrants and particularly refugees has been acknowledged by successive governments for a long time, though that acknowledgement has not always guaranteed the provision of adequate resources. In July last year, the then shadow minister for immigration, who has been elevated to a significant portannounced that a Rudd Labor government would commit an additional $49.2 million to help migrants learn English. The Prime Minister and his senior ministers have all been adamant that the government will implement its pre-election commitments, so I trust that any omission of a reference in the Governor General's speech to the strengthening of English language programs and settlement programs was not significant. Hopefully, the prioritisation of social inclusion will protect this program from falling victim to the government's razor gang, because the necessity for English language teaching and settlement programs grew enormously last year when the government of the day introduced a new citizenship test. Proponents of the new test have argued that it is intended to, and will, promote integration. But, as I and many others contended when the test was proposed, in all probability it will prove to be a barrier of exclusion rather than a vehicle of inclusion. In the debate last August I said: The fact that Australian citizenship laws have been made more inclusive in the past has provided a basis of trust, confidence and achievement. The fact that we accepted people with modest English language skills as citizens has broken down barriers, not maintained them. The establishment of this test will, I believe, diminish tralia. I do not believe that this will be apparent immediately, but I believe that it will happen, as the test excludes people who are committed to Australia and who could pass the present test. Their opportunities will be restricted, their participation will be impeded and the fairness and vitality of our society will be eroded. That prognosis was bleak, but it may already be eventuating. Since the first test was introduced on 1 October, the number of applicants for citizenship has fallen dramatically. In the nine months immediately preceding the introduction of the test, there were never fewer than 11,000 applications a month. Since then, applications have plunged to just over 2,000 in October, 3,500 in November, 3,200 in December and 4,200 in January. In the decade preceding the test, the average number of applications for citizenship was 99,450. On current figures, the total number of applications in the 12 months following the introduction of the test is projected to be just 39,336. Is there a cause-and-effect relationship or are other factors responsible? You cannot attribute the decline to the holiday period. There was no seasonal variation in the previous 10 years and the rates are far lower in the comparable months in that period. You cannot attribute it to the fact that there are not enough people who, due to residency requirements, could apply, because there are approximately one million people in this country who are eligible to apply. Whatever the explanation of that downturn in citizenship applications, it is troubling. Citizenship is an important element of social inclusion. It carries a range of privileges and responsibilities, which include the right to live here permanently, as distinct from the permission to remain which is granted to permanent residents; the right to apply for an Australian passport and seek consular assistance from Australian diplomatic representatives overseas; the right to Ausregister as Australian citizens children born overseas; the right to seek the full range of employment in the Defence Force and the Public Service; and, most importantly, the right to vote. But it is not just a question of the sheer fall in the numbers of applicants; it also a question of what has happened to the reduced number of people who sat the new test. Unsurprisingly, the test is proving to be a harsher barrier for refugees than for other migrants. Around 30 per cent of those from Sudan, 25 per cent of those from Afghanistan and 16 per cent of those from Iraq were unable to pass. These results compare with a failure rate of around three percentage points for migrants in the skilled stream and 10 per cent of those who come in on family reunion. The fact is that it is the most vulnerable that this test hits the hardest. The personal cost of not getting Australian citizenship may be far greater for refugees than for other migrants. Some are stateless, so a lack of citizenship is an ongoing source of deep emotional insecurity. Many refugees, both stateless and otherwise, do not have passports, so they are unable to travel to reunite with family members scattered around the world by their flight to survive. When the bill was introduced and the new test was being considered, few members of the House shared my view that it was so illconceived and unfair that it should not proceed. At the same time, many did have reservations and proposed that some protections be put in place. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs received evidence of strong concerns about the impact of the new test from a number of informed individuals and groups and, accordingly, it recommended that the operation of the citizenship testing regime be reviewed three years after the bill's commencement. The committee also recommended that the proposed citizenship questions be tabled in the parliament, and I quote from the report: Given the apparent level of community disquiet about the questions that might be included in the test, and that, as a general rule, delegated legislaamending tion should be transparent and disallowable, the committee suggests that the test questions be tabled in the Parliament to provide additional reassurance to those concerned. It would also help to ensure transparency and accountability of the proposed regime. This was supported by both the Liberal and the Labor senators on the committee and more generally. The then opposition leader, Mr Rudd, commented that Labor had questions about the test, stating: Show us the tests. Let's see what sort of scrutiny they need to be subjected to. The then shadow minister, during the debate on the citizenship bill, said: I think that, as a matter of transparency, the government making the questions available is completely in the interests of citizenship being a ess of unifying Australians. It is a logical thing to do, and it is completely in the interests of the government to do so. The arguments for transparency that the opposition put in June 2007 are no less compelling eight months later now that it is in government and has the power to implement its positions. Indeed, if one listened to the debates in this parliament over the last few days, one would say that it is even more compelling because the word ‘transparency' or the virtue of transparency has become almost cant. The test questions have not been published to date and I have made several inquiries of the government to try to find out when or if they will be published. Thus far the requests for further clarification have been in vain. I suspect that this indicates that demands for transparency made by the Labor opposition are different from the capacity to meet those demands now that Labor is actually in a position to do so. I note as well that, last year, Labor tried to ameliorate difficulties that the test would cause migrants of a non-English-speaking background by the legislation to require that the Adult Migrant English Program and other settlement services be improved to assist migrants to participate fully in the Australian community and to pass the citizenship test. That amendment failed, but Labor now has the opportunity and the power to make good on its commitment to increase funding for these programs. The government has stated that in April it will commission a review of the operation of the test, after it has been operating for six months. Given the government's support for the test, I do not anticipate that this will be the fundamental review that we really need to have. I do not anticipate that it will inquire into whether the test really does provide a strong incentive for people to learn English. I procdo not anticipate that it will examine whether the knowledge people have to have to pass the test will make them more grateful and better citizens than those who acquired citizenship in previous decades. I do not anticipate that it will consider whether the test is penalising, excluding and alienating people who would make worthy members of our community. I do not anticipate that the review will do all this, but I believe that it should at least identify and ameliorate some of the harshest and most arbitrary features of what I believe is an expensive and counterproductive folly. Whether the review can do so depends on a number of elements that have not been announced as yet or, perhaps, have not even been decided. Most important is the independence and the calibre of the people who are appointed to undertake the review. They will need to have credibility, firmly grounded in their demonstrable integrity, knowledge of the area and sound public policy skills. A second key element is the terms of reference of the review. The terms of reference must allow the reviewer to rigorously assess whether or not the test is achieving its objectives and whether or not there are any adverse consequences. I hope the Prime Minister's recent intervention to ensure that aspiring applicants have to be aware of a cricketing champion of 50 years ago does not mean that the review will be limited to tweaking some of the questions. When the initial post-test data was published, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said: If people are not succeeding, we need to find out why, and how we can help to support them better. I agree, but to do that the review will have to be resourced to conduct such research as may be required to assemble evidence about the operation and implication of the test. The review must hear, in a rather more effective way than the last consultations did, the voices of those who are eager to become citizens but who find the test too daunting. It must take advice from education and health professionals about how difficult it is to study when you are a survivor of traumatic experiences before coming to Australia or when you are a middle-aged adult who does not speak English well and who is working long hours in an abattoir, cleaning offices or driving a taxi. The review should also examine how other countries go about testing applicants for citizenship, and the lessons from these tests. This was certainly not done properly prior to the introduction of the test. For example, the UK was consistently put forward as a good model for Australia. We were not told that the UK does not test people about British history because it was considered unfair to ask immigrants questions that many British people would have difficulty answering. The report of the review of the Australian test should be published to allow discussions before the minister makes any changes. This would also be in keeping with the government's promise of greater transparency in decision making. I now turn to the other social inclusion issue which I mentioned at the outset: multiculturalism. A year ago this term was officially banished from the Australian government's political lexicon. It was banished despite the fact that multiculturalism was one of the policy responses which was instrumental in Australia's astonishing capacity to meet the challenge of an ethnically and culturally diverse society. It was a multiculturalism which explicitly insisted on a commitment to core values as the basis for a shared identity, as well as respect for diversity. The opposition at the time was critical of the government's abandonment of multiculturalism, and the new government has resurrected the word in the title of the office of Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services. I would be interested in whether this is more than a rhetorical gesture or an act of sheer symbolism. Two things will tell us. One is when the government publishes its policy on cultural diversity. The website of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has a section for the government's policy and for a while it has read: This section of the website is currently being updated. I and, I believe, many other people in the community eagerly await the news and trust it will come soon. The other indicator of the government's intention will be the outcome of what the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services has described as: ... an examination of how best to foster and promote the benefits of cultural diversity in the tralian community. This examination was announced in a media release of 8 February which was boldly headed ‘A new lease of life for multicultural Australia'-lovely. Regrettably, the media release does not indicate who is undertaking the examination, what the terms of reference will be or what process will be followed. Contrasted with the declarations about the importance of transparency, one can only describe this as being distinctly opaque. If the government wishes to provide more information, I am sure that it will find in the community many people who would be willing to help. I commend the government for identifying social inclusion as a priority of its work. I urge it to not ignore the formidable barriers to full and effective participation in Australia's economic and social life encountered by both citizens and permanent residents who have thus far been overlooked in the government's social inclusion agenda. To recapitulate my remarks, I call on the government to do three things. Firstly, the government should strengthen English language teaching and settlement programs. This is a commitment that must be honoured in full. Secondly, the government should ameliorate the adverse impacts of the new citizenship test. Thirdly, the government should reinvigorate the policy of multiculturalism, which has proved to be an astonishingly intelligent, successful and rewarding response to the fact of our ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity.",82
165,The SPEAKER,JOINT STANDING,"Order! Before I call the member for Forde, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",86
166,Mr RAGUSE,JOINT STANDING,"It is Ausindeed an honour to be elected to the chamber and, more importantly, a privilege to be here representing the people of Forde. However, before indulging too much in my own views and perspectives, I would first like to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your appointment and likewise congratulate all the members of the House for their success in the election, either as new or continuing members. This 42nd Parliament coincidentally includes 42 new members who, like me, are only too aware of the responsibilities that have now been imparted to them. The 24 November election was a historic victory for Labor and a well-deserved outcome for the honourable member for Griffith and our new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who as the leader of the Labor Party for only 11 months prior to the election created a viable and palatable platform and gave voters of Australia confidence in a new era of leadership that resulted in a transition to the Labor government. As a new member from Queensland, it was clear from our results that voters wanted change. The seat of Forde recorded a swing of 14.43 per cent, the largest in the 2007 election and one of the largest since Federation. Many have speculated on what caused the extent of the swing. I believe many factors played a part in the final result, in particular the strong message delivered during the campaign that Labor could deliver on a preferred new future for us all. We as a party, and now a new government, have built expectations, and we now need to work towards delivering on those expectations. Having been a regular business traveller to Canberra in the mid-1990s, I would always include a self-imposed visit to Parliament House and this chamber. On one memorable occasion, in December 1996, after parliament had adjourned for the year, I stood in the public gallery where my friends and family gather today. I was quietly reflecting on the importance and the reverence of the House and the thought of the enormous privilege it would be to one day sit as a member in this chamber. But, to me, that seemed like an impossibility, with family commitments, business commitments and a stringent party process that would determine the person most appropriate to represent an electorate. It seemed daunting and sometimes I believed it was something I would never really have the opportunity of achieving. Despite the enormity of the task, my own Pygmalion or self-fulfilling prophecy must have subconsciously started me on that journey. In fact, if you ponder the logistics of such adventure, it is one of Himalayan proportions. I say ‘Himalayan' with the utmost respect and admiration for those who have scaled the famous Mount Everest. In effect, many more people have conquered the summit of Mount Everest, some 3,500 in the last 55 years, than have had the honour to serve in this chamber-1,059 Australians in 107 years. However, despite those sobering statistics, 11 years after my realisation in 1996 became a proud new member who is so very honoured to be here to serve the people of Forde. Besides that, I would not make a good mountain climber anyway! Forde is a hugely diverse electorate, with very little profile in the wider Australian community. This is something I intend to change-to put Forde on the map. Forde is named in honour of Francis Forde, better known as Frank Forde, who was Prime Minister for only eight days, from 6 July to 13 July 1945, following the sudden death of the Labor Party Prime Minister John Curtin. It is important to note that Frank Forde was the last Queensland Prime Minister prior to Kevin Rudd-63 years ago-and was the father-in-law of Queensland's first woman Governor, Leneen Forde, who served Queensland from 1992 to 1997. At 3,167 square kilometres, Forde is geographically large compared to neighbouring electorates but, as a south-east Queensland seat, also known as the Gold Coast hinterland, it is nestled against the neighbouring federal electorates of Rankin, Fadden, Blair, MCPherson, Moncrieff and, over the border in New South Wales, the seats of Richmond and Page. Forde is geographically and demographically diverse, from high urban density in the north to large farmland and rural holdings in the south-west. It finishes at the New South Wales border, on the beautiful Border Ranges. The seat of Forde involves parts of seven state electorates and three local government authorities: the Gold Coast City Council, the Logan City Council and the Beaudesert Shire Council. It includes the traditional lands and custodians of the Mununjali and Yugambeh nations and their elders-proud and productive Indigenous people who have pragmatically worked towards building a strong and enduring community. Due to the increasing I demand for urban land in south-east Queensland, the areas of future potential development in Forde will become critical areas of growth and an economic powerhouse for the greater south-west of south-east Queensland. But, to do this in a way that makes economic sense, it must include a stringent planning regime to ensure environmental, social and economic imperatives to deliver long-term benefits. We must ensure that existing rural industries are supported and that goodquality agricultural land is enhanced. The farming sector to the south-west of Beaudesert has weathered torrid times, with the long period of recent drought making life difficult for farming families who had not had the level of government support they needed. We must lock up areas of high environmental sensitivity while making sustainable, efficient and sensible decisions on areas of development. To do this means a plan of action between Commonwealth and state governments and the private sector, with the cooperation of the local government authorities in facilitating planning and progressing appropriate development approvals. The electorate at the moment has some of the largest areas of proposed development in the nation-from the large industrial estate of Yatala, just south of Beenleigh, which is regarded as the fastest growing industrial development in Australia, to the proposed intermodal transport and logistics areas of Bromelton to the west of Beaudesert. Bromelton is cited as being the largest inland port in this country, connecting the planned major road and rail freight corridors. Billions of dollars of investment are planned over the next decade. To ensure sustainability we need to understand the integration of needs for an area ready to undergo massive expansion. Industrial centres require a ready workforce, and a ready workforce requires wellplanned residential communities planned around lifestyle. Housing supply and demand in Queensland and particularly in Forde at the moment is volatile. Increased demand for housing is being driven by intense economic growth but is also due to the tardy sequencing of land release, which unnecessarily inflates the cost of housing. The integration of planning to provide appropriate health, public transport, education and community services is essential, along with the provision timely infrastructure. A planning commitment by all levels of government is necessary to enable the timely sequencing and rollout of these new communities. There are two major residential areas planned for Forde. Greater Flagstone, which lies to the south of Greenbank near the Bromelton development, will provide for 100,000 residents by 2030 and Yarrabilba, which lies to the south-west of Beenleigh and Yatala near the Yatala development, will provide for 70,000 residents by 2040. These developments will potentially deliver the lifestyle communities I mentioned. Better government understanding of the inflationary pressures caused by bureaucratic duplication and local red tape is essential to finding planning solutions that have a positive effect on economic outcomes, particularly outcomes that deliver the strict low-inflation regime sought by our Prime Minister and Treasurer. Forde is diverse and includes parts of Loganholme in the north, Beenleigh and the beautiful Tamborine Mountain to the east, and the towns and shires of Beaudesert in the greater south-west. It is a unique place. With the retirement of my predecessor, Kay Elson, a long-serving Liberal member, the people of Forde had the opportunity to make a change. With this change I became the fourth member for Forde since its inception in 1984. The former Prime Minister, John Howard-who in his 11 years made only two visits to Forde, the latest being in October last year during the election campaign-said that Forde, to him, was where he could go if he wanted to know what was bothering Middle Australia. Well, on November 24, as we know, across the country and in Forde, Middle Australia resoundingly believed they had had enough. The immediacy of my challenge is to ensure that we focus the attention of the federal government on needs and on the serious lack of of both physical and social infrastructure in the electorate. The Labor campaign for the November 2007 election was built on the notion of a fair go-a fair go in work; a fair go for business; a fair go for older Australians; a fair go for our youth by providing opportunities in education and training; and a fair go for families. Every initiative of a new Labor government would find a point of reference within the electorate of Forde. Everyone was affected by the frustration of the lack of engagement by the previous government. Queensland was forgotten, and everyone on all sides of politics knew it. In my electorate, my support base straddled all sides of the traditional political fence. Both small and large business operators saw the opportunities presented by a potential Rudd government and got on board. As I mentioned, housing availability and affordability are at critically low levels. rate of mortgage stress and default of housing loans in Forde is one of the highest in country. The previous lack of cooperation and coordination between the state and federal governments has meant that a number of communities in Forde are without basic transport services. For an electorate without adequate roads, transport infrastructure and services, the impacts have a dual effect on the people living in the various townships and communities across Forde. The cost of running two cars, because there is no public transport, is compounded by the effect of rising fuel and grocery prices. People in the electorate are hurting. One of my pledges to the people of Forde is to provide better opportunities to talk to their representatives government. Coordination between the three tiers of government-council, state and federal-and regular community briefings will form part of our community engagement strategy. High on my list of priorities is our youth. Our future is so much determined by how we nurture, support and mentor our youth. Education and training is paramount in providing them with the skills and strategies for dealing with their future lives while maintaining their individuality and motivation. Our understanding of the social aspects of their velopment through tangible and intangible support is critical. I had a very humble and somewhat uncertain beginning. My mother, at the age of 17 in 1960, was pregnant and was not married. This was at a time when community perceptions and prejudices were heavily weighted against unmarried mothers. With no provision of support and a family that was not able to support her, it was decided before my birth that I would be adopted. I was very lucky to be adopted into a family who not only nurtured and raised me but imparted, amongst many things, the important values The of life. I enjoyed a good public education. After graduating from high school in 1977, I the took on an apprenticeship as a hand and machine compositor-also known as a comp-a trade within the printing industry. I am one of only three compositors that I am aware of who have served in this House. The two previous compositors were Australia's third Prime Minister and first Labor Prime Minister, John Watson, in 1904, and Senator Bert Milner, whose untimely death on 30 June 1975 caused a string of events that saw the demise of the Whitlam government later that year. For me, the events of 1975 were largely responsible for my political awakening. On 11 November, 1975-incidentally during my in junior exams-the Whitlam government was dismissed. While history well records the conventional and constitutional explanations for such an action, the political cause can largely be attributed to the machinations of Queensland's then National Party state Premier, Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, who appointed a less than Labor-friendly replacement senator. The conditions of this appointment were catalytic in bringing down the national government. In Queensland, without the existence of an upper house, some of the long-accepted conventions of the de- Westminster system were compromised, which further led to allegations of dishonesty and corruption throughout executive government. If you were a Labor Party member in Queensland, you may well have found yourself on the Police Special Branch files with an offensive dossier. The democratic freedoms we all enjoy in this country were severely compromised with the denial of freedom of expression, the outlawing of public congregation and the restriction of choice in what displayed many aspects of a totalitarian regime. However, the questionable activities and the promotion of cronyism by that government resulted in the conviction and sentencing of a number of former state government members on fraud and a variety of other charges. These events firmly galvanised my concern about political conservatism. The conservative actions of the Howard government on many social issues also became the antithesis of reform, particularly on the important social reforms that emerge through changing times and expectations. This cannot be better demonstrated than by the refusal of the former government and its stance on all matters related to the reconciliaoutdated, tion and the now celebrated apology brought down by the Rudd government on that historic day last week. I am sure the academics and the historians will analyse the actions of the Howard government and the machinations that continued in order to find excuses for why an apology should not be forthcoming. The Bringing them home report clearly explained the purpose of saying sorry to recommence the processes of reconciliation commenced by the previous Labor government. The philosophical arguments over the taxonomy of the words do not make any difference to the reality that, if there are social injustices affecting a community, governments must rise to the challenge of resolving these injustices. Reform is about recognising that something is not working and fixing it. In fact, I would argue that this is why this House exists-to debate, analyse and reform by finding a better way of doing things and to provide the appropriate legislation to deal with that change. Reform should establish the notion of: ‘It's not about blame; it's about change and the need for change when it is so obviously warranted.' The conservative philosophies and actions of the former Howard government were proven by their inflexibility when dealing with issues of social sensitivity. While the Work Choices legislation was certainly a major cause of the Howard government's downfall, it also demonstrated to the voters that the government was arrogant and failing on many other levels. If the difference between reform and conservatism is the ability to right previous injustice, then we must always look towards reform, particularly if past decisions continue to hurt and disaffect members of our society. Last week I was intrigued by comments from some of the opposition who seem to have the view that they have exclusivity when it comes to business expertise-an conservative and almost archaic boss-to-worker mentality-and that the coalition is business and Labor is the worker. The Labor Party proudly protects the rights of workers. A depth of expertise in all areas of business and professional practice is well represented on this side of the House. To suggest, as they did last week, that we on the Labor side have never run businesses or employed people is amusing, if not grossly naive and uninformed. I have, for a significant part of my working life, been a small business man, employing people who incidentally were also members of the union. As a former small business owner and operator who employed a significant number of staff, I understand well the dynamics of running a business. I was a member and executive member of two chambers of commerce and served as president of one and vice-president of another over a number of years. I spoke previously about my original trade as a compositor. But, with the opportunity to study as a mature age student, I commenced a commerce degree, converting to a teaching degree and further study, resulting in the completion of an honours degree in education. I took up positions as a teacher, lecturer, faculty and college director and, with the move back to the private sector, rolled out education and training programs in multimedia throughout Australia and South-East Asia. This led to varied business interests, including publishing small community newspapers and other media productions. My desire to enter politics resulted in a move three years ago, when I took up offers in parliamentary and ministerial service for a state member and two senior Queensland ministers, as a policy adviser. Mr Speaker, I further seek the indulgence of the House while I mention those special people who have had a great influence on my life and who have made my accession to this House a reality. As a member of the Labor Party, I pay tribute to the Labor cause and the generations of Labor members and elected members who have proven our philosophical stance, conscience and commitment to giving all Australians a fair go. I pay tribute to our Prime Minister and other elected Labor members in this House who fought a hard but honest campaign to convince a majority of Australians to hand Labor the responsibilities of government. I have so many people, who played varying roles, to thank, and there is simply not enough time in this response to name them all. For that I apologise, but I will not forget them! I want to pay tribute to my mum, Lyn Raguse, who, at almost 87 years of age, has been my inspiration and my conscience. She is an Irish migrant of 81 years who still carries a good argument and is someone against whom I still have difficulty in winning a debate! I pay tribute to the memory of my father, John Raguse, who died too young at 62 and whose stoicism and strength taught me tenacity. This style of tenacity gave me strength to campaign relentlessly. I pay tribute to my childhood brother and sister, Mark and Kim Raguse, for the shared happy and eventful childhood years. I pay tribute to my four children-Aaron, 19; Matthew, 17; Hannah, 13; Emma, 10and their mother, Annette. They have supported me through the years and have lived with the effect of politics on family life. I pay tribute to my birth mother, Denise Fletcher, whom I finally met at the age of 29. She weathered the early trials of life yet emerged triumphant with the support of her husband, Laurie Fletcher, a man who has also inspired me with his gentle yet unrelenting support for his family. I pay tribute to John and Daphne Loveday, who treated me like a son and were always there to support me. I pay tribute to my brothers and sisters and their families-the Fletchers-and my sister Nicole Byrnes, who made a number of personal sacrifices to help me achieve this win. I thank Steve Searle and his wife, Alison, who always believed that success was possible. Steve's energy and absolute commitment to the campaign were, for me, humbling and perpetually appreciated. I thank two very special and inspirational friends, Roland and Shirley Lindenmayer, who proved my theory that people from all political persuasions can come together for a common cause and influence a positive outcome and prove that democracy does work. I pay tribute to Jim and Sandy Dennis, who were there from the start and never failed in providing help wherever and whenever needed. I also pay tribute to Jim's mother, Mary Dennis, who, at 84, continues to hold the Labor faith. I thank Isobel Tarrago and her daughter, Aveline Tarrago, and Lucy and David Banu for their warm and generous support. I pay tribute to my loyal friends Noni Hazlehurst and Ian Marden, who, with busy filming schedules interstate, always made the effort to be available. I pay tribute to Normie Rowe for his overt and enduring support for Vietnam veterans and for making sure we always remembered. I pay tribute to Brett and Pam MCCreadie for their hard work, friendship and the support they garnered from the QPSU. I pay tribute to those I honour as my political tors, who, with their own busy and demanding schedules, always made time to help with advice: state members and ministers Desley Boyle, John Mickel, Margaret Keech, Evan Moorhead, Gary Fenlon, Michael Choi and Desley Scott. I also pay tribute to federal members and senators Joe Ludwig, Wayne Swan, Craig Emerson, Tony Burke, Jennie George, Bernie Ripoll and former minister Con Sciacca. I pay tribute to my friends and family who are here today in the gallery: my two sons, Aaron and Matthew; Aaron's partner, Alexa; Ada and Jamie Banks; Di Lydiard; Steve Alcock; Rosalia Sieira; and, in absentia, her partner, Paul Roderick. I thank Jenny Atkinson, my campaign manager, who, with the support of several hundred campaign workers and the help of her daughter, Samantha Fuller, formed a solid team who unrelentingly pushed our cause forward. I say thank you to Maarten Sherrington and his family-his wife, Louise, and their children, Tom and Rosewho all made so many family sacrifices to ensure that Maarten was always available, particularly during those intense weeks and months of campaigning. To my other staff, Stuart Fenech, Annette Curry and Jason Whitlock: I thank you not only for what you have already achieved in my office but also in anticipation of the vibrant and exciting three years ahead of us. I must pay special tribute to my partner, Marlene Sieira, who has weathered both a state and federal election campaign while managing her own career responsibilities and pressures. She has continued to be a stabilising influence, despite her own personal pain due to the loss of her father, Ben Sieira-a true gentleman-in 2006. In closing, I would like to reflect on the words of the honourable member for Grifmen- fith, our new Prime Minister. In his first speech, which strongly reflects my own disposition, he said: I do not know whether I will be in this place for a short or a long time. That is for others to decide. But what I do know is that I have no intention of being here for the sake of just being here. Together with my colleagues it is my intention to make a difference. Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the members of this House for your kind indulgence. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 20072008 Cognate bill: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 20072008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 February, on motion by Mr Hunt: That this bill be now read a second time.",86
167,Mr DUTTON,JOINT STANDING,"I rise to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008. I want to provide a perspective from the opposition in relation to these very important cognate bills before the House. The coalition supports the appropriate appropriation of moneys from consolidated revenues to the programs outlined in the detail of the bill, but the point that needs to made in this debate is that this is an exercise in blatant political skulduggery by those opposite-in particular, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. This is a political stunt because the government has used this bill as an opportunity to include $643 million of so-called cuts, many of which include underspends in programs. Much of the detail in the $643 million includes transferring some of the spending across to other programs and also some cuts into programs which the coalition announced before the election or that we undertook to deliver to the Australian people prior to the campaign period but which were not implemented for administrative reasons. This causes us some concern because, over the last few weeks, in talking about the $643 million of so-called cuts, the finance minister has attempted to rewrite history. He has used the figure of $643 million of so called cuts to try and provide an example of the way in which his government intends to affect pressure on inflation in the Australian economy at the moment. The reality is that we have a $1.1 trillion economy. We have a leading international economy. We have government expenditure running at about $1 billion a day. Although $643 million certainly is a lot of money, for someone to suggest that $643 million would exert downward pressure on inflation is an embarrassment beyond belief, not just for the finance minister but for the haphazard Treasurer in the Rudd government. When we look at the detail of the $643 million in so-called cuts, we see that there are some that we would agree with and some that we would not. But what is missing from the $643 million is any suggestion from the Labor Party that they could add to that figure. When we go through the funding commitments-the election promises that Labor made-we see that they are of a very similar be nature to some that they have included in the $643 million figure. On the one hand, Labor are saying that they are working to rein in government expenditure, that they are trying to exert downward pressure on inflation by making $643 million in cuts in a $1.1 trillion economy; yet, on the other hand, it is okay for them to knock out funding for a sports stadium or for a particular sporting group in an electorate when they have made a very similar promise in one of their own marginal seats. It seems that that is okay; government expenditure does not extend that far. All this does is underscore the fact that this is really nothing more than a political stunt. The Australian public is fast learning just how incompetent the Rudd government is in managing the Australian economy. That, of course, is of great concern not just to Australian families but also to Australian small and large business-the employers in this nation who have contributed so much to where we are as a nation and as an economy today. Over the last few weeks, ministers have made coordinated speeches and spoken similar lines. Their speeches have obviously been formulated by the Prime Minister's office. None of them are capable of writing their own speeches. All of their speeches have been formulated in the Prime Minister's office. This government has ministers who are incapable of determining their own speeches or programs. They need to follow a script from Mr Rudd's office. This shows their lack of depth and, in particular, the incompetence of the Treasurer and the minister for finance. As part of this debate it is important to put on the public record the fact that, when Labor were elected to government at the 24 November election, they inherited a very strong economy. The fundamentals of the economy had remained strong because of the last 11½ years of coalition government, and they will remain strong for many years to come-we hope. We hope that Labor do not undo many of the programs that the coalition put in place. Labor did not support all of the programs that we had in place to eliminate the $96 billion worth of debt when we came into government. Unemployment under Labor was running at 10 per cent, and we brought that down to just over four per cent. We had high inflation under the Labor Party, and we brought that within the band required by the Reserve Bank. Labor opposed every step that we put in place to deliver those measures and a balanced budget outcome for the Australian people. What we fear most is that they will revert to their old ways over the coming period that they may be in government. The point is that that sends a very disturbing message to people in this country who are making investment decisions in not just capital expenditure but also their business in terms of human capital investment as to whether or not they are going to put on staff. If we start to see a zapping of confidence in the business sector in this country then that of great concern because unemployment will rise from there and confidence will quickly disappear. That is of great concern to the future of this country. It is of course worth noting and recognising, as part of contributing to this debate factual way about the economic position that the coalition left this country in, that we herited a $10 billion deficit and we converted that into around a $10 billion surplus year on year after we came into government. We inherited levels of government spending equal to about 25 per cent of GDP and they are now equal to about 21.2 per cent. We certainly inherited a ballooning unfunded superannuation liability, which we have now addressed by closing the PSS and creating the Future Fund, something that Labor when in government was never capable of doing. We introduced accrual accounting to provide details of the full cost of service delivery. For the first time we published a balance sheet for the general government sector and the whole of the public sector. Last time under Labor we had no idea what the value of the government's assets were or of key liabilities like the unfunded superannuation liability. We introduced for the first time consolidated whole-of-government financial reports audited by the Auditor-General. We introduced the outputs-outcomes framework to place the focus on what was actually being delivered for the money spent. We increased the efficiency dividend on government departments to ensure money was being spent on services at the sharp end rather than on administration. We completely reformed property management and procurement practices to ensure best value for taxpayers' money. After having done all that hard work, the point that I make is that when we were coming into the November election we said to the Australian people, ‘If you change the is government, you change the country.' And at the moment we are seeing great evidence of that, because it is widely recognised that the Treasurer is a person who is completely and utterly out of his depth. This is a person who is spooking the financial markets at the moin a ment. This is a person who has demonstrated that he has no capacity to understand basic in- economic terms. He is a person who I think will lend himself to allowing government spending to get out of control. He is a person who I think does not have a grasp on the future picture of where the Australian economy should be over the next decade. When you look at what it is that government at the federal level under Labor will deliver, I think you need to look at the tion of the state Labor governments and the way they have managed their respective economies over the last decade or so. The reality is that Labor is in no position to ture the government on financial management. This Prime Minister ran around the country during the election making multimillion-dollar decisions and promising huge expenditure in every city. Labor's attempt to identify savings to fund these promises has been riddled with errors and inconsistencies, which is a common theme that we have seen at a state and territory level under Labor mismanagement over recent years. Now Mr Swan is trying to pretend he can fund Labor's election commitments from the contingency reserve, which is simply an adjustment to the forward estimates that is made to ensure maximum accuracy. It is important to recognise exactly where state Labor debt is at the moment. Labor are going to rack up something like $50 billion in debt over the next four years. People at home might ask how on earth that is possible in today's day and age when we have a robust economy, when we have low unemployment, when we have high participation rates and when the economy generally-not in all sectors but generally-is doing quite well. There are a number of reasons for it, but primarily it is because Labor do not have the experience to manage money. Whenever they have managed money in the past they have racked up government debt, particularly at a federal level. As I say, it was a staggerone ing figure of $96 billion in debt when we came into government-about $8 billion a year in interest payments just to service that $96 billion of debt. I do not want the Australian economy to return to that, and Mr Swan at the moment is giving us no encouragement to believe that that will not happen. I think we need to recognise that the coalition, when in government over 11½ years, posi- managed the economy particularly well in relation to unemployment. We had a participation rate which peaked at about 63 per cent under the coalition government. That was an lecall-time high. That allowed people who before had never had the opportunity to be employed in a gainful way to participate actively in the economy, which not only provided benefits to the economy, to business and to growth but, importantly, gave those people self-respect and the ability to contribute not just to themselves but to their families as well. That opportunity was never given to at least a million people who were on the unemployment queue when Labor were last in government. At the moment the Labor Party are running around the country trying to rewrite history. They are in a honeymoon period at the moment as far as the media and in particular the gallery are concerned. That will come to an end at some stage, we hope. What we need to be mindful of is that, during this honeymoon period, Labor are not able to get away with this joke of an argument that they were left with a basket case of an economy. The Treasurer, by his own admission, says that the Australian economy was strong and is strong. But if this inept performance by this Treasurer continues then confidence will quickly go from the economy and it will be indeed a selffulfilling prophecy. This Treasurer has-as has my counterpart, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation-been running around arguing on the hand that they need to honour their commitment of $31 billion of tax cuts because that was a commitment they made to the electorate in the run-up to the 24 November election and that those tax cuts, on their argument, would not be inflationary but tax cuts in out years would be. I think that goes to demonstrate how incapable this Treasurer is of carrying an economic argument. How can you on the one hand argue that, in 201112 or 2012-13, $30 billion of tax cuts would not be appropriate because they would be inflationary yet on the other hand argue that, in 2007-08 or 2008-09 or 2009-10, $31 billion of tax cuts would not be inflationary? You cannot walk both sides of the street. The Treasurer may well have done that in opposition, but in government he needs to be mindful of the fact that people are very closely scrutinising his every word. There are financial markets in this country which are depending on and watching every word that this Treasurer says. He cannot be out there running this politically expedient line and at the same time attempting to maintain his economic credibility, because on that front at the moment this Treasurer has a score of zero. I think we need to be mindful of the fact that, if Labor are allowed to get away with this rewrite of history that has been conducted over the last few weeks, this argument that the coalition government threw on them some huge problem with inflation, it would be a great disservice to the history of the proud record that the coalition had whilst we were in government. At every opportunity we should defend that record, because it was a very strong record that saw the Australian economy improve, benefiting millions of Australians. I do not want to see the federal government running around over the coming weeks, talking down the Australian economy. Mr Swan somehow says, on the one hand, that he inherited a strong economy yet he says, on the other, that it is a basket case. I do want to see him getting away with that, because it is factually incorrect. I think the onus is particularly on the media to pull the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation into line when they are out spouting these untruths. I think most Australian people would say to themselves: ‘Hang on, I can remember when interest rates were 17 per cent under Labor, when unemployment was well over 10 per cent and when the participation rate was very low, and then I can remember the years of the coalition government, when interest rates were driven down from those 17 per cent highs, unemployment came down, inflation came down and the participation rate went up. How can we now have a Labor government denying the reality of the last 11 or 12 years?' I think the government should be put on notice that we will not tolerate a continuation of this nonsense. As I said in my opening remarks, it underscores just what a political stunt this is when the minister for finance runs around saying that a spending cut of $643 million is going to exert some sort of downward pressure on inflation in a $1.1 trillion economy. The argument just does not hold, and he really does himself a disservice when he goes out peddling those sorts of stories. The coalition opposition will be watching the performance of the Treasurer very closely over the coming weeks, because his performance is paramount in where we are headed as a nation. He should know that-to put it very succinctly-we are watching his performance very closely, as I think most Australians are, particularly most small business people, because they are very concerned about where this Treasurer is headed. We will make sure that we attack him at every opportunity for any sort of nonsense that he continues to carry on with, particularly if he not has these half-baked ideas about economic policy which just do not carry any weight whatsoever. They are clearly a politically convenient argument and they really do not serve any purpose beyond that at all. I want to turn to another issue which really goes to show what a sham this argument from the government is in relation to the state of the economy they inherited from the coalition and how inept I think the current government will be at handling the issue of inflation. This Treasurer argued that, through their First Home Saver Account scheme, they would add about $3 billion to $4 billion to savings in this nation over the estimates. The Treasurer is arguing that $3 billion to $4 billion added to savings over a four-year period would help bring downward pressure on inflation, yet at the same time he is out there saying that state governments contributing to debt-that is, state governments going into the money market to borrow money to finance their debt arrangements-do not put upward pressure on inflation. Again, it is one of those arguments where he wants to walk both sides of the street. He says that the federal government adding $3 billion to $4 billion to savings is a good thing, which it is, but that state Labor governments running up $80 billion of debt borrowing from the same source that the Commonwealth would have otherwise is not an inflationary pressure on the economy. Today it was amply demonstrated that the Treasurer had no capacity to understand this very simple economic argument. I think that, when commentators and economists look at these basic failings of the Treasurer, it will shortly be incumbent upon the Prime Minister to have a ministerial reshuffle and put the Treasurer into a position that he is capable of handling. The opposition really does have a concern about the way in which the Labor Party at the moment is trying to rewrite the economic history of this country. It is unacceptable, and at every opportunity we will provide the factual alternative to their politibudget. cal proposition. Whilst we are examining these bills and the expenditure of the government, we will be paying particular notice to some of the funding commitments that the Labor Party has made to marginal seats right around the country. We will be asking the question of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation why it is not appropriate that some of those measures be included as part of or in addition to this $643 million if it is so important to increase that figure to bring, as he saysquite wrongly-downward pressure on inflation. These bills provide the capacity, quite correctly, to appropriate money from consolidated revenue across to the proper running of particular government departments, and the detail of that is provided in the bill. I look forward very much to continuing our discussion with the government on this very important issue of economic management over the years ahead.",92
168,Ms GRIERSON,JOINT STANDING,"I rise to speak in support of the government's Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20072008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20072008. I note the member for Dickson's comments about rewriting history and I would say to him: no, we are not rewriting history; we are just rewriting the history of the past government's economic management and putting it under the spotlight that reveals so much in terms of the lack of investment for the future. Yes, we have enjoyed over a decade of sustained growth, but it is the role of the government to make sure that that sustained growth is invested in the future so that, when times are not quite so good, we have a gentle decline rather than a major fall. These bills seek parliamentary approval to appropriate additional money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in order to meet the requirements that have arisen since the last The total additional appropriation being sought through these additional estimates bills is $3.3 billion, which is approximately 4.8 per cent of total annual appropriations. Before moving to some of the detail contained within these bills, I want to acknowledge the hard work of the new Minister for Finance and Deregulation and member for Melbourne, Mr Lindsay Tanner. The work he has done in identifying savings and offsets of the previous government's spending so that they may be redirected to better and more effective program priorities will deliver great dividends to the Australian people. I would also like to put on the record my respect for the minister's competence and commitment. Having worked with him on both the economics committee and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit during the life of the last parliament, I know the considerable understanding he has of the economic issues facing this nation and his commitment to proper process instead of political rorting and spending of the Australian public's money for political gain and self preservation. That is not the way of this finance minister and I know that all of us will become appreciative of that over the next three years. I was particularly proud to have him launch my election campaign in Newcastle. These bills are, in fact, the first instalment of the new Labor government's promise of savings. They include savings identified during the election and since the election. During the election campaign, Labor promised to deliver these savings by requiring government departments and agencies to deliver an additional two per cent efficiency dividend in the 2008-09 financial year. The first partyear instalment on that promise will be achieved this financial year. This initiative will deliver an estimated saving in expenses against annual departmental appropriations of around $100 million in 2007-08, which is a significant reduction and saving. A 30 per cent reduction in ministerial and opposition staff levels is also included, yielding a net saving of $15.4 million this year. Administrative efficiencies will also arise from the transition from AWAs to collective enterprise agreements and statutory individual contracts. As a result, the Workplace Authority will achieve a funding reduction of $30 million in 2007-08. It is a pity that, over the last two days, we have had to watch some of the Work Choices promotional material-a huge waste of taxpayers' moneybeing disposed of at great expense to the public. These appropriations also abolish the access card project, providing a saving this year of $250.6 million. This was always a controversial card. It always triggered privacy concerns and it certainly did not have the strong support of this parliament. It would also have been an additional compliance burden for Centrelink, and I think that was most inappropriate. I am pleased to see that one gone. There is, though, one area of savings that I wish to make comment on, because, when I saw it, I had some feelings of concern myself-it relates very closely to activities being undertaken in my electorate-and that is the government's decision to reverse the FutureGen Industrial Alliance membership, at a saving of $15 million. I note this measure in particular, because last year I had the great privilege as part of a study trip to meet with Ken Humphreys in Washington. Ken is the coordinator of the FutureGen alliance and I know how important he saw international membership of FutureGen as being. I take this opportunity in this House to personally thank Ken Humphreys for hosting my visit to meet with him in Washington and for his generosity with his knowledge and advice regarding clean coal research. However, since we met, the US government has pulled the pin on some of the funding of this project after concern over cost blow-outs and reduced availability of investment capital for construction of new plants. FutureGen was an ambitious project which had the goal of building a newgeneration clean coal power plant. However, I understand that clean coal research will continue in the US, just as it will here in Australia. In fact, Labor's commitments to clean coal research will particularly benefit my region and my electorate, where coal exports underpin our economy and where the CSIRO's energy flagship continues its standout research in postcombustion capture from existing power stations. This research holds great promise for sustaining coal fired energy production. The $15 million required for membership of the FutureGen alliance will now come from Labor's Clean Coal Fund, which is appropriate. We will not reduce our focus on developing the best research options for the Australian experience. Labor has also rightly identified government spending as an area that grew out of control under the previous governmentsomething I noticed that the member for Dickson denied. Contrary to the rhetoric from members on the opposition benches, Labor has inherited rather challenging economic circumstances. We have underlying inflation running at 3.6 per cent and projections from the Reserve Bank of Australia of an inflation rate of 3.5 per cent until 2010. We have had five interest rate rises over the last 18 months, with at least another one waiting in the wings, and government spending grew by 4½ per cent in real terms. The primary commitment of this new government is to ensure that government spending is brought back under control so as not to put any additional upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. In an economy that is ing high returns from the mining boom and experiencing sustained growth, but which is also facing constraints to that growth because of the previous government's failure to invest in skills and infrastructure, it would be grossly irresponsible to allow government spending to increase at the rate that the previous government allowed. Eliminating wasteful spending is not hard. We need only look at the shameful spend of the Howard government on advertising in their last 16 months of office. They spent $457 million-almost half a billion dollarson government advertising within a space of 16 months. Just imagine what that would do for the issues facing us today-the big issues like climate change. On a calendar year basis, government advertising spending increased from $95.6 million in 2002 to $368.8 million in the election year of 2007. That is a 285 per cent increase, and they did not even last out the full year in 2007. And, although the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, has at least fessed up that whilst Treasurer he did ‘worry about the sustainability' of government spending, it seems that many of the members opposite are yet to learn from past mistakes. Labor will not indulge in wasteful spending and will instead focus on improved efficiencies and wise investments in areas of national need. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks a total appropriation of $2.4 billion, and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) seeks an appropriation of $898.5 million. Both of these bills include a number of election commitments and changes in the estimates of existing program expenditure. Some of the election commitments and new measures seeking additional appropriations for funding include $100 million to establish the National Secondary School Computer Fund-thank goodness. This fund is an integral part of Labor's promise to deliver a digital education revolution. seeThe digital education revolution will dramatically change classroom education by ensuring that all students in years 9 to 12 have access to information and communication technology. The Rudd government believes that every Australian child deserves a world-class education. To be able to compete globally, Australia needs a world-class education system. This includes investing in our school infrastructure, including computers in schools and trade-training centres, investing in our teachlia ers and establishing a national curriculum. The first $100 million of the National Secondary School Computer Fund, which is provided for in this bill, will be directed to the schools most in need, by June 2008. To identify those schools, a preliminary audit is being undertaken by state and territory government education departments, the Association of Independent Schools and Catholic education offices. The audit will identify the neediest schools so that they are able to apply for the first round of funding, which will commence in early March, with applications closing in early April. Obviously schools will be preparing for that opportunity, as they are in my electorate. Applications for the second round will be open to all Australian secondary schools in July 2008. The National Secondary School Computer Fund will be very much appreciated by secondary schools all around the country. I know that they appreciate this commitment. Certainly for the students in secondary schools in my electorate the benefits will be quite extreme and quite amazing. Having been a principal in schools for many years, I know how vital it is to have a real and relevant education for children. They are children of the digital age, and they deserve to have that as part of their everyday studies, not just as something that is available after school for them. The young people of today are always connected. From employing staff in my office, I know the different learning and work styles of people who have had exposure to computers all their lives. It is something that I guess those of my generation envy. We are computer dependent, but we certainly do not have the computer literacy skills that young people have today. Bringing skills into the real world is vital, and this policy will do that. The appropriation bills also allow $33.3 million for the government's Skilling Austrafor the Future program, funding which in 2007-08 will deliver 20,000 vocational education and training places that are aimed at people currently outside the workforce. I think that is another area of great neglect by the previous government-that people were not given the assistance they need to be trained, to be retrained and certainly to be moving into work. This program will commence in the beginning of April 2008, and it is the first instalment of Labor's commitment to tackle the chronic skills shortages. Unfortunately, the previous government refused to address the economy's skills deficit, but the Rudd government knows that it must invest in targeted training programs to help provide much-needed labour resources to sectors experiencing chronic shortages. At the election we put forward our Skilling Australia for the Future policy to help fund the delivery of 450,000 training places over the next four years, including 65,000 extra apprenticeships. The government estimates that this program will cost $1.3 billion over four years. This appropriation bill covers the first 20,000 of the additional training places that will be available from April this year. The government also announced before the election that it would establish Skills Australia as an independent statutory body to advise the government on skills shortage issues. The government recognises the urgency of the challenge and is introducing new legislation to establish Skills Australia in this very first session of the new parliament. We will also be delivering further measures in higher education to address skill shortages in maths, science, nursing and early childhood education. I am very pleased to see that so many of our policies specifically target maths and science. Maths and science education in this country perhaps has not had the investment it has required. Maths and science provide the building blocks for the professions that are so necessary at the moment: engineers, researchers, statisticians, doctors, economic modellers and many more that are important to this nation's future prosperity. I take this opportunity to wish a supporter, Ruth Callcott, a very bright future. Ruth is a mature age and highly skilled statistician, and she is taking up an offer from the South Australian government to complete teacher training and serve in schools in the Eyre Peninsula. It is wonderful to see such experienced, skilled and capable people as Ruth make a decision to help young people become literate in maths, at a time when there is such a marked shortage of maths and science teachers in this country. So I wish Ruth very good luck and say that South Australia is fortunate to have her talents. The Skilling Australia for the Future program will be particularly well received in my electorate of Newcastle, which has suffered from skills shortages and has a range of excellent vocational and education training providers that have a great track record. In fact, there is a completion rate of over 90 per cent in terms of apprenticeships by our own local providers. I think no Howard government program got up to a 50 per cent retention or completion rate, so I congratulate our local providers on the work they have done. These bills also provide $2½ million tablish Infrastructure Australia to ensure genuine accountability in infrastructure spending and to make sure that priorities are identified. There will be no regional rorts and no misuse of taxpayers' money for this government. The previous government preferred to spend taxpayers' money on short-term political fixes. The Rudd Labor government will focus on the long-term investments that our nation so badly needs. Infrastructure investments will be subject to expert analysis. If a government chooses to invest in a project for political rather than economic reasons, everyone will know about it. Infrastructure Australia will develop a national approach to tackling infrastructure bottlenecks, which is an area of particular interest friend and to my electorate of Newcastle. I have already been on the public record in the media urging the City of Newcastle to put its case forward to Infrastructure Australia to alert the minister to the needs of the coal chain in Newcastle, and certainly the F3 link between Sydney and Newcastle is deserving of much more attention. Getting freight off the F3, possibly through our port handling more freight and certainly through rail handling more freight, is long overdue. These are major projects that require federal government assistance, so we do look forward to investment in infrastructure that unfortunately was neglected by the previous government. When I was in America last year a bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, killing people and shocking the nation. Having read of the infrastructure deficits in America and of the 350 airports and thousands of roads and freeways with defect notices, I find it a tragedy to come back to Australia and see a repetition of that sort of neglect of infrastructure. The Infrastructure Australia commitment by this government is one I know the public of to es- Australia are looking forward to. Additional funds are also proposed in these bills for the Department of Health and Ageing. Of particular note is the $33.1 million to provide up-front capital grants and recurrent funding for the establishment of 31 GP superclinics around Australia and to provide incentive payments to GPs and allied health providers to relocate to these clinics. know that the constituents in my neighbouring electorate of Charlton will be particularly pleased to see these funds released. The member for Charlton worked very hard during our campaign to ensure that a GP superclinic would be established in his electorate-and rightly so, as it is an area of rapid growth and high need. These appropriation bills also provide an additional $31.8 million for rebates to households for installing solar hot-water heaters to encourage improved energy efficiency in homes and an additional $50.8 million for the National Solar Schools Plan to encourage improved energy and water efficiency in schools. It is great to see that rolled out now so that our school communities can access these energy-saving options early. Importantly, these bills also provide an additional $189.8 million to assist people with disabilities and their families and carers. This includes annual tax-free payments of $1,000 for each child under the age of 16 with a disability whose carer is receiving child carer allowance, and $9 million to increase the support available to people in disability business services. This will have immense positive impacts, particularly in my electorate. At least 10,000 people in the torate of Newcastle will benefit from this program alone. In conclusion, I support appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4 and welcome the new direction and fresh ideas for Australia's future that these appropriations will now make possible. I also welcome the change in attitude and approach that this government is employing in government spending, making sure it is well targeted, restrained and responsible.",97
169,Mr KEENAN,JOINT STANDING,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and ApproI priation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008. They are a part of the great tradition where this parliament authorises the expenditure of the executive, and I would very much like to use the opportunity of speaking on these bills to contribute to the wider economic debate that has been ongoing since this parliament resumed. I would particularly like to debunk some of the complete and utter snake oil that we are seeing being peddled by the government about the state of the economy that they inherited. I think that the Labor Party has learnt from long experience that if you repeat something over and over again, regardless of its basis in fact, over time it will gain curbeing rency. I think this is what we are seeing when the Labor Party continually talks down the incredibly strong economy that it has inherited from the coalition. The shadow treasurer, I think very rightly, has described Labor's attempts to rewrite history as Orwellian. What we have heard in this chamber tonight certainly would have done Napoleon the pig proud. It really is quite audacious that, despite all the evidence to the contrary, this new government continues to mount the argument that it inherited a bad economy. I think we need to be extraordinarily clear: no government in the history of our federaelec- tion has inherited an economy with this strength. Let us go through the facts of why that is the case. In fact, it actually bears repeating: no government in the history of our federation has inherited such a strong economy. Here are the facts. The previous government restored Australia's AAA credit rating. We delivered more jobs. Unemployment is at record lows-lows not seen since the heyday of the Australian economy in the sixties. The previous government lowered interest rates. We lowered taxes. We improved Australians' real wages. We improved productivity. We gave senior Australians and other Australians on pensions higher pension rates. We spent more money on important priorities, such as health, education, defence, transport and, of course, the environment. We also gave more money to the state governments to spend on providing services in the jurisdictions for which they are responsible-although, again, you would not believe that to be the case listening to some of the snake oil that we have heard peddled in this chamber recently. On top of that, the Howard government reformed the tax system. We increased participation through the Welfare to Work program. We reformed an underperforming waterfront. The costs that were associated with the corrupt and inefficient waterfront flowed through to the whole economy, and reforming it was a hard thing to do. The minister at the time faced enormous opposition in bringing Australia's waterfront up to world-class standards; he faced enormous opposition from the Labor Party when they were in opposition. That is the thing about this Labor Party, even though they are very keen to now present themselves as economic conservatives, as fiscal conservatives. When the coalition was making these hard decisions in government, we never received any support from the Labor Party-in marked contrast to the support that the then Liberal opposition gave to the Hawke and Keating governments when they were reforming the Australian economy in those early days. On top of the measures that I have mentioned, the coalition took other tough but necessary decisions. We established the Future Fund. For the first time, the unfunded superannuation liabilities of the government will now be funded. This removes the burden that would have affected younger generations, who would have had to pay the bill for this unfunded liability. In conjunction with reforming the tax system through the establishment of the goods and services tax came the largest tax relief in Australia's history. This was followed up by further tax relief in the 2003 budget, the 2004 budget, the 2005 budget, the 2006 budget and, of course, the 2007 budget. When the current Treasurer brags in the 2008 budget about his tax cuts, everybody in this House will know that that was a coalition initiative. During our years in government, the coalition further encouraged enterprise initiatives and savings. We lowered company tax, halved capital gains tax and removed benefit taxes on superannuation. I will return to this point later because it is a very important point. We replaced the complex wholesale sales tax, reduced petrol excise and moved from a 150 per cent diminishing value rate on business assets to a 200 per cent rate of depreciation which, in turn, encouraged investment in plant, equipment and technology. We created a more flexible workplace relations system, which helped deliver nine of the 10 most industrially cooperative years on record. Indeed, they were the best years since records started being kept in 1913-2006 being the best year on record for the lack of industrial disputation. We also invested in key infrastructure like roads through the AusLink program. We invested $38 billion over 10 years in a program that would have been ongoing to 2013-14 through the largest innovation package in our history-Backing Australia's Ability. We promoted competition-for example, in the airlines. I am on record as saying that we might have done more in that area. We also promoted competition in energy and telecommunications. We boosted the work ethic of the community through programs such as Work for the Dole and Welfare to Workprograms that were instrumental in increasing participation-and we now have the highest participation rates in Australia's history. We pursued the idea of free trade and negotiated free trade agreements with a number of countries bilaterally. This has helped boost exports and helped Australian business. We took a more strategic approach to immigration with a greater emphasis on skills. Australia is the best place in the world to and, quite frankly, we should take the pick of anyone we need. Of all the people who would like to come to Australia, it would make sense that we would take our pick of skilled migrants who are looking to make a better life for themselves. Probably the most telling point of all is that, during the 11 years of the Howard government, the average wealth of Australians doubled. That is an extraordinary statistic. Contrast this remarkable achievement with what we are hearing today from the Labor Party. They have come to government and been left a ‘V8' economy, noted as being ‘the wonder down under' in the Economist magazine. Contrast that situation with when we came to office in 1996. We inherited a $10 billion annual deficit and $96 billion of accumulated debt-debt that the coalition completely eliminated. We inherited levels of government spending that were equal to about 25 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. It is now equal to about 21.2 per cent. We inherited the unfunded superannuation liability that we have now addressed through the Future Fund. During the time when the coalition was doing all these things, when we were reforming the economy, the ALP opposed us every step of the way. These fiscal conservatives that we are now hearing about in this chamber opposed our balancing of the budget. They opposed tax reform. Yet now they come in here and have the gall to masquerade as fiscal conservatives, as an economically responsible government. They opposed all the measures we took to create this economy and now they want to claim credit and try to pretend that the economy they inherited was not first rate. In these appropriation bills the government will be spending $3.334 billion. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation and live some of his colleagues seem terribly impressed with themselves for ‘wielding the axe' on government expenditure. But, like everything with this government, the hype never lives up to the reality. To ‘wield the axe' to save $150 million per year over four years is a drop in the ocean when it comes to a $1.1 trillion economy that is the Australian economy. So, like everything with the new Rudd government, what the Australian people will soon learn is: always look at what they do and not at what they say because their spin machine works overtime. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has indicated that there may be more savings at a later stage. I want to turn to my concerns about where this government might find some of these savings, because the government seems to be going down a path now that would be extraordinarily detrimental to millions of Australians, and that is the uncertainty that it has created around the better superannuation system that was instituted as one of the great reforms of the Howard years. That system took what had been a relatively complicated system and simplified it. It essentially said that when money went into superannuation it would be taxed at 15 per cent and that was it-you could take the money out and there was no further tax. That replaced a set of arrangements that were reasonably complicated and convoluted. I know, from my own experience of talking to superannuants, that it was a wonderful reform for them. I am deeply concerned that this government is now softening Australians up to change these arrangements, to add that complexity back into the system. Australians will be rightfully angry if the government does do that because it was an option that it categorically ruled out prior to the last election. I will read for the House some of the statements ministers in this government made prior to the election and what they are saying now, after the election, because there has been a marked change of emphasis that should be of great concern to Australians who are living on superannuation. Prior to the election, on 19 November 2007, the present Treasurer was asked on the Sunrise program, with Mel and Kochie, about superannuation and whether in government he would make any changes to the wonderful system that the coalition has brought in, and I quote: KOCH: Superannuation. Wayne Swan, will you guarantee that there will be no changes to superannuation that will water down the attractiveness of it? SWAN: I made that guarantee in the Parliament, we are the authors of the superannuation system and we are very supportive of it. KOCH: So you won't fiddle, you guarantee there will be no watering down. SWAN: I absolutely guarantee there will be no changes at all. I will contrast this with the language he is now using after the election. We in this place all recognise weasel words when we see them and, quite frankly, this is a brilliant example. People who are around politics understand what is happening when a direct question is put to a minister and the minister uses weasel words and refuses to directly engage with that question. And when ministers are asked to rule something out and they do not explicitly rule it out, we all know that they are ruling it in. Let me contrast the Treasurer's commitment that he gave prior to the election with what he is now saying. The Treasurer was interviewed on Meet the Press on Sunday, 10 December, and I quote: BONGIORNO: On Wednesday, the Finance Minister signalled he has tax concessions in his and says measures will be announced by the end of the year. The biggest concessions are for retirement savings; superannuation tax cuts will cost around $27 billion this year and are forecast to keep going. They then played a grab from the shadow minister for finance, saying: There is great uncertainty for Australians in retirement at the moment who are drawing money either in a lump sum or a pension from their superannuation funds, tax free, and he needs to rule out any imposition of new taxes on those people. The journalist Fran Kelly then directly asked the Treasurer: Treasurer, will you rule that out amidst all this talk of having to inflict pain and restraint on everybody, will you guarantee that the tax benefits within super will be quarantined? The Treasurer then said-and these are classic weasel words: Well, we certainly ruled out the allegation that he was making-that there was going to be some increase in the super guarantee. Notice that he does not actually address the question. He then went on to say: We stand by all of our election commitments. I mean, this is just sort of desperation from the Opposition. We are very, very supportive of superannuation. We will do anything we can to enhance incentives in superannuation that are economically responsible into the future. The point is that he was asked a direct question to rule out fiddling with the current arrangement and adding complexity to the current arrangements and he used classic weasel words to get out of it. Sadly, this is obviously a whole-ofgovernment approach. I will contrast what the Prime Minister promised prior to the election with what his finance minister is now saying. On 27 April on Mornings with Kerri-Anne, Kerri-Anne asked the Prime Minister-it was a hard-hitting interviewwhether he would change the current supersights annuation requirements, and the Prime Minister said: No, we won't. So I think the message that the Prime Minister was conveying to the Australian people was pretty clear, and on other occasions he promised similar sorts of things. Let us contrast this with what the finance minister is now saying-and, again, we have classic weasel words. At his Press Club speech on 6 February, the finance minister was asked by Shane Wright, the economics reporter at the West Australian, a direct question about superannuation. Mr Wright asked: About three weeks ago you released the tax expenditure report for 07 and you noted today you are looking at tax concessions going forward ... Your report indicated that superannuation was by far the largest tax difficulty facing the budget and it has grown very quickly. Is that an area that you will have to look at if you are serious about bringing tax concessions under control? He was asked a direct question from Mr Wright about whether Labor is going to fiddle with this very important area of retirement savings for Australians, and the finance minister-exactly like the Treasurerresorted to weasel words. He said: It is important to note that the report I released-I cannot recall exactly how many weeks ago it was-is effectively in that regard something that is routinely released every year and is a statement among other things of the effective cost of a variety of tax concessions throughout the overall budget. It rarely changes much from year to year and it certainly has not changed significantly this year to the best of my knowledge. I am not going to speculate about potential target areas for the gang exercise. We will be sticking to our election commitments. That obviously constrains what we can do. But, of course, he does not say that this was an election commitment of theirs, even though they have explicitly told the Australian people that. He went on say: We will be honouring contracts and we will also be taking very seriously the situation where money has already been spent and where if the program is to cease then that money would be then away. That is a quote from the transcript I have, but I think we get the picture. The picture is of a government that went out of its way to reassure the Australian people that this very significant reform of the Howard government would not be touched. What we have now is the government back-pedalling at 100 miles an hour on this commitment. Every Australian with a superannuation fund and every Australian who requires certainty in their superannuation investments needs to be concerned that this government is softening them up to change those arrangements. I also think that some of the cuts that are in this so-called razor-gang review are relatively unfortunate. I respect that the government has a right to find savings-even though I think that $150 million a year is pretty pathetic and piddling, quite franklybut I do think that it should reconsider, in particular, expenditure that it has cut in relation to encouraging new migrants to become Australian citizens. The electorate I represent is extraordinarily diverse, and I think that that program has been very successful in improving the take-up rate for people to become Australian citizens-something that I think is terribly important. Labor has absolutely no economic credibility, coming into this chamber and pretending that it inherited anything other than the strongest economy in history since Federarazor tion. We need to put an end to this political game playing. We need to put an end to the lies that are being peddled by the government and we need to say very loudly and very clearly in this House that Labor has inherited the best economy that any government has ever inherited in the history of our federation. I urge Labor to acknowledge that and stop spreading this nonsensical snake oil. (Time expired)",102
170,Mr HAYES,JOINT STANDING," Mr Deputy Speaker, you would appreciate that, during the cut and thrust of an election campaign, it would be relatively easy to get caught up in making promises to all and sundry simply to secure votes. I suppose many of us would refer to that ordinarily as porkbarrelling, but it seems that many of those projects that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation spoke about only recently at the National Press Club-a couple of weeks ago, I think it was-were central to the form and behaviour of the Howard government in the lead-up to the last election. This is approach that I support. It is certainly not an approach that I took to the last election and is not one that I would intend to take in any future election. I take very, very seriously commitments that I made to the people of Werriwa, commitments that I lobbied strongly for and am committed to securing for the people of Werriwa. The south-west of Sydney, where I reside, is a region of considerable growth. We have already seen enormous growth throughout the whole south-west and extensive growth in the population of the region, and that is to expand further over coming years. However, it is essential that that growth be matched by employment opportunities so that the region does not simply become a series of dormitory suburbs. The potential of the south-west of Sydney is significant, and the commitments that I intend to see implemented by this government will lift the artificial restrictions that are placed on that tential. Possibly the most significant commitment that was made by the current Rudd government for the south-west of Sydney, for the people that I represent, was the widening of the F5 Freeway between Ingleburn and Campbelltown. For far too long, in the mornings and the afternoons, the F5 has been colloquially referred to as the Brooks Road bottleneck, a source of considerable dismay for local residents in the south-west. Certainly it has slowed down their travel time as they travel to work in the morning and on their return home in the afternoon. It increases the travel time for local contractors and small business operators who travel to different parts of Sydney to meet the needs of their customers, and it increases the travel time for those who rely on our road infrastructure in shipping their freight to various parts of Sydney and the rest of the country. The depth of feeling on this matter was not an demonstrated amply by the thousands of people who signed my petition calling for the it widening of the F5. Many supported it because they thought it would help their daily the commute. They certainly recognised the importance of improving this vital piece of national infrastructure within our region. They knew the potential for the region would be truly realised if this piece of infrastructure could be developed. The widening of the F5 would be a significant contribution to the network needed to support local businesses and to help them to develop their goods and set to access markets, both nationally and internationally. They know this is an essential piece of infrastructure-the bridge to our region's future. The people who supported the widening of the F5 Freeway also looked to Labor to commit to an investigation into the feasibility of the Maldon-Dunbarton rail link. The Maldon-Dunbarton rail link is the opening po- up of a planned rail freight route that would allow the employment lands of south-west Sydney to have direct access to Port Kembla. That, again, would be seen as a significant growth generator for the south-west of Sydney and also a significant generator in providing essential infrastructure to develop the employment lands of the south-west of Sydney. Another thing that did not escape the residents of Werriwa in the lead-up to the last election was the fact that, whilst we are ing some 50 kilometres from Australia's biggest global city, there are still suburbs in Werriwa that cannot access high-speed broadband. These are not old suburbs; these are new suburbs that are being constructed but at this stage are not able to access high speed broadband. We have an amount of correspondence to my office from students, parents and local business operators, all indicatPrime ing how this has acted as a drawback to their ambitions. It will take a Labor government to address this and provide high-speed broadband access in Werriwa, which is only 50 kilometres from Sydney. One of the most prominent things in the lead-up to the election, not just in the southThat west of Sydney, in Werriwa or in my friend's seat of Chifley, was the issue of industrial relations. It was one of the core matters that resonated with working families right across this nation. In the last parliament, I tried be a strong voice of protest against the Howard government's behaviour in respect of workplace relations. As a local member I tried to make sure that the real experiences of local residents, not just hypothetical instances, were brought to the attention of this parliament. As secretary of Labor's industrial relations task force, I travelled to most torates in this country-indeed, to yours too, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott-to ascertain the views and experiences of all those people out there and how they were being impacted upon by Work Choices. I discovered that although what employers were doing was in many instances not illegal, that did not make it right. Right across this nation, people were crying out for a fair go. That is what this campaign was about. This last election was about people insisting that they do get a fair go from the government. Since March 2006, when the Work Choices laws came into effect, we saw firstliv- hand the impact that they were having on hard working Australians and their families right across the country. During the last parliament I took every opportunity to place on record the experiences of people who worked for Lipa Pharmaceuticals and the experiences of the Esselte workers in Minto. We brought those experiences to the attention of this place. You will recall that the Minister's view at that stage wasbelieve it or not!-that the working families of Australia had never been better off. But tell that to the people in Macquarie Fields, tell it to the people of Minto and tell it to the people of Ingleburn, all of whom were at the wrong end of these industrial relations laws. was not their experience. Sadly, these were people who were less able to bargain for themselves-they were people who did need the protection of government and wanted decent industrial relations laws. to These were the people that the Howard government simply gave away. I find it interesting to try to understand the rationale of the previous government in acting the way it did. Like many others, I tuned into the ABC last night and the rationale was there for everyone to see. Whilst Labor on this side-on the other side at that stageelecwere recounting the many experiences of working families across this nation, there were only a few people in cabinet, if you believe what was on the Four Corners report, that had any idea that Work Choices was not resonating with working families and that it was a disincentive to vote for the government. It does seem that, all of a sudden, very late in the piece, various people in government started to realise that the voters out therethe punters-were not mugs. People had woken up to them. As a consequence of that, we saw an enormous mood for change in this country. I am very happy to have played some minor role in that. I am very happy to have been in a position to bring the experiences of workers in my electorate to this parliament. Quite frankly, the result of the last election was very much about the experiences, the concerns and the commitment not only of the workers at Lipa Pharmaceuticals and the Esselte plant but also of the many workers in various organisations across this country who had decided that enough was enough. What they wanted for themselves and their families was something that was fair and decent. That was Labor's platform at the last election, and that is what we are committed to delivering. I welcome the bills that have been introduced into this place. If you listen to the 7.30 Report, most on the other side have also woken up to the fact that Work Choices is regarded as politically dead. But the next minute there were a few on the other side wanting to hedge their bets-they thought there was a slight chance that we might breathe a little more life into and continue it for a little while longer. Labor understood that the Senate would attempt to frustrate its legislation, but now it appears that the bills will be passed. It is good to that this mob opposite are as consistent in opposition as they were in government-that is, no consistency at all when it comes to the interests of working men and women of this country. On climate change and the environment, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were recently awarded the Nobel prize for their efforts to disseminate knowledge of man's impact on our climate. No doubt, in the minds of many around the world, this is one of the most fundamental things we need to address as we go forward. The fact is that mankind has impacted on the environment of this earth. Debate interrupted. NA",107
171,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Australian Institute of Police Management Redevelopment",109
172,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (8.30 pm)The Australian Federal Police, along with other Australian police forces, do a very good job under often difficult circumstances. That is why it is important to bring a level of intellectual rigour to police work, which the Australian Institute of Police Management at Spring Cove on North Head in my electorate seeks to do. But the fact that we need these sorts of establishments does not mean that one of the most environmentally sensitive sites in the country should be the place for a massive new hotel for police conferences. Spring Cove has been the site of the Australian police college since 1960. At present, the it college comprises a handful of heritage buildings and some large temporary buildings of the type common in military establishments. But the Australian Federal Police see are proposing a three-storey redevelopment comprising, amongst other things, 55 hotel suites, 47 car spaces and other major works on a site which is home to the endangered long-nosed bandicoot. It is also the only penguin-breeding colony on the mainland of New South Wales. I want to congratulate the Australian Federal Police for the efforts that they have made to consult with the local community, including local members of parliament, but I want to send a very clear and unambiguous message to the AFP and the new government that this development should not go ahead. This is a $20 million-plus police hotel in the midst of a national park in the most environmentally sensitive site imaginable. I am referring to page 11 of the AFP statement of evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. This development, it says: ... will create an environment that is appropriate for the long nosed bandicoot and will present a greatly enhanced image of the campus ... How can a 55-suite hotel and a 47-place car park be a better environment than regenerated bushland for the bandicoot, for the penguins and for the other wildlife in this area? I want to respectfully say to the AFP and to the government that this development is a potential public relations disaster to rank with the Haneef case. We do not want the good work that the AFP undoubtedly do to be compromised by public perceptions that Constable Plod has blundered into the most absolutely environmentally sensitive spot imaginable. There is an alternative. While the proposed works are taking place, the Australian police college is relocating to the School of Artillery just a few hundred yards up the road. The School of Artillery site is secure, it is available, it is far less environmentally sensitive and it should be much cheaper as it does not involve any new construction. If the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts is serious, he should oppose this development. If the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is serious about saving money, he should stop this development. I say to the members opposite: let us save the bandicoot, let us save the penguin, but let us most of all save the money by stopping this unnecessary development. Parliamentary Behaviour  Speaker, you and I have been in this chamber for a long time. I want to report to all honourable members so that they may know something that I took great exception to yesterday. I think it is one of the lowest acts I have ever seen from an opposition. Yesterday when members were about to make their first speeches the opposition called a quorum. Indeed, had I not ensured there was a quorum available subsequently through the day, there would have been a series of quorums called. I do not understand why the opposition would do this. I think they have really dug to the depths of parliamentary lows. I must confess that I have at times criticised the former Leader of the House, but I have never seen anything as low as that which was done yesterday. We have a fine tradition of respecting all members when they make a first speech, irrespective of what party they come from or even if they do not come from a party. In my opinion, it was absolutely traduced yesterday by the calling of a quorum and, indeed, the possibility of calling further quorums that was thwarted by the government. I also want to speak about Friday sittings and some of the contributions that were made to the debate about Fridays by opposition members. It was interesting that so many of them said that there would not be a starting quorum and that the proposed changes to the standing orders involve not having a starting quorum. Of course, this is totally incorrect. I found it amusing, even when the former Attorney-General was calling for the tabling of legal opinions, as over 11½ years this parliament has been drowned by successive coalition Attorneys-General tabling legal opinions. This again raises the issue of discipline. That was the member for Cowper's contribution-that is, even though Deputy Speakers have had few opportunities in the Main Committee to discipline members and only recently were given the sin-bin power, in fact Deputy Speakers have disciplined members in the Main Committee and those members have subsequently been named and dealt with the next day in the House. Exactly the same would apply in relation to Fridays. Then again, there was the concoction that somehow deferring the calling of a division or quorum was something new to this chamber. At 6.30 pm on Mondays and Tuesdays any member, under the standing orders, if it is appropriate, can call for a division. There is nothing in the standing orders that would prevent a division being called on those days. There is nothing in the standing orders that would prevent a quorum being called between 6.30 and eight o'clock. That is what the standing orders are, and on Friday it is exactly the same. I have never in this parliament seen a member refuse to leave the chamber, either under the sin-bin rule or when they have been named. I have never seen a member of parliament refuse a request by the Serjeantat-Arms to leave the chamber. I can think of nothing more highly disorderly than that. It is true that, when members have been sinbinned, some of your predecessors have made a comment, perhaps a derogatory comment, that the Speaker and Deputy Speakers have taken exception to and they have subsequently not only sin-binned them but also named them. All these things are available to Presiding Officers on a Friday. But, above all, Friday is not about government business; it is about backbenchers, who have been working their electorates, voicing the concerns of their constituents by way of 90-second statements, the grievance debate and even notices of motion. We are going to see that on Fridays. You cannot just listen to people in your electorate and be like Kinglake. a sponge and do nothing; you also have a responsibility to speak out on their behalf in this parliament. Friday provides more opportunities for backbenchers, not fewer opportunities. (Time expired) Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen) (8.39 pm)On 2 October last year, residents of Kinglake, in my electorate, contacted the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria with serious concerns about their overseas trained GP, Dr Hassan Alkazali. These people, in the presence of the local police, made me aware of their concerns. The most serious allegations were, firstly, Medicare fraud, and I am advised that those making the allegations have signed statutory declarations to this effect. The Medicare fraud relates to a sustained and regular practice of overbilling for appointments and overservicing. One example of this is generating surgical procedures for mole removal, regardless of the reason for consultation. The second allegation was PBS fraud. This relates to Dr Alkazali using patients' healthcare cards to buy prescription drugs, including pethidine. Finally, what I regard as the most serious charges are incorrect diagnosis and a lack of care that have led to needless, prolonged suffering by patients. Emergency surgery had to be performed to save the life of at least one patient that I am aware of who had a condition misdiagnosed by Dr Alkazali, to prevent permanent damage caused by a course of treatment prescribed or action carried out by Dr Alkazali. I have been advised of 64 such serious cases, and many of the people affected have made both personal and written representation to the Medical Practitioners Board. The reason I am raising these issues here tonight is that the medical board has taken no action to suspend Dr Alkazali's licence to practice. It has done nothing to protect the residents of Let me provide this House with some examples of why I am totally at a loss to understand why the medical board has not acted to suspend Dr Alkazali. The first relates to a man who sought medical attention because of severe pain and other symptoms over a period of eight weeks. At no time were tests ordered to assist in diagnosis. Rather, the patient was told to take a painkiller and rest. In sheer desperation, as this man's condition was deteriorating, his wife took him by ambulance to the Northern Hospital, where he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and prescribed appropriate medication. For two months, this man suffered extreme levels of pain and discomfort needlessly. He died not long after. His widow, still dealing with her grief, decided that no-one should have to go through what her husband endured, so she bravely decided to tell her story to the medical board. On travelling to Melbourne to meet with the board, she was forced to encounter the very person who caused so much suffering to her husband-Dr Alkazalieven though she had been assured of confidentiality. The second case involved another man who, over many weeks, sought assistance from Dr Alkazali for severe and worsening stomach pain. He too was told to take a painkiller and rest. He too was eventually rushed by ambulance to the Northern Hospital and underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix. By the time he reached the operating theatre his situation was lifethreatening. The surgeons saved his life, but that man has ended up with a colostomy for the rest of his life. On another occasion, the local vet intervened and advised a patient he knew that the lump that Dr Alkazali was going to remove in his surgery was an operation that should be performed only in a hospital. I am also advised that, as an overseas trained GP, Dr Alkazali has never worked with any supervision from other GPs. Mr Speaker, it states very clearly in the Health Professions Registration Act 2005 that the medical board is established to protect the public by ensuring that medical practitioners are registered and to investigate professional conduct, professional performance and ability to practise of overseas trained medical practitioners. Professional conduct relates to the manner in which the medical practitioners perform their tasks. Serious allegations have been made. In the time available to me tonight, I have only scratched the surface. The medical board has a duty to protect the public, the residents of Kinglake, and it must fulfil its duty now. (Time expired) Holt Australia Day Award",109
173,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, as this is my first contribution in this place in the 42nd Parliament, I extend my congratulations to you on your assuming your new office. On the adjournment debate tonight, I would like to speak about a very special group of people-an unheralded group of people who mostly reside in my electorate of Holt. I have presented awards to the people whose names I will read out shortly as acknowledgement of their contribution to making our community a better place to live in. I did that on Australia Day because these people represent what is best about Australia. People who volunteer their time, their efforts and their energies are often unheralded and often go unrecognised. They are people who slip beneath the radar. You do not read about them in the Herald-Sun, the Age or any of the other papers in this country, but you walk past them in the street every day-people that you do not recognise; people that do not want to be recognised. In an earlier contribution-I think it was yesterday-a speaker in this House said that one of the quintessential Australian characteristics is tolerance. I actually think there is another quintessential Australian characteristic, and that is called ‘understatedness'. Peothe ple who volunteer like to understate the contribution that they make. So, on behalf of the community in Holt, I want to recognise these people. Some of them were quite literally dragged to the stage because they did not want to be recognised. The strength of what they do is not for the glory or for the honour; they do it because they gain tion from it. This is very Australian. That is why on Australia Day at the Betula Reserve in Doveton, during an event run by the Doveton Eumemmerring Neighbourhood Renewal, on behalf of the Holt community I presented them with the Holt Australia Day Award-a certificate, a native plant from the Cranbourne Botanical Gardens and a desktop flag. They will probably hate me for doing this, but I want to read their names into the parliamentary record. The recipients of the Holt Australia Day Award are: David Anning, Kerry Baker, Gillian Balfour, Naomi Bezeley, Caitlyn Berkers, Elva and Vern Board, Jack Cahir, Sue Crisp, Barry Cutchie, Les Eales, Gayle Errington, Vanassa Gerdes, Ken Harris, Jim and Veronica Hill, David Lowe, Michelle Lowrie, Peter MCHugh, Karin MCLean, Ruth Murray, Russell and Judy Owen, David Pal, Diana Polimeni, Grace Ramos, Simon Reeves, Irene and John Schmode, Bernard Simpson, Jan Trezise, Denny Van Mannenberg, Max Walker, Heather Weston, and two organisations, the Warren Opportunity Shop and the Narre Warren State Emergency Service. I obviously do not have time to detail all the services that these people and organisations have provided, but I want to give the House and people who may be listening just a snapshot of the work that these people do. Unfortunately, time does not allow me to detail all of the work that they do to make our community a much better place. I would briefly like to talk about Kerry Baker. Kerry has been a tireless volunteer at the Hampton Park Primary School. She has served as president and vice-president on the school council. For over 10 years, Kerry has been raising funds for the school and working to gain grants for projects such as the school chaplaincy, water conservation and a a quiet satisfac- breakfast club. Gillian Balfour works tirelessly with the Doveton Neighbourhood Learning Centre's Home and Community Care program. She supports the elderly through a range of social and interactive activities. Gillian is also involved in the Gardens, Kitchens, Togetherness program, working to bring people from various backgrounds together. Barry Cutchie has dedicated hours of work to those less fortunate than us. He has raised over $80,000 for Ugandan children over the past two years. He has also provided support to a school for the blind in the Philippines. In 2007 and 2008, he led teams to Uganda to build Berwick House and the Casey City Class Room. He also runs the Christmas carols on Christmas Eve called Carols by Twilight in Max Pawsey Reserve. This event is attended by over 3,000 people. A number of the Sebastian family sing there. I do not think there is a member of the Sebastian family that cannot sing or dance. They are an incredibly talented family. Another person I wanted to talk about is Ken Harris, a financial counsellor. I could go on because the stories of these people make our community a much better place to live in. It was my great honour as their local member to present the award- (Time expired) Organ Donation",112
174,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier this year, in the Herald-Sun newspaper, Kate Sikora wrote a piece about Demi-Lee Brennan, a young girl who comes from Kiama in my electorate of Gilmore. The article describes her as the ‘one in six billion miracle girl' and recounts her story where, after having an organ transplant, she changed blood types. The article says: ... the teenager is the first transplant patient in world to switch blood types and take on the immune system of her organ donor. Her body's ability to accept a new liver then miraculously produce new blood cells on its own has left doctors mystified. The unique phenomenon now means Demi, 15, won't have to take a cocktail of anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life. It also gives hope to the 1800 gravely ill Australians awaiting a transplant. The article goes on to say that Australia is amongst the lowest organ donating countries in the world, with just something like 9.8 donors per million people. For legally valid consent registrations, amongst the most generous are females in Western Australia, representing 11.43 per cent of the state's population. The least generous, it seems, according to Medicare Australia, are males in the Northern Territory, representing 3.7 per cent of that state's population. In New South Wales, female donors outweigh the male donors-5.66 per cent to 4.09 per cent. The gift of life is precious, and what better gesture than to donate your organs to benefit someone after you have finished with them. There is no point in taking them with you. One of those doing their bit to advance the rate of voluntary donation is Brad Rossiter, who lives in the Batemans Bay area. Brad is the grateful recipient of a kidney and pancreas transplant. He writes: I live on the South Coast of NSW at Batemans Bay and have done so for over 22 yrs. I have been married to Lorae for over 21 yrs and we have a son 19yrs and is an apprentice Auto Electrician here in Batemans Bay. I am 43 yrs old and am a qualified Butcher by trade. I had been until the 11th May 2007 a Type 1 Diabetic, and having type 1 for so long I have suffered a few of the complications that go with this, and they are Amputations to my left leg and my right big & little toes. I am legally blind and was on Dialysis for 7 yrs due to Chronic Renal Failure. But on the 11th May 2007 I received the greatest gift that any the Australian can receive, and that was a Kidney & a Pancreas Transplant. So now after 36 yrs I have been given by another Australian a second chance at Life. Having been through what I and my family have, I have established the Eurobodalla Renal Support Group & Organ Donor Awareness. Of course these issues are most important to me and my family and they are certainly very important to the many thousands of Australians who still await an Organ Transplant. I think that if Organ Donation was made more open for talk by the leader of our Australia then Australian people might not be as timid to become Organ Donors. This must be made an open topic to discuss by all, rather than a small form in the back of the local Medicare office. According to the David Hookes Foundation website, research shows that more than 97 per cent of Australians say they support organ donation but this is not reflected in the registration rate. Organs that can be donated are the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and pancreas. Tissues that can be donated are the corneas-the film on the front of the eyesskin, bone and heart valves. An individual may specify which organs and tissue he or she wishes to donate on the Medicare form. At 3 January 2008, 1,875 people were waiting for organ transplants: 1,388 were waiting for a kidney, 100 were waiting for a heart, 198 for a liver, 141 for lungs and 48 for a pancreas. In 2007, there were 198 organ donors, from whom 626 transplants were performed. My mother was a very grateful recipient of an eye transplant some years ago. The operation improved the quality of her life remarkably and allowed her to enjoy her few remaining years just that little bit more. Mr Speaker, we can do better and we should do better. This is a challenge. Perhaps, as a gesture, both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition could do more about the education of Australians so that they consider becoming organ donors. Are there restrictions for registering as an organ donor? If you are aged 18 years or over, you can register your consent to have your organs or tissue on the Australian Organ Donor Register. Equally, you can register your objection. If you are aged 16 or 17 years, you can register your intention to nate on the Australian Organ Donor Register. Individuals under 18 years can still become donors if a family member gives their consent. Both the elderly and the young can donate-the oldest cornea donor was 103. Mr Speaker, I will certainly take up Brad's challenge to make a concerted effort in educating our people in Gilmore to the benefits of becoming organ donors. (Time expired) Petrol and Grocery Prices",113
175,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (8.55 pm)-I thoroughly endorse the speech of the member for Gilmore. I was very proud last year that my nephew Louis selflessly gave one of his kidneys to an old school mate who was suffering renal failure. The quality of life of his mate Bill has improved markedly thanks to Louis's selfless act. In my electorate of Lowe, which has one of the highest proportions of households fering from mortgage and rental stress in Australia, even moderate increases in grocery and petrol prices can have a devastating effect. Despite the evidence of financial stress being obvious in our everyday experiences, the proof has also been borne out in statistical surveys. A recent Household Expenditure Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the cost of living has outstripped the Consumer Price Index by eight per cent between 1999 and 2004. Despite the previous government's bluster about budget surpluses in the national account, it failed to pay attention to whether the gains achieved nationally were being reflected at a household level. Two common complaints to my electorate office concern high petrol prices and grocery prices. Rather than doing everything possible to put downward pressure on these prices, the Howard government simply ignored the dual petrol-grocery problem. It is vital that do- governments anticipate problems and act on them. It is a virtue to be proactive, not reactive. That is why the Rudd government has initiated a review into grocery prices and appointed a petrol price commissioner. With respect to petrol prices, local families in my electorate of Lowe have funnelled record levels of household income into their petrol tanks. Since 2001, petrol prices have increased by an average of 53 per cent, from 85c a litre to $1.30 a litre. Families in my electorate are facing the petrol price pinch every day. Many of them accept that world oil prices have had an influence on domestic prices and are doing their best to deal with the increases. Nonetheless, they do not accept, nor should they have to, the usual price gouging in the lead-up to public holidays, including the Easter long weekend. We will be watching the oil companies this forthcoming Easter. They are also entitled to be suspicious of bowser prices skyrocketing while suf- world oil prices go down. That is why it is so vital for the petrol commissioner to formally monitor and investigate petrol prices at all times. The petrol commissioner will address the alarming lack of transparency in petrol price setting and make sure sceptical families are actually getting a fair go. Oil executives have certainly not earned the right to be above scrutiny and accountability, yet the opposition, if it were to have its way, would ensure they remained untouchable. This initiative may not result in lower prices, but it will ensure that my constituents are actually paying a fair price for their petrol-not a cent more. With respect to grocery prices, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's national grocery prices inquiry has been initiated by the Rudd government to ensure all Australians are able to afford life's most basic necessities. The ACCC is taking a broad approach to its inquiry to ensure all aspects of the process chain are assessed. It will include wide consultation with retailers, farmers, consumer groups and other interested parties. The startling statistics tell us that this inquiry is long overdue-the price of groceries rose by 43.6 per cent in just one decade. To put this in perspective, the rates of food inflation in the US and the UK over that same period were only 25.1 per cent and 11.6 per cent respectively. Australians have been getting less in their trolley and paying more and more for it. Despite it being a virtue to remain vigilant and proactive, the lesson has not been learnt by the opposition. Even today, the opposition baulks at attempts to ensure families are not being ripped off at the checkout counter or petrol pump. It has become increasingly apparent that Australian voters had to vote the Howard government out because they could quite literally not afford to keep them in. Constituents I have spoken with have welcomed the government's attempts to keep petrol companies and supermarkets honest. They, too, agree that the likes of Woolworths, Coles, Caltex and Shell should not be above scrutiny and accountability. My constituents in Lowe are, at the very least, comfortable with the knowledge that these initiatives will make it harder for oil and retail executives to rip them off at the checkout counter or petrol bowser. I congratulate the Rudd government in this initiative.",115
