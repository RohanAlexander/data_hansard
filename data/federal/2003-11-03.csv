0,NA,Unknown,"(a) the Speaker shall preside at the meeting; (b) the only proceedings shall be welcoming remarks by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and an address by the President the United States of America, after which the Speaker shall forthwith adjourn the House and declare the meeting concluded; and (c) the procedures of the House shall apply to the meeting so far as they are applicable ... The resolution was identical to resolutions of the House in respect of the 1992 visit by President George Bush Sr and the 1996 visit by President Clinton. The Senate was advised of this resolution by message, which also requested Senate concurrence with its terms and that it take action accordingly. On 9 October 2003 the Senate passed a resolution to the effect that the Senate invite President Bush to address the Senate on 23 October 2003, that the Senate accept the invitation of the House to meet with the House for that purpose and that the Senate ‘concurs in the provisions of the resolution of the House relating to the conduct of that meeting'. Accordingly, as members will recall, members of the House and Senate assembled in this chamber at 11.15 a.m. on 23 October 2003 and I took the chair in accordance with the resolution agreed by both chambers. During President Bush's address, as recorded in the proof Votes and Proceedings, at 11.30 a.m. Senator Brown was ordered understanding order 304A to withdraw from the House for one hour for continuing to interject. He refused to withdraw and ignored the Serjeant-at-Arms' direction, on my instruction, to leave the chamber. At 11.48 a.m. Senator Nettle was ordered to withdraw for continuing to interject. She also refused to withdraw and ignored the Serjeant-at-Arms' direction. Members may be unaware that at the same time as the senators' disorderly behaviour, a guest in the southern gallery rose and began to interject. He was immediately removed from the gallery under the arrangements I had authorised previously. I was subsequently advised that this person of was a guest of one of the Greens. After President Bush left the chamber, I named both senators for continuing to defy the chair. In accordance with House practice and procedure, which I remind the House both chambers had agreed would apply, the Leader of the House moved for the suspension of the two senators. This question was put and, as recorded in the proof Votes and Proceedings, was passed by members and senators present. This is not recorded in the proof Journals of the Senate for 23 October 2003. In accordance with House practice, I called the vote on the voices as being in the affirmative. I did not hear any request for a division and at 11.55 a.m. senators Brown and Nettle were suspended for 24 hours understanding order 305. There was no dissent from my ruling. Later that day I wrote to the President of the Senate confirming the motion endorsed by members and senators present. I advised the President of the provisions of standing order 307, which had the effect of excluding Senator Brown and Senator Nettle from the chamber, all its galleries and any room where the Main Committee was meeting, and that this suspension was for 24 hours from 11.55 a.m. on 23 October 2003. I asked the President to convey this advice to Senators Brown and Nettle, and I table a copy of my letter to the President. Also on 23 October 2003, the President and I wrote jointly to the Serjeant-at-Arms and the Usher of the Black Rod to confirm the suspension of the senators, to authorise them and officers under their direction to enforce the suspension and to confirm that the senators were not permitted to approach the House of Representatives through the glass link ways and were not permitted to enter the chamber galleries for the period of the suspension. I table a copy of the letter the Serjeant and the Black Rod by the President and me. There are two other matters relating to President Bush's visit which I wish to address. Members will be aware that television film coverage of Senators Brown and Nettle in the chamber began appearing nationally and internationally shortly after events in chamber. This unauthorised footage was taken from the northern gallery by an as yet unidentified US media operator and against my specific and repeated direction that such filming was not permitted. Investigation of this matter is not yet complete but preliminary assessments indicate that, notwithstanding my repeated refusal of requests from the Americans to permit coverage in addition to the nine parliamentary cameras, a camera was brought into the northern gallery and used. I understand that security attendants who saw the camera made the incorrect assumption that it had been authorised. The other matter relates to events at the rear of the chamber as President Bush was departing. I did not see these events directly as the House had not yet adjourned. I have seen some film coverage of them and would simply make the observation that in the face of the refusal of Senators Brown and Nettle to obey the chair and their clear intention to approach President Bush with some vigour during his movement from the chamber, certain members, senators and chamber staff attempted to secure a clear route for the President. I turn now to events surrounding the visit of President Hu Jintao on 24 October 2003. There has been some public commentary on the placement of guests of the Greens party members in the enclosed second floor gallery. The fact of the matter is that, having sole responsibility for the management of the House galleries, I made a deliberate decision to on Thursday, 23 October 2003, following the unacceptable behaviour of the Greens senators in the chamber and one of their guests in the gallery that day, to ensure that guests of the Greens were unable to interrupt proceedings during the visit of President Hu. I directed that the Greens guests be seated with other overflow guests from the open galleries the in the enclosed galleries. I am advised that guests of members and senators from all sides of politics, including guests of ministers, were also seated in the enclosed galleries as part of the overflow from the open galleries. There were approximately 30 people seated in the enclosed galleries. As a result of administrative confusion and divided responsibilities between the visits task force and House staff, it was regrettable that simultaneous translation facilities were not provided in the enclosed galleries. For this, I apologise. In the days preceding President Hu's visit, the Chinese ambassador expressed to me on several occasions his concern that people may seek to attend President Hu's address using invitations not issued in their names. He strongly urged me to require photographic identification. I declined to do so on the basis that the requirement for photographic identification was not made known in advance to prospective guests and that to require it without notice may prove difficult for guests, particularly children. I assured the ambassador that I would direct that all possible steps be taken to ensure the integrity of the galleries. To further ease the ambassador's concern, I suggested that I would permit several of his embassy staff to assist House staff in identifying people who may not have been the persons for whom invitations were issued. Photographic identification of people so identified would then be requested. I am advised that this process did not result in the identification of any persons holding incorrect invitations. It has also been publicly asserted that the Chinese foreign minister asked me to remove guests of members or senators from the open galleries. As I have already advised the House, I had decided the day before that guests of the Greens would be seated in the enclosed galleries to prevent any repetition of the unacceptable behaviour during President Bush's visit to the parliament. The Chinese foreign minister did arrive at the entrance to the House of Representatives wing in advance of President Hu on Friday, 24 October 2003. He spoke with me and the President of the Senate. I assured him that all appropriate steps had been taken to enable President Hu to be received with the dignity and courtesy appropriate to a visiting head of state. President Hu arrived shortly thereafter and, as members will recall, his address to the House took place without incident. As any objective reporter would have noted, the short time lapse between the arrival of the Chinese foreign minister and the subsequent arrival of the President of China would have made it impossible for people to have been moved into or out of the galleries before President Hu arrived. Finally, I wish to commend all the parliamentary staff, security personnel and staff of the visits task force for their outstanding tribution in securing the success of the visits by President Bush and President Hu to the parliament. I particularly thank the chamber staff and members of the Parliamentary Security Service. Under unprecedented circumstances and in the face of some difficulties, they executed their duties magnificently. NA Addresses by the President of the United States of America and President of the People's Republic of China",50
1,Mr ORGAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, following on from your comments. You referred to giving due dignity and courtesy to President Hu Jintao. Why did you not inform me and my Senate colleagues of your decision to exclude our guests from the gallery on Thursday and give them, as Australian citizens, due dignity and courtesy in regard to the opportunity to actually come and sit in the gallery? We are talking about two Buddhist members of the Tibetan community in Australia. We are talking about Mr Chin Jin, a member of the Federation for a Democratic China. I have subsequently spoken to those people and there was no way in which there was going to be any disturbances within this House by those people. I think that courtesy should have been shown to our guests, who are Australian citizens. There was a distinct lack of courtesy shown on behalf of the government towards these ordinary Australians. I ask for an explanation as to why I and my Senate colleagues were not informed of your decision.",52
2,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have already indicated to the member for Cunningham that, as I said in my statement, I do regret the fact conthat there were guests in the glass galleriesnot only his guests but also guests of members of both sides of the House and guests of ministers. I have indicated to the member for Cunningham that in the case of his guestsand if any other members approach me I will provide exactly the same service-I am very happy to write to his guests indicating my regret that they were unable to receive the translation. I will make no other comment because all that needs to be said was enclosed in my statement. Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China",52
3,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"If I may, I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, with regard to your ongoing investigation into how the rogue camera gained access to the chamber on that date. Are you prepared to give the House an update on your investigations? Further, are you prepared to make inquiries as to whether the attendant in question based his false assumption on the fact that the holder of the camera was in the company of an employee of the Prime Minister's office or indeed the Prime Minister's department?",53
4,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I indicate to the member for Hunter that I will take whatever steps are necessary to discover how the camera got into the gallery. I have already met with the officer from the Prime Minister's office responsible for the camera crews which were in the gallery and I have spoken to him. I understand the pressure that was on the security staff at the time and how they may well not have appreciated that the camera was in fact being used illegally, but I do not intend to be frustrated in any way in my investigations of this matter. Furthermore, I have a meeting this afternoon with press gallery officials in order to further pursue The House will be informed as appropriate. Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China",53
5,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, with regard to your explanation that was given previously, while many of us would share your concerns about the discourtesy that might have been shown to the Chinese President on the basis of the behaviour the day before, is there any precedent to your decision to allow representatives of an embassy to provide security in this House?",53
6,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I inform the member for Melbourne Ports that there was no precedent to the actions that occurred in the House on the previous day. Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China  have a question to you. I appreciate the security provisions that were necessary surrounding President Bush's visit, but I had great difficulty getting into parliament. I did not get here thanks to a security officer. It is my understanding that I am not the only one who was delayed and detained in this way. Could I seek your assurance that steps will be taken to ensure that, no matter who is addressing the House, members of parliament will be freely able to attend the chamber?",53
7,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Let me reassure the member for Chifley that it was the absolute wish not only of the Presiding Officers but also of the parliament that everyone should have free and easy access. The Chief Opposition Whip, I understand, also had difficulty accessing the parliament. Wherever it was possible for my office to intervene in order to improve the access, it did so. I regret that the member for Chifley was inconvenienced. He would understand that these were extraordithe matter. nary circumstances. Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China",53
8,Mr ORGAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, what specific instructions did the chamber attendants receive prior to President Bush's visit to allow them to pull on the jacket of Senator Kerry Nettle and to not allow her to gain access to the President of the United States? Were the attendants given instructions similar to the use of preventable force on members of the House and senatorssimilar to those instructions given to keep Senators Brown and Nettle from the chamber on Friday? In other words, were the attendants given specific instructions prior to President Bush's visit to manhandle a member of this place?",53
9,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Member for Cunningham, the only reason I am delaying my reply is that I cannot reply until you have resumed your seat. Let me reassure the member for Cunningham that of course no such instruction was given to attendants. I have spoken to the attendant who, in the instance the member for Cunningham refers to, appeared on the camera. Let me also indicate to the member for Cunningham that the same camera shot shows a Senate attendant, who has indicated to the President that she was in fact fearful of being pushed into the path of the President by the throng of members behind her. That was part of what caused the confusion at the time. I do not intend to take any further action. I have responded as comprehensively as I can in my statement. Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China",54
10,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,My question goes to the visit by the President of the United States and a rumour suggesting that representatives of the US government were permitted to bring firearms into Parliament House. Is there any truth to this rumour?,54
11,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"It is one of these extraordinary situations where, rather like the one involving the member for Cunningham, I find myself sitting here waiting for the member for Batman to resume his seat so I can respond to him. Let me indicate to the member for Batman that the arrangements for firearms in this House were entirely consistent with the arrangements that were recommended by the security advisory group and were consistent with what has been done on other occasions.",54
12,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Further to your answer to my question, I would like to know the details of what those arrangements were. My understanding was that, on previous visits by the US President to the Australian parliament, requests for the bringing of firearms into Parliament House were refused by this parliament.",54
13,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,Let me indicate to the member for Batman that whatever was done in this instance was done entirely on advice. Mr Leo MCLeay-It was not the same as the first time and you know it!,54
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I warn the member for Watson! Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China,54
15,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank you for your generous and comprehensive answer to my earlier question. Can I ask that, when you report back to the House on the issue, you include in that report the name and the role of the individual concerned-that is, the individual from the Prime Minister's office or the Department of PM&C, the person accompanying the person carrying the camera.",54
16,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I have an obligation at least to clarify the record. There has been absolutely no evidence brought to my attention at any time or in any interview I have had with anybody that anyone from the Prime Minister's office accompanied any camera into the House. I will follow the matter up. This is the final time. I will recognise the member for Cunningham. I will put a comprehensive statement to the House for its perusal. Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China,54
17,Mr ORGAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. According to the President of the Senate in committee this morning, you are undertaking an inquiry into the assault on Senator Nettle. Could you please inform the House of the details of that inquiry or any related inquiry you are holding into the events of 23 and 24 October in this place? Also, will members of the House have any avenue by which to address questions to you concerning the events, other than the present circumstances or in writing?",55
18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I have made a statement to the House. I do not intend to make any further statements to the House unless new material is made available to me. May I correct the record. I find myself in the position of some ministers at the dispatch box. Apparently in response to one answer I said that I had spoken to someone from the Prime Minister's office. I should have said I had spoken to someone from the Prime Minister's department. Questions on Notice,55
19,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, on 18 August, question No. 2277 to the Treasurer, question No. 2278 to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and question No. 2281 to the Attorney General first appeared on the Notice Paper in my name. On 19 August 2003, question No. 2297 to the Treasurer, question No. 2298 to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration and question No. 2299 to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services also appeared on the Notice Paper in my name on the first occasion. It is now more than 60 days since those questions first appeared on the Notice Paper, and I would be grateful if you would write to those ministers understanding order 150 and seek reasons for the delay in replying to those questions.",55
20,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I will follow up the matter raised by the member for Lowe as standing order 150 provides. NA,55
21,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Medicare: Bulk-Billing To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: - That the rate of bulk billing by GPs has fallen by over 15% in Shortland Electorate since 2000 and is now in serious decline; - That this year, 7.7 million fewer GP visits were bulk billed than in 1996; - That the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk bill has gone up by 51% since 1996. - That public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk billing doctors. We therefore pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by general practitioners so that all Australians have access to the health care they need. by Ms Hall (from 236 citizens) Medicare: Bulk-Billing To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House thatUnder the Howard Government the rate of bulk billing has dropped and the cost of visiting a doctor has risen. The Howard Government's proposed changes to Medicare will do nothing to improve this situation. Under the changes more families will not be able to access bulk billing and doctors will increase their fees. We request that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by General Practitioners and reject John Howard's plan to end universal bulk billing. by Mr Jenkins (from 119 citizens) Medicare: Bulk-Billing To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The need to keep bulk-billing for families on the North West Coast and King Island in Tasmania. We therefore request that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by general practitioners and reject John Howard's plan to end universal bulk billing. by Mr Sidebottom (from 2,877 citizens) Health and Ageing: Aged Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: We the undersigned, concerned citizens of Australia, draw to the attention of the House the dire need to address current issues in Residential Aged Care resulting from insufficient funding and the lack of accountability for how that funding is distributed. Nurses fear that as a result of the above, they will not be able to continue to provide quality care to our frail aged in Aged Care facilities. Our senior citizens deserve to be cared for by appropriately qualified nurses - Appreciate Your petitioners therefore request the urgent attention of the House to review current funding arrangements to allow appropriate nursing hours that will ensure quality care to these residents, and will ensure parity of wages for nurses working in either the public or aged care sector. by Mr Andren (from 902 citizens) Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland, specifically parents, staff and students of schools on the Gold Coast, draws to the attention of the House their concern with the proposed cancellation of the ABC television program, “Behind the News” due to budget cuts. We acknowledge the media release of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts of August 5 2003, which states that the ABC has the freedom to make the cuts where its Board sees fit. We believe strongly that this program has been an integral part of the development of young Australians with a strong knowledge of world issues for over 34 years. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enters discussions with the Minister and encourages him to negotiate with the ABC to rethink its planned cancellation of this icon of Australian education. by Mr Ciobo (from 510 citizens) Environment: Plastic Bag Levy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the undersigned citizens of Australia, call on the Parliament of Australia to: - Recognise the severe environment damage caused by the 6.4 billion plastic bags used in Australia annually; the success of the new plastic bag levy in reducing the usage of plastic bags, introduced in Ireland in 2002 We, the undersigned petitioners, therefore request the House to introduce a similar plastic bags levy in Australia, in order to reduce plastic bag usage and create a recurrent fund for environmental projects. by Mr Danby (from 181 citizens) Medicare: Bulk-Billing To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: We the undersigned object to the Federal Government's proposed changes to Medicare that will: - Deny bulk-billing for around 4.3 million people in NSW; - Increase the cost of basic health care for middle Australia; - Place further pressure on our public hospital system; Medical treatment and the safeguarding of our children's health should be a right not an expense. We therefore pray that the House reverses their decision and considers the Carr Government plan to save bulk billing and protect Medicare. by Mr Laurie Ferguson (from 18 citizens) Goods and Services Tax: Funerals To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that a majority of Australians voted against the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST). We believe a GST on funerals and all associated services is an unfair tax on death. Your petitioners strongly request the removal of a GST on funerals and associated services by Ms Hall (from 13 citizens) Roads: F3 to Sydney Orbital Link To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We refer to the proposed construction of the F3 to Sydney Orbital Link Road, in particular the option described as the Red option. We, the petition- ers, wish to bring to the attention of the House; 1 That the proposed Red Option will adversely affect the amenity of the Community through, in particular, tunnelling exhaust stack emissions. 2 That the Red Option serves only to reduce traffic levels on Pennant Hills Road, does not follow traffic desire lines and has a poor cost/benefit ratio. We request that the House; Remove the Red Option from the current route options. by Dr Nelson (from 20 citizens) Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry: Tariffs To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives as assembled in parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens shows that if TCF tariffs are further reduced after 2005, the Australian TCF industry will suffer further job losses and closures which adversely affect the Australian economy and society. Your petitioners request that the Parliament should agree to freeze the tariffs at their current levels until it is proven that any reduction is in the interests of Australian workers. Tariff should remain frozen until our major trading partners reduce their tariff and non-tariff barriers to Australia's levels. by Mr Sidebottom (from 2,415 citizens) Centrelink: Offices To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: We the undersigned object to the Federal Government's proposal to merge the Fitzroy and Richmond Centrelink offices that will: - Cause hardship to significant numbers of Centrelink clients. - Disadvantage many people with disabilities who have transport difficulties. Discourage people from pursuing legitimate welfare entitlements. We therefore pray that the House reverses their decision and considers the Federal Opposition's call to protect the Fitzroy and Richmond Centrelink offices. by Mr Tanner (from 162 citizens) Health and Ageing: Funding The House of Representatives, Federal Parliament of Australia, Parliament House, Canberra. ACT. 2600. Dear Parliamentary Representatives, We, the undersigned petitioners, being citizens of Australia, wish to express our concern at the current inadequate level of aged care funding which is being made available to provide residential aged care. The recent funding increase of just 1.01% for Victorian aged care facilities will not cover increasing costs, with wages having just increased by at least 4% for most of those facilities. This inadequate funding increase seriously threatens the viability of aged care providers and is putting the provision of aged care within our communities at risk. We ask that you increase aged care funding as a matter of urgency. by Mr Zahra (from 115 citizens) Petitions received. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Transport and Urban Development  move: That this House: (1) understands that Australians want decisions made on the basis of good policy and what is best for communities, not what suits the electoral pendulum; (2) affirms the need for an integrated approach to transport and urban development policy to tackle issues associated with the growth of our major cities; (3) recognises that cities need integrated port and urban development policies involving all tiers of government and the community in the decision making process; (4) accepts that Labor has led the way on these important issues with the announcement of an integrated transport plan for Sydney; and (5) recognises that: (a) Labor will not build an airport at Badgery's Creek, nor will Labor sell the Sydney Basin airports in a cash grab that ignores community and aviation industry views; (b) Labor understands that the growth ambitions of Sydney Airport are not acceptable and that a second Sydney airport is required; and (c) Badgery's Creek remains the Coalition's preferred site choice for a second Sydney airport. This is a very important motion because it goes to honesty and integrity in decision making and the development of good public policy. It calls for an integrated approach to urban transport and urban development issues. It recognises that one cannot look at just one particular mode of transport; one needs to think holistically in terms of rail, road and air transport in the development of transport. I particularly want to read point (5) of the motion, which asks that the House recognise: (a) Labor will not build an airport at Badgery's Creek, nor will Labor sell the Sydney Basin airports in a cash grab that ignores community and aviation industry views; (b) Labor understands that the growth ambitions of Sydney Airport are not acceptable and that a second Sydney airport is required; and (c) Badgery's Creek remains the Coalition's preferred site choice for a second Sydney airport. Accompanied, I might say, by the honourable member for Greenway and the honourtransable member for Fowler and others, in July Simon Crean at the Mount Druitt workers club-and I know that might be offensive to some coalition members but it is a great club with good membership-on that Sunday announced that Badgerys Creek was dead as far as Labor were concerned. We will not build Badgerys Creek, and that is a clear difference between the coalition and Labor. It is true to say that in the Mount Druitt St Mary's Star, the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, said: I think people have total confidence in me. Over the last eight years I have never changed my mind on Badgerys Creek. My record is solid. Well, that is a fair statement, I guess. But the problem is that Jackie has not changed the mind of anyone else in the coalition. Be under no illusion. Joe Hockey, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, in a very courageous speech to the House on 20 August said: The second point in relation to Sydney airport is that this government is committed to a second airport in Sydney. This is the coalition! He went on: Existing government policy is to commit to a second airport ... at Badgerys Creekthe coalition are committed to Badgerys Creekwith a review in 2005. That is the policy that we have had for the last two elections. That is the commitment that we have made, and that is our existing policy. It is a commitment to a second airport in the Sydney basin at Badgerys Creek, with a review of the need ... in 2005. That is the policy that we have had since the 1996 election, and it is entirely consistent with the fact that we legislated the cap of 80 movements per hour at Sydney airport, that we legislated the curfew at Sydney airport and that, through legislation, we ensured that regional aircraft will be able to access Sydney airport. That is a clear, unambiguous statement by, I might say, an acting cabinet minister at the time. And all I say is this: Labor in Western Sydney have made our position utterly clear on Badgerys Creek-we will not build it! And the member for Macquarie, the member for Macarthur, the member for Mitchell, the member for Lindsay and the member for Parramatta-these are the Western Sydney Liberal members-ought to be honest with the people of Western Sydney, just as Mr Hockey, the minister, has been honest with the people in this parliament, and say that the coalition is committed to building the airport. None of those members nor Jackie Kelly can change the coalition's mind. Their policy, by hook or by crook, is to build Badgerys Creek. If you want an airport in Western Sydney then you vote for one of the Liberal federal members in Western Sydney, but if you do not want an airport in Western Sydney-if you think Western Sydney should not have an airport-you have one clear choice come the next election: vote for a Labor person, because we will kill it stone dead.",55
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mrs Irwin-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,59
23,Mr BARTLETT,PETITIONS,"As a consistent and unequivocal opponent of the prospect of an airport at Badgerys Creek, I am grateful to the honourable member for the opportunity to say a few words on this to again restate my opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek. I find myself agreeing with at least one part of the honourable member's motion-the first partwhich says: ... understands that Australians want decisions made on the basis of good policy and what is best for communities, not what suits the electoral pendulum ... So I thought I would go back and check out the consistency of the member for Chifley in terms of what his comments about Badgerys Creek have been at different stages in the electoral pendulum. There has been a veritable goldmine of comments by the member for Chifley, and we could spend all day reading these. I thought I would remind the House of a few of those comments. On 31 May 1995 the member for Chifley said: As far as western Sydney is concerned, I am delighted with the initiatives of the government in proposing that we should have an international airport at Badgerys Creek. Again on 31 May 1995, the member for Chifley said: I do not apologise for advocating an airportat Badgerys Creek. He went on: ... the people of western Sydney ... are excited about the fact that jobs will be created. The airport will have a catalytic effect in the western suburbs of Sydney. You are right there, Member for Chifley: it would have had a catalytic effect! On 18 October 1995 the member for Chifley said: ... I believe, to take up seriously the issue of the construction of a major airport at Badgerys Creek-something that I have been seeking for a long time. And on we go. In June 1994 the member for Chifley spoke of the decision about Badgerys Creek. He said: ... the magnificence of the decision by the government and by the ministerthe then member for Kingsford-Smith. On the same day the member for Chifley said: ... this airport may very well be privately owned and run. I do not give a damn who owns it or who runs it, as long as it is in vicious competition with Kingsford Smith airport ... These are all the gems from the member for Chifley regardless of the electoral pendulum-just based, I would imagine, on good policy. And then we have many of his colleagues reinforcing him in that. I will quote one from a couple of years ago. The member for Werriwa, again giving great credit to the member for Chifley, said on 28 March 2001: I can remember WESROC convening meetings where my friend and colleague the member for Chifley would come along and advocate the construction of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek. Some people regard him as the father of the proposal-the person who put it on the agenda in a substantial way in Western Sydney ... Well, we must wonder then what his commitment is to not responding to the electoral pendulum. There has been no consistencyit is absolute hypocrisy. Member for Chifley, while I respect a lot of your work in the electorate, I am afraid you do not have a leg to stand on on this particular issue. We have seen many others from the other side-the member for Grayndler, the member for Kingsford-Smith, the member for Watson, the member for Barton, the member for Lowe, the member for Werriwa and the member for Blaxland-all advocating strongly an international airport at Badgerys Creek. Are we to expect that somehow, suddenly, the Labor leopard has changed its spots? It would like to pretend that it has, but the evidence is clearly to the contrary. The message is clearly that Labor says one thing in opposition and does something to the contrary in government. Do not listen to what it says in opposition; look at what it did in government. The other question is this: if Labor are canning the idea of Badgerys Creek, where are they going to put it? The bell has been rung on this one with ALP policy statement 071 in July this year and the Leader of the Opposition raising the possibility of Richmond as a site for another airport. I can make this very clear. I have news for the Leader of the Opposition: my constituents-constituents of Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains-will not allow the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party to transfer their plans for Badgerys Creek from Badgerys Creek to Richmond for some cheap political gain dictated by the electoral pendulum.

24,Mrs IRWIN,PETITIONS,"The member for Macquarie comes into the House and tells us what Labor and the member for Chifley have done in the past in relation to Badgerys Creek airport. But what he will not do is give a commitment that a Liberal government will never ever build Badgerys Creek. Instead, the Liberals want to give us Badgerys Creek on the never-never plan: they might build it one day but they do not know when. When you look at transport planning or the need for an integrated approach to transport and urban development, the last place to go would be to this government. When it comes to planning, this government has a golden rule. And what is that golden rule? Never make a decision today that you can put off until tomorrow. The one thing about this government that you can depend on is that it will avoid making decisions at any cost. Transport and urban development must be planned if we are to avoid the problems associated with the growth of our major cities. It requires looking ahead for decades at the impact on growth and planning now to meet those needs. But while this government thinks that it can put off until it should be doing today, businesses, government agencies and ordinary people need to plan their future with some degree of certainty. And there is no better example of government's failure to commit to a plan than the tale of Badgerys Creek airport. Who could forget-I am sure that the member for Chifley will remember thiswhen this government came to office in 1996 the Prime Minister declared that, instead of Badgerys Creek, the government would consider putting Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy. That is the kind of decision making that this government is famous for. But in planning for transport, especially for airport needs, it is essential that we have some degree of certainty. Airports have a major effect on the health, safety and lifestyle of residents in large Planners need to know well in advance where airports will be sited in order to avoid the kinds of impacts that airports like Kingsford Smith have on nearby residents. And you cannot make major changes to existing airports like Bankstown without affecting people who have lived with low-level impact but who now face the prospect of jet aircraft operations over their homes. But that is what the member for Macquarie has been pushing for. Let us go back to August 1999, when the member for Macquarie told the parliament: ... the consultancy report points out ... that better development of Bankstown airport, just a few kilometres away from Kingsford Smith, can help relieve some ... capacity problems. And in November 1999 the member for Macquarie told the House: We need to work on more effectively using the resources that we have got-using Kingsford Smith more effectively. … … … Moving some of the regional and lighter planes tomorrow what out to Bankstown ... But that is not what the member for Macquarie wants in his own backyard. It is quite obvious that he does not want it in his own this backyard. When it comes to Richmond air base, he told the House in August this year that Labor wanted to turn Richmond into a noisy commercial airport and put airport noise into seats they do not care about. The member for Macquarie is happy to dump commercial operations onto Bankstown but he will not have them in his own backyard. And he will not agree with Labor's policy to move the second airport out of the Sydney basin altogether. Only the member for Lindsay wants to do that, and she came out with the harebrained idea-does the member for Chifley remember her harebrained idea?-of building the second airport on pylons in the surrounding areas. Pacific Ocean. The member for Macarthur sees no need for a second airport for 30 years, and then it will not be close to Sydney. But the time to plan for our transport and urban development needs is now. If we are to avoid what happened with Badgerys Creek we need to plan for our airport needs now. We cannot keep putting off the hard decisions the way this government does. (Time expired) Mrs Irwin interjecting",60
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Order! The honourable member for Fowler will resume her seat.,62
26,Mr CADMAN,PETITIONS,"Mitchell) (4.05 p.m.)After first being promoted by the member for Chifley, Badgerys Creek is now off the agenda. Everything else is on the agenda, subject to an environmental impact statement, including the air base at Richmond. Labor's integrated transport policy, which you must be familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, contains the heading ‘A potential new role for Richmond airport'. The document states: Labor believes Richmond Airport could play a larger role in addressing Sydney's general aviation needs and possibly other aviation operations. There it is-it's the Labor Party's policy. They want Richmond. They have canned Badgerys Creek and they are going for Richmond. In a media release on 28 July the member for Chifley said: Labor has lost 5 seats in Western Sydney and this decisionThat is, to can Badgerysis essential in the fight to win them back. That is what it is all about-it is a political statement. But what is the policy? On the one hand it seems to be Richmond but on the other hand it seems to be saying, ‘Anywhere but Badgerys Creek, subject to an EIS.' Isn't that a compelling argument to go to an election with? Won't that convince people in Western Sydney that you are half serious? ‘We are going to have anywhere but Badgerys but we are going to have an EIS first.' What does that mean? You're going to have an EIS on Badgerys and put it straight back at Badgerys immediately after the election.  Mrs Irwin-Sell Badgerys Creek.",62
27,Mr CADMAN,PETITIONS,"Of course you could; that's the next change of mind. It is a seasonal thing, you see. About 1992, propose Badgerys; about 2002, reject Badgerys; and about 2012 put Badgerys back on the agenda again. Of course that is the proposal. I am very interested in what Anthony Albanese said. He said: What I say is, if we're going to have a consensus about removing Badgerys Creek site from our platform, what we need to do is to not have a ‘Where's Wally' approach to the airport. We need to identify a site as our preferred site; say we'll support it subject to an EIS. So we are going to have a ‘Where's Wally' sort of exercise-that is what Anthony is saying-that is all over the place. You have ruled out Badgerys but you have ruled in Goulburn, Williamtown, Canberra, Wilton, Galston, Richmond, Holsworthy and Somersby-you have got the lot-and you are going to have an airport somewhere on those sites, subject to an EIS. That is wonderful politics. That is just going to frighten the whole population of Sydney. Previously you worried only the people in Western Sydney; now you are going to worry the lot of them. I do not think that is a very sensible policy. I know that if you lived in Western Sydney, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you would be part of it, but I know that you are not; you are against it. So the ‘yous' I have used are not referring to you-if you understand what I mean. This is the confusion of the Labor Party on this issue. In 1996 Cheryl Kernot, in a press release, said: ... further steps in the environmental assessment process had to occur before the Government made a final decision and the Opposition was not going to pre-empt or circumvent that process. “There is a process in place,” she said, “and we have always said we will not jump in before that process is completed.” There you are-looking at the EIS: no decision for five years, six years, seven years, and suddenly you are going to can Badgerys on no grounds whatsoever, except it is politically expedient. You have said it is politically expedient-that is what you are going to do. The policy was also enunciated by Kim Beazley at the same time when Kim, in 1996, was saying that he was all for Badgerys Creek. What does Mark Latham say? This is a bit of coat-trailing if ever I have seen it. When Mark Latham, who is from Western Sydney, wanted to make remarks about the opposition's decision not to go ahead with Badgerys, the member for Werriwa, who has been a keen promoter of the Badgerys Creek site, said: If the Howard Government had kept its promise it would be open today. You'd be taking flights out of Badgerys Creek. But they broke their promise and in the Labor Party we can't allow the uncertainty to go on. What is that? That is a ‘me too' statement. The member for Werriwa is saying that he wished the Howard government had made a decision to go ahead with Badgerys, he regrets that it has not, and now he agrees that the Labor Party has no choice but to agree with the government. (Time expired)",62
28,Mr MOSSFIELD,PETITIONS,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak to the private members motion moved by my colleague the member for Chifley. It draws attention to the need for forward planning for integrated transport and urban policies in all our major cities-no more so than in Western Sydney, which is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. In recent years in Western Sydney we have seen new suburbs springing up with poor public transport links. In the electorate of Greenway we have seen new suburbs in the north-west sector, with most commuters having to drive or take a bus to rail connections on the Richmond line-to Blacktown station and Seven Hills station-and linking up with the rail commuters from Penrith and the Blue Mountains. There is a huge disparity in the number of trains that travel from the CBD to the Richmond line compared with the Penrith line, despite the rapidly growing population on the north-western corridor. There has been no serious attempt to redirect the public transport clientele through the Hills district into the CBD, other than by road transport. It is quite clear that these areas have large enough populations to support a fixed rail form of transport. Even at this late stage of urban development a medium-gauge rail system, as operates in the Perth metropolitan area, could run adjacent to some of our major road networks, like the M2 and the under construction M7. As a long-time advocate of the construction of the Western Sydney Orbital-or, as it is now known, the M7-I am delighted to see extensive construction work being carried out on this project. This construction, however, is causing considerable inconvenience to local residents in the form of air and noise pollution and traffic congestion, again highlighting the need for the major road projects to be carried out prior to residential development. That of course takes foresight and planning-two skills the Liberal government seems to lack. The Western Sydney Orbital will, after construction is complete, of course prove to be extremely beneficial to the Western Sydney region. That is why business groups and local residents have been calling for its construction for over 20 years. I have made numerous speeches in this place explaining the benefits that the Western Sydney Orbital will have on the region. Industries want to be closer to good road networks to move freight efficiently. At present, trucks clog Western Sydney roads, creating pollution, noise and congestion. The roads were not built to sustain the kinds of truck movements that currently exist; therefore the roads require expenditure on maintenance. The orbital road will be good for business and it will be good for local residents. Along with most other Western Sydney residents, I have always been a strong opponent of the toll on the M7, particularly for local residents. However, with the federal government being reluctant to fully finance this part of the national highway system, the state government had little alternative but to implement the toll. I might add, it is the only toll on the national highway in Australia. This is a clear demonstration of the Howard government's failure in its responsibility to the Australian people. Turning to other matters regarding the need for proper and appropriate planning for our major cities, we need to examine transport policies and urban design policies together. They are very much two sides of a single coin. As a means of slowing down the urban sprawl that is engulfing us and placing enormous pressure on our transport and health systems, the New South Wales Premier has advocated a reduction in the number of migrants to the Sydney area. He is putting up the ‘house full' sign for the Sydney region. This approach runs contrary to the argument that Australia needs to increase its migrant intake to increase our population to ensure continual strong economic growth. The total Australian migrant intake has a direct impact on the Sydney urban sprawl. Before I run out of time, I want to comment on Badgerys Creek, as it has been raised again today. Whatever has been said, whatever has happened in the past, it is Simon Crean and the Labor Party that have put Badgerys Creek airport to bed totally. The member for Mitchell has been an advocate of the airport at Badgerys Creek. If it is claimed that the member for Chifley is the father of Badgerys Creek, then I will say that extra the member for Mitchell is the mother of Badgerys Creek, because on 7 October 1993 he said in a private member's motion that he: ... endorses the immediate construction of a private/public airport at Badgerys Creek with a full international capacity including a 2900 metre runway. He said in his speech: I believe that there are good arguments why there should be immediate regenerated interest in Badgerys Creek, and that Badgerys Creek should in fact be the site of a second international airport for Sydney. (Time expired)",63
29,Mr BALDWIN,PETITIONS,"Paterson) (4.15 p.m.)Today's motion on transport and urban development moved by the member for Chifley is nothing more than an exercise in hypocrisy. I will start with the very first paragraph of the motion, which says: ... understands that Australians want decisions made on the basis of good policy and what is best for communities, not what suits the electoral pendulum … The member for Chifley seems to have forgotten that he put out a press release on 28 July 2003 which said: Labor has lost 5 seats in Western Sydney and this decision is essential in the fight to win them back. I say to the member for Chifley: so much for the first statement about using the electoral pendulum. To look at hypocrisy further, I will take the House on a trip down memory lane-right back to 24 May 1989, when the member for Chifley said: I have always been an unrepentant exponent of building an airport at Badgerys Creek in the western suburbs of Sydney. So gushing was he that, not more than three weeks later, he said: I guess it would be inappropriate for me not to say something about Badgerys Creek. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know from previous speeches of mine in this House that I remain an unrepentant champion of Badgerys Creek. I believe it is inevitable that Badgerys Creek will be built. Not even a year went by before he then said: We are not ashamed to say that we believe that that is a viable solution to Sydney's airport In fact, we will be delighted to be with ter for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) later in the year when he turns the first sod at the general aviation airport there. We have to be frank. We have some expectation that the third runway environmental impact statement may fail and that we will have a domestic or international airport at Badgerys Creek. This is what consistency is all about. I will even show how proud he was when on 31 May 1995, not that long ago, he quoted an article from the Blacktown Sun, which in part said: ... and blamed the then Labor Cr Roger Price, now Federal MP for Chifley, for helping bring the airport to Badgerys Creek. The member for Chifley then said in this House: I want to plead guilty. I have to say that the Labor Party organisation in my area did have a tradition of being against an airport. I suppose, as a new federal member of parliament, one of my most nervous moments was to report to my FEC and seek its support for a campaign to get an international airport at Badgerys Creek. I must say, though, that there have been some on the Labor Party side who have been consistent against the airport. One has been the member for Prospect, and I have looked at her speeches. And then I looked at the member for Grayndler's speeches. When he spoke of this new policy which was announced by their leader, Simon Crean, he said it was an: ... example of a bad policy process leading to a bad policy. The fact is that people such as myself and other members around Sydney Airport were not consulted about this policy. He was supported by the member for Sydney, who said: I think it was the wrong decision to make. I've been open about the fact that I think it's the wrong decision to make but, you know, all I can deal with is what I've got in front of me. needs. The member for Watson, who is never short the Minis- of a word, said on 28 March 2001: When you do look at the totality of the plan, the only answer on what to do with Sydney airport is to build another big airport that will take jets, small aircraft and freighters, and that is Badgerys Creek. A person who was usually consistent-up until he was made the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-was the member for Werriwa. On 28 March 2001, the member for Werriwa said in this House: The best arrangement is obviously to fly into Badgerys Creek and have connecting domestic and international flights for people from rural New South Wales. So too, if they fly into Sydney, they should have those connecting flights. He at least admitted later: ... Bankstown will not be adequate. The proper thing to do is to use the large market that is available surrounding the Badgerys Creek site. Further, never one to be boastful, the member for Werriwa said: I go back to 1987 when I started to advocate, while on the Liverpool council, the construction of Badgerys Creek, which was within the municipal boundaries. In 1991 I became the mayor and chairman of WESROC and I can remember that every single state and federal MP in the region was in favour of Badgerys Creek. At the time of the recession and substantial unemployment, everyone wanted to build the second airport for its job generating capacity. That is an admirable thing. He further said: The potential has always been there. From 1991 through to about 1993 or 1994, all MPs, state and federal, were supporting the Badgerys Creek site. I can remember WESROC convening meetings where my friend and colleague the member for Chifley would come along and advocate the construction of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek. Some people regard him as the father of the proposal-the person who put it on the agenda in a substantial way in Western Sydney because of its positive economic and employment impacts. Further, he said: So Labor policy is to proceed at Badgerys Creek-that is crystal clearBut now, because he has been made shadow Treasurer and he has been brought into line by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, he is changing his mind. What we have is wedge politics, but the wedge is within the Labor Party. We have those around Sydney airport wanting Badgerys Creek, and we have those around Badgerys Creek wanting something else.

30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. West Papuan Refugees,66
31,Ms KING,PETITIONS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes the Report of the January 2003 Joint Mission of the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists and the Australian Council for Refugees to Papua New Guinea, Seeking Refuge: the Status of West Papuans in Papua New Guinea; and (2) calls on the Australian Government to endorse the Report's recommendations and, in consequence; (a) negotiate an agreement with Papua New Guinea for the recognition of travel documents based on certificates of identity for the purpose of enabling students to enter Australia to pursue educational courses; (b) provide humanitarian relief through AusAID or other appropriate agencies for those West Papuans in Transmitter Camp found to have refugee status; (c) express its willingness to assist the government of Papua New Guinea to implement a long term solution for the West Papuans in Western Province; (d) express its willingness to contribute to support and to provide aid funding to enable Papua New Guinea to put a plan in place to act as an incentive to those West Papuans to move from border camps; and (e) provide places for West Papuans found to be refugees in Australia's resettlement programs. This motion draws the attention of the House to the status of West Papuans in Papua New Guinea. The time allotted for this debate does not allow me to refer to the history of what has happened in West Papua, but it is of course inextricably linked to why West Papuans are in PNG, as is the issue of self determination for West Papua. My interest in the issue of West Papuans in PNG has arisen from representations to my office from the Sisters of Mercy in Ballarat on behalf of West Papuan students whom they have supported to come to Australia for secondary and tertiary education. The experiences of these students and many others in obtaining certificates of identity and in having these recognised when applying for visas in Australia when wanting to undertake long-term study highlight the uncertain status of many West Papuans in PNG. The Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists conducted a mission to PNG in January this year-it followed missions in 1984 and 1986-and I recognise the member for Denison's contribution to that mission. The number of West Papuans currently in PNG is difficult to estimate. Many are in PNG without formal recognition or status. Many have left established camps to resettle in Port Moresby or in areas in which they are able to eke out some subsistence. Many have given up on even applying for permissive residency. West Papuans who crossed into PNG before the 1980s have in many cases obtained citizenship status. But, for those who came after, their status within PNG remains of concern. The report from the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists mission makes it clear that there has been a breakdown in the system of permissive residence renewal and citizenship. The PNG government has accorded permissive residence to some West Papuans who crossed in the 1980s without assessing their individual refugee status. This has not been the case for those refugees who are currently in Transmitter Camp, or most of them. However, to access residence rights, they had to relocate to the camp at East Awin. Permissive residency gives West Papuans the right to move freely within PNG and to engage in business and employment. Many have established themselves in areas throughout PNG, but, in particular, in Port Moresby. To obtain permissive residency, West Papuans must stay in East Awin for more than a year. If you have left and you wish to apply, you must return to the camp. The certificate is only valid for three years and renewal is subject to the same condition-that is, living in the East Awin camp. It would appear from the mission report that the system for renewal has broken down. There is no mechanism to remind holders that their permits have expired and that they need to be renewed, and there is no system to process applications. Those who have held permissive residency for eight years may apply for citizenship, but the problems encountered by West Papuans in meeting the residential requirements and the breakdown in the system for issuing and renewing certificates make it difficult for them to obtain citizenship or even travel documents. The citizenship advisory committee, which advises the minister on applications for naturalisation, has also not met for many yearsas a result, according to the PNG government, of financial constraint. This has resulted in significant delay in citizenship applications. West Papuans wanting to travel outside of PNG who do not have citizenship can apply for certificates of identity. They can then travel freely outside PNG, so long as they meet the visa requirements of the visiting country. The few who have travelled have found it difficult to obtain these certificates as there is no clear process and there are significant delays. There are West Papuans who are studying in my own electorate. One of them is the son of a West Papuan border crosser and he had enormous difficulty in obtaining his certificate of identity, with lost paperwork and the system breaking down in many instances. I think it was only almost the week before he was due to arrive in Australia that we got word that his certificate of identity had actually been issued. The joint mission of the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists and the Australian Council for Refugees to Papua New Guinea have put forward a number of recommendations following their most recent mission. They are, I would say, a very balanced contribution to Australia's diplomatic effort in relation to West Papuans in PNG. They include-and they are part of this motion-that the government: negotiate an agreement with Papua New Guinea for the recognition of travel documents based on certificates of identity for the purpose of enabling students to enter Australia to pursue educational courses; provide humanitarian relief through AusAID or other appropriate agencies for those West Papuans in Transmitter Camp found to have refugee status; and express its willingness to assist the government of PNG to implement a long-term solution for West Papuans in Western Province.

32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Is the motion seconded?,68
33,Mr KERR,PETITIONS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,68
34,Mr CHARLES,PETITIONS,"I thank the honourable member for Ballarat for raising this issue in the House of Representatives today. It is a complex issue. The relationship between West Papua and Papua New Guinea constitutes some great difficulties and has done, I understand, across that border for a very long time. The last time. I visited Papua New Guinea was with the member for Franklin-he is the only one from that trip still here in the House of Representatives. We certainly learned a great deal about our relationships with our very close neighbours and we appreciated the opportunities we had. While we flew over the Fly River, we did not manage to get to the border region, nor did we see any of the refugee camps, so I cannot speak from personal experience about those conditions. I am advised that the Australian government has been monitoring in particular the Transmitter Camp border crosser situation since their arrival in Vanimo in December 2001. I do not know if the honourable member knows this or not: the Public Accounts and Audit Committee of this parliament did learn, during our inquiry into Coastwatch, that Australia has a memorandum of understanding with Papua New Guinea in respect of people movement. We also have a more recent one with China, which has had a huge impact on numbers of boat people. Both of those agreements in effect say that, if transnationals leave their jurisdiction-say, if West Papuans or others are in Papua New Guinea and then transit to Australia-then Australia will send them straight back to Papua New Guinea, which will accept them back again. I understand it is a difficult issue. Our high commission in Port Moresby, I am informed, works closely with the Papua New Guinean government and their counterparts in Port Moresby to try to help resolve some of these refugee issues. I understand your genuine concern about your student and how it could be that other potential students might be given a more easy path to Australia, either to secondary or tertiary school. We have accepted literally tens of thousands of Papua New Guineans into our institutions over the years. Having visited there, and having a number of friends from Papua New Guinea that I have kept in contact with since then, I am aware that those relationships have been fantastic. It has been good for Australia and for Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is going through a period of financial difficulty at the moment. I do not know how all of this is going to play out. When we were there, we also learnt about the very great population density problems, which in essence led to the problems with the rascals. My understanding of Papua New Guinean law is that a father owns the title to the land-this is not really shown on a piece of paper; it is, for example, from that rock to that hill to that tree to that place where the bird died-and, when the father dies, the land transfers to any or all of his sons. So if the plot of land was enough to produce a subsistence living for a family of six or seven, and the father dies, then there could be four young men who want to take up that plot of land. That is not sustainable, so they move to the outskirts of Lae or Moresby and that is where the trouble starts. As I said, I thank the honourable member for Ballarat for raising this issue. The government is trying to monitor the situation, with the UNHCR and the Papua New Guinean government. The government is encouraging Papua New Guinea to review its domestic legislation to allow it to do a better job of helping those who are genuine refugees and to come to some sort of ultimate resolution of its extremely complex border problem in a part of the world that is, quite frankly, almost impenetrable. (Time expired)",68
35,Mr KERR,PETITIONS,"I thank the member for Ballarat for putting this matter on the Notice Paper, and I thank parliamentarians on both sides of this House for the manner in which they are addressing this serious issue affecting our neighbouring nations. There have been very positive reactions thus far to the thrust of the ICJ's sion report from the PNG government. Foreign Minister Sir Rabbie Namaliu has confirmed, both publicly and privately, that there will be no forced repatriations, and Prime Minister Somare has indicated that the recommendations in relation to an appeal procedure for refugee determinations are going to be favourably viewed. Having said that, the points raised by the member for Ballarat about the breakdown of the citizenship determination and granting process are serious. Again, there are statements from the PNG government that this will be addressed in the coming months, and I look forward to that occurring. But it is hard to expect the PNG government to meet the full cost and weight of all the measures recommended by the ICJ, which are designed to provide some kind of basic sustenance and support for the more than 12,000 people who, over the last 30 years or so, have crossed the border from West Irian into Papua New Guinea. A number of those, with the encouragement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, went to the Transmitter Camp at Iowara. Yet, despite the best efforts of the PNG government, insufficient land has been provided for them, so there simply is not a durable solution. The natural reluctance of others to follow those who have relocated to Iowara into what really is an impossible situation for them has meant that there is now something in the order of 10,000 to 12,000 people living in impermanent camps near the border. Of course, some of those people still harbour hopes of returning to West Irian. Others would want to be incorporated into PNG if a long-term and durable solution were available. But a long term and durable solution will not become available unless PNG gets external support. PNG does not have the resources to acquire land from traditional owners on that scale. mis- Papua New Guinea is struggling to provide basic assistance and education programs for its own people in Western Province, which is the poorest province in Papua New Guinea, a poor country. In that poorest province are found the poorest of the poor-people who have lost their land in crossing over from West Irian to Papua New Guinea. They are having to use land which is the traditional land of the people in Western Province. Those people have supported them, in a neighbourly way, for a long period of time; but, as you can imagine, there is beginning to be some resentment of the fact that these people are now almost a permanent addition to that community and are putting additional pressure on the availability of land for agricultural purposes. Of course, as has been indicated in the debate, land in Papua New Guinea is heavily used and, whilst there may appear to be a huge amount of land for each person, because the land is used for subsistence agriculture and has a low level of fertility, the rotational system of cropping means that the additional population is going to create significant and difficult pressure. Australia needs to help fix this. We cannot fix everything. Some of the issues flow from the way in which the act of self-determination occurred. As a nation, Australia has accepted that West Irian is now part of Indonesia. But I do not think any fair-minded individual would see that as a process that did any great honour to this country or to the history. We can't undo history but we can give attention to situations where individuals can be helped. Not many of the border crossers want to come to this country as refugees but, for the handful that may be well suited and who want to, we should allow places for them under our program. We should make certain that those who wish to study can do so, and we should make sure that AusAIDand the Australian government, through AusAID and other private arrangementsmakes funding consistently available to assist PNG put in place a robust and durable solution -(Time expired)",69
36,Mr KING,PETITIONS,"Wentworth) (4.36 p.m.)Without doubt, Papua New Guinea is a state that is passing through a crisis as we speak. In the last 10 years there have been at least three economic crises. In the recent election year alone, the fall in GDP was about seven per cent, notwithstanding an increasing GDP over the last 10 years. So the last two to three years have shown that the country is facing severe economic and social problems-37.5 per cent of the population are below the poverty line. Notwithstanding that record of severe crisis both economically and socially faced by the country at the moment, there is a long and proud history of support by Australia for Papua New Guineans since the first discovery of that extraordinary country. I refer to the fact that in 1906 British New Guinea passed to Australian custody and care; in 1921, German New Guinea; and in 1949, following a UN mandate, the whole of the eastern part of New Guinea. On 16 September 1975, independence occurred, and since then the country has been seeking to establish itself as an independent and prosperous modern nation. The reason that that broad outline of facts is relevant is that the motion that is before the House needs to be understood in context. Whilst I am prepared to support the general tenor of the motion, it is qualified support. At the end of the day, the people of Papua New Guinea and its government are facing a crisis which needs to be addressed before the issues that are the subject of the motion can be properly and appropriately dealt with. I have mentioned aspects of the economy. There are environmental challenges, even in the area of the region that we are speaking about, near the East Awin camp. There are major environmental problems. There are significant tribal differences and, indeed, continued fighting between various parts of the country-a nation of 715 languages and even more tribal groups. Violence and tribal differences have become even more pronounced than they were in the past and democratic values that have been sought to be instilled are observed more for their breaches than otherwise. It is in that context that I refer briefly to the recommendations of the report of the January 2003 joint mission. I note that the honourable member who has just spoken was a member of that delegation, led by Justice O'Meally, a friend and former colleague. I want to say three things about the report. The second recommendation is one that I will briefly focus on. It recommends: That the PNG Government review its laws and procedures for granting Permissive Residency to West Papuans ... But, at the end of the day, that recommendation will be observed and put into effect by the Papua New Guinea government only if the broader issues of economic and social breakdown that I have raised are redressed, because they really form part of a broad administrative measure by a government that is functioning to full effect. However, there are some practical measures that could be carried out at little cost. The suggestion that PNG grant citizenship to children born in PNG who would otherwise be stateless seems to me to have some force, as does also the recommendation that the PNG government not forcibly deport or threaten the deportation of any West Papuan who may be at risk of serious human rights violation on return to West Papua. A third in that category is recommendation 19, which says: That West Papuans be entitled to apply for Permissive Residency if they are prepared to meet the conditions required for that status ... I have had long experience with Papua New Guinea over the years. I have appeared in the courts of that country and I have met many of its leaders. I understand the way in which the legal processes of Papua New Guinea occur, and, with that background, I care about the future of that country. Those are measures that could be put in place. I am aware that the legal system is capable of doing so, and they ought to be seriously considered. (Time expired)",70
37,Ms HOARE,PETITIONS,"I am also pleased to be able to support this private member's motion put forward by the member for Ballarat, which notes the report of the January 2003 Joint Mission of the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists and the Australian Council for Refugees to Papua New Guinea. The previous speaker spoke about the recommendations being put in context. To put this motion in context, this is about Australia being a good regional neighbour to a very close country and supporting people who have suffered hardship and humanitarian abuse over the years which have caused them to leave their homelands and to seek refuge in another country. The previous speaker also spoke about the recommendation for Papua New Guinea to provide citizenship for children who are born in Papua New Guinea from West Papua parents, because they would otherwise be stateless. As I understand it, any West Papuans who are now living in Papua New Guinea who have been out of West Papua for six years or more are stateless, so I cannot see why a distinction is being made between stateless children and stateless adults. I think that is something which could be extended to all. There has been discussion already about the Transmitter camp and the other camps. As I understand it, since the mid-1980s about 11,000 of these displaced West Papuans have been living in the western areas of Papua New Guinea. This is an issue which requires long-term solutions, and the recommendations in the member for Ballarat's motion provide practical suggestions which would be of minimal cost to Australia. They are small steps which would help address some of the issues which are facing West Papuans. To put it in historical context, situated on the western half of the island of New Guinea, West Papua was given over to Indonesia when Dutch colonial rule ended in 1963. The questionable act of free choice elections in 1969 confirmed Indonesian hegemony. West Papua is a mineral-rich area, whose reserves of gold, uranium, nickel, natural gas and other resources are coveted by a number of foreign mining companies operating under the protection of the Indonesian security forces. As a result of the foregoing political and economic developments, West Papua's 2.5 million people continue to bear ongoing challenges to their human rights and dignity as a people. For nearly 40 years there has been a failure on the part of the international community to address a culture of impunity that has tolerated militarism and oppression in West Papua, a situation that bears obvious parallels to earlier conditions in East Timor. More than 100,000 Papuans have been killed over the 38 years of this ‘integration' into Indonesia. Although Indonesian transmigrants continue to be moved into the region, the indigenous people of West Papua continue to seek ways to ensure the peaceful participation of the entire population in a democratic society. There has always been residual sympathy in Papua New Guinea for the people of West Papua and for their difficulties under an Indonesian administration. This is hardly surprising. Its very first self-governing elite were often themselves among the schoolchildren who had gone on the crossborder exchanges encouraged under the DutchAustralian administrative cooperation arrangements. In addition, those who live in the border regions know full well that the refugees who came across in numbers in the lead-up to the act of free choice elections, and periodically thereafter, were not always the nomadic peoples who moved across the often unmarked border for traditional reasons or the ‘economic refugees' looking for a better life in a more advanced Papua New Guinea, which both the Australia and Papua New Guinea governments were inclined to describe them to be. They were as well the educated elite fleeing political persecution. is these who sought and were granted permissive residence in Papua New Guinea, where many of them, as we know, remain today. (Time expired)",71
38,Mr CAUSLEY,PETITIONS,"In the limited time that I will have available to speak on this motion about West Papuan refugees, I would like to make a small contribution. Obviously, this is a very difficult issue and I certainly sympathise with those people who are involved, particularly those refugees who have come across the border and are now living in conditions that none of us in this parliament would see as being ideal. I think it is important to understand that Papua New Guinea, which is one of the poorest nations on earth, would find this particularly difficult to deal with. I agree with the member for Ballarat that many of these people, especially those up on the West Irian and Papua New Guinean border, are tribal people who have land that in many instances is held by a family-limited land at thatand of course when extra people come across the border and need to try to live off that land it makes it extremely difficult. Since 1975, when the Whitlam government granted independence to Papua New Guinea, Australia has been a significant contributor to try to help Papua New Guinea, and I think that undoubtedly will continue. The issue between West Irian and Papua New Guinea is a very difficult political issue. Members would probably realise that I led a delegation just over 12 months ago to Indonesia, which included the member for Werriwa, the member for Lingiari, the member for Lindsay and Senator Eggleston, and West Irian was raised very early in our discussions-the Indonesians raised our attitude to West Irian-so it is a sensitive political issue; there is no doubt about that. On the other hand, I have no doubt that the West Irianese would like to see some form of inIt dependence, although that would be difficult given the fact that there is limited development in that particular province at this particular stage. I am again leading a delegation, in the next few weeks, across to both Indonesia and Port Moresby-this time with Senator Ray and, I believe, the member for Mitchell and others-during which, I dare say, these issues will be raised yet again, probably from both angles, and I am very aware of the sensitivities involved. Nevertheless, there are some issues that need to be discussed. The Australian government is regularly in contact with the Papua New Guinea government; the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made that very clear on a number of occasions in this parliament. I did read the report-belatedly, I must say-after this motion appeared on the Notice Paper and I did have some concerns about some of the issues in it. The honourable member for Denison might be able to inform me later about them, but I thought that some of the recommendations were rather categorical, given that we are dealing with another country. We are dealing with a separate country with limited resources. While it is all very well for us to sit back in over. our ivory towers and say that we expect a country to do such things, I dare say that in this instance we could have been a little bit softer in some of the recommendations that were put forward, because I do believe that there are mitigating circumstances in this instance. If we look around the world at some of the more developed countries",72
39,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Order! The time allotted for private members' business has expired, I am sorry to say. The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Drought: Assistance",73
40,Mr KATTER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to draw to the attention of the House the extremely depressing conditions that prevail throughout rural Australia, particularly that part of rural Australia that I represent. At the time of speaking to the House, all of the Central West and other areas of Queensland-the Great Mid-West, as they are called-are suffering very severe drought conditions. In my lifetime as a parliamentarian, spanning some 30 years, I cannot ever remember us getting knocked back for drought moneys when we made a serious attempt at them. But given the administration of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-the honourable member for Wide Bay, Mr Truss-once again Mr Truss is going to score a first in the incompetence of the handling of his portfolio and the incompetence of the department which he presides Believe it or not, a drought declaration for North Queensland has to be undertaken by officers of the department living in Canberra. I pointed out to the officers in the department that some 20 stations are destocked either partially or totally and that I can give them the names of stations where they have moved from having 15,000 sheep down to 400 sheep. I can give them the names of stations that have been pushing down prickly trees for their cattle to eat for some six or seven months. They have now run out of prickly trees. I can point out to them stations where they have been handfeeding part or all of their herd for some five months now. Effectively what they said was that their computer model did not indicate that we had drought conditions. The DPI officers who live in North Queensland have traditionally assessed these situations. It is thought by some peoplewho I think live in the Stone Age-that they are going to get a better deal from the coalition than they are going to get from the Labor Party. It may be true that they will not get a better deal, but it is most certainly not true that they are getting a good deal now or can survive on the deal that they are getting at the present moment. Go no further than this decision. AgForce, the industry representative body in Queensland, is led by probably the finest farm leader we have in the country. He, along with John Bronger of the Pharmacy Guild, is one of the two finest leaders of owner-operated businesses in this country. The situation is that AgForce has come forward and said that there is a very severe drought on up there. The DPI, the local state officials, have said, ‘There is a very severe drought on in half of North Queensland.' Everyone seems to agree on this except the officers of the department here. They cannot even see fit to leave their computer screens, with their computer models, in Canberra to go up there. It must be pointed out that I do not expect officers in Canberra to be experts on landforms throughout Australia; nor do I expect that they would be experts on weather conditions. In the area that I represent-in the cracking clays, the vertisol soils, the black soil plains, if you like, of the northern Queensland-if you get anything less than an inch of rain it really does nothing else but fill the cracks. Nothing will happen as far as grass growing. If you get more than two inches of rain it all runs off; the soil seals over. It is a very drought-prone area in its natural state. To apply a computer model that will work in western New South Wales or north-western Victoria to North Queensland, where we have a drought at the end of each year, is quite ridiculous. We have an entirely different situation. As far as governments coming to grips with what needs to be done for these people, we really do not need to be providing a handout, even if there is a small subsidy involved. I was reading the brief on ethanol from the congressional briefing paper in the United States and it mentioned in passing that the corn growers were enjoying a subsidy for this year in excess of $1,000 million, at a guaranteed price of $2.60 a bushel. That is how other countries treat their farmers. If we could just get interest rates to the same level as the interest rate that the government pays-which is probably around four per cent or less at the present moment-we could pass on to the growers the benefit of that wholesale interest rate that government enjoys. That wonderful and great man John MCEwen provided for us development banks which simply loaned the money out to the farmers at the same interest rates that they were borrowing money. That was carried on in the same tradition by Doug Anthony, his successor. Quite frankly, if you put 0.2 per cent on it-and I was one of the two ministers overseeing the QIDC in Queenslandyou make very handsome profits. So we are not asking for a handout; in fact, we are inviting the government to make profits. Lending in agriculture is very safe. The policies imposed upon us by the curhalf of rent regime-and I must again mention Mr Truss and Mr Anderson, who are both ardent free traders-have deregulated industries. It is not a philosophy of the Country Party, which I have spent most of my life in, or the National Party, as it later became. Most certainly, in its modern context, it is the philosophy of the ALP. People got up all the time and talked about 25 per cent tariff cuts. That came from Mr Whitlam. The father of economic rationalism in this House was none other than Mr Keating. When that person deregulated the wool industry, he first undermined the scheme and then abolished it. When he did that, the price for wool dropped clean in half. The member for Richmond is in the House at the present moment. When his father introduced that scheme, the price for wool went up 300 per cent. What a wonderful, magnificent contribution to this country Mr Anthony made as a minister and as Deputy Prime Minister. In 1989 that scheme resulted in one-tenth of the nation's entire export earnings coming from one commodity-wool. The deregulation of that scheme took earnings from $5.9 thousand million a year-one-tenth of our export earningsdown to a situation now where half of the sheep herd has vanished. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, let me switch subjects completely. You, the member for Richmond and I represent part of the banana industry. I represent the larger share of the industry. If AQIS, or Biosecurity, as it now calls itself, should exist then it should exist to protect the industries of this country and to prevent disease from coming into this country. The Philippines has 23 diseases of bananas that Australia does not have, including the dreadful moko and black sigatoka diseases which you are quite familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure. In New Scientist magazine of February this year there was a front-page article on how the banana industry is vanishing and is doomed as a result of those two diseases-both of them endemic in every part of the Philippines. How any responsible minister or any responsible government could seriously consider for a fraction of a second bringing those bananas into this country and still say they have a quarantine service is beyond the wildest stretch of my imagination. Let us save the Australian public money and close the quarantine service down, because it should not be there if it allows bananas to come in. The grape decision staggered me, when we brought the grapes in from California where a 10th of them have died as a result of Pierce's disease. But if this happens, I will not use the arguments that 5,000 or 6,000 Australians will lose their jobs or that the economies of whole towns will completely vanish overnight. It would be naive for me to do that. For my colleagues on the right who may be a bit ignorant about these things, the industry will be replaced by cattle-an industry that employs nobody at all. We could put most of these shire areas, such as the Innisfail shire area and the Tully shire area, under cattle and we could run the whole industry with 100 people-and this is a place where there are probably 3½ to 4½ thousand jobs at the present moment in bananas. If they are replaced by cattle, that will be the fate that awaits those towns-similar to the ethanol for sugar industry and the tobacco industry. A reintroduction of the tariffs we were allowed to have, and the introduction of a cancer research levy if necessary, will, I am sure, guarantee that we will be able to have tobacco back in the Australian marketplace again. And, of course, as I speak, the dairy industry is going through its death throes throughout major parts of Australia. That is the situation in rural Australia. (Time expired) National Sustainability Initiative",73
41,Mr HUNT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to take the opportunity to propose to the House the concept of a national sustainability initiative. I propose this initiative in the context of a 30-year vision for Australia's environment, focusing on the notions of priority areas of need, identified indicators and specific targets and programs across the core areas of water, land and biodiversity, atmosphere and also energy in human settlements. In setting out this need and desire for a national sustainability initiative, I particularly want to first put it in the context of two events. In the last week we saw the passing of Garrett Hardin. Garrett Hardin was a US biologist, a Republican, who in 1968 wrote one of the great seminal works of the 20th century. In the journal Science, he wrote ‘The tragedy of the commons'. ‘The tragedy of the commons' set out a thesis, and that thesis was a very simple one. To quote his own words: The rational man finds that his share of the cost the wastes he discharges into the commonsthat is, the land which we all ownis less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them. Since this is true for everyone, we are locked into a system of “fouling our own nest,” so long as we behave only as independent, rational, free enterprisersnot locked into the system established for a group and a collective. There is a local example of that in my electorate of Flinders where, at Gunnamatta beach, the eastern treatment plant pipe flows out, carrying with it 420 megalitres a day of secondary treated sewage-150 billion litres every year. That water is discharged off the coast, but only by a matter of metres. It has three effects. It has an environmental effect, a health effect and it represents a ridiculous waste of 150 billion litres of captured water that we have in our possession every year. It is a classic example of the tragedy of the commons: we take that which is the action of an individual in disposing of his or her waste, we throw it into our collective resources and we damage them. But this is writ large across Australia, because this example is one of 142 ocean outfalls. Those 142 ocean outfalls put approximately 1.5 trillion litres of waste water onto our coasts, into our seas and into the areas where people swim, at the same time wasting a valuable resource that we have captured and which represents an extraordinary opportunity for use. Interestingly, that 1.3 trillion litres is approximately the amount that has been recommended for the regeneration of the Murray-Darling Basin, dependent upon different estimates. But that is water which we have, which we own, which we use and which we waste, and that is all an example of the tragedy of the commons as it plays out. Hardin's thesis is a simple thesis. It is that there are those resources which are common to all of us. If we draw upon them in moderaof tion, if we draw upon them collectively and if we draw upon them in a way that is sustainable, then we will all benefit. But if, as is the case, it becomes a rational action for one individual to draw more than his or her fair share-such as a fisherman who cheats on their licence or a polluter who dumps more than their fair share by putting in and fouling the common areas-we are led to a situation which is damaging for all. The impact is one of two things: either exhaustion of resources, whether it is our fisheries or our lands, or destruction of our resources, whether it is our water, our land through salinity or our atmosphere through pollution. What do we need to address this? We need two simple things: we need prevention and we need remediation. This is where I turn to the notion of the national sustainability initiative. I believe that we have a unique opportunity to establish a 30-year vision, with clear milestones and clear objectives across the four spheres of the Australian environment: water, land and biodiversity, atmosphere and energy in human settlements. If we establish a national sustainability initiative which sets out the 30-year targets that we can agree on in those areas-targets such as ending all of the ocean outfalls in Australia by 2025, a percentage increase in the total biomass of all fish within the Australian exclusive economic zone waters by the year 2030, an agreed percentage increase in the total biomass of all fish within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by 2030, and similar examples; and I commend the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp, for doing exactly that in relation to the Great Barrier Reef-then we can make real progress. On the atmospheric front, we would look at a percentage reduction by weight in the emissions registered under the National Pollutant Inventory, with a date and target. Similarly, we would look at a percentage reduction in salt affected lands by the year 2030 and attainment of a certain percentage of all human energy consumption from renewable resources by 2030. Those are the types of goals needed. It is easy to set goals. In this country we have a history of goals which have been set and then disregarded-including the goal that ‘no child shall live in poverty by the year 1990'. It is very easy to set a headline. It only becomes meaningful when it is attached to a concrete rational program. I wish here to propose a concrete mechanism for achieving those goals, which would work together to comprise a national sustainability initiative. The essence of the mechanism is two-fold. First, there has to be a recognition of the core priority areas and the setting of national targets across the generations-so it has to be a generational goal. Secondly, we have to decide how we fund it, how we achieve it and how we bring it into being. Here I wish to deal with a particular mechanism. The government has already used the Natural Heritage Trust as a percentage return to the public from the transfer of assets from the sale of Telstra part 1 and part 2. There advantages to the sale of Telstra. It allows the investment within our national telecommunications carrier of equity rather than debt as the basis for raising future investment. Also, on today's prices-and here is a fascinating figure-there would be a recurrent benefit to our budget of $340 million a year. What do we mean by that? It is very simple: if you were to sell Telstra, you would obtain approximately $1.75 billion in annual debt relief; $30 billion in debt relief would have an effect on the budget of about $1.75 billion. As opposed to that, the loss of the dividend receipts would be about $340 million less-and that is on today's prices. No matter what the argument, by holding it in its current form, every year we are wasting $340 million of taxpayers' potential revenue for hospitals, kidney machines, schools and the environment-for all of these things. In that context, I suggest that the vast bulk of that money-the vast bulk of the capital receipts-should be returned for paying off debt. However, I would also suggest that if, as occurred with the Natural Heritage Trust and Telstra part 1 and part 2, approximately 10 per cent of the sum were returned, on the sound economic basis of making investments now to heed, to ward off and to address exponential costs in investment in the future, that should be the basis for the national sustainability initiative. That money, drawn from capital, going back to capital, with a visible and clear return to the people in our urban fringes and in our rural areas, could directly address our water resources, our water sustainability and our coastal protection. This notion of a national sustainability initiative would then be economically sound and also about preparing ourselves for a long-term generational view. I return very simply to the ‘Tragedy of the commons' as represented by the threat to my are own electorate and to the area of Gunnamatta for beach. We see there a problem of individual actions collectively mounting to create damage. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity. I commend this proposal of a national sustainability initiative. I am disappointed in those who would oppose this mechanism, and I urge the House-(Time expired) Social Capital",75
42,Mr MOSSFIELD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In my grievance speech today I wish to discuss the need to invest in and to strengthen what we call social capital. I refer to groups, organisations and individuals who work within our local communities to provide social stability. It is simply not possible in this 10-minute speech to list all the groups that function in any community, but churches in particular stand out, as do service clubs, senior citizens organisations, Neighbourhood Watch, Red Cross, park committees and sporting clubs-to name just a few. In my electorate of Greenway, we have local government-run community centres at Riverstone, Marayong South, Seven Hills, Toongabbie, and Dean Park, out of which volunteers and paid staff provide a vast range of services to their local communitieseverything from Meals on Wheels for the elderly to youth services for the disadvantaged. We also have progress associations in Glenwood, Stanhope Gardens and Dean Park. They are fighting for the infrastructure needs of their rapidly developing residential areas. In Greenway the infrastructure needs-such as roads, transport systems and telecommunications-have simply not kept pace with the residential growth, and the communities are suffering as a result. The New South Wales government has worked diligently to bridge this gap, with major works on Windsor Road recently completed and major work proceeding on Sunnyholt Road and the much needed Western Sydney Orbital-what is now known as the M7. Telecommunications, however, are still a major problem in the area of Greenway, where many people work from home and our large youth population requires fast Internet services to enable them to complete their homework and studies. So the role of social capital ranges across all spheres-from providing meals to the sick and lonely to telecommunication issues. Financial support is provided at the federal, state and local government levels on an intermittent basis, but greater financial assistance from all levels of government would enable a better coverage of the needs of the area. To give an example, I have recently made representations to the federal government on behalf of two local groups for funding for sporting projects. I will mention each of these projects briefly to highlight the urgent unmet needs in this area. The first of these projects was a request for financial support for the upgrading of Mickelson Reserve in Quakers Hill. Quakers Hill is an area of considerable residential growth. Many young families are moving into the area. The reserve is currently being used by the Quakers Hill District Junior Rugby League Football Club, Terra Sancta High School and the Quakers Hill and Kings Langley Cricket Club. The football club alone has 19 teams, involving 250 young people in their club activities, so you can see the need for providing appropriate facilities. The second project is from an enthusiastic group of local residents from the suburb of Dean Park. This group is campaigning to establish a permanent youth centre in the area. Dean Park is a well-established local suburb with a large youth population. At the moment there are insufficient recreational activities for young people, which has resulted in an outbreak of antisocial behaviour. The local community works hard to provide for the social and recreational needs of the residents, with the Dean Park Community Centre and local schools in continuous use for youth activities. However, a centre is required to provide a permanent base for youth activities such as music, gymnastics and other passive activities for young people in the area. In each of these cases the relevant ministers, while being sympathetic to the requests, have been completely unable, or unwilling, to help these groups to invest in the social capital of the region. In an electorate such as Greenway, with its high ethnic mix, there is a particularly strong challenge to bring together the various ethnic groups with the existing local populations. Many of the larger ethnic groups have established strong community organisations of mutual support, but the interaction between these groups and the general community is not always so well established. The Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre and the Macquarie English Language School are two organisations which are providing valuable assistance in this area. There is a need for organisations such as the BMRC, along with schools and workplaces, to be provided with specific resources to bridge the ethnic divide. In the last calendar year, the BMRC provided information to more than 24,000 migrants in Western Sydney. This information was delivered through 117 information sessions. These sessions were delivered at the centre's main office in Blacktown and on sites for key communities in Mount Druitt, St Marys, Liverpool and Auburn. More than 70 different community groups and organisations regularly use the facilities of the centre, making a significant contribution to the social capital of the area. I know that the government is generally very pleased with the work that is being carried out by the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre. But I believe that the bridge between our ethnic population and the wider local community is through the youth of the area, so I was very pleased to see that the BMRC has established a non-English-speaking youth project. This project has worked closely with the smaller emerging community projects, ensuring better delivery of outcomes for younger people from refugee backgrounds. The program includes tours of local youth services, career information seminars and anti-racism programs. It also looks at mental and emotional health issues and provides education on rights and the police system in Australia and cross-cultural sports programs where young people can interact with the broader youth community. Only last Thursday, I attended the launch of the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre's multimedia youth resource kit, which reflects the challenges faced by refugees, young people and communities as they settle into new lives in Blacktown. The launch featured oral and musical presentations from young people from Sierra Leone, Sudan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Kurdistan. This is the very essence of why investment in social capital is so important. This was a very moving and well organised project, and it was interesting to hear the stories of the young people from these countries and to hear about the difficulties that they have to overcome in coming to Australia. Our educational institutions such as universities and schools also make a contribution to the social capital of the region. The University of Western Sydney, which has a large number of campuses throughout the Western Sydney region, provides an invaluable service to the community of the greater west. This university services an area which is traditionally disadvantaged when it comes to educational opportunities. The participation rate in higher education in Western Sydney is only 3.2 per cent, compared with five per cent for the rest of Sydney-and the proportion of people with degrees is only half that of eastern Sydney, for example. More than 70 per cent of students at US are the first in their families to attend a university. The university's role in providing for the future of our area is incredibly important, which is why the $270 million funding cuts to it by this government are so abhorrent. I am pleased to say that the local councils are taking a very keen interest in this issue and have discussed it with the government, with a view to restoring the funding that has been taken away from the university. I would like to talk briefly about how education-public education in particularcontributes to the social capital of a community. I will refer to an article written quite a long time ago-in 1909-by Professor W. H. Holmes. I believe it is still very relevant today. In that article, Professor Holmes, a Harvard academic, states: Civilised communities undertake education as a part of their proper business, not as a charity, as a necessary public function. Further in the article he states: The public interest is not met by merely elementary education. It is met only when every prospective citizen may secure without undue sacrifice that extent and kind of education which will make him most efficient in his fundamental social relationships, including his vocation. In other words, do not limit public education to the basics. People need more than that; society needs more than that. Yet in the education portfolio we have a minister who is eager to cut courses from universities, so he says, because they do not fit his political agenda. What makes a community a community? It is more than a mere collection of individuals thrown by circumstance into a particular suburb or region. It is an investment in social capital-links and networks-that creates community. The individual is important, certainly, but the community-the society-is just as important. When one becomes subservient to the other a great deal is lost. This government is focused consistently on the individual, with little or no thought for the community-for society. The balance is wrong. In a democracy, government exists to create the balance. (Time expired) Indigenous Affairs: Larrakia Nation",77
43,Mr TOLLNER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Solomon) (5.21 p.m.)Three weeks ago I attended the official opening of the Karawa centre, the new Larrakia Nation headquarters, at Darwin International Airport. It was an occasion that highlighted the achievements of the Larrakia people, traditional occupiers of the land where Darwin and Palmerston now stand. A few years ago the Larrakia people were a diversified people of major family groups integrated within the broader population of Darwin and in danger of losing their cultural individuality and traditions. Today, due to the hard but work of a number of their leaders-and support from the CLP Northern Territory government, the current Territory government, ATSIC and other organisations-they are reestablishing their identity and presence in the greater Darwin area. There are a number of different projects with that aim. The new premises is the centre for a wide range of cultural and social initiatives, including-with the help of our Work for the Dole funding-cultural activities like canoe making, arts and crafts manufacture and sales, a plant nursery, and markets. A Larrakia cultural awareness project is commencing at the Northern Territory museum. It will include arts and crafts, dance, story telling and guided walks. The Larrakia are also tackling the social issues affecting them. The Karawa premises include offices for Larrakia aged care and the itinerants program for Darwin and Palmerston. This latter program is a direct approach to a problem that is all too familiar to many Darwin and Palmerston residents: public drunkenness and misbehaviour. Initiatives include a community day patrol, meaning early intervention in and around the streets of the cities; a day facility, providing alternatives for those living the itinerant lifestyle-‘long-grassers' as we call them; and accommodation options for those who need them. Larrakia leaders such as chairman of the Larrakia Development Corporation, Kelvin Costello; chair of the finance committee, Richard Barnes Koolpinyah; employment and training committee chair, Barbara Tapsell; ex-board member and tireless worker for the Larrakia, Bill Risk; a recently deceased member of the Cubillo family, who I shall not name out of respect for tradition; and a number of other family heads deserve the Top End community's acknowledgement and thanks for their hard work in reestablishing the Larrakia as an entity and force for good. These cultural and social tiatives are necessarily underpinned by economic advances for the Larrakia in the past few years, which are very much integrated into the future development of the Darwin and Palmerston communities. The first of these was the agreement between the previous Territory CLP government, Larrakia representatives and ConocoPhillips for the purchase of land at Wickham Point, alongside Darwin Harbour, for the LNG plant to process gas from the Bayu-Undan gas field in the Timor Sea. A second economic opportunity for the Larrakia people was an agreement between the CLP government and the Larrakia people, with assistance from the Northern Land Council, over land that was to be compulsorily acquired for the further development of Palmerston residential estate. The agreement, finalised in December 2001, has allowed stalled urban development to go ahead. Native title claims over some of the land were withdrawn and native title rights were waived over a sporting complex, as were objections to the compulsory acquisition. Today the Darla project, as it is known, has seen 50 residential lots developed and a ond stage of some 59 lots is under way. These economic initiatives are being followed up with the identification of training, apprenticeship and job opportunities for Larrakia people. In summary, the Larrakia are reestablishing not just their identity and cultural practices but also their collective nomic interest and investment in their homeland-Darwin and Palmerston. The Larrakia have commenced a journey that will see them establish greater economic independence, and that is a good result both for them and for the whole community in my electorate of Solomon. This is, as they say, a good news story. However it would be a dereliction of my duty in recording this story in the iniHouse if I were to fail to mention the concerns that some Larrakia people still have about the domination of the Northern Land Council over their affairs. The work of the Northern Land Council in enabling these beneficial developments deserves recognition and the appreciation of all those involved. However it must be said that, in this case and in other instances where the multimillion dollar Northern Land Council heads up negotiations on behalf of Aboriginal groups, there are considerable reservations among traditional owners about the power and control the land council wields in enabling such projects. The Larrakia Development Corporation, the business arm of the Larrakia, is a creature of the NLC. The sole shareholder of the Lara rakia Development Corporation is the Northern Land Council. The board members of the Larrakia Development Corporation are chosen by the NLC as the sole shareholder. The NLC says that, following a future Federal Court determination of native title holders being finalised, the acknowledged native title holders may replace the NLC as shareholder. However the NLC is quick to add that ‘some sec- things may be difficult to change because they are fundamental to the LDC's structure; for example, its charitable qualities.' This expressed reservation catches my attention because it is clear today that the big land councils in the Northern Territory have gone to considerable lengths to defend and perpetuate their existence and their total control ecoover moneys that flow to them from the public purse. One of the ways this has been done is by establishing combinations of Aboriginal corporations and charitable trusts that put their financial affairs beyond the scrutiny of the public, the government and even traditional landowners. It may be that these arrangements result in outcomes for Aboriginal Territorians that are both beneficial and could not occur without this cloak of corporate secrecy. It could also be that moneys are being misused. Only a few people on the boards of particular Aboriginal investment corporations and charitable trusts know the answer, and they have consistently refused to lift the veil on how hundreds of thousands of dollars a year-millions over the past decade-are being utilised and to what purpose. While I am putting on the record my congratulations to those, including those on the Northern Land Council, who have been instrumental in revitalising the Larrakia nation, I also place on the record my determination to see greater accountability and transparency in the future work of the big land councils in the Northern Territory. The Northern Land Council has been audited twice in the past 12 years. The financial audit in 1992 found embarrassing irregularities and the performance audit of last year found that there were no performance targets in place, so it was impossible to report on whether the land councils were meeting them. Land council administration costs have gobbled up about 50 per cent of the mining royalty equivalents money. Only about 12 per cent, after discounting ABA money spent by the land councils on pastoral property acquisitions, has gone to grants for the benefit of Aboriginal people in the Territory. In other words, Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory have been ripped off over the past 20 years by at least $50 million by the very bureaucracy which is charged with looking after their interests. For Aboriginal Territorians who find themselves locked up in their traditional lands relying on welfare payments it is time, as Northern Territory minister Jack Ah Kit has said, for land councils to work proactively towards engaging Aboriginal territory with private enterprise and economic development. The land rights act in the Northern Territory was well intentioned, but it has created some considerable unforeseen consequences. The land rights act must be seen for what it is-a rights act which attempts to create a prehistoric preserve of Aboriginality within the Northern Territory. The big land councils must be seen for what they are-members of a culturally inappropriate, administratively high-cost, politically contaminated, vested interest regime which is arguably at risk of financial corruption and which has overseen the diversion of funds for Aboriginal benefit into administrative expenses and selective individual benefits. In conclusion, I congratulate the Larrakia people and their leaders for their achievements over the past few years but restate my long-held view that economic development for Aboriginal Territorians should be, where public moneys are involved, fully accountable and placed under the control of those who stand to benefit from such developments upon their land. (Time expired) Transport: Maritime Safety and Security Aviation: Air Safety Ms O'BYRNE (Bass) (5.31 p.m.)Australia's security and safety environment has changed dramatically in recent years, as a result of events both here at home and overseas. At present a lot of energy is quite rightly focused on improving security in airports and airspace. However, what concerns me greatly is that there is not a lot happening in the way of legitimate reform to maritime security or a real understanding of aviation safety. The government has to realise that maritime security is not just about chasing fishing boats around the region to stop the stealing of toothfish-although we do care quite a bit about that in Tasmania-or ensuring that boatloads of refugees cannot make it past Christmas Island to the mainland. Maritime security is about security within our ports, it is about the safety of our maritime workers and it is about the success of future international trade and relations. Historically, Australia's maritime industry has not been subject to the stringent security requirements that have been enforced in the aviation industry. This now means that we have a situation where changes will be required of an industry that has had next to no consultation on what are appropriate security and safety measures-a situation which I find quite ludicrous. The maritime industry has expressed concern that proposed regulations for maritime security have not received proper exposure, concern that these reforms go beyond the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code and concern that they cannot be tested against any guidelines for a maritime threat assessment to determine adequacy, because ASIO as yet does not have any guidelines for a maritime threat assessment. Maritime security in Australia has indeed been managed in a very poor manner. In a nation that has one of the largest shipping tasks in the world, structural changes should receive more attention. However, the maritime industry, along with the ALP, is acting in good faith to progress this issue, and we must compensate for the incompetency of this government in the handling of these important issues. Of course, the introduction new security regulations will not just happen and, as you would anticipate, the Howard government is forcing the maritime industry to bear the huge implementation costs. The minister and the government believe that because the aviation industry is forced to for security measures it is okay for the mariof time industry to pay as well. Perhaps the minister needs to be aware that, just as the airlines pass on the increased security costs to the travelling public, the maritime industry will have to transfer the costs of implementing new regulations through the supply chain. It is possibly also worth pointing out that the industry has significant concerns regarding cost escalation as the associated maritime security levels are escalated. Moving from default level 1 to level 2 is likely to add substantial costs-and heaven forbid that there be a huge resource cost to move to level 3. Of course, the precise nature of these costs is difficult to ascertain at this stage, because the regulations, as we know, are absent. The maritime industry will have to pass on the costs through the supply chain, and ultimately consumers will pay. The federal government may need to be reminded that it is responsible for national security, and this responsibility extends to embracing measures to protect the Australian community, government and institutions from harm. The government cannot be permitted to walk away from the associated implementation cost of securing our nation. My home state of Tasmania relies heavily on our ports to facilitate trade between the islands and the mainland, and it concerns me that assistance is not being provided to Tasmanian ports. It concerns me that the government is, through a sleight of hand, slugging consumers yet again. Tasmania's four port authorities will need to deal with the new security requirements, and should the of costs flow from the ports through to consumers Tasmania's very small population will be hit hard. I suspect it will be hit harder than any other state. I know it is a pointless exercise asking the government whether an economic analysis pay has been done to assess the flow-on impact any new port security regulations, because I know there has been none. In a nutshell, the government's handling of maritime security has been nothing short of incompetent, which leads me to a second point-the government's blind ineptitude in its introduction of the National Airspace System. This weekend I had the opportunity to meet with Civil Air and some very concerned air traffic controllers in Launceston. The fact that so many air traffic controllers and pilots are concerned about the safety of air travel once the National Airspace System is introduced in Tasmania on 27 November quite frankly frightens me, as a rather frequent flier. But this week many more aviation industry representatives and experts are also raising cerns-concerns which, I might add, have been dismissed by some private pilots, who are arguing that the whole safety issue is really just a ploy for commercial entities to control the skies and a union grab for jobs. This week aviation industry groups, including the emergency medical service helicopter operators, fixed wing aeromedical organisations, regional and mainland airlines, more organisations from the general aviation industry and charter and flying training organisations have all thrown their hats into the ring to raise concern over air safety under National Airspace System. I therefore have to ask whether the government does not find it alarming that so many aviation experts are telling us that our safety will be compromised under the National Airspace System? Does the government also not find it alarming that, based on the safety comparison carried out last week, the airspace over Tasmania would become one of the most hazardous in the country? If experts are telling us that through the implementation of the National Airspace System our airspace will be downgraded to an unprecedentedly unsafe operating environment then should we all not be just a little more concerned? When air traffic controllers are saying they will not be able to provide normal collision avoidance separation services because the new maps under this system are missing vital radio frequency boundary information should we not be asking more questions and examining how this issue can be addressed? The government needs to stop yielding to the influence of a small minority who seemingly control Australia's airspace for their own personal use and to start listening to the experts and the people who actually use this airspace on a daily basis. The issue of air safety cannot be held to ransom by this group. Although its members rightly argue that there is need for reform in con- airspace management, frankly I do not believe that should be at the expense of public safety. Around 1.2 million people fly in and out of Hobart and Launceston airports every year. Surely the safety of aircraft passengers should be the foremost priority in this debate. The vocal minority advocating the implementation of the National Airspace System argue that it works in the US and so why shouldn't it work in Australia. It seems that there is one fundamental difference in the management of airspace in the US and the management of airspace in Australia and that the is the fact that the US has 85 per cent radar coverage of its airspace across the entire country. Members of the House may be aware that Australia has some 15 per cent radar coverage, which covers the eastern seaboard area. Tasmania has no radar coverage under 20,000 feet and, with no guarantee that all the aircraft are talking to each other on the same radio frequency, management of airspace becomes very dangerous. New Zealand has recently revoked this system because it found management of airspace was becoming too dangerous. In addition to this, many air traffic controllers in the United States, upon hearing Australia was to implement the National Airspace System, began warning against its use because it would be too dangerous. Why does the government insist on implementing a system that is not supported by anyone in the aviation industry except a small, unqualified and unaccountable lobby group with lots of money? This group, the Airspace Reform Group, is claiming that the implementation of the National Airspace System will save $70 million. This claim has already been discredited, and still the government refuses to back down from its potentially disastrous decision. I have the greatest respect for small-aircraft pilots who fly in and out of the airspace in Launceston and, whilst I know they are very familiar with the operating conditions and have a very good relationship with the tower staff, we can never be prepared for the maverick that comes in from elsewhere, does not know what they are doing and causes some significant aviation disaster. It has further been identified that the ernment and the association plan to move control for a substantial amount of airspace-except for around the Launceston and Hobart airports-to the Melbourne control tower. I must confess that I have great concerns about this-and not, as members of the government have insinuated, because it is going to impact on staffing levels and therefore on some union member levels. The reality is that the same amount of staff will still be required in order to manage the airspace in the areas immediately around Launceston and Hobart. However, this decision will impact on the ability of local operators with local knowledge and local experience to make calls and judgments in relation to safety. It will also mean that when people enter those airspaces immediately around the airports it will be the first time that the air traffic control station really will have any responsibility or power to work with them. So I have to echo the concerns for safety of the people who are the experts. I like to feel very safe when I am in a plane, and I feel safe because I trust the pilot to know how to fly and I trust the air traffic controller to know how to manage the traffic of planes through to the ground. Considering the statements made by both organisations recently, I no longer feel that I am going to be very safe flying in Tasmania after 27 November. The government needs to take control of this situation and address what are fundamental and legitimate concerns being raised by professional pilots and air traffic controllers. The implementation of the National Airspace System must be delayed until all safety concerns have been addressed and resolved. The travelling public in Tasmania deserves no less, and the travelling public around Australia deserves no less. Local Government",80
44,Mr ROSS CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"ParramattaParliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) gov- (5.41 p.m.)-I rise today to grieve the attempt by Parramatta City Council to impose a new $10,500 tax on purchases of newly constructed multi-unit dwellings in my electorate, under the guise of a housing affordability measure. Parramatta City Council is proposing the introduction of a new levy on all developers of multi-dwelling developments within the local government area, under what it describes as an inclusionary zoning measure, under which multi-unit developments would have to give up three per cent of the floor space of any new dwelling to Parramatta City Council for management at below-market rentals. The argument is that this measure is needed in order to maintain the diversity of the residential community of Parramatta and to maintain access to housing for those on lower incomes. This is a measure I regard as being probably well-intentioned. However, it will have adverse and unjust consequences for the vast majority of the residents of Parramatta and in particular for new home buyers. I say that because we know from research conducted by the Urban Development Institute of Australia that a disproportionately high number of purchasers of new dwellings are first home buyers. In fact, in a study conducted by the institute in 1999, they found that one quarter of new dwellings were purchased by first home buyers, even though first home buyers represented a significantly smaller proportion of the total number of those people purchasing dwellings. Perhaps one explanation for that is that the decade between 1989 and 2000 the price of a new project home increased by 23 per cent compared to the rise of 53 per cent in the price of an established home. What we see is that the newer dwellings-both project homes and multi-unit developments-tend to be more affordable for first home buyers. Indeed, this government has taken a number of measures to try and make housing more affordable for those first home buyers. Among those measures is the first home owner grant-currently at $7,000-which is specifically intended to compensate first home buyers for the GST cost that applies to the materials involved in the construction of new dwellings. Perhaps the more significant thing we have done-by astute and prudent management of the economy, particularly of the public finances-is that we have managed to reduce interest rates to a 30-year low, which is where they currently stand and where they have stood for some time. This has made access to finance much more widely available. But, at the very time the Commonwealth has been working to make housing more affordable, we find that at both the state and local government levels there seems to be a determined effort to place housing, particularly new housing, beyond the reach of young Australians. This measure is one among a series which I would put in that category. It is suggested that developers will simply absorb the cost of this new three per cent tax-or $10,500 on the cost of an average over new dwelling, which totals $350,000 in my electorate. The reality is that there will be no way to ensure that the costs are quarantined to the developer; they will certainly be passed on to the purchaser. There is no mechanism available to ensure that that in transfer does not take place. We could ask ourselves whether it is just, equitable and fair to impose it on the developer. Developers have been the target of quite a bit of hostility. In fact, it is my view that development, soundly managed according to appropriate guidelines, powerfully enhances the quality of a neighbourhood and lifts property values. In Sydney, we have seen a transformation in many local communities, and Parramatta has been at the heart of that transformation. Developers have to face quite an ordeal at the moment. In Parramatta right now there are 800 development applications sitting in a queue waiting to be processed by Parramatta City Council. You can imagine the cost of the delays involved. The official line is that there are sixto nine-month delays to have a development application considered. The anecdotal evidence is that it takes considerably longer than that. One developer in Parramatta told me that he recently sold five projects without beginning construction or getting the development application approved simply because he could no longer afford the finance costs of holding the undeveloped properties. This is a factor which Parramatta City Council might consider as they propose this new three per cent tax on new dwellings. If they could reduce the backlog of 800 development applications and increase the speed at which they process applications, they would significantly reduce the cost of new housing. I now want to talk about the diversity within my electorate. Over 30 per cent of the people in my electorate speak a language other than English at home. When I attend the citizenship ceremonies in Parramatta, I find there is barely a white face to be seen the crowd. We are seeing an extraordinary diversity and vibrancy as newer migrants make a beeline for Parramatta. This is due in part to this government's sterling economic management which has resulted in an unemployment rate for Parramatta of 4.4 per cent. When I was elected in 1996, it was just under 14 per cent. In the eight years since the Howard government came to office, we have seen a fall in the unemployment rate in Parramatta from 14 per cent to 4.4 per cent. In the Baulkham Hills local government area, the unemployment rate is down to 3.5 per cent; in Holroyd, it is at 5.5 per cent. average is a little over four per cent. That my idea of an affordable housing strategy: to give people access to jobs and employment. We have an affordable housing strategy in the form of the New South Wales Department of Housing. The New South Wales government currently has 100,000 people on the waiting list for public housing and an admitted backlog of $1 billion in maintenance obligations to its current tenants. That is $1 billion worth of maintenance work which has not been done because, as in the area of water management, the government is happy to take dividends out of organisations but is hugely reluctant to invest in the key assets of government. This New South Wales government has seen an extraordinary increase in revenue from stamp duty. In 2000-01, the New South Wales government took $1.9 billion in stamp duties. The next year, it took $3.6 billion-a 37 per cent increase; a massive financial windfall. This year, 2002-03, it will receive $3.6 billionthat is another 17 per cent increase. We are seeing the New South Wales Treasury sloshing around with the revenues that flow from this massive boom in property in Sydney. What is the government's response to that? ‘Let's introduce a new three per cent tax on affordable housing in areas like Parramatta.' in This initiative has been strongly supported by Minister Craig Knowles. I think it is an unjust and inequitable tax on the people in my electorate. In my electorate there are households where both members go out to work. They are working extremely long hours and they are making great sacrifices in order to make their housing more affordable. And now Parramatta City Council turn around and introduce a new three per cent tax. My strategy for affordable housing is: let's keep interest rates low; let's keep the economy growing and generating opportunities for jobs; let's reduce So the the tax on the GST components of a new is house as a consequence of these new revenue measures the New South Wales government has introduced; let's repay the $1 billion backlog on the existing stock of public housing; and let's get Parramatta City Council to start processing its DAs more efficiently. (Time expired) Addresses by the President of the United States of America and the President of the People's Republic of China",85
45,Mr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It has been 12 days since the joint sitting that hosted the visit by George W. Bush, President of the United States, which was followed the next day by the visit by Hu Jintao, President of the People's Republic of China. It is a bit much to expect that those two days should have been discussed much in the parliament, given that today is the first day of sitting for the House of Representatives, although the Senate did sit last week. Today the only reference so far has been a question quite rightly put by my colleague the honourable member for Cowan about the lack of an invitation to the widow of SAS soldier Andrew Russell at the wreath-laying ceremony during President Bush's visit and then a series of questions following the statement by the Speaker after question time relating to some incidents that happened on those two days. Today I suspect that there will not be much opportunity to sit down and properly discuss the substance of the speeches made on those two days. It is important that, if we are to go forward as a national parliament and understand Australia's place in the global community, after such visits we as a mature democratic institution should at least sit down and thrash out the issues that were raised as part of the visit and, perhaps even more importantly, the issues that were not raised during the visits. It is ironic that as the comments were being made at that time-some 12 days ago-a conference was going on in Madrid to look at ways in which countries and the international community could put in place a pool of resources that would ensure proper reconstruction in Iraq. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke at the International Conference on Reconstruction in Iraq. He encouraged peoples and countries to be involved in the funding for what he described as Iraq's monumental needs. Kofi Annan said: ... we all look forward to the earliest possible establishment of a sovereign Iraqi Government. But a start on reconstruction cannot be deferred until that day; it demands our urgent attention now. Of course, quite rightly, the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, was at that conference and placed on the record the United States' views about the efforts that were being discussed. As I have had the opportunity to say in other debates-regrettably, mostly in the run-up to Australia's involvement in Iraq-it was always going to be the efforts that we came together to make in the winning of peace that were going to be the hardest part of the task. I remember saying that the irony would be that inevitably it would be through the actions of the United Nations and their involvement that we would see the most positive steps forward in the way these things could be resolved. So it dismayed me when 12 days ago there was no great reference to Security Council resolution 1511, which was adopted on 16 October, about the Security Council's views of going forward in Iraq, noting the events that had happened in recent times. It was not in any way indicating that this was an easy ask or an easy task, but it was showing that, through the willingness of the wider global community, efforts could be made to address the problems that need to be addressed in present day Iraq. But, sadly, at the UN conference in Madrid the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Jan Egeland, was indicating to donors that insecurity is severely hampering the ability of the United Nations to operate and monitor its assistance to the Iraqi people. He went on to say that the two key priorities that the humanitarian community needs to aim for over the next few months are to ensure the basic needs of the most vulnerable Iraqis are met and to build the capacity of Iraqi institutions to service the needs of their people. We now see that since the visit of President Bush there have been continuing events in Iraq. We see now the withdrawal of UN agencies and other non-government organisations because of the concerns about the security of those workers. We all would agree with-and nobody would dispute-the comments made during the visit, and the speeches that were made in this place, about Saddam Hussein; no-one who cares about human rights would really be mourning. As George Bush said: Today, Saddam Hussein's regime is gone, and noone should mourn its passing. That was underscored when the Prime Minister said: I know that all Australians believe that the people of Iraq are better off without that loathsome dictator, Saddam Hussein. I think that that is not something that needs debate. When a demagogue like Saddam Hussein is moved on and got rid of, it is important. But I still think that there is a need to discuss the way in which that was carried out and the way in which the effort that led to that outcome was put forward to people. I have said in other speeches in this place that my great concern is that the next time the Australian community are asked to go along with such an effort, because there will perhaps be greater questioning on the basis of the type of information that was used in the run-up to the present action earlier this year in Iraq, perhaps they will not be as cooperative. The other aspect is that it underscores a fundamental difference, and I am pleased that we are able to, in a mature way, demonstrate that in this chamber. Across the political divide in this robust parliament, as the Prime Minister likes to describe it, there were people who disagreed with the Australian government's actions in supporting the United States administration's efforts. Likewise, we should acknowledge that in the United States there is a difference of view, and we should not just consider that the President's view is held by all the people in the United States. There is a difference of view. It is good to see that those matters are discussed and debated. But I regret that I do not see the proper continuing debate here in this parliament, the Australian parliament, on those issues. We had no discussion about UN Security Council resolution 1511. We have had little discussion about the efforts in Iraq's reconstruction. We have had little discussion about Australia's place as an independent nation. The Leader of the Opposition in his speech on the day of President Bush's visit said: ... Australia looks to itself; to the self-reliance of a proud, a free, a strong and an independent people. The Australian perspective is bound to differ from time to time from the perspective of the United States. Of course, on occasions, friends do disagree-as we did, on this side, with you on the war in Iraq. But the important thing is that, when the relationship and the friendship are developed, it means we can have these differences and this discussion. This was illustrated by the next day's visit by the President of the People's Republic of China. That is another nation where we have to develop the contact and friendship so that when we disagree, because we disagree as friends, we can have the debate. There is no good in people discussing what the reaction was to a single speech by the President of the United States. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, as you are aware, I was one member of this place who was in two minds about the appropriate response. I hope my response was seen as gracious. I am proud that a number of my colleagues and I were able to sign a letter that was delivered to Condoleezza Rice that enabled us to set out our position on the United States's and Australia's involvement in Iraq. But, as the Hansard of the day indicates, at the end of the President's speech: Members and senators rising and applauding, the Honourable George Walker Bush left the chamber. Some did not, but some did it with great alacrity. That really did concern me, because I do not think that that was the proper way we should have responded. I had hoped that we would get to debate the speech, which is a much better response. (Time expired) Indigenous Affairs",87
46,Mr ENTSCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Leichhardt-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (6.01 p.m.)-I would like to raise an issue in relation to Aboriginal health and education in my electorate of Leichhardt, an electorate that I proudly represent. It has about the third largest population of Indigenous people in Australia. In August this year I had the privilege of attending a land and health summit in Cape York at a place called Beagle's Camp, a short drive out of the western community of Aurukun. I was with the Prime Minister and Minister Philip Ruddock. I had the opportunity and the privilege to listen to a speech made by a young woman, Tania Major, the youngest ATSIC commissioner at 21. She was appointed in October 2002. While we have opportunities to hear issues raised in relation to problems experienced in Indigenous communities, I do not think that the impact that has can be anywhere as profound as it is when it comes from the mouth of a person who has to live that life on a daily basis in these communities. As a consequence, I would like to read into the parliamentary record the speech that was presented by Tania, to highlight the problems that currently exist in these communities. The speech was entitled ‘Cape York on Youth and the Future'. Tania says: I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of this land and those who have worked so hard to put this important summit together. And what an opportunity! Here I am: a young Cape York woman addressing the Prime Minister of Australia directly. The fact that you are here today, Mr Howard, is largely due to the hard work and vision of our leaders. We are proud of their efforts. Especially I want mention Noel Pearson. He has been my mentor and contributed to paying for my education. We are also proud of the efforts of our elders who have struggled to keep our culture alive. I thank you for coming here today and acknowledge that your visit might signify the start of a new era in Cape York Peninsula's Aboriginal governance. I say might, because there is a huge job in front of us and if we are going to succeed we need your commitment as well as our own. I hope this is truly the start of a new relationship between Government and Cape York Peninsula people. In less than 60 years the people of my tribe have gone from being an independent nation to cultural prisoners to welfare recipients. Is it any wonder that there are so many problems facing indigenous Australians today? Prime Minister, I want you to gain a brief picture of the life of young people in our communities. When I was growing up in Kowanyama there were 15 people in my class. Today I am the only one that has gone to University let alone finished secondary education. I'm also the only girl in my class who did not have a child at 15. Of the boys in my class seven have been incarcerated, two for murder, rape and assault. Of the 15 there are only three of us who are not alcoholics. And, Prime Minister, one of the saddest things I must report to you is that four of my class mates have already committed suicide. Now if this paints a grim picture of community life for you, it should. Life as a young Aboriginal person is not easy, in any setting. Life for a young Aboriginal woman is even harder. We have to fight for respect from every one. The story of my fellow students is a lesson in the magnitude of the problems that young indigenous people in Cape York face. The two issues that, in my opinion, are central to to changing this story are education and health. And your Government's policies affect these things. Two months ago I told the Queensland Principals conference that the levels of literacy and numeracy are very low in Aboriginal communities. I told them that when I went to school in Brisbane it was as if I had missed out on my primary education. There is a huge gap between what we get in communities and what other kids get in cities. I got straight A's in Kowanyama but when I got to Brisbane I was getting C's and D's. It really goes to show that there was something seriously wrong with the education system in our communities. One of the problems facing education in remote Indigenous schools is that teachers tend to be out of training and generally stay only for a year or two. There was not one teacher who stayed for the whole of my nine years at school, even the principals. On top of the racism that Aboriginal people face every day of our lives this seeming lack of commitment by teachers makes you feel they don't care. Prime Minister we need to review the curriculum in these communities because it's pitched at a very low level. I have had to draw the conclusion that governments and educationalists see us as less than white people. It was really sad to go to school in my community because the attitude in the whole community was that ‘white kids are much smarter than me'. How can the education being offered to our young people be justified? Education should be uplifting not serve to reinforce lack of self-esteem and the heart wrenching low expectations that my mob suffer from. If we cannot get education right then we are doomed. We need a massive re-assessment of education policies and an equally massive investment in education. Governments have let down most of my classmates. Noel Pearson helped me to an education, but most young people won't be assisted by a sponsor. I got a chance in my life, worked hard with support from family and friends and today I stand before you as a qualified criminologist. All across Cape York I see and meet young Murris; smart, brave, compassionate, talented and beautiful. What is missing from their lives is an education that promotes self-confidence and drive. With these qualities, hundreds of Cape York Peninsula Murris could be the next group of doctors, lawyers, painters, mechanics, criminologists or engineers. We have spent so long listening to some whitefellas telling us we are stupid, lazy no-hopers that just the majority of my people actually believe it. The relationship between poor education and poor health is clear. People whose self-esteem and pride have been decimated by a sub-standard education system and a social system that creates an addiction to passive welfare have little reason to live healthy lives. Prime Minister, our health is getting worse not better. The policies that determine the delivery of health services are deeply flawed by a bureaucracy that does not want to let go and hear our voices. Health services are too often confined to the clinic. It's patch 'em up and spit 'em out kind of health regime. In Kowanyama we had the only doctor based in a Cape York Aboriginal community. She left two weeks ago because the Queensland Health bureaucracy did not support her. Her practice epitomised the sort of health system we need. She understood the relationship between, physical, mental and spiritual health. She took health out of the clinic and into the lives and homes of community people. She took her responsibilities to serve the community seriously and now she's gone. Another blow to my community's already low morale. Prime Minister, it's problems and challenges such as the ones I've described to you already that led me to stand in last October's ATSIC election. I decided to run because I believe ATSIC provides a great opportunity to advocate for my people; to have a say in distributing funding throughout Cape York Peninsula and influence State and Federal Government policy decisions that affect me and my people. It is great privilege for me to represent my community and I hope that with experience I will be an effective ATSIC Councillor. I know that in the coming months your Government will decide the future of ATSIC and I hope that you will understand that ATSIC is more than the Board of Commissioners and the Canberra bureaucracy. ATSIC is also people like myself and my Chairperson Eddie Woodley. People who are from community and work hard for community. Prime Minister, we recognise that Governments cannot solve our problems for us. As young people we are trying to take responsibility for our future. We are working with our Elders to address the terrible problems of grog, illicit drugs and violence. We are working hard to create economic, training and employment opportunities for ourselves. We are supporting our fellow young people to achieve their potential. Mr Howard, I ask not that you fix these problems for us but that you and your Government see us as equal partners in the huge task of rebuilding our families, communities and Cape York Peninsula. The fact that you are here today is a good start in the process of change and I urge you, as a fair minded man, not just as Prime Minister, to become part of the solution. I stand up here as a proud Aboriginal woman, a Kokoberra woman as well as a criminologist and I thank you for your time and attention. I do not think anybody could have made a statement as powerful as that one from a wonderful young woman. The statistics that she was able to reflect on in her own class of 15 are an indictment of the failures that we have seen over many, many years in dealing with the delivery of services to Aboriginal communities. One of the problems that has happened through successive governments is that there has been a continued tendency to gauge the level of success and commitment to Aboriginal communities by the amount of money that is being spent on those communities rather than gauging the success by the outcomes that are delivered by that investment of funds. I encourage people to start to rethink the way in which we do this and judge it on outcomes rather than simply on dollars spent.",90

48,Mr ANTHONY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the requested amendments be not made. The schedule of requests from the Senate for the amendments to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 involves extending the time limits for making past period claims and for payments of top-ups by a further 12 months. The changes would also allow the tax file number link between Centrelink and the ATO which facilitates the reconciliation process to remain open for an additional 12 months. Consequential changes consistent with the further 12-month extension are also requested for the application provisions in the bill so that the amendments cover the 2000-01 income year and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The government opposes these changes to the bill. The bill already gives families an extra 12 months in which to make family tax benefit and child-care benefit lump sum claims and to receive a top-up payment of family tax benefit. This will give families up to two years after the end of an income year to claim their entitlements. Two years is a very generous timetable, particularly when compared to time frames applied to other welfare payments. Extending the time frame by an additional 12 months-that is, giving customers three years to claim or receive a top-up payment-is not needed. The majority of customers lodge within two years of the end of the income year. As well, the proposed amendments would weaken the purpose of the payment, which is to assist with the cost of raising children. Families need this support when they are raising children, not three years later. In relation to extending the time frames to the 2000-01 income year, it would not be possible to identify all family tax benefit customers who missed out on lump sum payments or top-ups to their family tax benefit as a result of lodging their tax returns late for the 2000-01 income year. This is because the tax file number link between Centrelink and the ATO that facilitates the income reconciliation process for the 2000-01 income year has already been broken in accordance with the current legislative requirements.",93
49,Mr SWAN,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I request that the amendments to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 be made, because families under financial pressure simply cannot afford this government, and there are two key amendments which ease that financial pressure. What we have here is a family payment clawback that makes Ned Kelly look like Santa Claus. Families pay more tax and get less in family payments under this government, and then they are expected to pay more and more for the health and education of their kids. The $1 billion black hole, which was highlighted in today's question time, has been saved by stripping it from the payments of hard working Australian families. The answer that Minister Anthony gave today shows how mean and tricky the government is prepared to be to cover up its withdrawal of much needed family payments. Last year, 2002-03, the Howard government spent $1 billion less in family tax benefit and child-care benefit than it forecast. This system has an inbuilt automatic clawback that ensures that families never get what they expect, and this goes to our two amendments. First of all, people who needed a catch-up, not a top-up, in the first year of operation have been denied it, costing them $37 million. That is $37 million that has been ripped from those people because of this mean legislation. So one of our amendments goes to the core of that. The second amendment goes to stopping the stripping of tax returns which so far, to our knowledge, have been stripped from 230,000 Australian families. We are constantly told by this government that this is a generous system. How generous it was in 2000-01, when it came in. It was so generous that families were to be compensated much more than the cost of the GST. We now know that it is $1 billion less than the government has claimed. In fact, if you look at some of the new analyses of this payment system you will see that families receive in real terms $212 million less in family tax benefit than they did in the first year of its introduction. That is, in real terms there is now less money after three years of operation of the system than there was originally, plus families have been saddled with the GST, plus they have been saddled with extra costs of education, plus they have been saddled with extra costs of health care. That is why families feel under tremendous financial pressure. So tax is up, family payments are down and family budgets are squeezed. Today in question time the minister produced a typically mean and tricky answer to explain this clawback, which goes to the very heart of our amendments. He asserted that the clawback happened because of stronger than expected growth in wages. He said that it came about because of the means testing of benefits. That was a lie. The problem is that the initial budget forecast of wages growth for that year was 4.2 per cent and it was downgraded by the Treasury to 3.25 per cent. So wages grew less than was anticipated. The government took $1 billion out in the last financial year and it says that it happened because wages grew more than it thought they would. It was simply a lie. That is why there is an enormous clawback which goes to the fundamental problem with this bill, which is that there are parts which automatically take payments off families who are entitled to them. Families need these payments to feed, clothe and educate their kids on a weekly and fortnightly basis. When the minister spoke to the amendments he had the hide to say that we could not provide the catch-up, not the top-up, to families for 2000-01 because that need had passed, yet he refuses to change the debt trap in the system and says, ‘It's okay; families should take less on a yearly basis and claim it at the end,' as a justification for the fact that it is a debt trap. It is a family payment clawback. It is one of the biggest fiddles that have ever been imposed on Australian families in the history of this nation. The government is quite prepared to pay family payments to millionaire families but when it comes to average families it will not pay a category of the catch-up payments. When it comes to the broad mass of families, they are all being saddled with debt. This government's family payment debt trap is tearing the heart out of family budgets and placing parents under great financial stress. It is hitting one in three families. The average debt is $900. That is why these amendments must be passed-to stop the government thieving back this money from people's tax returns. That goes to our amendment about stripping. This government is like a thief in the night. It is building its surplus on the hard work of Australian families-(Time expired) Question put: That the motion (Mr Anthony's) be agreed to.

50,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"ANNE KELLY (DawsonParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (6.29 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with section liament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 15 October 2003, namely: Forecourt scoria restoration, liament House. This motion proposes the restoration to the forecourt area at the front of Parliament House. This project has arisen due to the movement and failures of finishes in the Parliament House forecourt. It has been an ongoing problem since construction and is now at a stage where the unsightly displacements, with cracking and undulating finish, are becoming hazardous to foot traffic and a disruption to the visual aspect which is required for official occasions. Under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Presiding Officers are responsible for works within the parliamentary precincts and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government is responsible for other works in the parliamentary zone. Accordingly, this motion is moved on behalf of the Speaker and the President. The works are expected to cost in the vicinity of $1,250,000 and will be funded from the Joint House Department administered funds appropriation. The National Capital Authority has given works approval and, given the nature of the works, the Presiding Officers did not think it necessary to refer the matter to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories for inquiry and report. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

51,Mr MCCLELLAND,AGE DISCRIMINATION,"I acknowledge the presence of the Attorney-General in the chamber and I thank him for his courtesy. Age is very much a defining feature of who we are. Our chronology can have an enormous bearing on many of our characteristics. Through the various stages in our lives-from infancy to childhood, adolescence to adulthood and middle age-our physical and mental qualities change with time. Age does, at certain stages in our life, also demand special treatment, recognition and sometimes protection. We would all accept that. It is frequently said that how a nation treats its young and its elderly is an indication of how civilised it is, and we accept that proposition. Many current stereotypes about agerelated characteristics are wrong, misconceived and hurtful. Notions of younger adults being irresponsible and older persons being inflexible, hard to train and not adaptive are frequently generalisations that have no reflection of reality and often deprive both industry and the individual of considerable opportunity. Our economics and our advancement demand that the attitudes and myths that perpetuate negative age discrimination are shattered. It is in this task that the SENATE government should lead, and we note that the substance of the Age Discrimination Bill 2003, albeit with some changes, is supported by the opposition. All states and territories have already outlawed age discrimination and, while the federal government is the last to act, we believe that late is better than not at all. Law reform is a powerful tool that can do much to eliminate prejudices. In itself, it can reflect community aspirations that help mould conduct so that those aspirations become standards. A generation ago, laws prohibiting sex, race and other ill-founded bases for discrimination wiped out many stereotypes that were largely unquestioned. One only needs to go back a little over two decades to be in an era where certain jobs were reserved for males and others for females. As late as 1980, a woman called Deborah Wardley was still involved in a fight that went all the way to the High Court to be allowed to pilot a commercial aircraft. She won that fight. Right up until the 1980s, job advertisements were segregated into women and girls, and men and boys. In the former category were positions like secretaries, sales assistants and nurses, and in the latter category were truck drivers, carpenters and managers. The move to eradicate age discrimination has come more recently, and there is still much to do. Until relatively recently, it was not uncommon for employers to set baseless age limitations for jobs. In our newspapers, it was easy to find employers expressly stating in job advertisements that applicants be under 40 or 45 years of age. These sorts of limitations had no rational basis, and they not only excluded worthy applicants but reinforced the message that age would dictate a person's ability to perform certain work when such an assumption was nothing short of wrong and destructive of both the individual and the corporate talent. Some of the quotes found in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's excellent report into age discrimination, entitled Age Matters, tell of the ageism in contemporary Australia. For example, one quote from a person stated: I was registered for unemployment and when I asked why no jobs had been referred, I was told by a CES staff member that I was past my use by date … Later, the report gives an account of a male teacher who applied for a subject coordinator's position. He was asked why he did not seek the position 20 years earlier. In respect of accommodation, the report reproduces an extract from the Youth Affairs Network of Queensland, which says: There is no legal reason that people under 18 years of age cannot sign a lease, however this still cited as a reason for them not being leased flats, units and houses. Age discrimination persists as a negative force that requires appropriate government attention and, as I said, that is supported by the opposition. In November 2001, the Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Sev Ozdowski, wrote: Age discrimination complaints made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission between 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 have tripled. More than 200 people phoned the complaints information line after being deemed ‘too old' for a position. Under New South Wales laws, age discrimination was the first most common ground for complaints in 2000-01 to the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board, making up nine per cent of complaints in total. Not only are these views that promote age discrimination an affront to the dignity of older persons but also they impair the efficient functioning of the labour market. On a macro level, an ageing population has serious economic consequences for the Australian economy. Over the next 20 years, the growth in the Australian population of labour force age will be 14 per cent, but the number of people between 55 and 64 years of age is expected to increase by over 50 per cent. On an international scale, participation in the Australian labour market stands at relatively high rates for young workers but low rates for older workers. For older Australians, the labour market is not serving them well. This proportion is exemplified in the disappointing reality that Australia has the highest unemployment rate for men aged 55 to 59 of any country in the OECD. So there is a real cultural barrier to be overcome in that respect alone. What these statistics bear out is that the case for human rights goes beyond legal niceties. Human rights do more than achieve is the noble objective of upholding the dignity of individuals. Respect for fundamental human rights pays significant economic and social dividends as well. Recalling the comparison to sex discrimination, the rise in female participation in our labour force has been a significant contributor to our rising economic prosperity. Not only can women now fulfil their potential and aspirations but also industry has an enlarged pool of skilled labour. The higher labour participation rate of women significantly boosts the gross domestic product of Australia. Demographers have charted how our growing life expectancy and declining birth rates are changing the population profile. As a nation, our average age is increasing. It is predicted that, between 2011 and 2031, the number of people aged over 65 in Australia will grow from three million to five million. Over this period, the number of persons over 85 years of age will almost double, to 1.1 million. This will be in most of our lifetimes. Perhaps more dramatic than these figures is the slowdown in the rate of work force growth. Between 1978 and 1988, the work force grew by 23.5 per cent. In the succeeding decade, the rate fell to 17.1 per cent. Over the decade 2000-10, the rate will dwindle to just 13.8 per cent. So, from 1978 to 2010, it will go from 23.5 per cent down to 13.8 per cent-a significant decline. These trends point to a significant shift the ratio of those who work to those who are in retirement. This will put an increasing strain on the economy, and it will be necessary to find the resources to fund retirement incomes and deliver wealth and fundamental services to other segments of the population. However, as pointed out in the bill's explanatory memorandum, an increase in 10 percentage points in the work force participation of Australians aged 55 to 70 years of age would largely cancel out any negative effects of an ageing population. It is therefore in everyone's interests to seek to increase labour force participation amongst older workers, not by way of necessity but by way of creating opportunities equally for senior tralians as for young workers. Of the various means pointed towards this goal, such as retraining programs for older workers, altered retirement income policies and so on, it remains essential that we as a society break down those views that perpetuate age discrimination and promote a culture that effectively locks people out of those portunities which benefit not only themselves but, as I have said, the nation as a whole. On this front, Labor welcomes federal age discrimination legislation, just as there already exists complementary state, territory and federal antidiscrimination legislation in respect of sex, race, disability and other grounds. The addition of federal legislative protections against age discrimination will signify the complete and comprehensive rejection of negative age discrimination by all Australian governments. However, there is considerable scope for the government, we believe, to improve in respect of this bill, and I will address those areas. Labor hopes that the government will indeed accept our amendments that will, firstly, extend the operation of the bill to relatives and associates. These will be debated, I understand, at a later stage in the in Main Committee. The prohibition of age discrimination to a person's relatives and associates was considered by the government, but we understand it was rejected. The government's information paper on the bill contained a passage that said it would be inappropriate. But, regrettably, we fear that, in the rejection of that proposal, perhaps the government has been overly influenced by employer organisations, or at least certain ones, without regard to the broader interests of the community. It is not difficult to envisage, for instance, where discrimination on the basis of the age of a relative or an associate may arise-for example, in an employment situation where Aus- an employer discriminates against an employee who cares for an aged relative, because of an apprehension by the employer that the employee will need time off to attend to the needs of that relative. Another situation might be that of a hotelier not allowing parents with young children to stay as guests, because of the hotelier's anticipation of unop- ruly behaviour by children. Labor takes the view that the Commonwealth legislation should set the standards and not merely provide the lowest standards of protection. I might add, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, that neither you nor I would have unruly or difficult children. I say that with my fingers firmly crossed! But Labor takes the view that the legislation should set the standards and not merely provide the lowest standards of protection. We believe that the government's capitulation, perhaps, to some of those more limited interests has impeded what would be effective operation in that area. We believe that another inadequacy with this legislation is the government's choice to water down the test for whether particular conduct constitutes age discrimination, by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for the conduct complained about. This is a significant issue; it is an issue of substance. The requirement that age discrimination be the dominant reason is a much harder test than that which applies, for instance, under the various state and territory laws dealing with age discrimination. Generally in antidiscrimination laws the relevant test is met even if the discriminatory action is only one of several reasons for the conduct that is the ground for the complaint. The provision in the New South Wales AntiDiscrimination Act is a good example. Section 4A provides: If: (a) an act is done for two or more reasons, and (b) one of the reasons consists of unlawful discrimination under this Act against a person (whether or not it is the dominant or a substantial reason for doing the act), then, for the purposes of this Act, the act is taken to be done for that reason. So probably the most significant amendment we will be moving seeks to have included in the act a test that age discrimination is one or more of the reasons, as opposed to the dominant reason, for the discrimination. The government's reasons for the more difficult threshold to maintain the complaint are, we believe, not based on sound reasoning and, indeed, are at odds with the government's rationale for bringing forward the legislation as a whole. We note that the government's case for introducing the legislation is said to be as follows: If the status quo is retained, older Australians and younger Australians would bear the cost of ongoing discrimination, suffering the effects of marginalisation, unemployment or under-employment, damage to self-esteem, reduced social participation and reduced access to goods and services. The community would also lose the benefits of diverse contributions to society by people of different age groups. Labor agrees with those sentiments entirely. In weighing up the case for legislative reform in this area, the government reasoned: The self-regulatory measures suggested in Option 2 are not appropriate for the problem of age discrimination as they do not provide an adequate remedy. Legislative mechanisms for providing protection against age discrimination would appear to be the optimum way of dealing with the problem.  Similarly, simply retaining the status quo, as suggested in Option 1, is not an appropriate option in this case. As noted above, there are gaps in the existing coverage of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws which would not be rectified by simply retaining the status quo. Again, we consider that the government has advanced a compelling case for legislating to prohibit age discrimination at a Commonwealth level, and we agree with the argument it has advanced. But, in the execution of the legislation, the government has softened unnecessarily the impact in these important areas. Age based harassment is the other area that we have concerns about in this legislation. The government's position on age based harassment mirrors its position on relatives and associates. The government raised the issue in its information paper but, after noting that only the Northern Territory specifically banned age based harassment, the government succumbed to business concerns over the issue and declined to ban age based harassment in the legislation. Age based harassment is a real phenomenon that should be stopped. No more should young apprentices and junior staff be bullied and treated in a demeaning manner, and no longer should older Australians be subjected to derogatory taunts. With the three amendments which we will be proposing at the detailed stages of the debate, we believe the operation of the Commonwealth's age discrimination legislation will go from being perhaps the weakest in the land to being on par with the best. As amended by those proposals, we consider that the proposed legislation will be better able to fulfil its mission-one on which the government and the opposition agree-to protect Australians from negative age discrimination and to have a significant benefit in promoting tolerance and a culture of utilising our nation's best talent base, irrespective of a person's age. On the issue of exemptions in the legislation, Labor will reserve our judgment until the operation of the legislation has been considered in time. In this sense, we believe it is vital that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have sufficient funding and resources to make that assessment on the operation of the legislation. As I have pointed out, having these measures operating effectively has not only social benefits but also economic benefits, and we believe that that should be a consideration in funding the important work done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. For this to happen, there must of course be no more cuts to the commission's funding, and the government must respect the commission's independence and integrity and let it get on with this work in its respected and objective way. With Labor's package of amendments, we believe the bill will become balanced, effective and should serve the purpose that it is designed to achieve. We are all susceptible to the effects of age, which regrettably we start to feel. They are something beyond our control. What is in our control, however, is the power to break down the stereotypes and prejudices that have held back those in our society who have every ability to make a contribution but have been dismissed simply because of their age. In conclusion, I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to ensure that federal age discrimination legislation contains the best standards of protection of older Australians, a failure which is consistent with its neglect of the human rights of all Australians, as evidenced by its introduction of legislation to weaken the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other actions to wind back protections for Australian citizens”.",97

54,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The opposition support the measures contained in the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence FeesManufacture) Amendment Bill 2003. Australia have a proud record in the area of the control of ozone depleting substances. We have managed to meet the targets and deadlines proposed in the Montreal protocol and the subsequent upgrades and amendments to these protocols. In most instances, we have been able to meet targets ahead of time and to exceed the requirements. A continuing bipartisan approach and generally good cooperation from the private sector have been major contributing factors to our success. It is only appropriate that Australia should be a leading nation in this area. Ozone depletion issues affected the Southern Hemisphere earlier and much more significantly than they did the Northern Hemisphere. High rates of skin cancer are already a public health issue in Australia and, indeed, continue as a major concern. Thinning of the ozone barrier increases the potential exposure to damaging UV-B light-the main causative factor. There are other effects as well. The cost-benefit ratio of one to seven in 2003 the review of the existing legislation speaks for itself. Ozone depletion is an important problem, where the widespread adoption of interna2003 tional protocols has helped to limit the damage. Hopefully, the problem will be largely remedied over the next several decades. Most of the current indications are positive, although there are a few worrying signs. Records from the CSIRO station at Cape Grim in Tasmania are showing that most of the levels of the controlled ozone depleting substances are decreasing in the atmosphere. The unfortunate exception is CFC-22, which was the most used CFC and is the most abundant ozone depleting substance in the atmosphere. Although the rate of increase has slowed greatly, it is still increasing. Continuing vigilance and adherence to strict standards will be required. It is unfortunate that, in this context, some wealthy nations are working towards a relaxation of some aspects of the protocols. Methyl bromide, for example, has a high ozone depletion potential. It is an important fumigant. We must try to avoid simply relaxing the controls to allow its continuing use, and I hope the government does not take a dodgy approach to the so-called critical use exemptions. There is an urgent need to research and find alternative fumigants. There is a second area of concern associated with the release of human generated additions of gases to the atmosphere. The effects on climate change are now seen as significant and problematic by the consensus of scientists world wide. Weather patterns are starting to show significant change all around the world. The Beijing amendments, which we are dealing with here, extend the range of considerations from ozone depleting gases to others that do not cause ozone depletion but, equally, have the potential to contribute to atmospheric warming and climate change. The measures we are considering are largely concerned with the national implementation of these international protocols. Concerns about global climate change affect all nations, perhaps some even more than Australia. We should not imagine that this is an issue that we can be slow in addressing. It is important that Australia show leadership and be at the forefront of measures designed to minimise the impact of our activity on the climate. The last seven or eight years have seen a significant change in weather patterns over, for example, South Australia. Although there have been previous severe droughts lasting a season or two, the current prolonged drought has been unprecedented in our records. Indeed, it would appear that the rain-bearing westerly airstream has moved southwards from our continent into the Southern Ocean. This is something that the member for Cowan might be familiar with in his part of the world-that is, the drying of the Perth climate when compared with what it experienced 20 and 30 years ago and before that. Computer modelling of the weather, at the Bureau of Meteorology and elsewhere, has shown just such a pattern associated with an increasing influx of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Interestingly and perhaps disturbingly, the models show a similar effect when a cooler Antarctic stratosphere is factored in. Temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere have fallen significantly with the local loss of ozone and it appears that these two factors have worked together to produce the recent changes. In southern Australia, only a small area in south-western Tasmania has received above-average rainfall over the last several years. The whole the rest of the southern part of the continent-we are talking about south-western and Western Australia and around Adelaide and the vast majority of Victoria, so all of those areas and few areas further north-has had a succession of dry years; the driest on record for a large part of the region. The atmosphere is a very thin and delicate region. Human release of substances to the atmosphere has produced measurable and observable changes in composition over a period of decades. Ozone depletion and greenhouse warming are two quite different problems but to some extent they feed one another and in many cases they are now being seen to combine to produce significant climate change. Human inputs to the atmosphere and their contribution to climate change are an urgent issue for Australia, an issue of enormous economic and social importance. It is vital that we take steps to reverse and, certainly in the short term, limit undesirable activities. This legislation is a very small contribution towards this goal. None of the substances included currently contributes significantly to atmospheric warming. They all have the potential to contribute if released in larger quantities. The substitute refrigerants that we have developed to replace the ozone depleting substances are, in some cases, capable of making a similar contribution to atmospheric warming. Careful monitoring of their use is an important and desirable part of limiting the harm, and that is largely what this legislation addresses. The legislation itself should certainly not be seen as a solution to our climate change problems. We should always remember that the major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and methane. Steady increases in the level of these two gases in the atmosphere over the last century or so are responsible for over 90 per cent of the human generated of change. The substances that are the subject of this legislation are potential contributors. At present their effects are insignificant but if not controlled they might build up to a contribution of a few per cent and that could well be an important additional burden. But carbon dioxide principally and methane, as a second factor, are the substances whose emissions must be controlled. It is disappointing that, in spite of successful negotiations to obtain concessions for a number of special issues that affect Australia, this ernment has decided not to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. That is worse than disappointing; it is shameful. The amendments before the House have two main thrusts. The first is to extend the types of measures adopted for control of ozone depleting substances to other substances that have global warming potential. They cover most of the more direct and obvious replacements for the ozone depleting refrigerants and bring them under a similar regulatory regime. The second impact is to centralise the regulation into a single consisthousands tent set of rules for the nation. There are vious advantages in terms of certainty and efficiency, particularly for enterprises that operate in several states or territories. The opposition support this thrust of the amendments in principle. We do have some misgivings about putting this kind of responsibility into the hands of a government that has shown in other areas that it is quite prepared to modify regulations and procedures and walk away from international protocols when they do not suit its prejudices. But if we do not take appropriate action to deal with human influences on global climate, effects that are already becoming apparent-and I will return to this issue-will amplify and we will have more drastic problems to deal with in years to come. The original legislation was introduced by the Labor Party in 1989. The first bill which we are debating here, the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, continues the generally bipartisan approach which has been taken on this subject. The purpose of this bill, in amending the Ozone Protection Act 1989, is to establish a national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone depleting substances and the synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. It also implements the most recent amendgovment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The existing legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances by over 80 per cent since its enactment back in 1989. To achieve this reduction, Australian industry has adopted a variety of ozone benign substances and technologies, including the synthetic greenhouse gases: hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. These gases present no direct risk to the ozone layer but are potent greenhouse gases, with their emissions having an impact on the climate hundreds to of times greater than emissions of obcarbon dioxide on a tonne for tonne basis. Although these gases currently comprise only a very small part of Australia's overall greenhouse gas emissions, their use and emissions are on the rise as substitutes for ozone depleting substances. The explanatory memorandum asserts that amendments introduced by this bill will deliver on commitments to manage synthetic greenhouse gas emissions, as detailed in measure 7.2 of the National Greenhouse Strategy. The second reading speech asserts the amendments also implement the key recommendations of the government's review of the Commonwealth's ozone protection legislation under the national competition policy. The two additional bills which are we are debating here, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence FeesImports) Amendment Bill 2003, extend the current payments applying to the manufacture and import of prescribed ozone depleting substances to certain synthetic greenhouse gases and allow for an increase in payments. So what these bills are doing is extending the system in the existing legislation for licensing the import, export and manufacture of ozone depleting substances to also include the synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. They are designed to simplify the current regulatory arrangements-for end-use control of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives-by replacing existing state and territory legislation with a single national framework. That framework will allow the government to enact regulations to target preventable emissions and adapt these controls over time to reflect changes in technologies and practices. In implementing these controls, the government will draw upon industry expertise and experience, including through the use of industry boards. The second reading speech says: The states and territories agree that isting controls with the proposed nationally uniform approach should deliver environmental gains more efficiently, and realise benefits dustry in terms of increased certainty and consistency. The bill reforms the current financial arrangements for the ozone protection program to establish the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Account. The reforms will accommodate the additional regulatory responsibilities assumed by the government under this bill and increase transparency by consolidating all financial arrangements into one account. The new arrangements will, on a cost recovery basis, fund administration of the amended act and programs to reduce the environmental impact of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. The bills also implement the Beijing amendment to the Montreal protocol. The Beijing amendment requires a ban on the trade in, and manufacture of, bromochloromethane and a ban on trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries not committed to their phase-out. The explanatory memorandum outlines industry support for the bills on the basis that they provide ‘necessary certainty and consistency with regard to its obligations to effectively manage ozone depleting substances'. There was support for the legislation from the Australian Fluorocarbon Council, which said that supporting the bills is a sensible and comprehensive approach to the matter. They said that the bills recognise that a least cost approach is the best way forward and that in this case reducing emissions will position our economy for the future. The Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating also said that the bills will provide Australia with a world-leading program for the control and management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. There was also support for the bills from Greenpeace and the Australian replacing exConservation Foundation. There was, however, some support for greater effort to move in the direction of into increased use of natural refrigerants. Indeed, the Greenchill Technology Association indicated very strongly their belief that the bills ought to go further. They described the government's approach as a necessary but not sufficient response to the problems caused by HFCs. They said that whilst trying to manage and control emissions is a laudable objective, emissions will continue to increase as they continue to be used. As it is far more effective to reduce emissions by using naturals instead, this needs to be the central thrust of the legislation. So there were some concerns about the legislation on the basis that we should be looking to move in the direction of natural refrigerants. I believe that the concerns raised by Greenchill and by others are best addressed through the development of policy on natural refrigerants rather than through seeking to amend the bills before the House, because the bills before the House otherwise improve existing arrangements for the management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. I will come back to this question of proposed amendments in a moment, but I will make a couple of other points before I do that. The first point is that this legislation product of a policy commitment made by the Commonwealth government back in 1995. I think that when the government stands up and says that introducing these bills will contain greenhouse gas emissions and provide greenhouse gas dividends it ought to be noted that this commitment was made back in 1995 and, had this legislation been introduced in a quicker and more timely way, we would have been saving much more in the way of greenhouse gas emissions. So there has been delay. That has resulted in millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere over the last decade, which could have and should have been prevented. The second point I want to make comes back to methyl bromide. This is a powerful ozone depleting substance. All uses of methyl bromide other than for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes are to be phased out in Australia by 1 January 2005, consistent with our obligations under the Montreal protocol. However, parties to the protocol recognised that transitional access to methyl bromide after that time may be justified. In 1997 they adopted a formal decision to allow limited critical use exemptions in some rare cases. That decision made it clear that such exemptions would be granted only when several strict criteria are met. It appears that the government may seek to allow or support dubious exemptions which compromise the intent of the phase-out. That is something that the opposition will continue to monitor. In general, the bills represent an improvement on the current arrangements for management of both ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. I understand that it will not have a financial impact in that proposed increases in licence application fees will satisfy the legislative requirement for revenue neutrality in administering the act. I think there has been a certain amount of is the mischief on both the government side-the Liberal side-and the Green side of this debate. I received correspondence from the executive director of the Australian Fluorocarbon Council and from representatives of the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturers Association. In those emails they said they were very worried that there was difficulty in having the bills scheduled for debate. They wrote to request my assistance in expediting this matter and to ask if I could assist in moving these bills forward. Mr Deputy Speaker Price, as you will be well aware, I have no influence over the management of the business of the House. That is entirely in the hands of the government. The delays in bringing these bills forward have been entirely a matter for the government. It is their choice as to which bills should be brought on for debate and which bills should not be brought forward for debate. If the government were endeavouring to suggest to the industry that Labor was somehow holding up this legislation, that would be completely untrue and a piece of mischief on their part. On the other side of the coin, the Greens have foreshadowed amendments to this legislation, which they have foreshadowed by way of press release, not by way of discussion with us. There has been some lobbying in the last couple of weeks endeavouring to suggest that we should be supporting amendments which take us in the direction of natural refrigerants. One of the difficulties relation to these proposed amendments, which have been bowled up late in the day, with people sending us emails the day before this legislation was originally scheduled to come on for debate, is that this approach does not show a great understanding of how a large democratic party works. We certainly do not spin around on a 20c piece in relation to these matters. More importantly, the issue is that this legislation should take us forward. The government is clearly setting out the case that this legislation does take us forward-for example, by telling us that it will deliver a greenhouse gas abatement equivalent of up to six million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum by 2010, which is about one per cent of Australia's 1990 emissions. If we accept the figures provided by the government and understand that this legislation is benign, then putting us in the situation of holding the bill to ransom and saying, ‘We will not support it unless it does other things,' can make life very difficult. If the legislation is amended in the Senate but not supported by the government as a result of the Senate amendments then, of course, people will be open to accusations that they are holding up what is good and worthy legislation. The Labor Party are prepared to consider the proposals to advance the cause of natural refrigerants and to give them due policy consideration, but that is something we will consider as part of our policy development work, not in terms of support for amendments to these particular bills. In the remaining time open to me, I want to return to the question of climate change. I said in my remarks that the bills are useful in relation to greenhouse gas abatement, but they are far from a major or even significant step forward in relation to greenhouse gas abatement. Climate change is, in my book, the most serious environmental question facin ing the planet. Every day there is evidence of climate change. We saw it with the Californian bushfires. We saw it with the hailstorms in south-east Queensland recently. Storm events with hailstones the size of golf balls and cricket balls lashed south-east Queensland and caused at least $8 million damage-and it may be much more than that by the time the claims have been properly lodged. In the ACT, we saw storm events with hailstones contributing to the blacking out of more than 20,000 homes in the ACT and something like 40,000 homes in New South Wales. Back in April 1999, we saw a billion dollar Sydney hailstorm. Interestingly, the Insurance Australia Group-it is their business to know whether climate change is happening and what impact it is likely to have on insurance claims-have done modelling and their preliminary findings show that even small adjustments to the key parameters would combine to form a superstorm and create a hailstone event that has the potential to far outstrip the horrendous April 1999 storms in both intensity and scale. There have been bushfires, there have been hailstorms and there is the evidence we have seen in relation to the Queensland wet tropics. Recently, I drew public attention to the findings of researchers that show that, in the area of the wet tropics, climate change will have severe effects on the long-term survival of many species. Most upland species will disappear if average temperatures increase by anything over one degree Celsius. We also have the prospect that carbon dioxide concentrations will reduce the nutritional value and increase the toughness of most foliage, which has implications for leaf-eating species and for litter-feeding insect eaters, and that the cloud base will rise higher above the ground than it is at present. A lot of those endemic rainforest species are distributed over areas with a very narrow range in temperature and rainfall, so relatively small changes in temperature and rainfall will have a major impact on the capacity of species in the wet tropics to survive. It is of concern whether we are looking at those things or at the phenomenon I mentioned earlier which was referred to in a recent Catalyst program as the Antarctic vortex. That is where the rain-bearing winds over southern Australia during the winter period which give southern Australia much of its rainfall are now apparently being sucked further south as a result of the interaction between the hole in the ozone layer and increasing temperatures on the continent. As that effect becomes more dramatic, the rainfall will be sucked south into the ocean and we will not get it. Southern Australia will enter a period of reduced rainfall and extended drought conditions. That sort of change is potentially dramatic for this continent. Australia is already the world's driest inhabited continent, and the prospect of reduced rainfall in southern Australia ought to be a matter of major concern. Unfortunately, this government does not get it in relation to its attitude towards mate change. It claims that we are on track for meeting our Kyoto target. The point is that we contribute less than two per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, but it has nothing to say about the other 98 per cent. The one vehicle that is there to try to tackle global climate change and global greenhouse gas emissions is the Kyoto protocol on climate change, and this government has done everything it possibly can to scuttle and undermine the Kyoto protocol. It has not played a part as a good international, environmental citizen. Indeed it is very much in Australia's best interests to get action at an international level to contain our greenhouse gas emissions. The rest of the world is responsible for over 98 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and this government has absolutely nothing to say about how we deal with those greenhouse gas emissions. Dr Stone interjecting",102
55,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This government ought to be ratifying the Kyoto protocol. The government's position is a matter of international embarrassment. The parliamentary secretary at the table, Dr Stone, might not be aware of it but around the world our environmental reputation is mud as a result of the stance we have taken on this. Try talking to some of those South Pacific nations-Tuvalu, Kiribati and the rest of them-and see how they feel about the prospect that they will be flooded as a result of us undermining the Kyoto protocol. We should be ratifying the Kyoto protocol on climate change and urging the United States and Russia to do likewise. It is of course necessary for either the United States or Russia to ratify the protocol for it to come into effect. If we do not get that collective international action then the problems we are talking about-droughts, bushfires, floods, cyclones and increased susceptibility to clitropical diseases-will only become more serious. So I urge the government to do the right thing on climate change. Collective international action can work in relation to the Montreal protocol and the ozone problem. It can also work in relation to the Kyoto protocol and the climate change problem. We need to take the same constructive approach to climate change as we have been taking to ozone so that we can get the effects that are necessary to protect the planet's climate, and particularly Australia's climate, in the years ahead.",108
56,Dr WASHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise today to speak to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and related bills. The purpose of the bills is to amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to maintain the national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone-depleting substances, ODSs, and newer synthetic greenhouse gases, SGGs, to be used as their replacements. Australia's ozone protection legislation has made a significant contribution to the global effort to phase out ozone-depleting substances. Through cooperation between government and industry the legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone-depleting substances by over 80 per cent since its enactment in 1989. To achieve this reduction, Australian industry has adopted a variety of ozone benign substances and technologies, including the use of synthetic greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons. These gases do not endanger the ozone layer but are now recognised as potent greenhouse gases. Some of these SGGs have an impact on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne-fortonne basis. For example, the hydrofluorocarbon 134a is 1,300 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis. The bills also extend the system in the isting legislation for licensing the import, export and manufacture of ozone-depleting substances. This enables Australia to ratify the most recent amendment to the Montreal protocol-the Beijing amendment-and address environmental issues raised by the increasing adoption of SGGs where they are used as alternatives to ODSs. These amendments have been developed following extensive consultation with state and territory governments, industry and other stakeholders over the last four years. There is widespread support for these changes, which will allow a national uniform approach and deliver effective environmental gains, certainty and consistency as a benefit to industry. These amendments affect businesses in the air conditioning, refrigeration, foam, fire protection, fumigation in agriculture, aerosol and precision cleaning industries. Greenhouse gases emitted during the production of aluminium, magnesium and electricity are exempted from the bill and will be addressed through voluntary programs. The bills have the potential to reduce Australia's overall emissions of greenhouse gases by the equivalent of six million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum by 2010, or up to one per cent of 1990 levels. The bills cover the phasing out of these ozonedepleting substances: bromochloromethane, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, halons, methyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform. Hydrocarbons, which are used as an alternative to ozone-depleting substances in car airconditioners, are neither ozone depleters nor greenhouse gases and are not regulated by this regulation. However, hydrocarbons are flammable and in some applications raise occupational health and safety issues. The aim of the bill is not to phase out SGGs as there is no reasonable number of alternative exsubstances available to replace them. They were originally adopted as replacements for ozone-depleting substances. The aim of the bill is to minimise the emission of these gases. The earth's ozone layer protects all life from the sun's harmful radiation, but human activities releasing ozone-depleting substances have damaged the shield. Ozone is an extremely rare gas, representing three out of every 10 million molecules. Most atmospheric ozone is concentrated in a layer in the stratosphere about 15 to 30 kilometres above the earth's surface. Ozone is a molecule containing three oxygen atoms. It is blue in colour and has a strong odour. The oxygen molecule, which we breathe, has two oxygen atoms and is colourless and odourless. The ozone layer absorbs a portion of the radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the planet's surface. Most importantly, it absorbs the portion of ultraviolet light called UVB, a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths from 280 to 320 nanometres, a nanometre being one billionth of a metre. It is produced by the sun. UVB has been linked to many harmful effects, including various types of skin cancer, cataracts and harm to crops, certain materials and some forms of marine life. The ozone layer also absorbs all the lethal ultraviolet C radiation. At any given time, ozone molecules are constantly formed and destroyed in the stratosphere. The amount, however, remains relatively stable. The ozone depleting substances that have been used over the past 50 years or so were initially thought of as miracle substances. They were stable, nonflammable, low in toxicity and inexpensive to produce. Over time, CFCs found uses in refrigerants, propellants, solvents, foamblowing agents and other small applications. Others-such as chlorine-containing compounds including methyl chloroform, a solvent, and carbon tetrachloride, an industrial chemical used in fumigation; halons, which were found to be extremely effective fireextinguishing agents; and methyl bromide, a very effective soil fumigant-have atmospheric lifetimes long enough to allow them to be transported by winds into the stratosphere. The CFCs are quite stable, although on exposure to strong ultraviolet radiation they break down and release chlorine and bromine, which in turn attack and destroy ozone. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules. The net effect is to destroy ozone faster than it is naturally created. One example of ozone depletion is the annual ozone ‘hole' over Antarctica that has occurred during the Antarctic spring since the early 1980s. Rather than being a literal hole through the layer, the ozone hole is a large area of the stratosphere with extremely low amounts of ozone. Ozone levels have fallen by over 60 per cent during the worse years. In addition, research has shown that ozone depletion occurs over the latitudes that include North America, Europe, Asia and much of Africa, Australia and South America. Thus ozone depletion is a global issue and not just a problem at the South Pole. Data collected in the upper stratosphere has shown that there has been a general thinning of the ozone layer over most of the globe. This includes a five per cent to nine per cent depletion over Australia since the 1960s. In addition to this general thinning, more dramatic damage occurs over Antarctica each spring when the ozone hole forms. The 2000 ozone hole was the largest on record, measuring 32.9 million square kilometres-more than three times the size of Australia-and, for the first time, extending over populated areas. The prospects for the long-term recovery of Antarctic ozone are good. Non-essential consumption of the major ozone-depleting substances in the developed world slowed during the early 1990s and ceased in 1996. Stratospheric chlorine levels should return to pre ozone hole levels by about 2050. Since most of the ozone-depleting substances are released in the northern hemisphere, a common question is why the ozone hole occurs over Antarctica. The first part of the answer is that, even though most of the chemicals are heavier than air, regardless of where they are released, they mix throughout the troposphere-the layer extending up to about 15 kilometres above the earth's surface-over about a year and then mix into the stratosphere in two to five years. The second part of the answer is that, although the overall process is similar between global ozone depletion and the ozone hole, there are two different types of ozone depletion chemistry. Both types are important, but the ozone hole seems to grab most of the attention. The first kind is called homogeneous depletion. Resulting from reactions as gases mix together, it is responsible for the reduction in global ozone levels. The five per cent to 10 per cent drop in ozone over the US is an example of homogeneous chemistry. The second kind of ozone depletion chemistry, called heterogeneous, causes the radical destruction of ozone over the Antarctic each spring that we call the ozone hole. It results from chemical reactions on the surfaces of ice particles. The existence of these particles and the seasonal and geographic location of the hole all result from a combination of meteorological and other effects that are specific to Antarctica at that time of year. Each winter, the air around the South Pole cools and begins circulating to the west. This vortex effectively isolates the air over Antarctica, with three effects. First, outside which is relatively ozone rich, cannot mix in and sustain ozone levels. Second, the chemicals that tend to slow down the depletion reactions cannot mix with Antarctic air. Third, the heat from outside air is shut out, prolonging the period of very low stratospheric temperatures. Because the air gets so cold over Antarctica each winter, the vortex remains intact for several months, finally breaking up in December. The vortex is the reason for the timing and location of the ozone hole, because such vortices do not form over more temperate regions, and, as such, homogeneous gas phase chemistry is the dominant global concern, producing long-term ozone depletion trends. The Antarctic is a very cold place; temperatures in the lower stratosphere drop below minus 80 degrees Celsius. Ordinarily, the stratosphere is so dry that it will not support clouds, but these cold temperatures do produce ice clouds, called polar stratospheric clouds or PSCs. Some of the clouds are water ice, but more prevalent are clouds of nitric acid and water. Like the wind vortex, the formation of PSCs has specific impacts. In the absence of polar stratospheric clouds, most man-made stratospheric chlorine is locked up in relatively inert compounds. However, the surfaces of the ice particles in the clouds allow these compounds to react, converting the chlorine into ozonedestroying forms. These reactions are different from those occurring when gases mix over mid latitudes. The forms of chlorine released from the clouds' surfaces cannot destroy ozone without the addition of UV light, which is not available during the southern winter. Thus their concentrations rise until the sun appears during the spring. When the sun does rise, the chlorine is rapidly converted to chlorine air, monoxide, and this is followed by a very rapid set of reactions, destroying up to 70 per cent of the ozone in the lower stratosphere over a period of a few weeks. The net effect of these factors is the ozone hole, an easily measured, well defined seasonal phenomenon. The depth, area and timing of the hole vary from year to year, but, as the polar vortex breaks up and the stratosphere warms, the heterogeneous chemistry shuts down and ozone levels over the Antarctic return to near normal. The ozone hole generally lasts from September to December, although the exact time period varies from year to year. The ozone hole is the most obvious effect of the release of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere and is also the most extreme example of ozone depletion. However, the long-term downward trends in ozone levels over most of the globe also pose a serious threat. Although not as spectacular, homogeneous chemistry is a significant problem. In conclusion, the 1999 Beijing amendment has already essentially been practised by Australia. The Beijing amendment contains four key elements: the ban on production and trade in bromochloromethane except for essential uses to countries that have fied the Beijing amendment; the ban on trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries who have not agreed to phase out these gases; the phase-out schedule for hydrochlorofluorocarbon production in developed countries, with phase-out by 2040; and mandatory annual reporting of methyl bromide imported for quarantine and preshipment purposes. Australia's trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries who have not agreed to phase them out is negligible. Australia has voluntarily reported its quantity of methyl bromide imported for quarantine and preshipment purposes. Australia does not manufacture bromochloromethane or hydrochlorofluorocarbons, has not recently exported bromochloromethane, and on average imports less than one kilogram of bromochloromethane per year. So, basically, we have enacted this already.",108
57,Mr ORGAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Cunningham) (7.39 p.m.)You might expect that as the sole Greens MP in this House I would welcome the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and its associated legislation, and I must say at the outset that these changes are long overdue and very welcome-as far as they go. And that is just the problem: they do not go anywhere near far enough. It is a missed opportunity. There are widespread concerns about the bill, despite a stated aim of minimising the impact of ozone-depleting substances on the environment. The minister has told us that the purpose of this bill is to amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to ensure we have a truly national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases-SGGs-used as their replacements. The minister told us that it also ensures Australia remains an international leader on action to preserve the earth's ratiozone layer by implementing the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says this will be done by amending the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to: - introduce a licensing system for the import, export and manufacture of synthetic greenhouse gases (SGGs) used as alternatives to ozone depleting substances (ODS), accompanied by a licence application fee, activity levy and reporting obligations; - introduce a licensing system for refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment imported into Australia containing the ozone depleting substance hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) or the synthetic greenhouse gas hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), accompanied by a licence application fee, activity levy and reporting obligations; - extend the existing licensing system for the import, export and manufacture of ODS to a new ODS, bromochloromethane, including the associated licence application fee and reporting obligations; - provide for national consistency in enduse regulation of ODS and their SGG alternatives through a power to create regulations for this purpose, replacing State and Territory ODS and SGG enduse regulations that vary in both scope and nature; - extend the scope and purpose of the Ozone Protection Special Account to include all costs and revenue associated with the amended Act and management of Australia's National Halon Bank; - introduce application fees for an exempthe tion to import or manufacture certain products containing or manufactured with ODS; and - undertake a series of minor technical amendments to clarify the definition of “Protocol” for the purposes of the Act, and clarify the status of ODS and SGG imported for destruction. That all sounds very worthy, but there are significant problems with this bill, and I would like to highlight some of those. For example, it has been argued that the bill is worthy of support because it improves legislation requiring review. However, this assessment is flawed for the following reasons. Firstly, it disregards the potential of natural refrigerants-as opposed to synthetic refrigerants-to replace fluorocarbons. The member for Wills has already made reference to concerns of peak environmental groups. The most significant of these is the exclusive focus on end-use controls on fluorocarbons taken by the bill and the unjustifiable dismissal in the explanatory memorandum of the potential for the uptake of non-ozonedepleting substances, non-SGG alternative substances and not-in-kind technologies such as hydrocarbons, ammonia, water and carbon dioxide. The government has repeated fluorocarbon industry views that these substances and technologies are unproven or unsuitable. Amongst experts in the use of natural refrigerants there is no uncertainty about their suitability for use in a wide range of applications, and there is very strong interest in the refrigeration and air conditioning industry in pursuing these solutions. The government claims that a study being conducted into the suitability of natural refrigerants is needed to resolve uncertainty. The study referred to was undertaken at the behest of the natural refrigerants industry. It has been published in draft form and sheds very little new light on suitability of alternatives, merely presenting instead a snapshot of opinion across different sectors of the industry. Taking firm action to encourage the use of natural refrigerants is not in any way dependent on the findings of the study, which is apparently being used by the government as an excuse for doing nothing. This outrageous attempt by the government to dodge the most pressing issues confronting the Australian refrigeration industry is simply unacceptable. The use of hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, will expand dramatically in the next few years. There is therefore no excuse for the failure of the bill to provide for strong action to facilitate a transition to the use of other substances and technologies. The limited extent of the uptake to date says nothing about the potential of such environmentally benign technologies to replace fluorocarbons in most applications, and immediately. There is a real strategic requirement to make the adoption of natural refrigerants a priority of the act and its associated regulations. The feasibility of replacing fluorocarbons is demonstrated by a number of European Union member states that have gone further by proposing a phase-out of HFCs as the primary mechanism for minimising emissions. Additionally, clear guidance needs to be given by the parliament on the formation of the proposed national industry boards. The detailed changes to the governance of the industry will be substantially determined by the regulation made under the legislation, in particular the establishment of national industry boards that will replace the current state based licensing system. I would like to talk a little about this issue. These new national boards will play a crucial role in influencing the performance and direction of the industry, and it is essential that the boards that are put in place to perform these functions enjoy the confidence and trust of the industry participants-not just the big end of town players and those with a vested interest, such as manufacturers of chemicals and equipment, but also those workers and contractors who are at the coalface, so to speak, in the installation and maintenance of air conditioning and refrigeration facilities. They're the ones who will be regulated! It is widely anticipated in the industry that the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council, NRAC, will be appointed by the government to administer the refrigeration industry board. Back in June, I asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage a number of questions about NRAC. The first related to the Australian Greenhouse Office having invested $3.6 million of taxpayers' funds in two organisations, Refrigerant Reclaim Australia and the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council Ltd through a Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program performance based grant to facilitate better handling and recovery of hydrofluorocarbon and perfluorocarbon refrigerants. According to the minister's reply this activity is expected to result in abatement of greenhouse gases equivalent to 3.58 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. My second question sought information on Refrigerant Reclaim Australia and NRAC in regard to their legal status, structures, rectors, key operating personnel, and financial reporting. The minister revealed that Refrigerant Reclaim Australia, RRA, is a company limited by guarantee which exists primarily to be the trustee of the Ozone Depleting Substance Reclaim Trust. RRA is a not-for-profit industry-funded organisation that has been established to recover and destroy waste refrigerant gases. RRA has a board of directors and a chief executive. It contracts with professional organisations to effect the recovery, transport, storage and destruction of waste refrigerants, and, according to the minister, it utilises world best practice Australian-developed destruction technology to transform waste refrigerant to salts and water. The minister further pointed out that the board of RRA is a vertical slice of the refrigeration and air conditioning industry, with representatives from importers, wholesalers, contractors and end users of refrigerants. Current directors are from five organisations: the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Contractors Association, the Australian Refrigeration Wholesalers Association, the Australian Fluorocarbon Association, the Vehicle Air-conditioning Specialists of Australasia and the Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturers Association. The Chief Executive of RRA is Michael Bennett. As RRA is not a publicly listed company, it is not required to produce public financial reports. However, RRA is required to report to the Australian Greenhouse Office on expenditure relating to its Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program grant. No such reports were available at the time of the minister's response to my question on this matter. In regard to NRAC, we were informed that it is a not-for-profit, limited liability company with a board of directors and a chief executive officer. Current board members include representatives of the four diorganisations I have referred to but excluding the Australian Fluorocarbon Association, along with the Motor Traders Association of Australia, the Institute of Refrigeration Airconditioning Service Engineers, the Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air-conditioning and Heating and the Air-conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association. Current directors are from the AIRAH; AREMA; ARWA; RACCA; VASA; and the AMCA. NRAC is currently preparing a financial report for the Australian Greenhouse Office covering the period from 19 September 2001, when the first funding was received, to 30 June 2003. That statement has not yet been received. I also asked a question seeking details of any contracts between these organisations and the government. We know that the Commonwealth signed Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program deeds of agreement with Refrigerant Reclaim Australia and the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council on 19 September 2001. As the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program is focused on the delivery of abatement in the Kyoto protocol commitment period, and these projects therefore need to continue throughout this period, the deeds of agreement do not expire until 2013. There are therefore a number of questions that could be asked about the validity of the abatement methodology proposed by NRAC and the extent to which it is likely to succeed, and particularly about whether NRAC is achieving the milestones specified in the deed of agreement with the Australian Greenhouse Office. One of those milestones is the registration of contractors working in the refrigeration and air conditioning field. understand that NRAC is way behind in the number of membership registrations it needs to have, yet it is quite explicit in its June 2002 annual report that it will be in deep trouble if the legislation before us is not passed to make the scheme compulsory. Understandably there are substantial objections from many in the industry in regard to NRAC being handed this critical regulatory role. They include a number of small business operators in the air conditioning field in my electorate of Cunningham who came to see me earlier this year and raised concerns about the impact of this new national regime and the dominance of NRAC on an industry which is going along smoothly under the present state regulatory regime. Those local business operators were very concerned about the idea of NRAC coming in and regulating on a national scale. As you can see from the above information, NRAC is dominated by refrigerant importers and large equipment manufacturers and has been greeted with great scepticism by contractors and other industry professionals. Reflective of this lack of trust by the industry in the NRAC are the very modest membership levels NRAC is understood to have achieved to date. A number of well established industry associations worked cooperatively in the late 1980s and early 1990s to establish the state based controls and licensing requirements for CFCs and came up with effective and widely accepted arrangements. These industry associations and organisations are the repository of the technical knowledge and practical experience that is required to develop effective systems of control and management of the industry, and it is essential that they be assured of a decisive role in the establishment of the national industry boards under this legislation. It is imperative to the success of the I national industry boards that they are comprised of a genuinely representative group of experienced industry professionals and that the industry is not placed under the control of a small group that does not have the confidence of the industry at large. As I said in the debate on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 2003 earlier this year, we are in danger of allowing the industry dog to wag the regulatory tail. Workers and contractors in the industry do not want this and the government needs to recognise their voices and listen to them. A further consideration about this bill is that significant improvements can easily be achieved by taking time to consider amendments. Unfortunately the member for Wills has indicated the opposition's refusal to consider such amendments, citing them as ‘mischief' by the Greens, although our suggested amendments do go towards supporting natural refrigerants. When this bill reaches the Senate, the Greens will move to ban imports of synthetic greenhouse gases in small split-system airconditioners. Small domestic airconditioners imported into Australia and prefilled with synthetic greenhouse gases, called fluorocarbons, can be installed by unqualified tradespeople, which leads to the greenhouse gases leaking. If the airconditioners were imported without the gas inside, they would have to be installed by qualified tradespeople, which would stop thousands of tonnes of ozone depleting and greenhouse inducing gases from escaping to the atmosphere. This simple move would make a big contribution to reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions and is strongly supported by companies like Pioneer Air Conditioning and industry groups like the Heating and Cooling Association of Australia. The Greens will also move amendments to the legislation to phase out synthetic greenhouse gases altogether and promote the move to natural refrigerants which harm neither the ozone layer nor the climate. The transition to natural refrigerants is well tablished in Europe and if Australia followed suit we would be well-positioned to lead the way in Asia. I therefore call on the government and the opposition to back the Greens move to ban imports of split-system airconditioners precharged with synthetic greenhouse gases and not to cave into pressure from the fluorocarbon users. The Greens amendments to support the industry's call for a ban on the imports of split type refrigeration and air conditioning equipment precharged with HFCs and HCFCs will have a significant immediate and positive effect on improving industry practices and reducing emissions. The amendments aim to require that fluorocarbon refrigerants would have to be put into split systems-as opposed to sealed ‘packaged' systems-in Australia by licensed technicians, reducing leaks and waste from overcharged and/or incorrectly installed systems. An effect of this requirement will be to encourage the purchase of split type airconditioners from specialist air conditioning and refrigeration dealers and installers, who are licensed to handle refrigerant gases and are required to abide by best practice techniques to avoid leakage in the installation, operation and ongoing servicing of the equipment. Qualified professionals taking due care in the installation of split-system airconditioners is an important strategy to achieve substantial reductions in emissions from this rapidly growing sector of the industry. The practical measure of requiring splitsystem airconditioners to be charged with a nitrogen holding charge instead of environmentally harmful refrigerants will provide an effective means of improving industry practice, reducing emissions and enhancing the efficient operation of air conditioning equipment. It will also help to support smalland medium-sized Australian companies and will esassist them to make the investment in training their employees in best practice refrigerant handling techniques. Further significant improvements to the bill could be achieved by implementing the refrigerant classification and safety standard, AS1677 parts 1 and 2, and expanding the purposes for which funds established under the act may be used. In summary, the government's approach encourages the overseas fluorocarbon industry while ignoring or hampering the domestic natural refrigeration industry. It is obvious that the fluorocarbon industry is concerned by the potential loss of market share they face from competition with products that are less damaging to the environment. This bill ignores numerous issues which, although largely unseen, have an impact on the lives of many Australians. The bill, as currently proposed, is seriously flawed and contains several problems that could be easily fixed. I would strongly urge the government to reconsider its position on this legislation and take action to bring about improvements that will provide support to the Australian refrigeration and air conditioning industry and make a more substantial contribution to the reduction of harmful ozone depleting and global warming gases. Until it does, I cannot support the legislation in its present form as the government could so easily do much more to deal with this important issue.",112
58,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on and support the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. This is a noncontroversial bill. Although I understand that the Greens are not supporting this bill, the Labor opposition have indicated that they will support it. It is an important amendment that should have come before this parliament quite some time ago; in fact, it could have come before this parliament many weeks ago. The only reason that it has not come before the parliament is that the opposition would not agree to have this bill debated in the Main Committee. As honourable members would know, the debating time in this House is quite limited and the government's legislative agenda makes it quite difficult to get bills onto that agenda and debated in this House. However, there is the second chamber, which is available for debate and does have time available, and this bill could have been introduced into the Main Committee several weeks ago. So the opposition has delayed the introduction of an important amendment which will help protect our environment and the ozone. I was disappointed to learn that, when industry sources approached the Labor opposition to clarify why this bill had not come before the Main Committee, they were informed apparently by the opposition that it was the government that was objecting to this bill being taken to the Main Committee. to Nothing could be further from the truth. The government was keen to have this bill introduced and was prepared to take it to the Main Committee several weeks ago. Having said that, I am pleased that this bill is now in this chamber. It will hopefully be debated in the Senate as quickly as possible and it will shortly come into effect to help protect our environment and our ozone. Australia's world-recognised efforts in ozone protection have been truly national efforts and have traditionally received support from all parties in the parliament. I am disappointed that the member for Cunningham, who represents the Greens, has left the chamber, but I will be interested to see the reasons why the Greens will not support this bill. I believe that the Greens are going to introduce some further amendments in the Senate. The introduction of the Ozone Protection Act by the Hawke Labor government in 1989 and subsequent amendments by the Keating government in 1995 received broad bipartisan support in this House. The important amendments we are considering todaywhich will result in one national program covering both ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases used in what are termed the ‘Montreal Protocol industries'-will hopefully receive bipartisan support, and I really urge the Greens to reconsider some of the objections they have to this bill. The measures in this bill, which have the industry's full support and which were developed over a lengthy consultation period, will give Australia the most comprehensive package for minimising the atmospheric impact of these industries anywhere in the world. The government have made many comments about the Kyoto protocol, and we are very committed to reaching some of the commitments that were established at the Kyoto protocol. This bill is further evidence of the government's commitment to meet the Kyoto target of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions by 2008. While the government is pleased to put forward this bill and I am very pleased to speak in support of the amendment, I would also like to congratulate the industry associain tions that have worked closely with the government to develop a package of controls which will deliver the best practical outcomes to minimise the emissions of what are, after all, nonflammable, colourless and odourless gases. I would particularly like to congratulate Steve Anderson, the executive director of the Australian Fluorocarbon Council, and Mr Greg Groppenbacher, who also represents the Australian Fluorocarbon Council, for the work that they have done to ensure that the industry is well represented and for the work they have done to assist the government to put forward this bill. The Australian Fluorocarbon Council has been a central and influential player in this area for some 15 years. The council is composed of representatives of all the major user groups and in particular has representatives from all the industry associations in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. This structure has enabled the council to put forward a broadly based view to the government and draw on the expertise across the industry to develop practical responses to the environmental challenges that the industry faces. I am aware that quite some time ago the industry came to the government with what it termed a ‘responsible use strategy'. Recognising that controls would, and indeed should, come, the Australian Fluorocarbon Council proposed a four-part strategy comprising: a ban on the use of disposable containers of fluorocarbon refrigerants; the extension of product stewardship obligations to cover all fluorocarbon refrigerants; the introduction of a national training and certification program for air conditioning technicians; and a general prohibition on emitting any fluorocarbon to the atmosphere when it can be practically prevented. I am pleased to say that all these elements will be put into place one form or another under the provisions of this bill. The Fluorocarbon Council has been responsible for a range of significant initiatives over the years which have earned it a number of awards from bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Perhaps the most significant of these was the establishment of Refrigerant Reclaim Australia, which I am advised is possibly the best organisation of its type in the world. To put it simply, Refrigerant Reclaim Australia is an industry-financed, not-for-profit organisation that is responsible for collecting and safely destroying any surplus or unusable fluorocarbon refrigerants anywhere in Australia. It is these refrigerants-the ones that cannot be used, the ones that have no economic value-that end up being emitted into the atmosphere, because obviously it is easy to discharge them into the atmosphere. As I said earlier, they are odourless and colourless gases, but unfortunately they have significant environmental impacts. Refrigerant Reclaim Australia achieves this by paying bounties for returned refrigerant, and this is financed via a voluntary industry levy. In its 10 years of operation, this organisation has destroyed approximately 900 tonnes of ozone depleting refrigerantsa magnificent effort that is helping to protect our environment and particularly help stop the depletion of our ozone. Unfortunately, since it is a voluntary organisation, not all companies pay the levy and we end up with this ‘free rider' issue that often creates serious problems with voluntary programs. While Refrigerant Reclaim Australia pays to take back and destroy everyone's refrigerant, unfortunately not everyone pays the levybecause as I said earlier it is a voluntary This bill will help to place the product stewardship obligations across all of the refrigeration and air conditioning industry. While Refrigerant Reclaim Australia will remain a voluntary program, there will be no more free riding. Companies will pay a levy either to the organisation or to a similar body or they will make their own arrangements which will have to meet the standards set down by government. A further example of the effective working relationship between government and industry has been the establishment of the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council. Established with assistance from the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council is composed of all relevant associations in the refrigeration and air conditioning industry. It is responsible for implementing a nationwide training and certification program for technicians and companies in the industry. While this group has made great progress, the difficulties of an effective voluntary program in this area are apparent. The bill will allow for the establishment of a mandatory national training and certification program for the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. As I said earlier, this is a very important bill and I am disappointed that it has taken so long for it to come before the parliament. I would certainly urge those in the Senate to help, assist and speed the progress of this legislation through the Senate. I would appeal to the Greens to act constructively for once in their lives-to look at this bill, which is a great step forward in protecting our environment; to support the bill; and to support the government in what they do. I think the Greens are losing a great deal of credibility. Their stunt in the parliament recently during the visits of the President of the USA and the levy. President of China certainly depleted their credibility. And as far as I am aware, the member for Cunningham-the sole Greens representative in this chamber-has never once supported the government. If they were in fact a party that wasMr Albanese-If you did something decent, he might!",117
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The member for Robertson has the call.,119
60,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Even the Labor Party on occasions supports the government! It really shows something of the mind-set of the Greens that they are not even prepared to look at the issues on the basis of merit and they simply vote against the government. This is an opportunity for the Greens to look at this issue and for once support what the government is trying to do. This government has been at the forefront of protecting the environment, through many initiatives, such as the Natural Heritage Trust, which is the largest environmental program that has ever been introduced by any federal government to protect our environment. We receive little or no recognition for that, particularly from the Greens, but it is a program that is supported very strongly throughout the community, through Landcare and Dune Care and many other programs in the community. This is just one way of showing that the government is doing something for the environment. The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is another way in which the government is showing that it is getting serious about protecting our environment. It is also an indication of how serious the industry is, not only in wanting to protect their industry but also to show that they are looking at a way of protecting the environment and ensuring that the air conditioning and refrigeration industries are seen as viable and long term, and are seen to be protecting the environment. The fact that these industries had already set up a voluntary levy that managed to reclaim a great deal of excess, surplus and useless ozone-depleting gases and had them destroyed in a way that was environmentally safe and did not contribute to the depletion of our ozone layer shows that industry is very serious about ensuring the protection of the environment. The fact that industry is prepared to work with government and put forward constructive ideas shows that it is also very serious about these issues. It is a great disappointment to me that a party such as the Greens, who claim to be a party for the environment, have damaged again their waning credibility by the fact they have refused to support this amendment bill. I believe they are planning to obstruct the passage of this bill in the Senate, which will further delay a bill which is designed to enhance and protect our environment.",119
61,Mr HATTON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Blaxland) (8.13 p.m.)We are dealing with three bills here tonight, so it is a cognate debate. We are dealing with the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, and my comments, arguments and debate will essentially go to this main bill. tendant upon that bill are the regulatory ters dealing with licence fees, so we also have the Ozone Protection (Licence FeesManufacture) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Amendment Bill 2003. These two sets of measures fundamentally simply update the current situation. They allow for a new range of licence fees to take into account what the central part of the bill is concerned withthat is, in particular, the synthetic greenhouse gases that have been so effective in reducing the deleterious effect on the ozone layer of the previous gases that were used. What has been available since those gases-the CFCs and so on-were phased out has had a particular effect. It has been argued in this debate, quite rightly, that there has been an 80 per cent effect in terms of the lowering of the deleterious effect on the ozone layer as a result of Labor's 1989 policy, which was that CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, should be written out of the additives that we had or the key components that we used, particularly for refrigeration. This is a wonderful example of how you can get it right, in terms of dealing with manufactured goods. You can see a problem, clearly, in terms of deleterious or inappropriate effects in this instance: the effects of chlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer. When Labor were in government in 1989 we that said that we should write down our usage of chlorofluorocarbons and that there would be a direct, scientifically measurable effect from putting this policy into practice. We can say all these years later, in 2003, that the Labor government were right and the scientific advice they had was correct. We can say it was a good, right, proper and just measure, indicating that you can effectively regulate the industry. We can say there is a direct correlation-a simple cause and effect-between the depletion of the ozone layer and the use Atof chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration, and mat- in aerosol sprays, and if you reduce those properly you will see a measurable effect on the ozone layer. We know from reports over the last two years, and particularly this year, that the increase in the rate of depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica has been arrested. In fact, the indication is that we are on the way back, in terms of dealing with the depletion of the ozone layer. The measures that we have taken and the measures that have been taken in America and in Europe, have had a direct and measurable effect. In particular, because we are contiguous with Antarctica, what we have done on this continent has borne fruit. We could rightly say that, responsibly, in government we did what was necessary. But, if you cast your mind back, if you think of the voices within the manufacturing industry at the time, and the voices in the debate generally, there was a great deal of hemming and hawing-a great deal of: ‘We don't know whether this is really possible; there would be a major impact on Australia's employment.' It was seen as too hard to do and the cost pressures were seen as too great. I would think that, given the effluxion of time-and we are talking about more than 14 years-everyone in the industry would now argue that this was a relatively easy thing to do once you recognised the necessity for it and coupled that, and the scientific work that went with it, with a government willing to put in tough legislation to make those changes. You can achieve good environmental outcomes if you have those connections. What does this bill deal with? It recognises that good policy can have good outcomes-and we have seen that over the last 14 years. But it also shows us that when you take a certain set of steps there can be, words of one particular past politician, ‘unintended consequences of your actions'. By substituting synthetic greenhouse gasesparticularly hydrofluorocarbons and perflourocarbons-for the chlorofluorocarbons, the gases that initially caused problems with the ozone layer, we have fixed one problem and created another. This bill recognises that fact but does not do anything to fix it. It says we need to monitor this closely and that we need to bring in a regime, through the attendant bills, where we do the proper licensing and so on, and get people to actually think about what they are doing. But there is a continuing problem here. Those gases that were substituted are doing the job of protecting the ozone layer, and the campaign in the seventies and eighties to address this evident problem had its effect. But when they made the change, they did not predict-and it may have been possible to predict but, as far as I know, no-one did so at the time-that the synthetic gases would reduce ozone depletion but at the same time would increase the greenhouse effect massively. What is argued in the explanatory memorandum and the background papers is quite simple. It is argued that these gases present no direct risk to the ozone layer but are potent greenhouse gases, with their emissions having an impact on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis. Reading that, you would think that here is a major and significant problem. The propensity of these two substitutes is to create a far greater problem than we have seen before. What you have to do then, of course, is take the next step and say, ‘What is the relative proportion of these gases in terms of our total use?' If you look at the background work that has been done on this you will see that they in fact make up only a very small part of our overall greenhouse gas emissions, in the and their use as substitutes for ozonedepleting substances is on the rise, so we have more of them. You would have to ask how significant a problem this is going to be if they fix one problem and help to create another one-and push that forward. This bill really does not have much of an answer to that, except to say, ‘They're there, and we'll keep a bit of an eye on it, but we're not really sure.' If you look at the explanatory memorandum, it says that the bill will deliver on commitments to manage these synthetic greenhouse gas emissions-and that is detailed in measure 7.2 of the National Greenhouse Strategy. The second reading speech also asserts that the amendments implement the key recommendations of the government's review of the Commonwealth ozone protection legislation under the national competition policy, but they do not fix the problem. They say, ‘The one core thing they were meant to do in 1989 is done, but we have to leave the rest in abeyance.' What has the response been to that? The response has been that, in part, the size of usage is much smaller when compared to the rest of the uses we have and the greenhouse gas problems we have through diesel particulates or through petrol-driven cars. They are a much greater concern than what is created here. Therefore, when you look at that on balance, you would say that they may not be as significant a problem. However, if you are looking at fixing the problem finally, you could propose that, instead of using these substitutes, we should look at natural refrigerants. It has been argued fairly extensively that that is a better way to go. I am sure that since refrigeration was first discovered and since Australia first established a significant meat trade with Britainat the end of the 1800s, from 1875 or so onwards-the value of refrigeration has been experienced and appreciated by people at both ends of the trading spectrum. Certainly those people in Australia who had the benefit of refrigeration in the 1940s and 1950s appreciated it. There was not too much of it around in Bankstown on a household basis. I can still remember my grandmother, coming from the country as she did, using extremely old methods of refrigeration until finally she bought an American Kelvinator and introduced the wonderful world of modern refrigeration to her house in Bankstown. If you think about it, it has been just over 50 years that we have had a completely different way of preserving our food and having the benefit of that in what is a very modern context compared to what went before it. If you look at the broader question of change here, I am sure that if you talk to most of the manufacturers now and you put the question to them: ‘Would you use chlorofluorocarbons again, knowing what you know about their ozone depleting character and nature?' most of them would say: ‘No. Given that we've got these substitutes-the hydrofluorocarbons and the perthe fluorocarbons-we're happy to go along and use those.' If you put the attendant question to them: ‘What about substituting those with natural refrigerants?' currently they would say: ‘We haven't seen all that much research around in terms of doing that. We'd like to do the right thing by the environment, but where's the evidence that these things will do their job?' There is a correlative problem that is probably greater than what it was some years ago. If I think about the number of refrigerators that I have-I have added it up-I have about seven that I am responsible for. It used to be only one. If I think about my own house, I have one in the garage. Luckily I have that, because the one we bought four years ago broke down a couple of weeks ago. Because Fisher and Paykel are now running out of New Zealand, they do not supply parts except through Queensland via New Zealand. The computer boards they have have to be remanufactured. We have been waiting about four weeks now-if you do not go through a Fisher and Paykel bloke-to get the fridge back. Luckily we still have the old Kelvinator. A number of years ago when my wife wanted to change this, Jack Fitzpatrick, who was the president of the Central Bankstown branch of the ALP and who also ran JJs Electrics and Sporting Goods store, said, ‘Why don't you just use the old one? It'll go for another 30 years.' He was actually quite right. That used chlorofluorocarbons but it still runs. We know that modern refrigerators, like modern cooking appliances, have built-in obsolescence. Even when you move from chlorofluorocarbons to the modern equivalents-the hydrocarbons or the perfluorocarbons-you have a problem in that you have to throw these things out on a far more regular basis. Not only is there then the question of what emitted when you are using them; there is also the problem, if you are going to throw the appliance out-hopefully we will not have to do that; hopefully this board will work-of the impact of that on the environment. That is something that 20 years ago we did not have to take into account so readily. We know that obsolescence is a problem in the computer industry, but the problem is increasing because most of our manufacturing in the whitegoods area is based on a ple proposition. What you get in the marketplace is based on price rather than on price, cost efficiency, quality and so on. While most whitegoods are based on price, they have a very short-term running cycle. Economies have changed over that 50year period since we have had extensive refrigeration in Australia and, therefore, the impacts have changed as well. Those things which can cause deleterious effects can do so in unexpected ways. Very few people would have expected that they would have to replace their whitegoods on such a regular basis. I know, Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, that you and the minister at the table, the member for Curtin, and all of those people, male or female, who have had to deal with these domestic problems understand fully that the world has changed and that we have this increased obsolescence. As legislators we need to be aware of that, and the bill that we have before us now deals with only part of the problem. It is an indication as well that, when you are dealing with changes in technology, you are also dealing with unexpected or unintended consequences. You can hope and expect that natural refrigerants might be used. My grandmother used one-it was called a block of ice. We know that, prior to ice becoming significantly available, ice-runs went through the streets, such as those in Greenis acre. In fact, my grandfather had an ice-run in Bankstown in competition with the Foxes. Ice was quite available and was a natural refrigerant. It was better, I suppose, for the environment than the kerosene based fridges that were used at the time but no-one has yet come up with something that is significantly easy to use in terms of natural refrigerants. Those who argue that it is simple to solve these problems can readily say, ‘Why don't sim- you use the natural methods?' Companies would do so if those problems were easily solved. What the legislation indicates is this: at any particular point in time, whether it is 1989 or 2003, a government acting in the best interests of its people will use the current state of scientific knowledge to attack a problem. That is what we did in 1989. That is when the projection was that if you decreased chlorofluorocarbon use we would be able to fix the problem with the ozone layer. All the scientific evidence that we have indicates that that is in fact coming true, that the probability is that we will be able to solve that one. Now we have a correlative problem in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. As the member for Bonython, who will be speaking later in this debate, has pointed out time and time again, the larger problem we have with greenhouse gases is the fact that our energy uses are so dependent on petrol or diesel products and we do not use the great natural advantage that we have got-natural gas. Its impact on greenhouse gases, if it were more broadly adopted, would be far less than what we have got from petroldriven engines and the effect throughout industry of using diesel. Australia does not have a policy which would force people, by dint of circumstance but also by dint of government action, to really look closely at their energy use and the effect that energy use has on greenhouse gases. Labor forced that to happen in 1989 with our legislation on ozone protection. But where the synthetic fuels have created a greenhouse problem we do not have any kind of government grasp of this significant problem and of the fact that we have major overuse of not just these gases but also petrol and diesel. By substituting natural gas, we could therefore dramatically cut our use of those greenhouse gases, deliver to the people of Australia a better product at a cheaper price and revolutionise the way that we deal with the problems we have now in terms of the Kyoto protocol by pushing in that way. What we have seen, as no doubt the member for Bonython and my colleagues will attest, is no government commitment whatsoever to grasping this problem by understanding it or putting in place a set of protocols that could actually deal with it. This legislation, in ing form, attempts: (1) to recognise the strength of what Labor did (2) to press forward with the solutions that we provided, but (3) to not really have a new program put into place to deal with the unintended consequences of those synthetic greenhouse gases that have caused this significant problem.

62,Mr HUNT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am delighted to rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Ozone Protection (Licence FeesManufacture) Amendment Bill 2003. I do so knowing that earlier today I rose and spoke about the death, the passing, of Gareth Hardin, who wrote ‘The tragedy of the commons' in 1968 and published that in the journal Science. As I mentioned earlier today, that was one of the seminal environmental treatises of the 20th century. When I spoke of it earlier today, I spoke of it in the context of a localised example of a tragedy of the commons: the soiling of Gunnamatta beach, the staining of the oceans and the waste of water which occurred off my own electorate. This legislation addresses the alternative. It addresses a global example of the tragedy of the commons. Hardin's thesis was simple. Hardin's thesis was that, in a world full of rational actors, there is a certain amount that each of us could do and each of us could contribute to the environment. If there is a group of herdsmen who surround a commons and if each grazes one cow, that commons can accommodate them. If, as a rational actor, an individual herdsman grazes an additional cow, that is to his or her benefit. But if all do the same, they exhaust that resource. That is essentially what is meant by the commons: that intuitive common sense for an individual amounts to collective failure when passallowed without looking at it from an overview. That is what this legislation and the whole notion of modern environmentalism focuses on. It focuses on one word, one concept: externalities. Externalities are those things which are by-products of an individual's or a group's actions and which are not borne by that individual or that group. When the actions of a series of groups become the actions of states, which become the actions of nations and which become the actions of continents and there is no single collective responsibility, then we have systemic failure. That was what Hardin recognised in 1968, that is what Rachel Carson recognised half a decade earlier with a treatise called ‘Silent Spring', and that is what came to pass with the gradual erosion and depletion of the ozone layer. That ozone layer is part of our protective shield. It shields us from the sun's rays, it allows our crops to grow and it protects many parts of the way in which the natural planet functions. Our actions taken collectively, not with collective malice but with collective indifference, were leading inexorably to not just depletion but collapse of the earth's protective ozone layer. In that context, these bill being debated cognately are part of the global response, not just the Australian response, to dealing with the problem of depleted ozone. Fundamentally, at their best these bills are about making an investment not for us but for our children and for their children so that the legacy we bequeath is not a worse world but an improvement in the quality of life without the trade-off of destroying the very incubator in which they live. Essentially, the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 amends the Ozone Protection Act 1989. It introduces new controls for substances that have detrimental impacts on the atmosphere. They are, firstly, ozone depleting substances-those which through collective use and the effluxion of time destroy the ozone layer-and, secondly, synthetic greenhouse gases which are used as alternatives to ozone depleting substances. One of the great dangers we have is the very simple notion of robbing Peter to pay Paul if we try to solve one problem by creating a problem in another area, albeit inadvertently. These controls are introduced for the purposes of implementing Australia's obligations to minimise the consumption and emission of ozone under the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I want to address these concerns in three phases: firstly, to understand a little of the background to these bills; secondly, to understand their importance; and, thirdly, to examine some of the core provisions which they enshrine. Looking at the background, what we see is that ozone depletion is a global problem, but it also provides perhaps the pre-eminent example of international cooperation to tackle an international problem. It is a significant problem, not just globally but in particular for Australia, because of the specific damage to that portion of the ozone layer which overreaches Australia. The causes of this significant ozone loss over Australia, particularly over southern Australia and the polar regions, have been the growing levels of ozone depleting substances in the upper atmosphere, known as the stratosphere. The 1989 Montreal protocol has provided the framework for Australia's response to ozone depletion, and it has provided the framework for an international response. The previous steady rate of increase in the global atmospheric concentration of ozone depleting substances has slowed significantly in recent years. Scientists attribute this to adherence to the bans in the Montreal protocol. It is a successful example of an international agreement acting in the collective interest. In that context, global measures are seen to be having an effect. Critically, as a result of the decision to introduce this, there has been a great growth in alternative technology. It is a classic example of sustainability driving innovation. We forget sometimes when we look at the status quo of the world that we are incredibly innovative. When we resist the alternatives and stay with the old ways, we are often taking a more inefficient path. As a result of the Montreal protocol and the obligations we imposed upon ourselves, there are now many alternatives to ozone depleting substances. What has happened in Australia is that we have phased out chlorofluorocarbons for general use. Only very small amounts are now used for essential purposes. Halons and methyl chloroform have also been phased out. In addition to that, in the phase-out process other compounds-hydrochlorofluorocarbons-were substituted for CFC use. Importantly, these have a much lower ozone depleting potential than CFCs, although there is still damage and we must work to provide alternatives and to eliminate these substances. What is interesting is the overview. Emissions are being held at 1989 levels. Not only is the phase-out target of 2020 on track; Australia is ahead of its obligation in its targets for its 2020 goals. One of the things I talked about earlier day was the notion of a national sustainability initiative-a broad based initiative which covered the four spheres of water, land and biodiversity, human settlements and energy, and the atmosphere. What we see here is one example of setting a generational goal, setting a regime in place to achieve it and estabnational lishing a protocol and a policy program by which we set out to pursue physical changes in the way in which we live. That is a process that I believe we need to take part in nation, to set across all of those core sectors so that we have goals for ozone depletion, for a reduction in land clearing and for estaband lishing in Australia total wooded biomassor the total volume of wood that is alive and growing in our fields. It is so that we have goals for the flow of water and for the absolute cessation of all ocean outfalls by the year 2025. The target of 2020 for the elimination of CFCs and other ozone depleting substances from the Australian landscape is one which I believe is a single example of what should be a national, broad based approach to the creation of a national sustainability initiative. These bills have two primary purposes: firstly, to ensure that Australia has a truly national regulatory scheme for the management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacement and, secondly, to ensure that Australia-both for reasons of self-interest and good citizenship-remains an international leader on action to preserve the earth's ozone layer. Their two purposes are, firstly, to ensure that we have an adequate, real, hard, practical regulatory scheme and, secondly, to show that we are playing our part, doing our bit and holding up our responsibilities. In that context, what we find when looking at the importance of the bills is that they set out to address the issue of ozone depleting subtostances and synthetic greenhouse gases. I also want to mention, very simply, some of the core provisions of the bill. Item 4 amends paragraph 3(a) of the act to replace the reference to the ‘convention and the protocol' with the ‘Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol' so as to clarify our interagreements. Perhaps most significantly, item 6 amends the bill to incorporate two objectives into the act: it institutes controls on the manufacture, import, export and as a use of substitute greenhouse gases to give effect to Australia's obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; it promotes, argues for and establishes the framework for responsible use and management of all ozone-depleting substances controlled under the act so as to minimise their impact on the atmosphere. There are a lot of elements but, essentially, it puts in place a harder, more advanced regime than that which already exists for ozone-depleting substances and substitute greenhouse gas substances. I want to step back for a moment and return to Garrett Hardin. Looking back at the work he completed almost 35 years ago, we see that his thesis was spot-on. It recognised that our actions, which may be taken inadvertently and collectively, could lead to a negative and, in some cases, potentially catastrophic effect either at the local level or at the global level. These bills are an acknowledgment of Garrett Hardin's work, which recognised that we can take steps and transform the way we do business, and we can take steps and have an impact on our global environment. We are already seeing a dramatic change in the way in which we deal with ozone. There is more to be done, whether it is in our greenhouse gas emissions, in our water use or in our land clearance. These are things which my generation has a responsibility to take up, and we are doing that. We do it with a passion, with a commitment and with fervour. I am delighted to commend these bills to the House, and I wish them safe passage.",124
63,Mr MARTYN EVANS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is the case that the world has recently started to confront a number of global problems in relation to the environment, and the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and related bills deal with two of the most serious of those problems. The first one I want to refer to is the challenge of the depletion of the ozone layer by a number of chemicals which have been entering the atmosphere-such as the chlorofluorocarbons-and which have been released over recent decades as a result of industrial processes. This has brought about the well known problem of the ozone hole. It has increased the amount of ultraviolet radiation which can strike the earth, particularly in Australia where we are most vulnerable to the problem. The challenge has been met by the Montreal protocol, although the history of that has been somewhat chequered since the world first started to address this issue. Indeed, worth noting that, at the time this problem was first identified by scientists, it was the United States government which first wanted to address it seriously. The European Community to some extent resisted that challenge by the United States and actually took some time to come on board to meet that global challenge and agree to a worldwide measure that would seek to prevent those chemicals from escaping into the atmosphere and depleting the ozone layer. Finally, a protocol was adopted which has had a relatively significant impact on the escape of those chemicals into the atmosphere and which has been fairly much accepted by the worldwide community. It has had some degree of success by way of scientific and verifiable measure. It has had a degree of achievement, although it will be many years-from recent reports, I understand probably up to 50 years-before we can declare victory and move on from that particular challenge and see the ozone hole repaired. As is the case with many of these environmental challenges, it is relatively easy to release these compounds into the atmosphere, into the water or into the soil, but it is quite difficult to see those chemicals degraded and removed from the global environment. Of course, that is especially the case with many of these chlorofluorocarbons and related compounds. They are long-lived compounds in the environment and they take some time to break down, whereas they readily mop up ozone and easily remove ozone from the atmosphere. Their deleterious impact on the environment is quite quick. It is much harder to take them out of the equation that it is to put them into the equation. So we will have to wait a little longer for the cure to take effect. However, the fact that the world has been able to agree, in the relatively short space of a decade or so, on a global protocol which it is has had reasonable success in being enforced throughout the world at a practical level in terms of stopping the trade in those chemicals, stopping the production of those chemicals and seeing the introduction of a reasonable range of substitute chemicals and industrial practices which will prevent the release of those chemicals, as other members have indicated in this evening's debate, I think is a great credit to global organisation. It is also great credit to global science in identifying the problem in the first place, in cooperating on a collaborative basis, in tracking the problem, in bringing it to the attention of the world's governments, in seeing the problem through in terms of enforcement, cooperation, and prevention of the manufacture and distribution of those chemicals, in seeing the outcomes through and, finally, we hope, in tracking the gradual reduction of the ozone depletion in the atmosphere and in measuring the gradual and total closure of the hole. However, more than that, because that is just a final symptom of the ozone depletion, I suspect there will be total resolution of the problem in a decades-long time frame, and we are well on track to that. That relates quite well to the other aspect of this legislation, which is of course greenhouse, but the two are more interrelated than that. They are both global problems which relate not only to the global science community, the global diplomatic community and governmental communities but also to the global industrial communities and the global economic community, because all these things are interrelated in how we deal with them. Just as the world comes to grips with environmental problems at this level, to some extent we also fortunately have the infrastructure at the scientific and diplomatic levels to begin to grapple with these problems. I would certainly accept, as many other members would as well, that we do not have the infrastructure at the scientific, diplomatic and governmental levels to resolve them as such, but we certainly-fortunately-have the infrastructure at those levels to at least make a reasonable effort to come to grips with them. That is why we have before us, in another context, treaties such as Kyoto as well as those like the Montreal protocol. As a member of the treaties committee of this parliaa ment, I have seen many other related documents which at least show the world's governments are making a serious effort to deal with all these interrelated efforts. Of course, many of the same chemicals which we have had to deal with at an industrial and scientific level in relation to the ozone problem are also greenhouse gases, and vice versa: those gases which contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect also contribute to ozone depletion. It is very much the case that we need to bring some serious science to dealing with both of these problems. But it is not only science that needs to be brought to bear when dealing with them. It was the case with ozone and it is much more so the case with greenhouse that we need to apply much more than just science, although science of course is fundamental to identifying and quantifying the problem and looking for solutions. But economics and statistics are also vital parts of this fundamental equation. It is those to which I would like to turn the balance of my remarks this evening and when I later resume my remarks. As is the case with the greenhouse issues, with which this bill also deals, statistics and economics will play a fundamental role because the greenhouse question, like the ozone question, will be played out over a very long period of time. Part of the reason for that is a statistical and economic question. While it is the case that ozone-depleting chemicals are in the atmosphere for a long period of time doing the damage that they do to the ozone layer, it is also the case that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases-there are at least six major greenhouse gases that we have identified, along with water vapour, that do serious harm to our planet in the context of greenhouse and accumulating heat-remain in the atmosphere for a long time. We need to look at the statistical base of how those who are looking at the greenhouse issue have done their calculations because this will have a significant policy impact on how parliaments and governments deal with this issue. I would like to draw the parliament's attention to the work of Ian Castles and David Henderson because it is very relevant to the way in which we approach this. Ian Castles is well known to Australians and Australian government officials. He is now at the National Centre for Development Studies at the Australian National University but he was formerly the head of Australia's national office of statistics, the ABS. David Henderson, who is now at the Westminster Business School in the UK, was formerly the Chief Economist of the OECD. So both gentlemen are very substantial figures in the statistical world with very significant backgrounds. Both have been recently doing some work on the way in which we might look at the background calculations which underlie the Special report on emissions scenarios. This report was put together by the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was the base work for the Kyoto treaty-the base work on which everyone looks at climate change. So it is very important that when you look forward at the projections-the temperature change projections which underlie all the work on Kyoto, greenhouse and temperature change-you look at the underlying statistical work which projects forward the CO2 increases in the atmosphere and you look at the underlying statistical work which supports it. These two gentlemen have done a lot of work on that and they have looked at the economics and the statistics which underlie that basic work. While I and my colleagues on this side of the House could not be described in any way as greenhouse sceptics-far from it-I take the view very strongly, as do my colleagues, that we face a very serious challenge from greenhouse and global warming on planet earth; that climate change, like ozone before it, is the most serious environmental challenge that the planet faces at the moment; and that the Kyoto treaty is one of the best ways we have of addressing that challenge. So now we have to look forward and see how we can address these issues in a very serious and stable way. To do that we have to look very closely at the emissions scenarios that underpin these challenges. We need to be certain that the statistical bases and the projections which underlie them are as sound as they possibly can be so that, when we make projections about the temperature changes and we ask governments, populations and voters to make sacrifices and changes to the underlying economy that supports our own country and other people's economic bases, we do it in a way that we have confidence in and that we can ask them to have confidence in. To do that, we have to be very certain of the projections we make. That is a very important basis for the work which Henderson and Castles have done and which I would like to share with the House in this context. The work they have put forward is very fundamental to this. In fact, some of those projections do cast doubt on the basis of the work of the IPCC. Debate interrupted. NA",127
64,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.00 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Child Abuse",129
65,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in support of a constituent of mine in Newcastle, Mr Chris Gorman, who is in the chamber tonight. Chris has achieved something extraordinary. He has sufficiently overcome the emotional distress caused by his personal experience as an innocent victim of child abuse to publish a moving book outlining his life's journey. This journey winds through a childhood characterised by poverty, neglect, grief and sexual abuse, fortunately towards stronger friendships and more loving family relationships but most importantly toward some understanding, acceptance and self-respect. But the journey has been a troubled one, punctuated by depression, mood swings, emotional breakdowns and relationship failures-nothing atypical for those people traumatised in their youth by abuse. Chris was born in Limerick, Ireland, just after the end of World War II. When he was four, his mother died and although he had a father it would be reasonable to say his father was an ever-absent one who basically abandoned his parenting role. What Chris may not have understood is that the loss of one's mother before the age of 12 is considered to be the trauma most likely to leave a legacy of emotional scarring. But of course there was more for Chris. His book is titled A Hole in My Heart-a hole and an emptiness created by the loss of his mother at such a tender age, a hole that has taken a long time to fill. Chris experienced sexual abuse from the age of seven in both the home of relatives and an orphanage-that is, in places where children should be both secure and safe. Last week everyone's ABC televised a Welsh movie based on child abuse. It was truly a moving and revealing exposition of the reality of child abuse. At the end of that movie a silent statement was shown telling that, of the 52 council areas in the UK, 42 were undergoing investigations into the abuse of children in council institutions, a terrible indictment on the caring role of government in Britain, which is of course where Chris grew up. Regrettably the movie was shown just before midnight, not really a popular viewing time-but then child abuse is not really a popular subject, although it is experienced by so many. In his 20s, Chris had what he sees now as the good fortune to come to Australia, where his new life began. Although he would be grateful to call Australia home, his time here has had its struggles too, particularly with his emotional health and the health of his relationships. But Chris was eventually assisted by a TAFE counsellor after enrolling at TAFE to take on the challenge of improving his literacy and numeracy skills, which were affected by his disjointed education and the troubled times of his youth. I must say this illustrates the wonderful spin-offs for students of all ages provided through our public education institutions. In his book, Chris urges others who may have had the same experiences as he has had to take up counselling opportunities. Although counselling has allowed Chris to confront his past and his suffering at the hands of adults, it has also brought to life again-as it does-the dreadful memories of domination and brutalisation by adults, betrayal by adults who should have listened and believed him and helped him, the lack of trust he then had for others, the fear of rejection living with him forever and the guilt and shame no child should ever feel. I quote from Chris's book. He says: I've had to grapple this ‘hole in my heart' for most of my life-in writing this book I am closing the hole and look toward a healthier futurewith clarity, strength and pride. I commend Chris on his achievement in publishing this book, which I am told is a sellout, and for his attempts to help others. Chris's challenge now is perhaps the most difficult one, and that is to find ways to let go. Recently in Australia we marked Child Abuse Week and poverty week. Chris's story reminds us that Australian children are still risk of abuse and neglect, and it is to our shame that we as a nation have not sufficiently responded to protect our most vulnerable and to help those who have been harmed to recover and heal. Having spent three decades in schools as a teacher and principal, I know the pain and grief when a child discloses their experiences of abuse. We must as a nation make more concerted efforts to protect our children and ensure their early lives are ones of wonder and joy instead of struggle and harm. I therefore recommend to the House Labor's plan for a national commissioner for children and young people and encourage the government to do more to protect our children wherever they live and whatever their circumstances. Dunkley Electorate",130
66,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to raise two issues which are very important to the community that I represent. I notice my friend and colleague the member for Flinders is here-it is the ‘peninsula combo' talking tonight about issues of concern to both of our constituencies. The first relates to a public meeting I convened on 21 October to discuss the Scoresby Freeway and the great disappointment, strong resentment and disbelief among the community that I represent that the Bracks government has so blatantly turned its back on the interests of our community and has moved to impose tolls on what is the most critical infrastructure project supporting our region. One clear message came out of the public meeting. It is a message I rise tonight to convey not only to the Bracks state government but, frankly, to anybody who will get behind this project: build what we were promised, Mr Bracks. Build the Scoresby Freeway as it was promised. Build it completely. Build it without tolls, and overturn your backflip deat cision on the imposition of tolls on this freeway project. There is no question, as we heard at the public meeting, that the Bracks government could do that. It could honour its promise if it chose to. But it has chosen not to. The Bracks government has chosen to support other road projects in the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne. The community that I represent wants to know what it has done wrong. What has it done wrong? It is a hard working community, a community that, within the Scoresby corridor, boasts about one in 20 jobs in our country, where there is more than the population of Adelaide using this facility. Why are we not deserving of an arterial ring-road, the same as those in the northern and western suburbs have received, which has driven investment, improved opportunities and improved lifestyle for those people? There is a veritable wagon wheel of freeway infrastructure in the north and the west of Melbourne, and the community that I represent just wants a fair go, to make sure we can put our best foot forward into the future. What was unexpected at that public meeting was the strong sentiment amongst those present that our local councils had let us down. They referred to the work of Knox City Council and Maroondah City Council in taking the fight up to the Bracks government and saying that this is a project that matters to them. The call from our meeting, unanimously passed on a motion for action from the floor, was for: ... Frankston City Council, Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, Casey City Council, Kingston City Council and the City of Greater Dandenong to stand up for the interests of their communities vigorously advocate a toll-free Scoresby Freeway ... That is what Knox City Council have done. That is what is happening further up the corridor. Why are we not getting that representation in our community? There is the capacity to implement that project, and I will talk more at another time about that project and why it is so crucial to the community that I represent. The second issue that I would like to briefly mention tonight is Point Nepean. My first suggestion is that a lot of people need to settle down for a moment and have a look at what is really going on. Point Nepean is fine. The point is secure. The point is being gifted to the state government as part of the national park. That seems to be lost in some of the rhetoric that is going on, as if that tip of the peninsula-a magnificent part of our region-is somehow not going to be part of the national park. That is wrong. That is part of the 209 hectares the Commonwealth has offered to gift to the state government. My only regret is not testing the bona fides of the state government to properly manage that point and to properly invest in that area when we see from reports from expert advisory councils to the state government that Parks Victoria queries its own capabilities and its own resources to carry out these kinds of tasks. You would have seen a couple of weeks ago in Monday's Age Parks Victoria itself being part of an inquiry into the agency's performance capabilities and responsibilities and publicly conceding that it is not equipped and resourced to properly manage and conserve many of the built heritage assets under its control. Parks Victoria itself identified its core competencies as being the management of nature conservation areas. So even though 209 or 210 hectares may be within their competence, is the commitment there from the state governand ment? I think that should be tested before any of that land is handed over to make sure they will invest in the habitat restoration and regeneration of native species in that area. What is clear from Parks Victoria's own evidence to Heritage Victoria is that it is not capable of managing the 65 heritage listed buildings in the area that has gone out for public tender. That is why the community consortium has brought to the table the resources and the expertise to make sure those heritage conservation values that are crucial in that area are currently before the government and the preferred tenderer to look at managing into the future. It is crucial that those resources and those capabilities be provided, and Parks Victoria says it has neither. It has neither the resources nor the competence, according to its own testimony. (Time expired) Telstra",131
67,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"I bring to the attention of the House an item of business that appears in the Telstra annual general meeting 2003 notice of meetingscheduled to take place this Friday, 14 November. This item should be of serious concern to all members of the House. Specifically I refer to item 3 of the said notice at page 7, which reads in part as follows: In accordance with Article 16 of the constitution and ASC Listing Rule 10.17 at present, the maximum aggregate amount payable annually as fees to non-executive directors of the Company ... is fixed at A$1,150,000 (per annum). Item 3 goes on to say: The maximum aggregate fees payable to directors were last increased at the 1999 AGM from A$750,000 to A$1,150,000 per annum. The proposal before the meeting is to increase the maximum aggregate amount of directors' fees by A$170,000 to A$1,320,000 per annum. The reasons given for the increase in directors' fees as stated in this item are: The increased limit: - Has regard to the increased size, nature and complexity of the Company's operations and the increased responsibilities of the Board; and - Compares favourably with the fees of directors of companies of comparable size. What a hide the directors of Telstra possess! What audacity of the board to move this item whilst Telstra flounders in a sea of miserable corporate performance! The so-called captains of industry on the board of directors of Telstra should be flogged then sacked for their pathetic mismanagement and abysmal market performance over the past 12 months, not rewarded with a $170,000 per annum pay increase for incompetence. This pay increase is a huge remuneration hike of 14.78 per cent in one year. The 1999 increase from $750,000 to $1,150,000-an increase of $400,000 per annum-was an increase of over 53 per cent. I cite the News Interactive media statement titled ‘Telstra reappoints Ziggy', dated 14 October 2003, which states: The announcementto reappoint Ziggy Switkowski as Chief Executivecomes on the eve of Telstra's full-year result, which analysts forecast to slump 17 per cent to around $3.03 billion, following the $965 million writedown of its Reach joint venture in Asia made in February. … … Analysts said there were concerns over the telco's ability to hold onto its current 45 per cent the Australian mobiles market, as number two player Optus continues to increase its user numbers. The media release notes: Dr Switkowski's basic remuneration package was $1.46 million, but he could earn an extra 75 per cent in performance bonuses. What we have here is the clearest example yet of why Telstra cannot afford to be sold into majority private interests. This item represents the most flagrant breaches of any performance standard imaginable. The foreshadowed Telstra dividend of 12c in my view exists only in preparation for the now failed sale of Telstra, as the Senate so wisely rejected. As I said of Sydney airport, I now say of Telstra. Yet again we have the government fattening the lamb for the kill. Again we see the unsustainable and unjustified issuance of grossly inflated dividend distributions coupled with totally unjustifiable board of director remuneration packages totally out of proportion to what really matters-the performance of the corporation. I say again: the directors of Telstra should be flogged then sacked. They are losers. Under their stewardship, Telstra is a loser. I join with the shadow minister for communications, Lindsay Tanner, and call on the Howard government to exercise its 51 per cent and controlling interest to vote against item 3 next Friday at the forthcoming annual general meeting of Telstra. Flinders Electorate: Point Nepean",132
68,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to follow on from the points raised by my friend and colleague the member for Dunkley in relation to the future and protection and enhancement of the land at Point … Nepean within my electorate of Flinders. I want to do two things: firstly, I want to talk share of about what we have fought for and what we have won; and, secondly, I want to expose the fraud which the state government is putting about in relation to its own proposal. In terms of what we have fought for, 18 months ago as a new member, along with the community reference group which was to be formed, I set out to achieve three things. Firstly, we set out to achieve a ban on residential housing on Point Nepean for all time-and it is a difficult environment to do that. We see in Victoria that the Victorian government is proposing that parts of Devilbend, parts of Royal Park, parts of the Royal Showgrounds and parts of Kew Cottages will all be subdivided for private residential housing. All those plans remain on the table, but at Point Nepean we have a guarantee for all time that that land will not be subdivided and that there will be no private housing. The only threat to that is at page 8 of the state's proposal, where for Police Point, the single most sensitive area, it proposes holiday homes. The state proposes holiday homes on Police Point, at page 8. This state plan for a park is a fraud. It is a fraud because in writing the state proposes holiday homes on the most sensitive part and it is utterly consistent with what it is doing with Royal Park, the Royal Showgrounds, Devilbend and Kew Cottages. The second thing we set out to achieve was to keep the entire area in 100 per cent public ownership, and we have done that. We have kept the entire area in 100 per cent public ownership. Again, unlike the current Victorian government proposals for selling and subdividing parts of Royal Park, the Royal Showgrounds, Kew Cottages and Devilbend. The third thing we set out to do was to protect and to utilise the 65 heritage buildings which form the old Norris Barracks. There are 65 largely empty buildings and they are there. You can either let them lie and become derelict over time-as the state has done with the one building it has had responsibility for, Pearce Barracks, which has been in state hands for 15 years and is a hulking wreck and a singular disgrace-or you can use those buildings for education, heritage and community purposes and accommodation. That was the plan of the community reference group. That was the plan which we set out to achieve. That was the plan, incidentally, of the Victorian National Parks Association, the National Trust and the state government. That is what we have achieved in an extraordinary and tremendous breakthrough. The Australian Maritime College is looking at setting up a marine and maritime precinct which would include marine education, heritage with the attraction of the maritime museum of Victoria, a space for the Bunnerong elders, the Dolphin Research Institute and other community groups which are likely to come on board. To create a centre for all Victorians for all time which is environmental and which hopefully over time will rival those great international oceanographic institutes, such as Wood's Hole and Cape Cod, the Bodega Marine Laboratory and the Scripps Institute in California-that is what we set out to achieve and that is what we have achieved. All those people associated with the community reference group who have pursued that vision with a passion, who have been criticised by many who have other alternative agendas, deserve the most extraordinary credit because they have put in hours and hours as volunteers. There are many good people on all sides of the debate. There are many good people and I respect and value their work, but what we have achieved are three things: no residential housing, unlike the state's proposal at page 8 of their plan for holiday homes on Police Point; 100 per cent public ownership; and a marine and maritime centre with the bringing of the Australian Maritime College as the lead agency. I want to deal very briefly with the state's hypocrisy. At page 8 of their proposal, in talking about a park, they call for holiday homes and for 230 beds-commercial accommodation-including a three-star hotel. (Time expired)",133
69,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I should indicate to the House that consistent with an agreement reached by the whips it is my proposal to allow the remaining part of the adjournment debate to go to opposition members. Cunningham, Mr Ted",135
70,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I pay tribute to the late Ted Cunningham, a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia. Edward Joseph Cunningham-or Ted, as he was known universally to all in the Australian Labor Party-passed away in Perth yesterday after a relatively short but serious ness. Our sympathies go to his wife, Julie. Ted was the Labor member for Balga from March 1988 and, through boundary and name changes, was for almost 13 years variously the Labor member for Balga, Marangaroo and Girrawheen until his retirement in February 2001. Ted was very well regarded in his community as a good local member of parliament. I first met Ted in the late 1970s, but it during the mid-1980s that my close professional and personal dealings with Ted began, first as State Secretary of the Western Australian branch of the ALP and then as the member for Perth. Ted had almost 50 years of aggregate membership of the ALP, firstly in Queensland and then in New South Wales and Western Australia, where he arrived in the late 1960s or early 1970s. That he was both universally liked and respected in the Western Australian branch of the party was reflected by his elected membership of the party's Administrative Committee, as a state executive and state conference delegate of long standing and culminating in his recent award of life membership of the Western Australian branch of the ALP. He was both chairman of the state parliamentary Labor Party and Labor's Legislative Assembly whip during his time in the state parliament. Ted was very Labor, he was very loyal, he was a very early Labor devotee of Chinese restaurants as a place for camaraderie and fundraising, and he was a great editor of legendary local newspapers and newsletters. In very many respects I believe his most enduring attribute was always bringing on young people, both as party activists and as potential parliamentary members. The Western Australian branch of the Labor Party lost a lot of history yesterday. We lost a good colleague and a good friend and illfor many of us things will not be quite the same again. I extend my condolences and best wishes to Julie. Cunningham, Mr Ted",135
71,Mr EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"Cowan) (9.22 p.m.)The death of Ted Cunningham-a long standing ALP member who was presented with his life membership by the Premier, Geoff Gallop, just a few days ago-is a time of sadness. Ted was elected to the seat of Balga in was 1988. He was elected at a by-election following the resignation of Brian Burke. Ted had a reputation as a hard working parish pump member and he built a strong following of supporters-supporters who were kind enough, for instance, to support his annual St Patrick's Day dinner, always at a Chinese restaurant, always with the proverbial raffle. Indeed, I think Ted could have claimed to be the original king of chook raffles. The seat changed to Marangaroo and then became Girrawheen. I went to see Ted in hospital on Saturday, along with the former Premier, Brian Burke. Ted was asleep for much of the time of our visit. When he woke briefly and recognised Brian his eyes lit up and we enjoyed a brief time of old and warm friendships. Ted is survived by his wife, Julie, who has been his constant companion during his illness. Ted and I shared common boundaries within our respective state and federal electorates. Indeed, Ted gave me considerable support when I stood for Cowan and, no doubt, my victory was in part due to the standing he had in the community and the networks he had built during his time as member. Ted's very close friend, Batong Pham, was by his side when he passed away. Batong was one of the many whom Ted had helped during his time as a member and that relationship developed into a strong and enduring friendship. As the chair of the Western Australian federal parliamentary Labor Party I extend on behalf of all federal members and senators our deepest sympathy to Julie. Our thoughts go out to her during this difficult and sad time. Cunningham, Mr Ted",135
72,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with great sorrow that I join my two colleagues from Western Australia, and I am sure the three of us speak for the entirety of the Western Australian federal delegation as we farewell a dear friend, a great Labor Party worker, a very good member of parliament indeed, and the devoted husband of Julie. It is particularly to Julie that I want to extend my sympathies tonight. She will miss Ted enormously, as we all will. It will be one of the profound regrets of my life that, unlike the honourable member who has just spoken, I was not able to see him in his last few days. I had heard, after the presentation by the Premier of Ted's well-deserved life membership of the Labor Party, that he still had some time left, but that information was wrong. I regret very much not being able to share a final few moments with a man who has been a close friend of mine since the late 1960s when he first arrived in Western Australia and immediately joined the Labor Party. We were up to all sorts of shenanigans in those days-all entirely legal. I can recollect Ted being one of the founding organisers of an outfit called the John Curtin Labor Club. It was a marvellous opportunity for dining, a marvellous opportunity to listen to good speakers, and a wonderful opportunity to make mischief-those were all the sorts of opportunities that Ted enjoyed enormously in his life. I do not think Ted in those days would ever have anticipated being a member of parliament, because Ted was a very humble man. Those sorts of jobs went to other people. His role in life, as mentioned by previous speakers, was to bring young people on in the political system and to give every encouragement to those he thought might succeed and make a serious contribution to public life through the Labor Party. But, in fact, loyalty was its own reward and he secured endorsement ultimately for parliament and pursued a very credible career in the legislative assembly. Not many people rise to be Chief Whip; not many people rise to chair their parliamentary Labor Party-he did both. In addition to the service at the centre there was service at the local level. He was an extraordinarily active local member. The member for Perth mentioned a couple of the publications in which he was involved. I remember the Marangaroo Leader, which changed the first element of its title through his political career but not the second. I once asked him if there was a priest or a pastor or a rector who had failed to gain entry into the Marangaroo Leader and he said ‘No'-he covered them all. Apart from being a devoted member of the Labor Party, he was a devoted Christian and a very strong Catholic. Therefore we can be assured that his faith sustained him in his last moments, but he was sustained as well by his good friends, many of whom, unlike me, did make it to his bedside. He was sustained too in the knowledge that he lived a good life and a life of great achievement in my home state of Western Australia. Along with my colleagues I extend my sympathy to Julie and to the community of which he became part. Through Julie he became a very intense participant in the Filipino community (2) and in the broader Asian community in his various constituencies. He was a goodhearted soul and we are going to miss him terribly. Question agreed to.

Whilst the ATO information about employer non-compliance assessments and broad based research conducted high level of employer compliance. No estimate of the number of employees bankruptcy or receivership is available. in relation to superannuation contributions liquidation. The ATO is only empowered to act to when an employer has failed to make the end of the relevant financial year. The debt has not crystallised.
