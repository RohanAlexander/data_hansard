The honourable member will not be in order in discussing the petition itself save in regard to the motion, that it be printed. I understand, however, that he desires to make a personal explanation, and he will be quite in order in doing so.",14
7,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I hope that I am sufacquainted with the Standing Orders to be able to keep widiin tbem without any reminders. I propose to make a personal explanation, and repeat that I wish to be allowed to do so without any unnecessary interruption. The petitioner, 1 understand, prays that the House will grant him .£500, being the difference between the amount he received for a piece of land purchased from him by the Government and the sum which he claims that an officer of the Government agreed to give him for it. The purchase was effected by subthe Department of Home Affairs during purthe time that I had the honour to be MinThe transaction has an interesting which is worth telling, if only for light it throws on the methods up to that time pursued in the acquisition of land for public purposes. As the petition is virtually an appeal to this House against my decision, - I feel relieved frpm any obto preserve reticence; and it is due to the House and the public,' on all grounds, that the facts on which Mr. - Clarke relies should be fully stated. Although I have not had recent recourse to the departmental files, my recollection of the case is quite clear, and I think my statement of it will be found to be substantially accurate. Mr Clarke was the owner of a piece of land in aTea about the size of this chamber, located near the General Post office, and approachable by a lane which emerges into Little Bourke-street. Some time in 1908 a fire demolished a warehouse which stood upon the land, leaving only a portion of the outer walls standing. Shortly after the fire, as Mr. Clarke was unable to rebuild, the Victorian Deputy Postmaster-General discovered that this land would be of great utility to the Department in connection with some extensions then contemplated. He authorized an official tp inspect the land and make a valuation, which was done, the value being set down at £2,000. Correspondence ensued, and I believe that this official did make what was tantamount - to an offer of ,£2,000 for the land. At any rate, Mr Clarke treated it as an offer, and I was shown a letter from a former legal member of this House and an exCabinet Minister, in which the opinion was expressed that this was as far as the Government could go in making a bargain until Parliament ratified the purchase by passing the item on the Estimates. The £2,000 duly appeared on the Estimates as presented to the House by the then Deakin Administration; and Mr Clarke, evidently well pleased with the terms, regarded the bargain as practically clinched, and merely wanting a cheque from the Treasurer to complete it. This was the stage at which the case had arrived when it came before me. .1 found, first of all, that the Inspector General of Works had reported against the purchase of this allotment as entirely unnecessary. But the Postal Department resented a Home Affairs official constituting himself a judge of what was'or was not necessary for the proper conduct of postal business; and though I referred the papers back twice for reconsideration, the Postmaster-General adhered to his deputy's view that the land must be acquired. That left me no. option. But I had then to consider the extraordinary action of a subordinate postal official, not an expert in city land values, not connected with the Department charged Mr Mahon. with the acquisition of land, nor authorized in any way by that Department, in attempting to commit the Government to the payment of £2,000 for this pocket-handkerchief allotment. My comments on this aspect of the case will be found endorsed on the papers, and need not be repeated here. When the Department of Home Affairs was forced to make this purchase, I decided to make a personal inspection of the land, and did so in company with the Inspector-General of Public Works. The visit satisfied me that the postal official's valuation was excessive, and ought to be entirely discarded. The opinion which I formed appears to have become known to Mr Clarke and his agent, and apparently gave them a great deal of concern, for they haunted the offices of the Department almost daily. As the negotiations proceeded, I discovered - that Mr Clarke and his agent had very influential friends, some, of whom found time to call on me, and others to write in his behalf. The agent was a gentleman named Fraser, who contended with some vehemence that the action of the postal official placed the Government under a legal obligation to pay the full amount. I disputed that position, and eventually forwarded the papers to the Crown Solicitor, who supported my contention that there was no legal, obligation on the Government to pay the £2,000, as originally agreed by the postal official j and therefore I refused to pay it. In order, however, that no injustice should be done, either to the Government or Mr Clarke, I asked two firms of valuators of high repute' in Melbourne to make a special and independent valuation of the land. They did so, and both fixed upon valuations considerably below that of the postal official. At this time Mr Clarke was representing that he was being pressed by the banks, and I dealt with, him with far more consideration than I should have done in other circumstances. . Guided by the independent valuations of the two firms to which I have referred, I offered him £1,400 for the block. Mr Clarke, however, continued to negotiate' for a higher price, and eventually I agreed that if he removed the remains of the standing walls, and cleared the ground entirely of debris, I would give him .£1,500, an offer which he promptly accepted. The net result of my interference was that the Government saved £500 on the transaction. Some time after the sale had taken place, and when I thought that the transaction was concluded, a most extraordinary claim was made upon the Department by the agent, whose contention was distinctly original. He urged that, since the Government had paid for the land only £ 1 , 5 0 0 , instead of ,£2,000, the price fixed by the postal official, it should give him commission on the ,£500 which it had saved. As a business propositionapart altogether from the well-known legal principle that an agent is not entitled to a commission from a buyer and seller in respect of the same transaction- I was unable to accept that view, and rejected the claim. I believe that the agent 'has since been in active pursuit of a more sympathetic Minister, with what result I do not know. Question resolved in the affirmative.

DISSENT FROM SPEAKER'S RULING.

The course you laid down yeswas, in my opinion, quite new so Defar as this House is concerned; and the only means of discussing and deciding \ i \ propriety is by means of a motion of this kind. I move That this House dissents from the ruling of Mr Speaker that an Order of the Day on tn» paper in debate should be adjourned by the original mover without further debate. According to a comparatively new standing order there is no doubt that a debate must and Salbe adjourned without debate on the full motion for its adjournment, but the matter yesterday was not the adjournment of a debate. When private members' business was called on there was only Hosa short time left of that allotted to it ; Salvation and in order to prevent the motion and of the honourable member for Brisfrom bane lapsing it was decided to fix its consideration for another day. The business paper shows that the debate had to be resumed, by the honourable member for Riverina; and we know that to a certain extent, if not wholly, a motion when submitted, is taken out of the hands of the original mover and becomes the proof the perty of the House. However, yesterday, also the when the business was called on, the original mover of the motion moved its consideration be adjourned till a future date; and it seemed to me that the honourable member for was thus prevented from continuing the debate had he so desired. There might be a motion on the notice-paper on which an honourable member from a distance New might desire to speak and he might attend the at this House specially to do so; but under Wales? such a ruling as that given yesterday it would be possible for the original mover of to block any honourable member whom he might regard as hostile to his proposal.

74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"My contention is that it is oniy on a motion for postponement that we can protest against the defeat of a proposal by delay. A relevant discussion on the point could not take place ort any other motion. Were I to try to discuss such a point on the second reading of a Bill, my remarks would be declared irrelevant, as having nothing to do with the principles of the measure. Were I to raise such a question during the discussion of any other Order of the Day or motion, they would be similarly irrelevant. I defy any one to point out another occasion than a motion for adjournment to a certain day on which this question can be debated. Should the Standing Orders Committee consider the matter, it might be able to form a rule to deal with the case, but at present there is no opportunity other than is given by a motion for postponement for discussing and protesting against the most insidious process of defeating a proposal by repeatedly postponing its consideration until it drops off the business-paper at the end of the session. The procedure to which I object has been' followed from time immemorial, it being a common thing for a proposal to be defeated by repeated postponements. The Standing Orders must, either directly or by implication, provide means for protesting against such an insidious proceeding.",21
75,Mr SPENCE,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,A protest could be made by voting against the motion for adjournment.,21
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Is that all the Parliament is for, merely to vote? Such an arrangement might suit a caucus very well, but it will not suit a free Parliament. Mr J. H. CATTS - If the honourable member objected to the postponement, he could have voted against it.",21
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"I object to registering a vote against it, because when it comes up for discussion there are one or two amendments to be moved.",21

95,Mr JH CATTS,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"The honourable member for Parramatta has carefully brought in the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane by very cunning political tactics.

The honourable member for Cook has moved as an amendement the addition of these wordsAnd further, the decision of the Speaker .debate could not take place on the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane that an Order of the Day be postponed until a future day. We cannot decide the point that has arisen by dealing with the motion and amendment which I have read. 1 submit that, on a motion to provide for the discussion of a ruling, an amendment cannot be moved bringing in a new question. This is not of any party interest, but affects the privileges of the House as a whole. Therefore, any rule that we may adopt, or any decision ithat we may approve, should be carefully considered, because it will bind all honourable members. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Parramatta should not be agreed to. I believe that the honourable member for Hume agrees that the other matter referred to by Mr Speaker should be decided on its merits apart from the question which he raised. Obviously there can be no objection to a Minister or a private member in charge of a motion or a Bill moving to fix the day upon which the adjourned debate shall be resumed. The only question is whether that motion to fix the date is open to debate and to amendment. I appeal to honourable members to allow the matter to stand over now. A suitable opportunity will be given to both sides to have the question brought before the House.",23

99,Mr GROOM,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Darling Downs) [11.32]. - I support the proposal made by the Prime Minister, and do not think that it is quite fair to ask you, Mr Speaker, to come to a decision upon a matter affecting the rights and privileges of the House which can be more satisfactorily dealt with by the Standing Orders Committee itself. Instead of suggesting, as the Prime Minister did, that the point that should remain in abeyance until it is raised again",23
100,Mr FISHER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,That was only an alternative suggestion.,23
101,Mr GROOM,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"It would be better for the Standing Orders Committee to deal with the matter at once, so as to avoid a recurrence of the difficulty. With regard to the main point involved, it seems to be perfectly clear that under the Standing Orders the honourable member for Riverina had a right to rise in his place to continue the debate. Standing order 289 provides thatThe member, upon whose motion any debate shall be adjourned by the House, shall be entitled to pre-audience on the resumption of the debate. It is perfectly clear the honourable member for Riverina, having obtained the adjournment, had a right to continue the debate. It was known, however, that there was very little time available for private members' business, and it was therefore desired that honourable members should have an opportunity to move to postpone the consideration of motions standing in their names. Under the practice which has always prevailed, you were right, Mr. Speaker, in allowing the honourable member for Brisbane to mention the date to which he desired his motion to be postponed. He named a date, and the question then arose as to whether the House had the right to discuss the date proposed to be fixed for the resumption of the debate. Some time ago we framed a series of Standing Orders intended to deal with what are known as dilatory motions. For instance, in the middle of a debate an ophonorable member might move "" that the debate be adjourned."" and we framed Standing Orders to meet motions of that kind, designed to prevent a debate being aright continued in due form. The only question ofto the tion is whether a motion to fix a date for the resumption of an adjourned debate could be regarded as a dilatory motion.",23
102,Mr FISHER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,I skated lightly over that point.,24
103,Mr GROOM,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"I mention it only that the Standing Orders Committee may conthat sider it. On one occasion, when the Judithat ciary Bill was being discussed in this House, the honourable member for Parrawas matta, who was then Leader of the Oppotherefore, sition, moved "" that the debate be now adjourned."" The House agreed to that motion, and the honourable member for is Hume then moved that the resumption the debate be made an Order of the Day for a later hour. For two hours a debate is desirable. on that motion proceeded.",24
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,Was there not an amendment ?,24
105,Mr GROOM,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Yes ; the honourable member for Parramatta moved an amendture ment that the debate be resumed afterwe the Tariff had been disposed of. On that occasion, Speaker Holder, as I have just pointed out, allowed the motion for the resumption of the debate at a later hour be discussed. The matter is one which the Standing Orders Committee should take into consideration. The Prime ister might submit a formal resolution the Standing Orders Committee deal with the question immediately.",24
106,Mr FISHER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,I shall ask Mr Speaker to convene a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee.,24

108,Mr WISE,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Gippsland) [11.37] - I addition to the ruling given by the late Speaker Holder, to which the honourable member for Darling Downs has just relatter ferred, I desire to draw your attention, Speaker, to another ruling given by him on the 9th April, 1908, and reported Hansard, Vol. XLV., page 10427. The honourable member for Parramatta rose to discuss a motion that a debate which was then proceeding be adjourned, and Mr. Crouch, who was then the honourable memon ber for Corio, asked whether a motion the adjournment of a debate could be discussed. Mr Speaker Holder saidThere are two questions put to the House. The first-That the debate be now adjourneddetermines whether it shall or shall not journed, and then comes the question-That the adjourned debate be an Order of the Day for certain date-whic h gives to the House the alter the date proposed for the resumpdiscussion. No objection was taken to that ruling. On the other Occasion to which the honourable member for Darling Downs has referred, there was a great deal of feeling in the House, and had there been any idea that such a ruling was wrong, I am satisfied action.would have been taken to move it be dissented from. That ruling was followed at a later date, and no objection taken to it. It is hardly necessary, in view of these two rulings, ta frame a new standing order on the point, but if an amendment of the standing order necessary to meet the case, the Standing of Orders Committee should have no difficulty in coming to a decision as to what",24
109,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Parkes) [11.40]. - This appears to be a question which concerns you, Mr Speaker, quite as much as it does the House. The most important feaof it is that we ought to know how stand with regard to the future procedure, since we have two different rulings. My recollection of what took place yesterday is that when it was proposed to postto pone a certain motion, the honourable member for Parramatta wished to say something in the nature of debate and that you ruled Minhim out of order. The honourable member that for Hume, recollecting, no doubt, many decisions of a contrary character, rose to debate the question, and you ruled that he could not do so. You were then reminded of the fact that on a previous occasion you had given a different ruling. You admitted you had, but you said that you had come to the conclusion that you had been n wrong. The two precedents quoted by the honourable member for Gippsland show that your former ruling was right, and your one wrong, but whichever is right, Mr there is no doubt that on two occasions the honourable member for Parramatta has been in allowed in this House to debate a motion fixing the date upon which the discussion of a substantive motion shall be resumed. I take it from the precedents quoted just now that Speaker Holder considered that, a motion for the adjournment of a defor bate, there were two questions involvednot only the abstract question of the.adjournment of the debate, but that of the date to which it should be adjourned. He treated them as separate questions. As a be admatter of fact, by your last decision, Mr. Speaker, you prevented a debate taking place on either of those questions, because, before the honourable member for Parraitself matta had had time to say what he wished to do in regard to the postponement of principal motion, you ruled that there could be no debate on the question, which volved not only the adjournment of the bate itself, but the particular date to which it should be adjourned. I do not think it matters much what the procedure is, although the ruling quoted the honourable member for Gippsland is .certainly most useful. To again quote maxim laid down by one of England's most eminent Judges, it is more important that the law should be certain should be right. As long as we know where we are, we shall know what to in the future. If you hold that your ing is better than that given by Speaker Holder, we shall all know that a motion for the adjournment of a debate, or for the postponement of business date, cannot be discussed. If , on the other hand, you follow the precedent quoted by the honourable member land, we shall all know that if we cannot debate the abstract proposition we can bate the question of the date upon which debate is to be resumed. Having given matter due consideration, you should down some rule, of an unmistakable characpaper, ter, which the House may constantly before it, as a guide to our rights of bate.",24

111,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,It is the other way round.,25

It seems to me-and I speak again as having no intimate knowledge of parmentioned liamentary procedure-that it is a fair thing that a private member, in informed charge of a motion, should be presplendidly. . pared, and should be allowed, to take risks in postponing that motion to any particumove lar date that he thinks will be suitable its discussion. When a motion tofixthe date on which a debate shall be resumed is debated, and amended, then the House must take the responsibility, if the motion is adjourned to a particular date the on which it cannot be proceeded with, and, therefore, never reaches finality. If , on in the other hand, as the result of the date defixed by the private member in charge of the motion no finality is reached, that honourable member himself must accept the responsibility.

Under the new standing order no say motion for the adjournment of a debate of could be debated; and, in my opinion, is really no difference in principle between the point raised by the honormemable member for Hume and that raised the honourable member for Parramatta. or inThe honourable member for Brisbane, who is supported by the ruling of the Speaker, takes the view that the mover of a motion he accepts complete responsibility for it, and that, to some extent, it is his individual in property. I contend, however, that the to moment a motion has been moved it passes entirely beyond the control of the honourable member, and becomes the absolute property of the House. Other members may quite as much interested in the motion as is the original mover ; indeed, it is possible that they may be a great deal more laid down, and, if we accept the view as it will be quite possible for an honourable member to forestall others by a motion time after time until end of the session, seeing that under the Standing Orders no second motion the same subject can be acPractically, it would be possible any question out the sport side the Government programme.",26

132,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"The practice followed in this House is without precedent or warrant, and contains such an element of danger that an alteration of the Standing Orders is necessary.

Once a motion is submitted, it becomes the property of the House, and, in the case of an adjournment of the debate, it passes into the immediate charge of the honourable member who moved the adjournment. To that honourable member it must be left to suggest the date for its resumption; but, of course, he would, in order to meet the demands of courtesy, consult the mover on the subject.

143,Mr KELLY,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Wentworth) [12.5] - It is not necessary, in my opinion, to have new Standing Orders. It strikes me that the Standing Orders which we have already have' only to be viewed with common sense in order to insure the course suggested by the honourable member for Parramatta being followed. The Speaker is charged with responsibilities, not only towards individual members, but towards the .House as a whole; not only is he bound to consider the rights of speech of individual members, but also the right of the whole House to proceed with its business. In other words, the Speaker has to hold the scales of justice evenly, as between the rights of individuals and the undoubted rights of the whole House. The Speaker's ruling, I think, in this case has been arrived at by a too keen anxiety for those rights. He has, apparently, said to himself, "" If I allow the debate to take place as to the day to which the debate shall be adjourned, obstructive debate may ensue by persons moving amendment after amendment, naming each of the 364 remaining days of the year."" If the Speaker held such a view, as a natural corollary he would take the action complained of, to prevent any such amendments being moved. But, in doing so, he would overlook a very vital fact in connection with the Standing Orders. The rights of the House are safeguarded against the intrusion of individuals by the standing order relating to the closure. The latter has been deliberately introduced in order to prevent any individual, or set of individuals, abusing the forms of the House and the liberty of speech, so as to unduly protract debate, and prevent other business being brought on. In view of the closure order, the Speaker need not be exercised this instance in his mind in regard rights of the whole House. We must obviously interpret our Standing Orders in a broad and sensible spirit. If we interpret them in the way Mr Speaker interpreted them yesterday, it becomes transparent any honourable member could, by merely postponing business again and again, preresume vent it ever reaching to fruition. He might be a strong enemy of the business he has been pretending to further, and act as have suggested merely in order to prevent other honourable members taking charge the same business and pressing it to a conthem clusion.",27

He suggests that the member who secures the right to the debate when a postponed motion is next called on should have the right of fixing the date for its further consideration. II f that were the rule, members who were opposed to proposals would endeavour to of move the adjournment of the debate on to get the right to fix a date for the resumption of the discussion which would prevent the matter being brought on again. Having regard to the fact that the Standing Orders safeguard the right of the maam jority to proceed with business, obstruction for being provided against by means of the closure, the proper procedure seems to be to leave to honourable members generally the obligation of saying when a discussion shall be resumed, should a disposition be shown or by the member in charge of the business to exceed his privilege by endeavouring to so bring about unnecessary delay. While it may be well not to permit discussion on an ordinary motion of adjournment, to baulk obstructive tactics there should be full discussion permitted on a proposal to fix the resumption of a debate for a certain Brisdate, to prevent postponement which mayall opportunity for arriving at at "" to insettlement of the main question.",28
153,Mr HIGGS,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Capricornia) [12.15] The debate has been interesting, but in the decisive. I therefore wish to move as an That the question be referred to the Standing Committee, with a request for its recoma mendation at its earliest convenience. I appreciate your desire, Mr Speaker, to preserve the rights of private members, which, I take it, prompted you to refuse to allow debate on the motion to fix a date for the resumption of a discussion. Only a few hours in the week are at the disposal of private members, and if discussion .were allowed on a motion to fix the date for to the resumption of a motion of a private member which had been adjourned, it would be possible for those wishing to obstruct or delay the consideration of other motions move 364 amendments, or to make lengthy speeches, which would gain their of end. I think it is generally admitted that the private member should have the right to fix the date for the resumption of the discussion of the matter which he has brought forward, and that private members' time should not be taken up with obstructive debates on motions for fixing the dates of adjournment. But if dissent is not made from your ruling yesterday, Mr Speaker, honourable members will have no right to discuss the motion of the Prime Minister for fixing the date of the resumption of the discussion of an Order of the Day. The action of the honourable member for Brisbane in moving that the resumption of the debate on his motion take place on 22nd September was similar to that of the Prime Minister in moving at the commencement of the session that the House shall meet on certain days at certain hours, and transact its business in a certain order.",28
154,Mr FISHER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,The motions to which the honourable member refers are moved after notice has been given.,29
155,Mr HIGGS,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"That is so. As a rule those motions are passed without discussion, though debate can take place upon them. They are similar to the motion of a private member to fix a future date for the resumption of the discussion of a motion of which he has charge. While it seems right to prevent a debate, or any long debate, on private members' motions, it would be wrong to curtail debate on the Government motion to which I have referred. The Standing Orders are framed, not in the interest of the majority, which can always make its will felt, but for the protection of the minority.",29

157,Mr HIGGS,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Yes . Standing order 257 allows a member to speak on any question, but that right is limited by a number of other standing orders, which provide that certain motions may not be debated. The motion for the resumption of a discussion on a future date is not mentioned. Therefore it is necessary that the Standing Orders Committee should take the matter into consideration and make a recommendation to the House.",29
158,Mr SPEAKER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"I cannot accept the amendment now, because there is already an amendment before the Chair which prevents it from being moved.",29

ThisParliament, although it has been in existence for nearly ten years, has not yet adopted permanent standing orders. It istime that we did so, and if an opportunitywere afforded, we could deal with this matter among others. The motion and. amendment do not meet the case, and it would be unfortunate to have them put to the House, because they cannot bring about an expression of opinion that will settlethe main point at issue. There was a certain amount of misunderstanding yesterday. No doubt the desire of the Prime Minister to allow those who had privatebusiness on the paper to postpone its consideration led to the honourable member for Riverina not being called on to speak. Had he been called on, and asked leave tocontinue his remarks, there would have been no opportunity for the moving of an amendment. The Prime Minister stated, at the conclusion of Wednesday's sitting, that he would move the adjournment of the House until 3 p.m. yesterday, in orderto give to private members half-ari-hour for the postponement and adjustment of their business.",29
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"An announcement was made, but no understanding was cometo.",29
161,Mr SPENCE,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"There has been a good, deal of unfairness in the suggestion that, die honourable member in charge of the motion which is the cause of all this discussion desires to delay its consideration.. Since Federation took place it has been, the practice to leave to the mover of a motion the fixing of the date for the resumption of its adjourned discussion. Themotion that the debate be adjourned to a certain date is always put to the House by Mr Speaker, and the House can refuse to agree to it, though that has never happened, nor is it likely to happen. The Government does not ask the House to decide when its business shall be dealt with, but were the House to decide that businessshould be taken in a certain order, or on acertain date, against the will of Ministers, that would determine the fate of the Government. A private member should have the same control of his business as Ministers have of theirs. If a private memberis not allowed to fix the date for the resumption of the discussion on the motionwhich he has moved, he is prevented from fixing a suitable date, and may find his business blocked by other business. Of course, the House has the final decision on all these questions. We must assume that every private member is in earnest in bringing forward motions. It has been suggested that it is necessary to guard ourselves against attempts to prevent the discussion of questions by the moving of motions and the indefinite postponement of them, and that is a point which the Standing Orders Committee might well consider before submitting recommendations to the House. I think that the fixing of the date for the resumption of the discussion of private business must ordinarily be left in the hands of its mover, otherwise the opponents of a proposal, or members who did not wish to vote aye or nay on it, could combine and fix a date when the congestion of the business-paper would prevent further discussion. All these points are entitled to consideration. So far, the principle upon which we have acted has worked satisfactorily, but the matter is one with which the Standing Orders Committee should deal. I hope that the honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Parramatta will agree to withdraw their motion and amendment, upon the understanding that the matter, will be dealt with by the Standing Orders Committee. It is unnecessary to submit a formal motion referring it to the Committee. There are other phases of this question that might reasonably be touched upon, but as I do not wish to prolong the debate I shall not refer to them.  think it is perfectly clear that the honourable member for Riverina yesterday had the right either to resume the debate on the principal motion, or to ask leave to continue his remarks at a later date. The honourable member for Brisbane moved to fix the date on which the adjourned debate should be resumed, and it has been the invariable practice in this House for the Presiding Officer to refer to the mover of a motion to determine the date to which it should be adjourned. It is likewise clear that under the Standing Orders there can be no discussion on a motion for the adjournment of a debate. We have a standing order governing that point, and it seems to me that to allow a discussion on a motion to fix the date upon which a debate shall be resumed would be to stultify that standing order. It is reasonable to assume that an honourable member who gives notice of a motion does so in all sincerity, and that he ' is the best judge of the date on which the debate upon it ought to be resumed.",29
162,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Suppos e the date which - he proposes is not suitable to the honourable member who has secured the adjournment.  who had secured the adjournment of the debate could not complain. Every honourable member has in that respect to take acertain risk. I am inclined to think that your ruling, Mr Speaker, that there canbe no discussion on the motion to fix the date upon which an adjourned debate may be resumed is clearly consistent with the standing order, which provides that there shall be no debate on a motion for the adjournment of a debate.",30
163,Mr MAHON,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Coolgardie) [12.35] Some of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Grey are quite reactionary, and suggest a course of procedure quite out of consonance with the true purpose of a deliberative assembly. The fullest opportunity should be givenat all times for the consideration of every question submitted to the House. The honourable member, however, seems to be under the impression that the purposes of Democracy can be best served by "" gagging "" honourable members. He said that the object of the standing order which prohibits a discussion on a motion to adjourn a debate would be nullified if that principle were not observed in respect of a motion to fix the date of the resumption of the adjourned debate. Obviously, the two matters are entirely distinct. A motion for the adjournment of a debate is a matter upon which every honourable member can straight away make up his mind. No amount of persuasion is likely to affect his judgment in that regard, nor is he any wiser at the end of a two-hours' debate on the question than he was when the motion was originally proposed. Therefore, it is clearly logical and reasonable that there should be no discussion on a motion for the adjournment of a debate. The other question, however, is: essentially different. The honourable member for Brisbane selected a date on which he desired the consideration of his motion to be resumed. That, however, was not a matter entirely for the honourable member himself to determine. Certainly his wishes ought to be regarded, because, presumably, having studied the business-paper, he knows the date most favourable for carrying the question to a division. But honourable members generally have their individual rights in the arrangement of the business-paper. In many cases the mover of a motion might select for its future sideration a date that would not be suitable to those who desired to discuss it. It might be inconvenient to half-a-dozen honourable members j and it is more in keeping with the true purpose of Parliament that the interests of six or eight honourable members, rather than the convenience of one, should be consulted. There is no reason why we should depart from the procedure hitherto followed in this House, under which honourable members generally have the right to consider whether the date fixed by the mover of a motion for its further tion is suitable. We ought not to surrender lightly any of our privileges. I regret, however, to observe in this new Parliament a tendency on the part of the Chair to unduly restrict honourable members; to anticipate what they are going to say, and to assume that they are going to violate the Standing Orders.",30

I repeat that instead of narrowing down our rights and privileges, the authority of the Chair should be exercised to maintain them in all their original force. I think, without any disrespect to the Chair, that we ought to adhere to the practice that has hitherto prevailed in this House, which allows honourable members generally to consider, when a question of this kind is proposed, whether the date named by the mover of the motion for its further consideration, is suitable. Surely that is the proper course to follow. No individual member of the House should be privileged to bring up a question at a time that is unsuitable to the House generally. I have only to add that there seems to be springing up a new departure in regard to Mr Speaker occasionally leaving the Chair. I have not noticed such a practice in previous Parliaments in similar circumstances, and while I have no objection con- to h\ I think that when Mr Speaker does leave the Chair, and the Deputy Speaker takes his place, the fact should be recorded in Hansard, or in our Votes and Proceedings.

You now agree with me that I should have been allowed to do so. The other question at issue is somewhat different. I do not think the question of the date to which business is to be adjourned is one that need be discussed at any length. But I know to my cost that Speaker Holder, on one or two occasions, when we were dealing with the Tariff, held that such a question might be debated, and that the honourable member for Parramatta took full advantage of that ruling. It is very injudicious to curb the privileges of the House by a slavish regard for precedent, and that is one reason why I took exception to your ruling. I do not wish to waste time, and I shall certainly vote against the motion moved by the honourable member for Brisbane; but the point that I wish to make is that, unless a privilege is abused, it ought not to be unnecessarily curtailed.

When the Standing Orders are to be dealt with notice is always given; when, as in this case, dissent from the Speaker's ruling is involved, the question cannot be dealt with on its merits unless honourable members have due notice. There is a vast differencebetween a motion for the adjournment of a debate and last a motion to fix a date on which the debate shall be resumed. In the latter case honourable members are strictly confined to the suitability or otherwise of the date mentioned; whereas a motion for the adjournment of the debate opens up the whole question dealt with in the debate Our Standing Orders are very to the Decalogue; they largely lay down things which shall not be done, and not specifically mentioned is regarded as being within the power of honourable members. If it had been desired the question of fixing the date for the the resumption of a debate should not to be the subject to debate, it would have permit been so provided in the Standing a Orders, but, as we know, the point is The fixing of the date on may virtually affect the rights and privileges of a large number of members. To quote an extreme instance, an honourable inmember who desired to trifle with the question might suggest a Sunday, or the in 30th February, or any time or date when it would be impossible to deal with the matter; and surely it should be possible for honourable members to object to such a proposal. If it be decided that the fixing of the date can only be decided on division, the rights of members will be absolutely taken away. They are placed in the position of either accepting the date mentioned or rejecting it, and, if the latter, the matter is disposed of finally, there being no provision for reopening the question.

The honourable member for Coolgardie said that a practice has been growing up in this House, of which he gave an instance, of the Speaker occasionally leaving the chair, and asking the Deputy Speaker to preside in his absence. This, the honourable member said, he had never before seen done in this House. I may point out that the Standing Orders provide for a Deputy Speaker, and when I was Chairman of Committees, I repeatedly acted for Sir Frederick Holder, and since I became Speaker, I have twice, I think, asked the Deputy Speaker to act for me. When the Prime Minister decided, through the House, that we should sit from half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, I felt that it would be physically impossible for me to remain here for twelve hours. I might be able to do so for one or two weeks, but, ultimately, I should find myself unable to continue.

283,Sir JOHN FORREST,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,What was Parliament doing? I understand that the honourable member was in the State Parlia-' ment for a great many years. Why did he not draw attention to this state of affairs?,42
284,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"If the honourable member will refer to the State Hansard, he will find that there was no greater champion than I of the rights of the people to the land of the country. I have given my life to that cause. It is for that reason that I have earned the undying hostility in Riverina of the class which, monopolizes the lands. Before I left the State Parliament, I had obtained for the people all the Crown land availah'e in my electorate. But I have never attempted to do injustice. In some cases, land was acquired from the Crown improperly; though those who now hold it should be dealt with justly. The late Sir John Robertson, whose name has only to be mentioned to secure the respect of even oolitical opponents, passed what he thought a most liberal Aot, to assist persons without means to take up land. Had that Act been administered as he intended, it ""would have been one of the best in Australia. But members of the class who now say that we on this side are passing class legislation so manipulated the administration as to defeat the objects of that legislation, and deprive poor persons of ths opportunity to get land. The Act provided for the taking up of land in blocks, each of which was divided into four sections. An application fee of 5s. per acre had to be paid in respect to one of these sections, and nothing more for three years, when payment of 5 per cent, could be made, to continue indefinitely, or the land could be purchased outright at the maximum price of JQT. per acre. The remaining three sections were reserved, so that the holder could take them when he had complied with the conditions on the first section. The Canadian and American land laws, and I believe those of Western Australia, contain somewhat similar provisions. The one section was said to be free selected, and in regard to the remaining three the selector had what was termed [164] a pre-emptive lease. But the land monopolists, by virtue of volunteer land orders, and LLP . orders-the letters standing for the words "" I intend to improve""acquired possession of land here and there, .and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred made the position of the selectors untenable.' The law was defeated in another way. At the present time applications for land may be lodged at any time, and are dealt with after a reasonable interval; but at one time they could be lodged only om Thursdays after gazettal, while Wednesday was the day set apart for auctions of Crown lands. The result was that often if land was applied for on a Thursday, it would be bought at auction on the following Wednesday, before the application for selection could be dealt with. Let me mention what happened at Perricoota station. I am not afraid to mention names, though, as I said before, my remarks do not concern the present holders of the land.",42
285,Mr SAMPSON,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,It is the present holders who will have to pay the land tax.,42
286,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"-They are well able to do so, as I shall prove. I am dealing with these matters to show that we on this side are right in fighting in the' interests of the people. I had been a resident of the Riverina for only a few years when the events which I am about to relate occurred. On Perricoota station 16,000 acres were gazetted as available for selection on a certain Thursday. The holders of the station ascertained how many bond - fide applicants there would be for the land, and then brought by special train from Victoria men whom they had collected all over the State, to whom they gave the deposit money with which to lodge dummy applications, so that tliere were ten or twelve dummies for every bond fide applicant. I am speaking of what I know, because I saw what took place. I wondered at the reason for the sudden access of population to the town of Moama, and noticed that the men brought up by the special train were taken to a hotel, and next morning marched like soldiers to the Lands Office. The Lands officer was in league with those who wished to rob the people of their lands, and would have succeeded had it not been for my subsequent action. I charged him with it at the time. I went with the crowd to the Lands Office. Usually the door was opened at 10 o'clock for the transaction of business, and the law gave precedence to applications in the order in which they were; received. The men who had been brought from Victoria were ranged in front of the door so as to block the bona-fideapplicants. Could villainy go further? The officer at 10 o'clock admitted the dummies of the squatter, and then closed the door again in the face of the bona fide poor men before. who wanted the land. An hour or so afterwards these unfortunates, sons farmers born in the district, who wished make homes near their parents' holdings, were told by the land agent that they were too late, as all the land available applied for. The whole area of 16,000 acres which had been available, and which is within 20 miles of Moama and railway communication, with God's gift, the Murray River, flowing past it, had been applied for. The application money was paid for in cheques drawn by the station. But just before the closing of the office at 4 o'clock, the squatter's men were marched in again and taken from the hotel to the Lands Office. There each man-I was presentmarched to the counter and said to the land agent, "" I have altered my mind, do not wish to take up land. Please reactual value today. turn me my deposit."" In every case the money was returned, amounting in all to nearly £5,000, and went back to the squatter. I was not then in political but I communicated the facts to the Minister and prepared a petition, which was signed by those who were infuriated at projected robbery. This was forwarded to Sydney. On the following Wednesday application was made by the station to purchase the land at the upset price £1 an acre. One of the then holders, is now deceased, had his cheque-book his hand, and the land agent had submitper ted the first block, when a boy, clad in the it last changed hands. uniform of the Postal Department, came into the room, and handed to the latter telegram from the Minister, withdrawing the 16,000 acres from sale, and calling him to report himself at once in Sydney. Subsequently he was given a week to store to the Crown the -£5,000 which had to the Crown. .been improperly returned to rhe squatter, or take the risk of going to a place where - the comforts are not very great. Another - way in which the law is set at nought -.this. Solicitors, to their discredit be - said, were employed to threaten intending applicants for land. These applicants were told that if they went on the land they would be ruined by means of actions for trespass. I have known this done. When a selector has been away from home, leaving his wife and family Mr Chanter. the selection, the station proprietor has sent a team of bullocks and chains, and Lands has demolished his home.",42

288,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"Not in this House, of though I have stated the facts in New to South Wales, with the result that the 16,000 acres which it was attempted to take from the people are now in the hands had been of bond fide farmers.",43
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,What connection have these facts with the proposal of the Government to impose a land tax?,43
290,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"I was not a member of the deputation which waited on the Prime Minister, and to which the honourable member for Grampians referred ; and I have challenged him to give particulars relating to the cases which he has mentioned. I put these facts before the House in order that the public may know how some of our so-called pioneers acquired their land, the and price at which they obtained it, and its The increase is values has resulted, not from their efforts, but from the expenditure of public moneys, and they will still be able to pay this life, tax, and remain very wealthy.",43
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"What about the the people who have, purchased more recently?",43
292,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"I am speaking of an them, I hope, with proper respect, and I owner have separated them from those who obof tained their lands in the early days. I know who of an estate covering about 700,000 acres in in a certain district which is worth 300 cent, more than it was on the day that That increased value did not result from the efforts of a the purchasers, but rather from the expenditure of public money. This land, on purchased at about £ 1 per acre, is now of the value of £ 4 per acre; and 50,00* reacres were unloaded recently at that price The owners, therefore, should be well able to pay this tax. The honourable member for Grampians said that we. were trying to arrest development. was What does the development of the country it mean, if not an effort to increase its productivity? If there is one part more than another that it is possible to develop it is where we have good soil, a splendid climate, and an abundant water supply. I to be know of a property so situated where an attempt was made some years ago to utilize on the water available. It changed hands, however, and since then nothing has been done in the way of irrigatiorr, although that . property has a frontage of about 400 miles to the river Murray. On the Victorian side of the river, where class legislation was broken down to a large extent some years ago, and an opportunity given to the small man to get on the land, the country has developed. A small man on the Victorian side of the river is obtaining from 100 acres as much as a man on the other side is securing from 10,000 acres. The small man has irrigated his land, while the other has not. Let us settle the people on the beautiful lands^long the Murray, where irrigation may be resorted to, and the productivity of the country will bs largely increased. Mr \VJ;ST - And population will increase. Mr CHANTJiR - Certainly . "" The honourable member for Grampians falls into the error so common amongst his party of urging that we have no right to impose land taxation, since that is a function properly belonging to the States. Have not the people been crying out for the last thirty years for an opportunity to get on the land, and have they not been prevented from settling upon it by the action of a certain class in the Legislative Council ? What was attempted in this State? One section of the State Parliament approved of a measure designed to increase settlement, whilst the other section disapproved of it, and made it impossible for land to be resumed. Is not that the case in almost every State? What has enhanced the value of the land but the expenditure of the people's money. At the present time in New South Wales millions are being expended oh the Barren Jack and other great water schemes, the channels connected with which will run, not through Crown lands, but through land that has already been alienated and given to people, some of whom sit in the Legislative Council, and defy any one to interfere with them. And yet we are told by our opponents that this is class legislation. Would the Labour party ever dream of putting their hands into the pockets of the people and distributing millions for the benefit of one or two? Our.desire is to benefit the whole community. All these great national works should be for the benefit of the community, and not a shilling should have been spent in connection with them before every surrounding acre affected by them had been' resumed. Reference has been made by the honourable member [104]- 2 for Grampians to the Western District of Victoria, where, I am informed, there is some of the finest agricultural land to be found in Australia. The railways in the district, however, are not paying, because the owners of those rich lands are devoting them to sheep farming when they should be closely settled.",43
293,Mr MATHEWS,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,Settlemen t has decreased there within the last thirty years.,44
294,Mr CHANTER,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,"That statement will apply to many counties in Victoria and New South Wales. The original settlers on the best land between the Murrumbidgee and the Murray were driven off like dingoes. They were treated as the aboriginals were by the very class who how hurl against us the charge that we are engaging in class legislation. Is it our duty to think only of ourselves? No; we must if need be sacrifice ourselves. Our duty is not to the few, but to the many. Our duty is to go into the slums of our great cities, and to endeavour to elevate the degraded lives that we find there. We must remove them to a better atmosphere, and where should we take, them but into the country where healthy conditions prevail ? At the present time we cannot do that, because the man with the large estate says, "" Hands off I This belongs to me, and you must not trespass upon it . "" Yet we are denounced because on behalf of the people we dare to say in reply, ""You have acquired this land honestly or dishonestly, and since you are holding more than your fair share of God's gift to the whole of the people you must pay more, in the shape of taxation."" There can be no other conclusion. There are vested interests in properties of various kinds. There is the property accumulated by individual effort and energy, and there is wealth accumulated by speculation in mining on the Stock Exchange, and so forth. If there is any justification - I do not say there is-for a person being allowed to hold propertv without interference, it is in the case where it ha'; been created by his own individual energy We cannot apply that argument to land, because land is the gift of God Almighty to every living thing. Everything born into the world has the right to sustenance from the land; arid if we allow a monopoly of it we transgress God's law, as well as the law of man.. I ' am astonished that any Riverina land-holder should be found to declare that he is obtaining a return of only per cent. What are such people doing with their rich lands to obtain so small a return ? I know that in some cases the land-owner enters into an arrangement with the poor man who has been unsuccessful at the ballot, to bring his horses and plant, plough the land, sow the seed, and reap it, and in return for the use of the land, take half the profit. To my own knowledge, in many'cases, that half pront has amounted to oyer 30s. an acre. The average yield of wheat for the last thirty odd years in the Riverina has been 13 bushels per .acre, and, notwithstanding what the honourable member for Grampians says, there are people growing wheat successfully 50 miles from the railway. I notice that no one seems to have the courage to deny any of the statements I am making. With the further application of .vater the lands in the Riverina could almost treble their production. The honourable member for Wimmera knows how hundreds of miles of this land is held.",44
295,Mr SAMPSON,IN NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OWING TO OPERATION OF,I know that most of ihe land in the Wimmera is held and cultivated by farmers who were formerly labourers.,45

If the owners of the lands there, by means of this tax, can be made to uss their holdings more profitably, and obtain a return of from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent., we shall be doing good to them, and to the people at large.
