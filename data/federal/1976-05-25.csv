We have been advised by the Management that if this report of the IAC is accepted by the Government then the Company of Martin Wells would have no alternative other than to sack 400 employees. The Government is well aware that unemployment is very high. If they accept this report, the Government would be rectly contributing to another 400 people being unemployment list. The very important point that must be brought to the attendon of the Government is that 80 per cent of the employees at Martin Wells, live within a 10 mile radius of the national factory. To find other employment in the area would be virtually impossible. Factories in this area, have a great turnover in staff. It should be noted that the housing population in this area is high due to the fact that Mt troyed Druitt Housing Commission is adjacent to the industrial loss, fire area. All factories in this area must be kept going to be in the regeneration best interest of the people of mass unemployment. 'We feel that it would be in the interest to note that employees have many years of service with this Company, and have obtained a high degree of skill manufacture of spectacle frames, which has led to this Com6. pany gaining world-wide recognition. We feel that adoption of the IAC Report would lower standards, conflicting with health requirements and that the higher influx of imported frames would only lead a higher degree of inflation and a further tralian public We deplore the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which will end the operation of the last Australian Manufacturer in the industry.

The humble petition of the undersigned citiput on the zens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That Australia is not well-endowed with natural forest areas only amounting to 4.5 per cent of the total land area. 2. That very little of this forested area, is reserved in parks, most of the remainder being directly (as State forests etc.) or indirectly (as Crown lands, over which forestry exercises timber extractionrights)under forestry Uke Martin Wells, do not control. 3. That most of this remainder is liable to be totally desby woodchip projects, due to soil erosion, nutrient damage to young saplings in artificial forest projects. and avoid serious social problems 4.

Immediately provide more funds into research for recycling of used packaged material. 3.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation sonal incomes whereby both the Australian and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his personal income taxes between States; (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job vary from State to State even when gross wages advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain in each State.

3,Mr BRYANT,MEDIBANK,"My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Health, refers to the mangling of Medibank. Will staff currently employed by the Health Insurance Commission have to remain at present levels, or more probably increase, to cope with the administrative burdens of recording each person's health the need for action in conserinsurance status, administering a cumbersome premium scheme and running both the present and proposed arrangements until the end of the year? Wdl the private funds have to increase staff to cope with their increased work load? Will the Department of Health have to administer some of the new scheme? As these are probabilities, how can the Government claim to be making savingsIncome Tax Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member is being argumentative. He may seek House information in his question and may do so of Australia respectfully forthwith.",22
4,Mr BRYANT,MEDIBANK,How then can the Governof perment claim to be making savings on the new Government Medibank arrangements?,22
5,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK,The modified Medibank proposals do not come into force until 1 October. We or her will not know what adjustments need to be made until it has been in operation for a period. If there would are to be any reductions in the staff of the Health were Insurance Commission appropriate steps will be records of income earned taken to ensure that nobody is unduly harmed. NA,22
6,Mr JULL,MEDIBANK,Has the Prime Minister seen reports that some left wing unions intend to mount a series of rolling strikes against the Government because of the changes to Medibank? Can he see any justification for this line of action and what is his reaction to it?,22
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MEDIBANK,"I have seen reports concerning this matter in today's Press. I would have thought that there would not be much chance of a great deal of support being gained for this purpose. The Government's proposals maintain the universality of Medibank, they maintain the principle of no means test and they confirm our principle of providing a degree of choice for as many people as possible right throughout the income scales. In addition, other proposals that are involved in these matters which the Minister mentioned in his statement and in a Press release he issued, make it quite plain that we wanted to establish circumstances where the general level of taxpayers would be providing a lesser subsidy to those who wish to insure themselves fbr intermediate or private ward treatment. One of the odd things I find is that some people are trying to support the view that the general run of taxpayers and levy payers under Medibank should be providing additional support to those who wish to insure for intermediate or private ward treatment. If that is the platform from which some left wing unions would seek to muster a cause I would hardly think it is a popular one with their own members. NA",22
8,Mr MARTIN,MEDIBANK,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Will the Government's Medibank proposals reintroduce a 2-class system of health care in Australia, whereby those above a certain income level will be forced into private health insurance schemes and the remainder left in Medibank? Will not the stigma attached to public ward patients re-emerge and will these people now find that they are forced back into second class status by this new hidden means test?",23
9,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK,"Le t me reply,firsdy,by saying: 'Rubbish!' Under the proposed scheme there will be no means test at the point of service. There will be no division. No Australian person will be forced out of Medibank. Even the highest income earner in Australia can take out a $300 a year package to cover himself and his family, and a single person can take out a $150 a year package. It is not designed to and it will not cause the divisions that the Australian Labor Party would like to see created in this community. What it does, firstly, is provide the widest ranging choice that any health scheme has ever offered the Australian people and, secondly, it identifies the charges for health care in this try. Nobody has a free meal in this country. What is more, so much has been said about a free health scheme that never existed. The taxpayers in this country have been paying for it. Those in the higher income levels will be paying closer to the cost of their health care under this proposal. Pensioners and people on the lowest incomes will be getting their health care free to them at the point of service. NA",23
10,Mr MCVEIGH,MEDIBANK,"I direct my question to the Minister for Health. Will all income earners be worse off in Queensland under the recently announced proposals in regard to Medibank near future. than they were prior to the advent of the Labor Party's Medibank when medical and hospital care in Queensland was provided free to all Queenslanders by the Bjelke-Petersen Government, free of a means test? (Opposition members interjecting).",23
11,Mr MCVEIGH,MEDIBANK,Do Opposition members want me to repeat the name Bjelke-Petersen? Will pubhc hospital patients and outpatients attending Queensland hospitals be able to attend these institutions under the new proposals free of any charge to themselves personally or to Medibank or to private insurance organisations? Will the cost of x-rays and pathology tests and costs of running mental hospitals be included in the new Medibank proposals? Do the proposals as announced require the approval of all State governments?,23
12,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK,"Queenslander s will enjoy the same wide ranging choices of the type of health cover that all other Australians will obtain. We are not discriminating against the Queenslanders. All Medibank patients in Queensland will, under the new proposals, have access to medical' and standard accommodation at no cost to themselves at the point of service. Those dependent on pensions and the lowest income earners will pay no levy for those services, and those on the higher incomes will have the choice of remaining in Medibank or taking out private insurance for themselves for intermediate or private ward accommodation with doctors of their choice. It is true that Queensland has had a free hospital scheme for inpatients and outpatients for some years but, as I said earlier, nothing is really free. The free hospital system in Queensland was brought in some years ago because Queensland gave that form of service a higher priority than, say, rail freights which have been very high in Queensland. But it is the counpeople who pay for the so-cailed free service. There will be no means test at the point of service. For those who are privately insured the Queensland Government will have therightto charge against the insurance fund the costs of accommodation in the hospital for x-rays and other hospital services. All public and private hospitals will continue to receive $16 a day as a subsidy towards the bed patient. The State mental hospitals are a matter of concern to the States and indeed for that matter to the Commonwealth Government. The Government will be discussing these and other possible changes to the heads of agreement with the State Ministers in the very NA",23
13,Mr BIRNEY,NEW SOUTH WALES HOSPITAL,"Has the Prime Minister seen the statement by the New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Stewart, describing the Commonwealth Government's proposal to increase intermediate and private ward charges as 'bushranger tactics' that New South Wales would not go along with? Is there any validity in these charges? What would be the impact of a refusal by New South Wales to go along with the increases?",24
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEW SOUTH WALES HOSPITAL,"If the New South Wales Government refused to enter into negotiations and to come to some agreement along the lines that were suggested in a letter from myself to all Premiers last week the result would be that the New South Wales Government would be putting itself in a posiuon of wanting to offer larger subsidies to the better off in the Australian community and to those who wished to insure for intermediate and private ward treatment. If that is the order of priority of the new New South Wales Government then so be it. But it is this Government's view that those who wish to insure for intermediate or private ward treatment should carry the major part of that responsibility themselves. The general level of taxpayers and those who pay the levy under Medibank should not be required to contribute substantial additional subsidies for that purpose. In New South Wales, as has been the case other States, as a result of the introduction Medibank, treatment in intermediate being charged at $20 a day and treatment in private wards at $30 a day. The proposal for discussion with Premiers-it was not put in any dogmatic sense, but was one for discussion-wa s that Mr URENthese charges ought to be increased to $40 and Treasurer. $60 a day respectively. It is worth noting that in used New South Wales, before the introduction of as thetoestimated Medibank, the charge for an intermediate bed was $4 a day more than the charge we are gross growth in incomeswhat now proposing; it was $44 a day. The suggestion Treasurer also state the most that the quite unrealistic charge of $20 a day for available for the rate of inflation an intermediate ward bed in a public hospital ought to be maintained is itself utterly unrealistic. The real cost is $90 to $ 100 in the major tal city hospitals. This, as I say, results in ation where the New South Wales Government is in fact suggesting that the taxpayers generally should be subsidising people who wish to insure for intermediate or pnvate ward beds to a much greater extent than would be the case under proposals of the present Government. From Mr Stewart's learned statement it would CHARGES appear that there are other consequences of the New South Wales position. The position of private hospitals would be made more difficult. To some degree the insurance rate might be lower, but an additional burden would be put on standard ward beds and on public hospitals generaUy. Again, that would come back to the taxpayer, who would have to foot the bill. So if Mr Stewart is putting a point of view that he wants to put an additional charge on taxpayers he is going the right way about it. This is an odd circumstance, since already the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, seems to have come to the understanding that it is beyond his capacity to pay for his election promises. TRANSFER OF INFORMATION: NA",24
15,Mr WALLIS,PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS,"I direct my question to the Minister for Health. What are the privacy impUcations of the continuous transfer of information between private health funds and Medibank and between the Taxation Office and the Health Insurance Commission, made necessary by the new 2-class universal system of health care?",24
16,Mr HUNT,PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS,"That is a very good question. I shaU give a detailed answer to it later. The Taxation Office never reveals information. We have referred a Bill relating to privacy to the Law Reform Commission. One of the terms of reference of the Commission is to examine ways and means of ensuring that the privacy of in individuals is preserved. We will be studying of measures that need to be taken to protect the wards is privacy of individuals.

17,Mr LYNCH,TAX INDEXATION,"The Honourable gentleman is capinow assuming a position of pristine purity in Opa situposition because never, as I recall during my period in the House, did his Party when in Government release the forward estimates which he is now seeking.

PORT OF GLADSTONE: QUARANTINE NA",29
22,Mr CARIGE,SERVICES,"I address my question to the Minister for Health. Is the Minister aware that nearly 400 ships enter the port of Gladstone in Queensland each year and yet the quarantine services operate only on a 9 a.m. days a week? Does this mean that neither ships nor their crews arriving, for example, on Friday are checked by quarantine officers till 9 a.m. on Monday? Does the Minister agree this situation poses a serious threat of the introduction of foreign diseases, both human and animal to Australia? Will trie Minister take urgent action to remedy this?",29
23,Mr HUNT,SERVICES,"I have seen reports mentioned by the honourable member Capricornia. My answer to his first question categorically no. Ships which have a berth to go assure to are cleared by quarantine and customs ensure ofncials on arrival at the berth, 7 days a week, hours a day. Ships which do not have a berth to work? go to anchor in the bay approximately 3 miles off-shore and are cleared as soon as possible quarantine and customs officials during normal working hours even though they may not be brought to berth for some days. No ships's sonnel or passengers are permitted ashore until customs and quarantine clearances have been lieve granted. I have checked with my department I am assured that this requirement is rigorouslygentleman enforced by the customs officers and officers of my department at Gladstone. There is no of this requirement having been contravened. Mr Morris-Have it incorporated in Hansard.",30
24,Mr HUNT,SERVICES,"I am sorry that the honourable member is not interested, but other honourable members may be interested. The suggestion crews are free to go ashore before clearance completely without foundation. I am sure that the nonourabie member for Capricornia will be pleased to be able to convey that information the people in his electorate who are very conIs cerned about the possible introduction of disand eases into this country that human and the animal populations. Mr Morris- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I require the Minister to table the docuintent ments from which he was quoting in answer to the question.",30

I can assure him that if the full details are prorecord vided the examination will be pursued. NA",30
32,Mr MARTYR,MEDIBANK,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I am sure that all honourable members are glad to see him looking so well and in that such sparkling form again. I ask: Has the is Treasurer seen recent Press reports that a number of trade union leaders are intending to undertake industrial action as a protest against to the changes which he announced to Medibank? the Treasurer concerned about these threats can he give the House any indication as to could affect both the their basis?,30
33,Mr LYNCH,MEDIBANK,"I have seen Press reports indicating that certain unions are apparently on taking upon themselves the process of industrial action against the changes which I announced in my economic statement in this House last Thursday. I believe that the union a leaders have demonstrated what can be described only as a completely irresponsible and politically motivated attitude. I remind the House, as my colleagues the Prime Minister and Minister for Health have done so well today, that the changes to Medibank retain the principle of universality, protect the position of low income earners and widen the field of choice available in the area of health care. Because the levy is linked to taxable income, those on the lowest incomes, of course, will pay no levy and those on moderate incomes will pay the levy only in accordance with their means although income earners remain entided to all the benefits of Medibank-that is, treatment and accommodation in public hospitals by doctors engaged by the hospitals and benefits at the present level medical expenses incurred outside hospitals. In short, as has been emphasised today, the arrangements made by the Government provide a measure of social justice whilst at the same time introducing a much needed area offinancialresponsibility. One fact remains, as my colleague the Minister for Health has made clear, and that is that Medibank must be paid for one way or another. NA",30
34,Mr LYNCH,TAX INDEXATION,"Mr Speaker, with the leave of the House I should like to take the opportunity to add to the response I gave a few moments ago to a question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader, I think, was asking for information both in the forward sense and in the retrospective sense. When I was sitting down I recalled that the Deputy Leader did ask me on what rate of inflation was the cost of tax indexation estimated at approximately $1,100m. That of course, as the honourable gentleman should be aware if he reads the statement made on Thursday last, is a retrospective calculation which goes from March of this year back to March of the previous year. Thefigureis 13 per cent and it does make allowance for indirect taxation. NA",31
35,Dr JF CAIRNS,INFLATION,"I ask a question of the Treasurer. Is it correct as reported by apparently expert analysts that the main purpose of the poluse icy of the Government is to force down real wages so that the economic recovery Government wants can take place? If so, by how much does the Treasurer think real wages forced down during the course of the next months?",31
36,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION,"The proposition that we have been putting in this House and before the cUiation and Arbitration Commission is that there is to be a reduction in the overall rate inflation this year then that reduction must take place with the acceptance by all members of Australian community of restraint in the wage and salary area. That has been made perfectly clear. The honourable member is well aware the need for greater productivity out of which there can come increasing shares and labour. He is also aware of the need to unlock the savings ratio which has been far too high in recent years. I would say to the honourable member that, far from the inference that he has made in his question, the real objective of this Government is to put value back into the wages for which people are now receiving. Too many members of the work force of this country, unfortunately for the honourable member, are now appreciating the absolute folly of wage increases which to them and their families have become Ulusory as the process of inflation induced by the honourable member and his colleagues has continued unchecked in recent years. NA",31
37,Mr GROOM,USE OF AUSTRALIAN PAPER,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Is he aware that the previous Government undertook to direct Government departments and instrumentaUties to use only Australian produced paper? Does he agree that whUst this policy has been carried out by the Government Printer it does not appear to have been foUowed by many sub-contract printers, nor by such instrumentalities as TransAustrauan AirUnes, Qantas Airways Ltd, the Australian National Line and the Australian Broadcasting Commission? TAA printed its last annual report on paper made in Wales and the ANL report was printed on Japanese paper. This has taken place at atimewhen Australia's paper production workers",31
38,Mr SPEAKER,USE OF AUSTRALIAN PAPER,Order! The honourable member may not give any more information.,31
39,Mr GROOM,USE OF AUSTRALIAN PAPER,"I will proceed immediately to the question. I ask the Prime Minister: Can the Government see the need to redirect all departments, instrumentaUties and sub-contractors to only Australian paper? If the answer is in the affirmative, will the Government issue such dithat the rections as a matter of urgency? will be Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The honourable 12 member has been assiduous in pressing the needs of his own electorate and his own State on these matters and I welcome his bringing these matters to the attention of the House. The ConGovernment does confirm the instruction that if has been issued in relation to its own of departments. That instruction will be reinforced. I will also ask my colleague, the Minister for Adthe ministrative Services, to approach Government instrumentalities of the kind the honourable member has mentioned to ascertain whether of they can exhibit a greater degree of'buy Australian' in the matter of printing reports and both to capital using paper. NA NA",31
40,Mr FRY,CANBERRA,"Will the Minister for the Capital Territory indicate whether he is considering the imposition of a nominated corporation on the people of the Australian Capital Territory to administer the City of Canbena? Is he about to relegate the so-called Legislative Assembly, which has been elected by the people of Canberra, to the role of an advisory body to the nominated corporation, which will then be free to inflict harsh and irresponsible decisions on the people of Canberra in the same way as the Government did in last week's mini-Budget?",32
41,Mr STALEY,CANBERRA,Pres s reports about these matters are inaccurate. The Government will soon be considering the question of some form of local authority for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. Until the Government has done so I have nothing to add. MEDIBANK: REPATRIATION NA,32
42,Mr BONNETT,PENSIONERS,"I address a question to the Minister for Repatriation. Not having had an opportunity to study completely the new Medibank system, I ask: WUl repatriation pensioners be disadvantaged in any way under the new system?",32
43,Mr NEWMAN,PENSIONERS,I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. He is well known for his deep interest in ex-service matters. When the Government decided on its Medibank plan it made special provision for those people who are beneficiaries under the Repatriation Act. That is to say that where a veteran is in receipt of full medical care by the Department of Repatriation,32
44,Dr KLUGMAN,PENSIONERS,Fu U medical treatment? Will you repeat that? FuU?,32
45,Mr NEWMAN,PENSIONERS,"Can the honourable member not hear? Yes, full. That includes war widows, people on 100 per cent general rates and so on. These veterans, if they are single, will not have pay the Medibank levy. Those who have dependants will pay 50 per cent of the Medibank levy. I can assure the honourable member for Herbert that in this way veterans are fully protected from the Medibank levy that has just been introduced. NA",32
46,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,IMMIGRATION FROM LEBANON,"I direct my question keeping to the Minister for Immigration. By way of ground I refer to the problems in Beirut. Is fact that the Minister has altered the classification of those people eligible to come here from Beirut and Lebanon since 7 April? If so, what alterations have taken place? Will the Minister be good enough to tell those people previously denied entry into Australia that they may now reapply?",32
47,Mr MACKELLAR,IMMIGRATION FROM LEBANON,"I am not sure of the date of the latest instructions in relation to the entry criteria for people coming out of Lebanon and seeking to come to Australia. However, I am able to tell the honourable member that the normal entry criteria for people who have managed to escape from the situation in Lebanon and who have made appUcation to come to Australia at one of the Australian posts surrounding that area of the world have been relaxed to the extent that the utmost priority is given to what are known as category A applicants that is dependent parents, husbands, wives and dependent children. Special attention is given to those applicants who meet the normal migration criteria and additionally those people who have some special relationship with residents of Australia and who have their own special compassionate circumstances. Their applications are received and sent to Canberra for assessment. In this way a number of people in the third category of compassionate circumstances have already entered Australia. Special instructions have been given to members of my Department both in and outside Australia to treat every appUcation with the utmost compassion and attention. We have strengthened our representation in the posts in Nicosia. With the very kind co-operation of the Netherlands Government we have put an officer into Damascus, operating from the Netherlands Embassy there. In aU ways we have endeavoured to help those people who have left the Lebanon and who have sought to come to Australia. Obviously we cannot accept everyone who wishes to come here but we are making special arrangements particularly in respect of category A people. Even if they do not have passports, for instance, we are acceptto ing identity documents and we are carrying out health checks after the people arrive in Australia. We are keeping a very close watch on the situation there. Everyone on both sides of the House, I am quite certain, has the utmost sympathy for those people whose lives have been devastated by the internal situation which at present obtains in the Lebanon. The Government has made special efforts to assist as much as possible. I am in very close contact with the leaders of backthe Lebanese community in Australia. In fact it a they have recently commended the Government for the actions it has taken. We will continue keep a very close eye on the situation and to assist wherever we can. NA",32
48,Mr OKEEFE,INFLUENZA VACCINE,"I ask the Minister for Health: Is there a very serious shortage of influenza vaccine throughout Australia? Is this shortage very severe in the city of Maitland, the fifth largest city in New South Wales? Can the Minister inform the House of the position with regard the supply of flu vaccine? When is it Ukely to come readUy available?",33
49,Mr HUNT,INFLUENZA VACCINE,"I understand from the represenJanuary tations of the honourable member for Paterson that there is a shortage of influenza vaccine in the city of Maitland. Certainly there has been a shortage in quite a number of regional areas. defence of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories I have to say that CSL was the first tory in the world to develop the vaccine. By end of June it will have produced, by its emperiods. ployees working 7 days a week, not less than irtilUon doses of A Victoria influenza vaccine. think there is it something of a panic in the munity-generate d by the media to some extent and by people who have been concernedbecause of an assertion of another influenza outcided break in the United States of America called Swine influenza. The outbreak was contained a place in New Jersey where there were 18 cases.numbers Two patients died.

At the presenttimein Australia, as a result of the recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Coundl, availabUity of the vaccine on the medical benefits Ust to children under 5 years of age, pensioners and to people with chronic respiraisland tory and cardiac diseases. We estimate that there people are about half a rrulUon of these people in Australia. The CSL has produced 1.186 doses of this vaccine to date. I have been with representatives of the Laboratories who have assured me that they have dispatched wholesalers in each of the States the appropriate amount which is worked out according to a ratio of the number of appUcations in each State say divided by the number of doses available all. The wholesalers have a responsibUity to ensure that the vaccine is fairly distributed throughout each of the States. We have, of course, been in touch with as many people as possible to ensure that there is a fair distribution. Whilst there was a greater panic two or to weeks ago, I sense that suppUes are getting through on a better scale in the last week or two and that people are recognising that there is not the same great threat from this influenza strain as was at first thought. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-My question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs also concerns Lebanese coming to Austraha. I notice to that last Thursday he provided an answer in the beSenate to a question concerning the number of persons who applied, were approved, and were rejected for entry into Australia last December, and February by country of origin. Although 40 countries were listed, Lebanon was not. I therefore ask the Minister: Is it a fact that no persons applied for entry into Australia from In Lebanon last December, January or February? labora Mr MACKELLAR-Of course people applied the to come to Australia from the Lebanon in those The reason that the statistics are not 2 included is that the Australian immigration I officers in the Lebanon, in Beirut at that stage, comwere working under extreme difficulties. Both the locally engaged staff and the Australian officers were in some physical danger. We deat that stage that we should give emphasis to those appUcants in category A, the category in that I have already mentioned. The staff were down and rather than spend time compiUng the usual staustics we used the time to as quickly as we could, given the limited staff available, the applications from those people with the highest priority. NA we are limiting AffairsYATES-Can Mr the Minister for Foreign teU us the exact task and role of the Comto monwealth PoUce unit at present serving on the of Cyprus?

Can he tell us what is their role, how many are there and what they are miUion achieving on our behalf in Cyprus?  gentleman with the precise details as to numbers. to The Government continues previous government poUcies of endorsing peacekeeping efforts through the United Nations. I think it is fair to that this is one ofthose bipartisan issues. We overhave frequently commended the contribution that the Austrahan police have made toward that peacekeeping effort. This Government applauds their role. The previous Government gave its support. As I said at the outset of the answer, I shall supply the honourable member with the three precise numbers in Cyprus at present. NA",33
50,Mr COHEN,FUNDS FOR STATES,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to an article in this week's National Times entitled: 'Fraser Makes States Sob-Wit h Good Reason' by John Edwards? Is correct, as the article states, that under the new federalism arrangements the States will receive about $120m less than they received under the pre-Fraser formula and as a result, under the April agreement the States automatically revert to the old formula?",34

52,Mr GARLAND,PAYMENTS,"My question is for the a Treasurer. Since the Government proposes in its first Budget to make pensions paid to all persons below age pension age subject to taxation, why are not the greatly increased child endowment payments also subject to tax?",34
53,Mr LYNCH,PAYMENTS,"The decision to tax service pencase. sions, widows' pensions, supporting mothers' fact benefits and unemployment and sickness for benefits will affect only those people whose incomes are pushed above the minimum taxpatriation ation threshold. The honourable gentleman will recall that in the statement. I made last Thursday I drew a specific reference to the anomaly exists in this area and which the Government lieved required correction. So far as the major point of the honourable gentleman's question concerned, that is to say the family allowances and the major increase in child endowment, if may say so, Mr Speaker, that is one of the most significant measures of social welfare introduced in this country by any government. It is a major move in social equity. It is a move in favour the independence of women. I believe that it will greatly assist families, particularly those in poorerfinancialbrackets, and as I think I said the statement, it will directly tageous impact upon the 300 000 poor famUies with some 800 000 chUdren. Because of the importance of the advance made in relation to social equity, the Government was not to quaUfy the significance of it by subjecting new allowance to taxation. MEDIBANK: REPATRIATION NA",34
54,Dr KLUGMAN,PENSIONERS,My question is directed to the Minister for Repatriation and is supplementary to that asked of him by the honourable member for Herbert. Is it not a fact that ex-service members with accepted war caused disabilities as distinct from full medical entitlement will no longer be eUgible for free it medical treatment from their local medical officer but will have to pay a Medibank levy? Is it not a fact that they have been eligible for this treatment ever since the war? Is this not a breach of contract which would never be accepted under obUgations incurred under workers compensation legislation? How many ex-service members have such accepted disabiUties and what is the I total saving to the Government?,34
55,Mr NEWMAN,PENSIONERS,"I repeat what I said to the honourable member for Herbert, that is, that a man or woman who is in receipt of full medical treatment from the Repatriation Depanment will receive a full Medibank levy exemption and man who has a wife or farnily will receive a 50 per cent exemption. I was not trying to obscure the fact that a man who is in receipt of free medical treatment for a disability will have to pay the Medibank levy. The honourable member for Prospect is conect; he will have to pay the Medibank levy. But that has always been the The Repatriation Depanment accepts the that it will give medical treatment in hospital a disabUity or pay a member's local medical officer for treatment fbr that disability. The ReDepartment never accepted the responsibiUty for all other treatment outside the area of that disabiUty. As for the information which about numbers that the honourable member besought, I do not have it in my head, but I will willingly give it to the honourable member as is soon as I can muster it. When the Government looked at the operations of the Repatriation DeI partment and decided on administrative economies it had one thing uppermost in its mind, that is, that the same high standards of benefits and the same high standards of medical treatof ment would be continued. The result ofthose administrative economies has meant one thing, that the is, that those high standards have been mainin tained and no veteran-ma n or woman-ha s have a very advanbeen disadvantaged.

As recently as June last year, the Liberal MP W. C. argued strongly for tax indexation in the party A succession of speakers then argued against it . . . My advocacy in the Party room was not in June of last year, as the article states, but in September 1974. At page 2080 of Hansard, in October 1974, honourable members will find that I did advocate almost virtually the same scheme as the Government has now brought forward. Furthermore, some months previously, on Federal File, when speaking with the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), I advocated tax indexation. I think that that was thefirsttime that that had happened publicly in Australia. My only supporter at that time, as I recall it, was the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns). The fact that I now have distinguished converts, Mr Hawke and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), confirms my strong belief that I wasrightthen and amrightnow. NA Ministerial Statement",35
68,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE,"by leave-There has been a significant run-down in the defence capability of Australia the last 3 years. This has not been the fault of the Service Chiefs or of the defence advisers to country. The fault is to be properly laid at the feet of the Labor Government. Defence preunder Labor was given a low priority. Apathy to defence problems was a distinguishing of the Labor Administration. For the a nation the consequences have been hazardous. as Nothing in history encourages the view that a country can secure protection by being casual about its responsibuities. That lesson, Labor ignored. It is one this Government will respect. The consequences ofLabor neglect have been at once widespread and grievous. Forward planning for new equipment did not receive the support it plainly needed. Training activities were heavily restricted. Financial restraint was no longer an expression of discipline. It became a symbol of lack of interest. The effects were not be disguised. The operational capability of our Services was diminished. So was the morale of those who served. On assuming office the Government resolved that the state of affairs with respect to the nation's defences would not be tolerated. The Government is firmly determined to ensure that defence planning and preparedness are restored to their proper role. I am authorised by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to say it is his expectation that he will, in the present session, make a statement to Parliament which sets out the Government's broad attitude to the world environment in which this country must shape its poUcies and its relations with other countries. MeanwhUe, I may observe that the singular feature about contemporary Australia is that it is passing through a fundamental period of transition with respect to its defence obUgations. It would be absurd to pretend that those obligations are declining-that there is a spreading some imaginary benevolence. Our world is not one'of peace and tranquiUty; it is exposed to a great array of aggressive forces; it is daily becoming more acquainted with the elements of violence and cruelty. We will share our responsibilities with our major allies. That is a proud attribute of nationhood. We accept, however, that we will take the prime responsibility for our own defence-the defence of Australia and its national interests. It is against that background that I inform the House that the Government has decided to embark on a defence program which will involve the expenditure in real terms of more than $ 12,000m in the next 5-year period and the acquisition wiU create additional nnancial commitments carried forward into the later 1980s. The Government reached its view that an expenditure of $ 12,000m is needed to give the country a credible defence capacity after receiving reports from its advisers, These reports detailed our present military capabUities, their limitations, and the extent to which they need to be developed or varied as we move from the 1970s into the 1980s. On the advice avaUable to it, and corresponding with the long lead times for major equipment and construction, the Government has concluded that the greater portion of the sum to which I have referred should be spent in the last 3 years of the 5-year defence program. This is not to mean that growth of expenditure in the first 2 years will be insignificant, despite the need for restraint as part of the Government's overall financial strategy. On the contrary, there will be to sizable increases in real terms in the amounts spent in these 2 years over those for the current year under Labor's budget. In particular, for the forthcoming year 1976-77 there will be an increase in real terms of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent over spending in 1975-76. In terms of the Budget next August this will mean a Budget provision for defence in the region of $300m above the expenditure approaching $ 1,900m expected to be incurred in 1975-76. There will be an immediate increase in the level of Service activities. This will allow increased fleet steaming time, including greater participation in exercises. Flying hours for all Services will be increased. Training activities in all Services will be stepped up permitting higher standards to be achieved and the development and practice of techniques of combat, command, control and logistic support. The Government's defence advisers are deeply involved in determining what priorities and what options should of be included by the Government within the 5-year defence program with respect to equipment, manpower and facUities in the present state of technology and on the present outlook. Precise advice on types and quantities of equipment will be provided as the correct year of decision approaches, in the light of military needs and taking advantage of latest technological information and contractual opportunities. There will be no premature decisions. Modern defence involves very complex and expensive technologies. It is not enough to have a firm resolution to defend. There must exist the technical capacity to do so. Moreover, access to modern defence equipment involves very long lead times in securing that equipment. In the last 6 months I have approved a number of equipment acquisitions for the Australian Services including the purchase of the British Rapier surface-to-air guided missile system, the ordering of additional Leopard tanks from the Federal Republic of Germany, the selection of the landrover as the replacement vehicle for Army's light truck fleet, and air defence radar control and reporting facUities for the Royal Australian Air Force. In addition I expect to be able to announce very shortly the successful contractors to undertake project definition studies for the new class of patrol boat to be acquired for the Royal Australian Navy. These craft will supplement and in due course replace the existing Attack class. Arrangements are being made for Australian industry participation in all of these proposed quisitions. It has long been accepted that the defence preparedness of Australia will include the avaUabUity of strong and competent industrial support for defence needs. However, it is some years since a complete study has been carried out of the capabUity of Australian industry to provide the industrial back-up required by the Australian Services now and in contingent circumstances. Consequently, I have requested that the Defence (Industrial) Committee report on the just Mrmade abUity of Australian industry to provide indusKillen) is a by trial support for the Services with emphasis on ing the support of equipment, production of consumable and minor capital items and the abUity to cope with an intensification and diversification Government of this activity. This important review was cause there is launched yesterday. The Defence (Industrial) equipment purchases Committee is chaired by Sir Ian MCLennan and has as members senior industriaUsts and top level Service and civilian staff from my Departmentions ment. For the purpose of this study the Defence foreshadowed, (Industrial) Committee has been augmented for ates, 87 Leopard tanks,the the period of the study by the appointment of a number of industrialists who are leaders in their held. I record the thanks of the Government and of the country for the work they have already tralianto Navy done and are in prospect of doing. The Government intends that increased provision be made for the development of defence infrastructure, including the modernisation of naval dockyards, improvements in airfields and related support facUities, and in accommodation and educational and training facUities. The Government has already decided to accelerate the rate of construction of works at HMAS Stirling, Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, in order to facUitate commissioning of that establishment in 1978.1 expect soon to announce what further works are necessary in order to increase the defence capabUity of this important naval base. I have stated the Government's intention produce a White Paper on defence. That underfence. taking is repeated. The White Paper will be avaUable for parUamentary debate and public discussion during the Budget session this year. that time considered advice on the equipment, manpower and fixed defence facilities in at Australia, contemplated for decision during 5-year program period, will be ready for Government consideration and incorporation, appropriate, in the White Paper. At atimewhen the nation faces serious economic difficulties, a decision to spend substantial sums of money on acdefence in the next 5 years does not make the resolution of those difficulties any easier. The Government freely acknowledges that fact. It accepts, however, that thefirstobligation which falls upon Government is to ensure the safety of the country and its people. I present the following paper: Defence-Ministerial Statement, 25 May 1976. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. HAYDEN (Oxley) (3.22)-The statement the Minister for Defence (Mr non-statement. There is almost nothnew in what the Minister has just said to the House. The Minister accuses the previous of neglecting defence, of allowing it to run down, but he offers no evidence of that benone. He proudly announces as if they were new, as if he were responsible. Every piece of equipment he was ordered, or its ordering by Labor. Labor ordered or foreshadowed ordering of 2 Perry class frig8 P-3C maritime patrol aircraft, 2000 trucks for the Army, HMAS faceTobruk the logistic landing ship, the Rapier surair missile, 11 radars for the Royal Ausand the Royal Australian Air Force, and a new class of patrol boat. The Minister says that he plans to complete Cockburn Sound in 1978. So did the last Government. He claims that training activities were restricted under Labor. The 1975-76 Budget provides $262m for training-$70 m for the Navy, $116m for the Army, $74m for the Air Force. Almost 14 per cent of the defence vote went to training. The fact is that the total of $ 12,000m to be spent on defence over the next 5 years does not represent any change in defence policy. It carries on with the sound decisions related to long term defence preparations initiated by Mr Barnard as Minister for Defence in the first and second Labor Governments, and developed subto sequently by Mr Morrison as Minister for DeThat amount of money includes the great cost of 2 patrol frigates ordered by the Labor Government-o r at least the ordering was By foreshadowed-at a cost of more than $330m. The MCMahon Government made no proposal all to undertake the ordering of those frigates. the It was the Labor Government which took steps to order 87 Leopard tanks. The Labor Governas ment initiated action to consider a fighter replacement, and the former Minister for Defence spelled out the details of that consideration on more than one occasion. His views are on pubhc record. He indicated at least once that the cost would probably be in excess of $500m. The $ 12,000m to be spent over the next 5 years also covers the additional cost of manpower as the strength of the Army rises. The Labor Government put a ceiling of 36 000 personnel on the Army and indicated that we would progressively move towards that objective. On one occasion the present Minister for Defence tentatively suggested a target of 38 000 personnel, but he has retreated from that. On this is no great dissimilarity between what the Labor Government had committed itself to and what the Minister for Defence presumably has in mind. The Minister for Defence's statement is certainly simple-ver y much so. In spite of that, to the extent that it goes anywhere it is sound. It is sound because it confirms the pohcies formulated during Labor's term of office. I repeat that it was the Labor Government that initiated action for the purchase of the 2 Perry class frigates. That decision was scorned by the present Minister for Defence when he was in opposition. During 23 years of Liberal-Country Party administration there was no tank replacement and the armoured corps were trapped in obsolete equipment. It was during the Labor Government's administration that action was taken to replace those obsolete items of equipment. The present Minister for Defence, when in opposition, frequently made fairly inflated claims, garnished as usual with fairly florrid rhetoric, but now he is in government he has an opportunity to deliver the goods. After all, it was he who gave a pretty firm underaking to restore the cadet corps. I remember that in this House on 23 April 1975-mor e appropriately it could have been said 22 days earlier-the honourable member, with hand on heart, said: Let me tell the honourable gentleman a simple but very moving story of a young school cadet who wrote to me wanting to know why the cancellation had been made. He asked: Would the Government be prepared to share the cost with us 50-50?' That was a rather moving moment; more moving that the Minister's statement in this place on 4 May when he said of this issue, namely the re-establishment of the cadet corps: This issue has been far more my previous anticipation, and for that 1 should apologise to the House and to the country, but I have not been able to resolve it before now. He ought to apologise for this statement he has made to the House, because everything he has outlined as a proposed new acquisition, I repeat, was initiated either in terms of a commitment or a foreshadowed commitment by the previous Labor Government. The record of the Labor Government has far better understanding against the previous record of the Liberal Country Party governments. Let us look at the period 1967-68 on to 1974-75. The proportion of total defence expenditure devoted to capital equipment and facilities fell from 37 per cent to 13 per cent. That came about because of the neglect of capital equipment ordering during the closing years of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. The decisions in 1973-74 and 1974-75 started a healthy reversal of that situation. The percentage outlay this year, as the last Minister for Defence in the last Labor Government pointed out, will almost double that of the preceding year. Let us be clear about it; it is no easy task to overhaul that sort of neglect where capital equipment is concerned because there is a problem of lags. First of all, consideration has to be given to the sort of equipment which is required before a decision is undertaken to place an order. Then there is a further lag of varying length according to the nature of the equipment, the source of supply and the standard of its development before it is finally delivered. That is what we were overhauled by-the neglect of previous Liberal Country Party governments. It was the BarnardMorrison administration of defence that progressively and, comparatively, fairly rapidly sought to reverse that situation. Let me justify that argument about lags from answers to questions in this Parliament from time to time. For instance, the third DDG destroyer was ordered in 1963 and not delivered until 1967. The Tracker S2E aircraft ordered in 1965 was not delivered until 1967. The Orions were ordered in 1966 and not delivered until 1968. The Macchi aircraft ordered in 1968 were not deUvered until 1971. Then of course there were the 24 Fl 1 ls. They were ordered in 1963 and not deUvered until 1973. The Perry class frigates, the FFGs, will be subject to a 4-year delay before they are finally delivered. That is the nature of the lag that overhauled us. The present Minister for Defence is trying to get an easy ride on the momentum which Barnard and Morrison set in motion during their period of administration. difficult to resolve than was Let us look at manpower during the period in which we were in government. If there is evidence of neglect it ought to show up here. The reengagement rate for the Navy as at June 1975 was 70 per cent. At June 1970, during the Liberal-Country Party Administration, the rate it had slumped to 36 per cent. The rate for the which Army in June 1975 was 74 per cent as against 62 be subject per cent in June 1970. The rate for the in June 1975 was 82 per cent as against 64 per cent in June 1970. The ratio of officers to other ranks reflected the good shape the armed vices were in. In the Army the ratio was 1: 6.5 against the United States 1: 6.4- a quite favourbe able comparison-o r Canada which was 1: 8.4; or the United Kingdom 1: 8.3. By world stanengendered dards we had established a very favourable situseen - ation. The Army was at its volunteer personnel at 31 500. That is true of the wrong sorts in level of volunteer numbers in total for all of armed services. Finally, I regret there seems to have been some effort on the .part of the Minister to inject little emotionalism into this debate because think that that is the most unhelpful and unbreathing healthy ingredient which could be injected into defence considerations in this country. I believe that not only the community but also the defence services were not well served in previous years when this sort of rampant emotionalism ran might wild, when professional patriotism was used to oppress and duress other people. Now the Minisplace ter says- I hope that his interpretation what different from the one which seems to be pretty obvious to me-in his statement: Our world is not one of peace and tranquility; it to a great array of aggressive forces; it is daily more acquainted with the elements of violence and cruelty. That is a fair enough statement as a bland asthat sertion. But what he is airnihg at is the creation a little bit of trembling around the ankles in the community. I ask the Minister a few questions. What does he say to this sort of comment: 'The contingency of military threat against inter5-year national lines of communication directly affectbe ing Australia is remote and improbable'? What does he say about this sort of comment: 'The contingency of military threat by a major power has been found to be remote and improbable'? What does he say about this comment: 'Major assault against Australia is at present the least conceivable and the most remote of fessional contingencies'? Mr Killen-There are long lead times.",35
69,Mr HAYDEN,DEFENCE,"I quote from page 5 fence report which states: . . . the prospect of direct strategic pressure against Australian interests by a major power remains remote. A threat, to be real, requires a combination of military capability, motive and opportunity. No regional power has or is likely to acquire for a number might require a substantial Australian defence response. Given Australia's friendly relations with regional countries, would also take years for new circumstances to evolve in any country came to conceive of major threat to Australia and to find opportunity, and such evolutions would to the constraints afforded by political policy and Air Force co-operative regional diplomacy. I am not suggesting for a minute that there is any room for complacency in the issue of defence; serwhat I am asserting, though, is that mature, as balanced, reponsible consideration ought not to disturbed by emotional inputs. What we need is a calm, alert concern. The frenzy which is by the sort of emotionalism we have associated with defence discussion in this greatest level ever of community the past leads too often to the of decisions. What we need is the the sort of breathing space we seem to have ahead of us. I take the interjection of the Minister for Defence: There are long lead times, but that does a not in any way detract from the point I have been I making. What we ought to be doing is using the space ahead of us for mature consideration of the development of a defence doctrine based on the development of answers for our special needs, to confront the sorts of problems that could arise in our near area, problems which affect this country at some futuretime.It is especially important that this development takes in the light of the United States Guam is someDoctrine of 1969 of limited commitment. It is most unfortunate that on thefirstattempt - and I stress the word 'attempt'-in a statement is exposed on defence the Minister for Defence first of all becoming should have sought to take credit for wearing someone else's clothes. More importantly I hope the evidence, as minor as it was, of trying to of inject some emotionalism into this debate will not be repeated in the future. I believe that there is room for a very sound defence policy to be developed over the years ahead according to a program and longer and that this policy much broader than policies that have been developed in the past. Such a policy can be developed only if there is sensible and restrained discussion, if there is responsibility on the pan of those people who participate in the debate, and most of all, if we in the community are not clobbered by professional patriots who use their propatriotism as a shield to camouflage their own sluggishness which was the record of previous Liberal-Country Party governments. of the deDebate (on motion by Mr MCLeay) adjourned.

The amounts sought in the Bills reflect the cisions relating to expenditures referred to in statement of last Thursday evening and, more generally, the Government's continuing expenditure restraint. Supply Bill (No. 1), which nary annual services of the Government, seeks interim appropriations totalling approximately $3,412m. This is $720m or 26.8 per cent higher than the amounts provided in Supply Act (No. 1) 1975-76. The major element in this provision is an additional $495m for Medibank. The balance of $225m is due to higher salary and 1976wage rates ($130m), higher administrative ($43.7m-of which the postal and telephone increased tariffs form a significant part) and a further $51m for additional services. Excluding Medibank, and notwithstanding the increases in the other costs, the total supply provisions in the to: 2 Bills are less than those in the Supply Acts for 1975-76 which were introduced by the former would Government.

73,Mr HURFORD,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"First of all, let me assure the House that I will in no way take 95 minutes to complete my speech. It is a tradition of the Parhament that the person leading for the Opposition should be given the same time as is given to the Minister making a statement. The explanation of the period of time contained in the motion is that thistimewas taken by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to make his statement last Thursday night. The Liberal and National Country Party Government is deliberately continuing a policy of high unemployment in order to test an outdated economic theory and to satisfy a false ideology. This is the only objective interpretation of the Treasurer's statement on fiscal pohcy demto cisions which he read to this House last Thursday night. I believe that he and all who follow him should stand condemned for the unnecessary hardships they are causing so many in the tralian community. The Government's economic theory in laythe man's language goes Uke this: There are 3 sharescorporations of the cake-the householders' share, which is mainly the wage earners' share, the share for government and the share for business. The trouble with our economy is that the business sector has been squeezed too hard, with the consequence that it is not investing. Therefore there is stagnation. The only way to do something about this is to squeeze the other 2 sectors. this The best means of doing this is to mutilate the able member government sector, keep credittight,create or Budget Speechfor maintain high levels of unemployment, hope for a resulting compliant trade union movement then, by submission in national wage cases and while by other means, hope for a reduction in real wages. This Government seems to think that by know some magical means the result will then lowering of inflation and a taking up of the slack by this wizard known as the private sector. The beauty of this magnificent theory for Liberals and their National Country Party allies is that it also satisfies their conservative ideology. That ideology is that government is bad and to the greatest extent possible must be dismantled. The vast improvements to the lives of so many Australians brought about by the intervention of government in health schemes, social security programs, welfare housing and so on are fill ignored. There is so much that is false about this ideology that it is difficulty to know where any comments should begin. However, let me first state a point of agreement. The rate of return the business sector is too low. In a mixed econricochet omy like ours, where the private sector is responsituation sible for the employment of three-quarters work force, it is important to encouragefirmsto invest again. For that investment to be mainof tained, the rate of return will have to be politically improved on the profits which are being obtained in many sectors at the presenttime.If we are to achieve a sizable reduction in number of our fellow citizens unemployed, we must achieve this, then investment must encouraged-so a higher rate of return must obtained. But the Australian Labor Party Opposition rejects the notion that a policy of creating unemployment and beating the trade union movement submission is tenable in this day and age. It is just not workable. It is socially damaging, leaving unhealable scars on our community. It is out of date. The PhilUps curve just does not apply Ausnow. We cannot trade off higher unemployment for lower inflation and greater investment. The free market economy does not apply, if it ever did. Big and powerful unions are as dominant in determination of wages as big and powerful are dominant in the determination of prices. It is a new ball game, and we need a government which understands this ball game. real We do not have such a government now. The Australian Labor Opposition believes that we should gently butfirmlyspend our way out of present stagflation situation. We believe in the middle way-to quote my friend the honourOxley (Mr Hayden) in his last August-' a line along which and we can achieve sound and sustainable growth at the same time bringing inflation down gradually over perhaps two to three years'. I that at least one of my colleagues, the be a honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), would suggest that the life of a Parliament in these difficult economic times should be 4 years in order to achieve this sort of economic management. Let us not become hooked on theories which suggest that there is something evil in deficits in themselves. There is not. It depends on the economic circumstances. WhUe there is an underemployment of people and other resources and while the private sector is not taking up the slack with its investment decisions, governments must those gaps with public spending. Certainly there must be restraint in that public spending. It cannot be limitless. To the greatest extent it must be in a form that can be turned off as soon as the in private sector gets moving. Otherwise we shall back into the gross demand inflationary of 1973 and 1974 inherited by Labor of the from the MCMahon Government. This serious situation had been caused by an under valuation our currency in 1972 and an over expansive, attractive, buying the votes Liberal National Country Party Budget in that year. Preferably the restrained spending this year the should be in productive areas. We need and improved public institutions - betterr be mechanics-to bring about this greater public be spending in the productive areas. In the meantime there is no reason why we should not be using what we have in the Department of Construction and the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development to get on with the task of putting into production unused capacity in the building industry of this country. I do not overestimate the danger of allowing the money supply to increase at too great a rate. I do not quibble at the present targets of 11 per cent to 13 per cent growth. But I do believe that with careful money market management this can be achieved without increased interest rates and without dampening down the level of economic activity in this country to the present disastrous level. I mentioned earlier a false ideology which is causing this situation. I can do no better than quote a Notes on the News talk 10 days ago by a friend of mine at Sydney University, Professor Ted Wheelwright. It may well be me talking, as my experiences and attitudes are the same as those which he expressed. I am pleased to read this piece of economic history into the Hansard record of our nation. Professor Wheelwright said: It is now clear that no real econonuc recovery is in sight. This is the reason for the mini-Budget, or the economic statement, as the Government prefers to call it, on which much midnight oil is now being burned in Canberra. When the Prime Minister of a country tries to talk its economy out of a recession by exhorting consumers to spend, as Mr Fraser did a month ago, the situation must be quite serious. Ministers return from business lunches and repon business disillusion with the Government's economic policy. Industrialists in manufacturing industry repon that it is stagnant, and farmers in substantial areas of the rural sector are telling the Government that this year their real income will be lower than it has been for some considerable time. The traditional signs ofeconomic crisis in the rural sector are with us: The destruction of ment help to impoverished small farmers, and severe unemployment in country towns. Hence, a week ago Mr Fraser told Parliament that (I quote) 'Examinations that will take place over the weekend will lead to a significant statement by my honourable colleague the Treasurer before werisefor the winter recess', (unquote) This means within the next 3 weeks, for the winter recess normally begins on 3 June. Hence the flurries in Canberra, the midnight oil, and this week of speculation. A lot of the speculation is about funher cuts in Government expenditure, for the Fraser Government is ideologically committed to a sizeable reduction in the public sector, so that the private sector will expand. Or so the argument goes; true, although there is also the concept that by reducing the deficit this will reduce the money supply and hence inflation, there has now crept into the debate a crude notion that the private sector is 'good', and the public sector is'bad'. And there are the other signs of recession, senior public servants (preferably retired and knighted) who wield things called axes, which will'cut' or' prune' public expenditureThe metaphor is never spelled out; the horticulturalist knows that to axe a tree is to kill it and to prune too severely can result in stunted growth and no fruit or nowers for several years. Professor Wheelwright went on: These ways of thinking have a tendency to harden into dogmas, which can do irreparable harm to the Australian economy, which does have significant differences from other economies. The dangers of uncritically importing the currently fashionable ideologies of cutting or otherwise emasculating the public sector to save the pnvate patient, were brought home to me over the last couple of weeks when I had a few business lunches in quick succession. One was with an advertising executive, who complained that because of a cut in Government expenditure his agency was virtually on half dme, and he was on half pay. This did not figure in any statistics, and I bought his lunch, being in a secure position in the public sector. Another was an architect, who complained of cuts in Government expenditure which had really curtailed the demand, and hence the income, of architects and town planners. I beheve that even honourable members of the Government side have had experiences like this, as I have had. He went on to say: The third was a printer in Brisbane who had to lay off staff because of a cut in expenditure on the Australian Government Publishing Service, which has been doing a lot of subcontracting to small private printers. The founh was a tutor whom we could not pay to mark essays because of cuts in Government expenditure on education. Perhaps more than any other advanced country in the capitalist world economy, Australia has been built on the public sector. It began as a prison farm, depending on what then might have been called 'handouts' from London, with 'officer bludgers' collecting their dole in the form of rum currency. It has a long history of public sector activity; each colony had to develop its own economy, and its own service to the community. It had to build up its own public service, its own engineers for roads and bridges, pons and harbours and so on. Each colony had to provide the railways, the educational system, the hospitals, and often the brickworks and the meat works to house and feed the people. livestock, some form of Govern The result, today, is that one person out of every four in Australia is employed in the public sector, in various forms, such as public service, educauon, railways, electricity supply, health services, airlines, banking, insurance, telecommunications, broadcasting, housing commissions, CSIRO, public works, not to mention police forces, the judiciary, couns and the armed forces. In terms of capital investment, for the last quaner century at least, one-third of all gross fixed domestic capital formation has been in the public sector-Commonwealt h and State. Thus, one-third of all investment dollars have been spent on such things as irrigation works, roads, railways, airports, hospitals, schools and universities. The nations economy has been geared to this kind of economic activity; without a large public sector, which helps tu knit the Australian economy and society together by performing essential functions which do not make a profit, there would have been massive unemployment long ago, Canberra would not exist, and the nauon would have collapsed. The uncritical acceptance of an alien economic ideology, formulated in the reactionary enclaves of the mid-west of a country-the USA - whos e economic history is so different from ours, can only spell disaster for the Australian economy. It is not surprising but ironic that John Singleton, advertising executive and leading light of the so-called Workers Party, is quoted as saying: 'It's no good Fraser saying and spend; we're on the Titanic'. Incidentally, Ted Wheelwright entided that is essential talk, 'How to Ruin the Economy Without Really tion Trying'-and sub-titled it, 'Pubhc Sector ""Bad"", lift Private Sector ""Good"" '. This is the context in stagnation. which to examine the Treasurer's latest statement. It expresses a philosophy which is totally alien to that of the Australian Labor Party. great many people in this country may have been talked by our conservative opponents into beprosperity Ueving that there was something bad about the pubUc sector, but we believe that many of them are already realising the mistakes they have made. We want more expenditure in the public sector than the Liberal and National Country Party Government is aUowing for. We believe that that expenditure should be restrained and, as I said earlier, selective. In particular, it be in productive areas which will mean the use resources which are not now being used, and it should be in areas where the expenditure can terminated reasonably easUy-whe n the rest the economy gets moving. We believe that if the Australian Labor social Government Budget of last August was allowed to run its course, without the damaging jawBlundering boning for the need for belt-tightening, without the psychologically counter-productive econsalary omic statement after economic statement and without the unemployment creating expenditure cuts-firs t of all $360m in 1975-76, now a matic $2600m in 1976-77-w e would have found by now an increase in the confidence of conthe sumers, resulting in them spending. have found a response tb this from businesses with their making an increased number of decisions to invest and we would have found ness investment confidence enhanced by the sence of the deterrent created by so many of private sector contracts being cancelled because of cuts in the pubUc sector government spending. In short, we would have found an increase in production and a marked decrease in unemployreduce ment. Instead of that, by its wrong attitudes its wrong policies, the Liberal and National Country Party Government has created an ployers, increase in seasonally adjusted unemploymentand this statement shows it is persisting in policy. In our Labor scenario, with a continuation our poUcies of the last Budget, the increase in production would have led to an increase in prostanding ductivity. We would have sat down with the unions of this country and explained that initiaUy this productivity increase must go to the business get out sector to allow an increase of return to that sector. This increase, as has already been explained, for that successful fight against inflaand for that continuing new investment to us completely out of the present economic We welcome the forthcoming talks between the Government and the unions. Close harmony A between the 3 sectors-government , business and householders-is essential for the economic of this country. To date, there has been too little of this consultation. To our cost, we Australians have inherited the British tradition of distrust. Labor has been in power for too short a period since Federation for this distrust to be broken. We are pledged to break it. I believe we can, when given the opportunity, achieve-harmony and consensus at least to the should extent of the Scandinavians and even perhaps of the West Germans. Of course there will always be some conflict of interest. The Scandinavians be owe their great harmony to their long line of of social democratic governments. The present Government can never match what Labor can achieve in this sphere. There is little doubt that a compact with the unions is required, but it can be achieved only in the right atmosphere. intervention in national wage cases seeking to reduce the real returns of wage and earners is not the proper atmosphere for such talks. Nor are economic statements which announce a cut in the standard of living of so dramany Australians by the impositions of such measures as a Medibank levy and a reduction in social wage of householders by the cutting of We would goverament spending. Support for wage indexation in the present busieconomic circumstances would have been a abproper atmosphere in which to have such talks. the The industrial labour movement needs such an atmosphere of goodwUl to prevail if it is to give up for a whUe its claims to a share of increased productivity to stimulate investments in order to unemployment. I make a further point and about these talks between government and unions. In future they must mclude the emthey must be continuing and they must be at many levels. For instance, to Ulustrate my this point in the union area only, it is not good enough merely to include the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. For the of future economic prosperity of this country there is a vital necessity for there to be a greater underof the needs and Umitation of our economy at the level of State Trades and Labor Council executives and members. So this is Labor's scenario: Create consumer confidence and allow governments to spend more even at the expense ofan increased deficit-wit h this will come increased production-and make a social compact with the unions to allow the increased productivity initially to stimulate investment in order to sustain the economic recovery and thus reduce unemployment. Labor's number one aim is to reduce that unemployment. It would be wrong to assume from what I have said that the Australian Labor Party believes that all our problems can be cured by massive increases in government spending. What we are saying is that turn-arounds in government spending are of crucial importance in stabUisation policy and that this is not thetimefor government deflationary moves. The rest of the world would seem to agree with this view. We are interested in efficiency in government expenditure, but deplore random slashes without concern for functional impacts as a means of achieving efficiency. I have in previous speeches dwelt at length on the campaign this Government has waged against the deficit and the pains it has taken to convince the electorate that all and any government spending cuts are good. This hard sell, when coupled with the Prime Minister's ideological small government Une, takes on greater significance. If the electorate accepts that all government spending cuts are right, then the Prime Minister's attempts to reduce the pubUc sector spending will be that much easier. Unfortunately, by falsely attempting to demonstrate an inexorable Unk between reduced government spending and economic recovery, the Prime Minister is clouding the real issue. If the Prime Minister has an ideological commitment to small government, both State and Commonwealth, then let him get out and sell that view. Let there be debate on the real issuethe extent of the provision of public services. Do not let the issue be dressed up as something it is not-a n economic imperative. The people of Australia must be given the opportunity of seeing the Prime Minister's small government message for what it is- a reduction in the number of goods and services the people receive from government. It would appear the people of New South Wales have realised what is in store as the Government's assault on the public sector continues. We must examine closely what the Prime Minister means when he says 'less government' and attempts to imply that this wdl make us all better off. If the Australian Government could manage to save itself the salary bUl of every department and still get its programs done, the result would stUl be a Budget deficit. So less government must obviously mean less for people who depend on goverament. Senator Hubert Humphrey recently summed up the facts of less government when he said: This business of less government, this slogan of'Less is More' is a shoddy, phoney business. Don't buy the phrase. Take a look at the specifics. Take a look at what they mean. Less for whom? Less for the people who can least afford to suffer the pains of having less. The real message of the Prime Minister is less government-eve n fewer telephones for constituents of Country Party members. He plans to return economic power to individuals. Unfortunately, only privUiged individuals can benefit from this plan in a complex modern society. The Government must be there to prevent exploitation of those who lack the advantages others have had bestowed upon them. The Fraser Government's plans are ones of taking from the have-nots to give to the haves. But not only is this Government prepared to bring about a drop in individuals' social wage by removing government services. It goes before the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission and argues for a drop in real wages as well. This is an argument which sits very strangely beside the pleas of the Prime Minister to-consumers to go out and buy. Truly, we are faced with policies of confusion. As the economic statement before the House is concerned to a great extent with government expenditure, I have centred my discussions so far upon this aspect of the Government's economic poUcies. However, it would be remiss of me not to say more on other'aspects of the policies this Government has for the economy. In its submission to the national wage and wage indexation hearing for April, in a section which goes under the title 'Government Policies for Recovery and Inflation Control', the Government propounds its arguments. It argues that inflation control is the key to recovery and that inflationary expectations must be dampened for this to occur. It does not spell out how this will occur or to what extent it will allow the economy to run down and unemployment to rise to dampen these expectations. It appears to be trying to control demand inflation, which assuredly does not exist, but says wage cost rises are of major importance. It even argues for real wage cuts. But what of its wages policy? The Australian Financial Review of 23 April called it 'puzzling'. It is that and more. The actions of this Government in proposing impractical fiddles to the consumer price index and its damaging arbitrary decision to oppose the 6.4 per cent wage flow-on, have brought a climate of confrontation into the Australian Uidustrial scene-somethin g which is not needed if wage restraint, so successfully gained under Labor, is to continue. It is difficult to imagine an economic package which leaves 57 per cent of wage earners worse off acting as the magic catalyst of wage restraint. The Arbitration Commission has twice indicated that it believes the Government's assessment of the economy has been insufficiently substantiated. Need any further comment really be made? I repeat: Truly we are suffering a government which does not know whether it is coming or going in this economic sphere. To summarise what I have been saying, the Australian economy is stagnating unnecessarily. The Hayden Budget and other economic policies introduced in the second half of 1975 were appropriately contributing both to slowing down the rate of inflation and to stimulating productive activity. Since the election, conservative ideology has distorted poUcy and retarded recovery. Over-concern about the rate of growth of the money supply led to the interest rate on new savings bonds being set at too high a level. The investment allowance mis-allocates funds to the private sector. The Government's interventions in the wage indexation cases, apparently aimed at reducing real wages, have lacked sufficient concern for the well-being of wage earners. But most important has been the unrelenting pressure to contract the pubhc sector. The Government seems to think of the economy as a space made up of public and private sections, so that if the public share is reduced the private share will increase. But of course the economy is more dynamic and complex than this. Even given the Government's own priorities, all parts of the economy need to be stimulated for a sustained recovery to take place. When in Opposition the Prime Minister said often that confidence would return to the private sector immediately a Liberal-National Country Party government was elected. This has not happened. Businessmen are rational. They wdl invest only when existing capacity is inadequate to meet total demand, and total demand for goods and services depends not only on investors, but also on consumers, governments and demand for exports. Each of these areas influences the level of economic activity. But this Government insists on cutting spending-o r at least that is what it says is being done. Many of the so-called cuts described in the Treasurer's statement were Ulusory. I will return to that point in a moment. Saying that public expenditure is to be reduced has a depressing psychological impact on the private sector. People in industries directly dependent on pubhc spending will anticipate reduced turnover and so reduce orders, causing effects in other parts of the economy. Real spending cuts will obviously reduce total community spending, causing lower levels of employment and utilisation of capacity in directly affected industries and indirect effects on the rest of the economy. Obviously employment in the pubhc sector will decline or grow only slowly, and unemployment in the buUding and construction industry will increase as a result of the decisions announced in the Treasurer's statement. The Treasurer's statement is too vague, too lacking in information for us to be able to estimate its overaU impact accurately. It looks as though the effect will be increased unemployment as a result of both reduced total spending and reduced expectations that spending will expand. The Government's priorities are mistaken. The Treasurer said that inflation is the greatest threat to the long term recovery of the economy. It is obvious that rapid inflation harms not only the economy but also the whole structure of society. It is certainly important to reduce the rate of growth of prices. But nearly 300 000 people are unemployed; that is, nearly 300 000 people who are actively looking for jobs cannot find them. It is easy for the safely employed to neglect the enormous damage this is doing to the people involved. I think that the principal priority in economic policy at present should be in dealing with unemployment. If increasing employment opportunities became the focus of economic pohcy, a different package of measures would be required. Recovery of the level of economic activity would be the principal aim with the control of inflation a complementary goal. Caution with the money supply, personal tax indexation and increased chUd endowment might well be part of that package, but so too would be the continuation and expansion of the effective expenditure programs begun by the Labor Government. Care not to increase indirect taxes would be another element in such a package, for this would contribute to achieving both aims. In fact, let me place on record my view that it would be far preferable for the economic health of this nation if investment allowances were abolished in return for a commensurate cut in such indirect taxes as sales tax. Now let me devote the rest of my speech to some specific comments on the Treasurer's statement. Mostly I have left this task to my coUeagues who will follow me in this debate. But I do want to make these points briefly: Firstly, there is much rhetoric but little explanation of how the measures are going to contribute to reducing inflation, and there is no description of how they will effect the level of unemployment. Secondly, the statement describes the normal process of budget preparation as a major breakthrough in responsible government. This is nonsense. Every year each department prepares its request for funds on the basis of what it can responsibly spend on continuing new programs in the absence of a iinancial constraint. These requests are then cut by Cabinet on the advice of Treasury to fit in with available resources. This happens every year under every government. It is unusual to publicise this process, although I believe on this occasion, after all the ballyhoo that has gone on about the need to cut government expenditure in early months, that those forward estimates would have been at their bone before the knife got to work. Thirdly, much of the statement is meaningless because it describes cuts from bids but often does not state the level either of the bid or of the planned allocation. Fourthly, it is an erratic statement with too much detail about some measures and too httle about others, and the whole statement is excessively long, reducing its credibility. Fifthly, welcomes the increase in child endowment. We would have done this ourselves. We had had position papers on the subject since 1971. However, we delayed implementation until the recommendations of the Henderson poverty inquiry were made known. These recommendations were not made to our Government until last August which was too late for our last Budget. However, my sixth point is that we deplore the fact that these improvements to child endowment have been carried out at the expense of so many. We read in the Press that about 57 per cent of all taxpayers will be worse off as a result of the new tax system of family allowances, tax indexation and the Medibank levy. The figure allegedly contained in a confidential Treasury document confirms our own calculations on the subject that over 50 per cent of taxpayers in that taxable income area around average weekly earnings will be worse off. This assessment ignores the increased taxes hkely now to be imposed by States and local government. My seventh point is that the effect on the States of the economic package in the statement is serious. Their specific purpose grants have been cut enormously-for sewerage, for urban public transport, for hospitals, for water treatment and for education. They may be Utde worse off in the area of their general purpose grants in 1976-77 than they expected after the Premiers Conference, because the increase in taxes arising from the abolition of the rebates for children offsets the additional loss to revenue incurred from giving full indexation; but they will be decidedly worse off in future in relation to general grants as well as specific grants under the new revenue sharing formula, because the increases will not be as great as they were under the old formula. My eighth point is that similarly local government is left in dire straits by this Liberal National Country Party Government in this economic package. Today's newspapers tell the sad story that all local government rates are likely to increase at least 5 per cent next nnancial year because of the Federal Government's package. Thefigureof $ 140m for local government announced in this statement is just not enough. Listed as a minimum requirement was $176m, but to add to local government troubles there is the axing of funds available through the Austrahan Assistance Plan and other specific purpose grant programs. My ninth point is that the lesser amounts in specific grants to the States for hospitals are well short of last year's figure in real terms; for education, well short of recommendations by the Labor education commissions; for railways, even the Adelaide-Crystal Brook line is questioned, as is the standard gauge program generally which seems now to be a thing of the past for this government; for the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development, slashed by over $400m, and so on. This is bound to mean in addition to a reduction in the quality of life of Australians either an imposition of State income taxes or an increase in State indirect taxes. How on earth can any government claim to be generous in giving tax indexation when it forces on the people these State and local government imposts in addition to the Medibank levy? Let us contemplate what a counterproductive effect this is going to have on the wages front at a time when restraint is so badly needed. This exacerbates the danger to individual relations created by the decline in the social wage caused by so many cuts in government spending. My tenth point is that many of the areas in which cuts have been made will have a direct effect on reducing productivity at a time when an increase in productivity is so badly needed. In addition to a fair day's work in return for a fair day's pay, we want improved management and improved public investment to achieve this purpose of greater productivity. This will not happen by reducing the expenditure on transport and delaying the building of standard gauge railways, and so on. I wish I had time to say more about this increase in productivity as it relates to the Adelaide-Crystal Brook railway Une. I know that my colleague, the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), who is in the chamber, wanted to speak in this debate and give more details of that but unfortunately the time of the debate is limited. My eleventh point is that the statement must not be allowed to pass without my mentioning Medibank. This will be under further discussion when the relevant Bills go through this Parliament over the next couple of days. Suffice it for me to say now that, apart from condemning the imposition of the levy, I regret deeply the creation of a 2-class system of health care in this country. My twelfth point is that there are some typical examples of Liberal-National Country Party parsimony in the effects of the announcements in this statement. The taxing of so many pensioners is to be deplored. So are the extra charges to be applied to so many old servicemen whose benefits from the Repatriation Department are being reduced. So is the miserable treatment applied to Aborigines. Any savings to this social expenditure now will be more than offset by the enormous increase in expenditure which will be required in future years because of the problems not being cured this year, because of lack of resources made available by this government now for Aborigines. Apart from the disgrace of it all-the lack of humanitarianism-it is just so short sighted. The Aborigine people will become increasingly bitter and this Government will be responsible for that. Lastly, I must mention overseas aid, although let it be known that I have a lot more I would have liked to have turned my attention to in this statement. The total appropriated for foreign aid by the Australian Labor Government in 1975-76 was $378.2m. This was an increase of $48.6m on previous years. Our pohtical opponents, the coalition parties now in government, slashed this $351m. They are now providing for 1976-77, thanks to some good lobbying by the churches and other aid organisations $400m, an increase of $49m on their relatively miserable previous year'sfigurebut of only $22m on our Australian Labor Party Government's figure. In other words, their increase is only 6 per cent on that provided by the Australian Labor Party's Budget of last year. This is a dechne in real terms when one takes into consideration an inflation rate of 13 per cent. And yet deceitfully the Treasurer's statement under the heading of Foreign Aid reads: Budgetary difficulues notwithstanding, the Government has decided on a 14 per cent increase in Australia's total overseas aid program in 1976-77. That is just not true. It is only 6 per cent on the figure appropriated last year. This is typical of so much that is misleading in this economic statement. One other area should be mentioned. If one adds up the details of the so-called figures reduced from the forward Estimates one gets nowhere near the $2,600m which the Treasurer alleges has been cut from those Estimates. This is one of the many things which breeds this aura, this atmosphere and this attitude in the community of a lack of confidence in this Government. In fact, Mr Speaker, in summarising I believe that the announcements of this statement are-of very serious consequence to Austrahans in a number of ways. Confusion has been created. Nobody knows the real cuts in government expenditure. Few know where they really stand with Medibank. This damage to public confidence has serious economic consequences. Further, the attitudes and policies of the Liberal National Country Party Government as continued in the announcements in this statement have created a set-back to the steady economic recovery which was under way before this Government came to power. We have seen that this is so by examination of the seasonally adjusted unemploymentfigures.In addition, the cuts in government expenditure, apart from their effects on confidence and on deterring consumers from spending, are deUberately creating unemployment. More men and women would be employed and more resources would be in use if only more government contracts were let. Lastly, in summary, I draw attention to the lowering of the quality of life by the dismantling of sections of the public sector and by instituting 2 classes of health care, to the unnecessary penalties applied to large sections of the Australian community on modest incomes in reducing their to take-home pay and to the increase in burdens on the States and local government-and thus on the people who pay State taxes and local government rates-in forcing more functions on those levels of government without providing the funds to carry out those functions. AU in all, this Liberal-National Country Party Government in under 6 months of existence can be thoroughly ashamed of itself.",40
74,Mr GARLAND,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"We have just listened to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), the Labor Treasury spokesman, replying to the statement that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) made last Thursday evening. He adopted throughout his rather lengthy speech a moderate tone. I think that calls all the more for an analysis ofjust what he has put to us as the official view of the Labor Party. He said, for instance- I can take up only some of his points as I have less time than he had-that unemployment was the main problem in the country to be faced by the Government. Of course it must be apparent to anybody listening to this debate that Labor's efforts created the highest unemployment in this country since the great depression of the 1930s. He said: 'It ought to be the principal objective of the Government to deal with this matter'. Later on in his speech he said that recovery recovery of the economy was the first step. Of course there we have common ground. But the dispute between our parties is as to how that should be approached. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) for his part has had a lot to say about economic recovery and how it should be achieved. The honourable member for Adelaide went on later to say quite clearly that he believes that the investment allowance ought to be abolished and the cost ought to be offset by a reduction in sales tax. Let us just pause there for a moment and ask ourselves: Which would have the greatest effect for the recovery of the Austrahan economy? Would it be an incentive for people to manufacture plant and machinery, providing employment in manufacturing and goingrightthrough the service industries, providing plant and equipment that can be used for productive purposes; or would it be the extra demand that we might expect from people presumably buying more goods after a drop in sales tax? I really do not think that any economist could come to the conclusion that such a reduction in sales tax would have anything Uke the recovery effect of the investment allowance, which is an encouragement by the Government amounting to near $500m. It is a progressive pohcy which I think will have a big effect in creating employment and in the future, enlarging the productive capacity of this country. But apparently the honourable member for Adelaide has stated the official Austrahan Labor Party policy, which no investment allowance and reduction of sales tax by an equivalent amount. He spoke of budget deficits and said that they are not an evil in themselves. We know that in Austraha we have an enormous deficit problem. When the Labor Government produced the was Budget before last it budgeted for a deficit of, think, $2,700m. At the time. I and other honourturing able members in this House said that there was no way in the world that the previous Governtor? ment could confine the deficit to thatfigure.Sure enough, thefigureended up very nearly double the estimate. In fact that indication in the original documents was grossly misleading. Of course no one is saying that a deficit is necessarily evil in every case. But the point is: the size of it and the attitude that should be taken to our whole economic policy in this country. If one says that the size of the deficit does not matter-ther e are honourable members in this place who say such things, some of them even on this side of the House-wha t one is saying is that one will leave most of the economic control to monetary policy, which of course is inadequate for the task. We saw what happened when Labor tried to draw in expansion by using only the money supply. One would also be saying that the size of the deficit, no matter what it is, is of no consequence. I remind the House that that view may be taken by some economists- I think Professor Wheelwright was mentioned-bu t it is not a view that is taken by any central banker or Treasury official of any of the countries in the Western World with comparable economies to whom I have spoken in the last few years; and that includes those from the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Belgium. In other words, those who are in responsible positions recognise that such fiscal packages are necessary and they recognise that a deficit can be too big. Each ofthose countries- I would hope the only countries with economies with which we would care to compare our economy-ha s recently instituted a similar package to the sort of package we are debating today. They have similar objectives. Those countries are very conscious of the size of deficits and they are trying to rein in their expenditures. It is all very well to put up attractive theories which state that one can have it both ways, but if one is in a position of responsibility, and Treasurers and finance Ministers of those countries are in that position, of course one cannot just do things that merely read well. As far as I can see it the solution put forward is by the Labor Party to meet our present predicament is to spend more. It is suggested that if money is spent in productive areas somehow it will cure our problems. I remind the House and the country that Labor tried all that in the last 3 years. It had its chance. If spending in productive areas is the major solution-that is mainly what put to us today-wha t was the effect in these I areas? Did we have a vast boom in the manufacsector, in the mining sector either, in development or exploration, or in the rural secWhere was the boom in Australia? I shall tell honourable members. It was in land prices and in the growth of Public Service employment. those other areas-manufacture , mining development and exploration and most rural industries-were in a position near disaster. is a result, in the main of Labor policies, not tirely, but in the main. This fiscal package which is put forward part of what is necessary for economic recovery in Australia is similar to packages recently put the United States and in the United Kingdom. Of course there was a time when the Australian Labor Party used to like to refer to Britain and say when the British Labour Party had done something'that it was a marvellous thing. Lookgovernments. ing at the state of the United Kingdom economy at present-rit is under a British Labour Party-i is strange that we do not seem to hear that argunatural ment today. We were told tonight that we are working an alien system and we had an outmoded way of looking at things by being concerned about the level of government expenditure and large deficits. We were clearly told, let the country nouce this, that the Labor Party is totally opposed to that outlook. In other words, means that it is in favour of a continuation of earlier policies. The Labor Opposidon beheves that we should not worry about the deficit and the level of expenditure, and of course because it follows, about the size of taxation ied in Australia, no matter what it does to perthose sonal initiative. The Government's present posiuon is not like the position of a company which acquires an unprofitable company. What atdtude does it take to that company? It says: 'This company we havething acquired is in such a mess that we will try by number of measures to get it on an even keel thefirstyear. If we are successful we will look some sort of stability and profit in the second year, it will not be done quickly, in the last elecing tion campaign we said to the people of Austraha: 'The posiuon is bad. The economy's position grave. It will take ume and tough be necessary. Tbis Government has been prepared to stand up and to face the posiuon and to take tough measures. The posiuon will not be cured quickly. As yet the Government has not the end? been in office for 6 months. This package is one step in getting this economy back on an even keel. What else would we really expect? What was promised to the electors of Australia if it not an effort to rein in the earUer extravagance and to bring taxauon to a lower level than anticipated. All In the last Budget the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), sold the idea successfully that the previous This Government was providing tax cuts. Of course enwe know perfectly well that no tax cuts whatsoever were provided. As a matter of fact, personal income tax was budgeted to rise by an additional as $2,000m. In Australia in recent years we have had the highest sustained level of inflation in our in history, a level which certainly was higher that that in our earUer years. After all, in the 1960s and earlier we had on an average an inflation rate of 2 Vi per cent over 15 years. That rate of 2 !6 per cent was sustained under Liberal Party But of course in the late 1960s and early 1970s we were aware of the world recession t taking place and great oil price rises, and it was that Australia would have an increase in inflation because of the pressures. But Labor came along with a lot of bright new policies, to some of which I might say would have been appropriate for the late 1960s but which were completely inappropriate in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975. The result was that instead of having an inflation rate of the order of about 8 per centthat is all Australia ought ever to have had be that cause the Australia economy was not much its affected by oU price rises-w e ended up in the dizzy heights which usually are associated only size of the with banana repubUcs. levLet us compare our inflation rate today with of other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with comparable economies. When the Leader of the unOpposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) was Prime Minister he used to say that we are 'near the top' we are 'near the bottom of the OECD list' or somelike that. But let us compare our position a with those economies that are well managed and in highly developed-wit h the exception of Great forBritian, of course. We do not, with respect to them, want to be compared with what is happenin Iceland, Turkey and other such countries. I am talking about the well managed economies. is We were fortunate to have a well managed econmeasures will omy untU recent years.",47
75,Dr KLUGMAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"What was your inflation rate at Mr GARLAND If the honourable member for Prospect had listened carefully he would was have known that I said 'sustained rate'. However, I do not want to be diverted. The position is that we had about double the rate that we ought to have had. Of course inflation is at the root of our problems. Of course inflation has made the employment situation worse- I think 'exacerbated' would be the word used by the Leader of the Opposidon to describe the situation. Of course inflation has made the interest ratesrise.We have had record interest rates. The Austrahan Labor Party had its chance in this area and it did not take advantage of it. It is not that it did not receive warnings. I take the liberty of quoting from a speech that I made in this House in 1971 after listening to speeches from the Labor Party's ranks. Speaking of the then and present Leader of the Opposition, I said: It is easy to promise and while he speaks with such nation of the last Budget and of inflauon, his own speech on that Budget and the 2 pohcy speeches he has made in the last 18 months are a catalogue of vast additional expenditure that he would make. It is a formidable increase which, if implemented, would result in catastrophic inflation. Perhaps I can be immodest enough to claim that that was prophetic. In endeavouring to criticise the package put forward by the Government the members of the Opposition are engaged in this debate in harping on emotional issues. They are going to say-it has just been said-that they accept from the package the benefits that are being given to the people, but they are going to hammer away at the areas which are to somebody's disadvantage. They will criticise anything that will result in the weight of an additional burden. That, of course, is common in such debates. The shifting of the burden of discontent always results in less gratitude on one side as against the antagonism on the other. The Government has developed a package which will result in the introduction of indexation, which is necessary to prevent people's tax rates from rising with inflation. It is determined to cut government expenditure. It is determined to put some limit on the blank cheque that has been signed in relation to Medibank because it knows perfectly that if the expenditure on Medibank is allowed to grow at its present rate it will grow so fast that the money needed for it can come only from future education and welfare. The Government is also providing an increase- a large increase-in child endowment, which will be paid to the mothers of children in areas in which there is real need and in which the private welfare agencies have said that such payment is so necessary. I am dehghted to support this Government and its package. I am dehghted that we have a government that is determined to tackle firmly Australia's major problems.",49
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (4.39)-The statement by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) on Thursday night spelt the end of any commitment by the Australian Government to the basic needs of the Australian people. It served notice to the world that one of therichestand most fortunate nations on earth cannot afford to give its citizens the minimum decent standards of health care, public transport, urban development and social amenities enjoyed by the people of all other advanced Western democracies-al l other well managed economies. Nowhere is the nature of the Fraser Government more clearly revealed than in the priorities set by indigthe Treasurer last week. The attack on Government expenditure in the Treasurer's proposals is not primarily an attack on the deficit but an attack on the living standards of Australians. Medibank as we know it is finished. Expenditure on urban and regional development is virtually ehminated. Public investment in transport is cut back. Any responsibility for the growth of our cities and the quahty of hfe of their people is abandoned. At one stroke the Government is condemning millions of Australians to secondrate housing, second-rate transport and a second-rate environment in second-rate suburbs and towns. It is abdicating its responsibility in the very areas where public expenditure alone can meet the people's needs. It is demonstrating the classic complacency of conservative governments-the do-nothing defeatism of successive Liberal Administrations which blighted the nation's progress for 23 years. During the election campaign the threat to all these programs was concealed in the usual wad of Liberal verbiage. The people were never told that Medibank, their sewerage programs, their growth centres, their urban transport improvements and their chances of buying land at fair prices would be virtually wiped out by a Fraser Government. It has taken the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) just 6 months since his policy speech to come clean about his promises. On television last night he was asked about his undertaking that education, health, welfare and urban programs would be retained. He rephed: You will remember those comments were made in the context of the last election campaign and in the context of what was going to happen immediately thereafter. In other words, all those fraudulent promises were for electoral consumption only. Yet for those who studied the Liberal policy documents closely the deception was clear from the beginning. By promismg that health, education, welfare and urban programs would not be curtailed in the present iinancial year the Government was able to disguise its intentions for subsequent years. The real mendacity of its pohcy documents hinged on a double-edged use of the word 'essential'. The public was assured that essential spending would be maintained. It was never told what the Government considered essential. Now we know. Nothing is considered essential. Medibank is not essential: Health care is again to become a needless worry and a needless financial burden. Growth centres are not essential: Our bulging and bloated capitals will continue to sprawl unchecked. Sewerage is not essential: A fundamental amenity for civilised populations is to be denied to hundreds of thousands of Austrahans. Land commissions are not essential: Man's one irreplaceable and immovable resource is to be handed back to developers and speculators for their personal enrichment. Spending on urban pubhc transport is not essential: No additional funds will be provided next financial year. New hospital programs are not essential: Funds for hospitals are at a standstill. The Liberals have never grasped that all these deficiencies, all these inadequate services and untackled problems add inexorably to society's costs. If human values do not concern them, at least let them think of economic values. It is not the Government's spending in these areas that constitutes waste: It is the Government's failure to spend. The real waste is in thetime,money and human resources dissipated by substandard services and public amenities which no other affluent nation in the world will tolerate. The high cost structure and built-in wastage entailed in overgrown cities are beyond estimation. The longer we postpone essential services like sewerage the greater the ultimate cost and disruption of providing them. The longer we delay the building of necessary hospitals and health centres the greater the cost in sickness, rehabUitation and absenteeism. The longer it takes to get to work on dUapidated trains the higher the toll in industrial production and human efficiency. The more deprived and backward our cities and towns, the greater the toll in crime and mental ness. All this neglect and impoverishment diminishes the nation's productivity, blunts its competitiveness as a trading nation and burdens its people with needless inconvenience and hardship. No other country In the world has neglected these areas as wantonly as Australia. No federal nation-the United States, West Germany, Canada-is abandoning federal programs in order to reduce its federal deficit or deal its economic problems. The least the Liberals do if they want to reduce expenditure is evolve some rational system of priorities. Where should our avaUable resources go first-o n a superphosphate bounty, on abolishing the meat export levy, on investment allowances, on school cadets? Or on land commissions, on sewerage, on national transport systems, on growth centres? These programs are not luxuries. They are essentials. For most Australians they are the only essentials. These are the indispensable conditions of advanced, civdised societies, and they can be achieved only by government action and government expenditure. No matter how great a person's income he cannot provide decent transport or decent cities for himself and his famUy without the intervention of governmentswithout government spending. The problem is one of growing urgency. In the quarter of a century between the end of World War II and 1971 Australia's population growth was increasingly concentrated in the major urban centres of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Between 1947 and 1971 the censuses of those years show that the percentage of Australians living in urban centres with a thousand or more people increased from 68.9 to 85.6. The 1971 census showed that of 11 000 000 people then living in urban centres, approximately 7 500 000 or 68 per cent, lived in the 15 largest cities. The only way to reduce the pressures on already overstrained and overburdened community resources is to encourage the growth of new cities. The Treasurer served notice on Thursday that the growth centre program will be terminated. In the favourite euphemism of the Fraser Government, it is 'subject to review'. The Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr MACKellar) admitted to his own statement on Thursday: The Government is fully aware of the problems that uncertainty can cause to business confidence in the centres and as a result has directed that the review be carried out as a matter of urgency. UlThe only respite for the condemned man is to be a hastening of his execution. For Albury Wodonga-the most successful and creative experiment in co-operative federalism-the Government is providing $9m to meet its legal commitments compared with $45 m sought by the Department to maintain the program at its natural rate of development. Other growth other centre projects are to lapse altogether. The commitment to Albury-Wodonga was with made on 25 January 1973 by the Premiers of can New South Wales and Victoria, my Deputy and me. It was spelt out in solemn agreements between the 3 Governments and embodied in a development corporation set up by the 3 Governments and already operating. Whatever one may think of growth centres, they are not something where the Federal Government alone has a divinerightto grant or withhold expenditure. Decisions by other governments and local government are affected. Decisions by private firms, developers, planning authorities and individual citizens all depend onfirmassurances of government support-o n government commitments. The Fraser Government's backtracking, far from eliminating waste, will endanger millions of dollars in private investment and will jeopardise the employment of thousands of local residents and public servants. As with cities and growth centres, so with hospitals and health insurance. The concept of Medibank, like Albury-Wodonga, was endorsed by a committee set up by our predecessors. The Nimmo Committee in 1969 called for a thoroughgoing reform of the old health scheme and described the private funds as bureaucracies. The pretence that Medibank will be preserved by the Fraser Government now deceives no one. People were deceived during the elecuon but they are deceived no longer. The Prime Minister has yet to explain how Medibank will be preserved when more than, half the Austrahan people will be forced out of it. That is how the Liberals will preserve Medibank-by chopping it in half. Medibank will be made so expensive that half the people now covered for free, automatic, universal health insurance will be driven to join vate funds. What waste and extravagance will be ehminated here? What are the savings for the Australian people? There is none. Employers, State governments, taxpayers and motorists are familiar enough already with the waste, dupUcation, inefficiency-and above all, ever-mounting costs-of compulsory private insurance for third party and workers compensation. The Fraser Government has now decreed that precisely the same pattern of waste and high cost will afflict health insurance. We are to get the worse of both worlds. Whatever arguments there may be for private health funds there can be no argument for a competing mixture of public and private funds. The Fraser Government is merely adding to the inefficiency and duplication of existing funds. Statistics tabled in this ment on 28 October and never challenged demonstrate conclusively that a single government scheme for third party and workers compensation would have saved employers and vehicle owners $225m thisfinancialyear. Here we have the clearest example of how a government's failure to spend produces inevitable waste and extravagance by the private sector. The withdrawal of hospital subsidies, the destruction of Medibank, the drastic increases decreed in pubhc hospital charges for intermediate and private wards will put the best medical care beyond the reach of even moderately well-to-do families. The Fraser Government is ensuring that private health insurance premiums will go on mounting year by year in the same way as third party charges to motorists. Every country in the world is facing steeply rising costs of medical care and hospital treatment. It is beyond question that the only way to rationalise and apportion these costs fairly throughout the community is by means of a single, comprehensive, national insurance fund. The only economical and efficient way to provide compulsory insurance is for a government to provide it. The destruction of Medibank will serve no purpose other than to revive the moribund private health bureaucracies. It is an ideological hangup by the Liberals. In April 1974 the Hospital and Health Services Commission presented to the Government a report on hospitals in Australia recommending an urgent program of capital expenditure on public hospitals, mental hospital facilities and pubhc nursing homes. My Government accepted the Commission's recommendations. The Fraser Government does not. There is to be no growth next year in the hospitals development program. Expenditure aUocated for next year will remain priat the level of $ 108m for thisfinancialyear. According to the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) the allocation will be $43m less than the Department's estimated needs. In other words, the program for new hospitals will come to a standstill. The Treasurer's statement offered no hope to Australians who want to buy land. The land price spiral will continue. The Fraser Government will do nothing to halt the growth of land prices-alway s the most expensive component in the price of a home. The statement last Thursday by the Treasurer and that of the Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development made it clear that Federal funds for land commissions will be curtailed. This is another area set down for 'urgent review'. Land commissions are already operating in South ParUaAustralia and Victoria and the Labor Government of New South Wales will be going ahead with a land commission shortly. Only through government intervention can the community ensure that land is made available at fair prices to homebuyers. Land commissions depend largely on Federal funds which my Government provided. The Department has estimated that $41m will be needed for the coming year. The Government will give nothing save the $ 14.3m needed to meet existing legal commitments. The Treasurer stated that an interdepartmental committee would inquire into land commissions. He gave a useful insight into the Government's thinking when he revealed that one of the committee's main considerations would be the 'viability of the private sector'-in other words, the private land developers and speculators who have grown rich on the hopes and savings of young Austrahans. There is to be a drastic cut in funds under the national sewerage program. My Government allocated $113m for the current year. The Department sought $145m for next year. The Government will provide only $50m. The National Estate program-a n investment of modest cost but inestimable pubhc value-wil l be virtually destroyed. Of the $8m sought by the Department, the Government will provide $ 1.35m compared with the $5m provided by my Government. Despite pious words from the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) there is to be no more money for urban public transport next year. The New South Wales State election showed how keenly people feel on this subject. Yet public transport is another field where there has been unanimity of advice from quaUfied bodies and experts. A report by the Bureau of Transport Economics available to the Liberals in 1972 drew attention to the need for investment in urban pubUc transport and the magnitude of the funds required. The broad thrust of that report was accepted by my Government in 1973. The Liberals are abandoning it. The Government maintains its deception and obfuscations even when announcing its new measures. It is difficult to discover anywhere in the Treasurer's speech",50
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,53
78,Mr HURFORD,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,I move: That an extension of time be granted to the Leader Opposition. MrMCMahon-No.,53
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,The question is: 'That an extension oftimebe granted to the Leader of the Opposition'. Mr MACKellar-Was some arrangement entered into? Mr E. G. Whitlam-The honourable member for Adelaide did not take aU ofhis time.,53
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"Those of that opinion say' aye', to the contrary' no'. Mr MACKellar-No .",53
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,An extension of time is not granted.,53
82,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,We just heard a speech read by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) which obviously was written by Graham Freudenberg. It was read without a great degree of enthusiasm or interest. It must by doubtful whether the honourable gendeman had any idea at all about the substance of the subject on which he was talking.,53
83,Mr BAILLIEU,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,It was lack lustre.,53
84,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"'Lac k lustre' is a very good phrase to use. I wish I had chosen it myself. I want to examine the performances of the honourable gentleman while Prime Minister. I cannot understand how he could have the hide, when judged against those performances, to get up in the House and condemn the Government after it has been in office for only 6 months whilst it has been trying to repair the devastating conditions that he himself created. I would Uke to mention 4 aspects. I point out that during a period of 10 years that we were in government we increased our gross domestic product by 5.2 per cent per annum, on the average. During the 3 years that the Labor Party was in government it reduced gross domestic product to 2.8 per cent, and in each of the last succeeding quarters of 1975 it was operating with a substantial deficit in national production. Those figures are unbeUevable in anyone's language, including the banana republics and including, if you like, other countries which are in critically desperate economic positions today. I can give the House the consumer price index figures. When we were in government from 1962 to 1972 the average rate of increase in the consumer price index was about 3.4 per cent. What did the Labor Government achieve under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition who of the has just sat down. The increase was nothing like 3 per cent, but the average increase during that period was 13.4 per cent. SimUarly, when we were in government average weekly earnings, which are the most important determinant of increases in prices and costs, increased at a rate of 7 per cent. But in the days of Labor the average increase was more than 18 per cent in 1972 to 1975. We heard the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), talking about unemployment. What credit can the former Labor Government take in relation to unemployment, when in the March quarter of 1973, to be handed on as a legacy from our Government, unemployment was down to 87 000. Today we have an unbelievably high unemploymentfigure,It is something of the order of 270 000. Labor had predicted that if it remained in office it would increase to 360 000.",53
85,Mr BAILLIEU,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,That is what it said.,54
86,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"Quite right. I want to speak about the bravado of the Leader of the Opposition. I have never known a man in all my hfe with such pretensions and delusions of grandeur as the Leader of the Opposition. I remember that four of five months after he became the Minister fbr Foreign Affairs he had not had time to do anything in that field because he was managing, so he said, about 10 other portfolios. No wonder he made a mess. Speaking about Curtin and another great man, Mr Chifley, he said on a radio interview that he regarded the 3 years of his Government as having far more influence on the development of Austraha than the 8 years of the Curtin and Chifley governments m the 1940s. I wonder whether there can ever have been a more contemptible statement. Does any honourable member opposite or any member of the whole of the Labor movement agree with that statement, or do they beheve that it is a show of vanity unequalled in Parliamentary life? But hold your horses Sir, I know that you are capable of reacting very suddenly and hostilely to a stupid statement. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say: Menzies, in his 16 years as Prime Minister, did not as much as I did in three. Mr Baillieu - Who said that?",54
87,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"This fellow who is up the back of the chamber gossiping with my friend from Hunter. I cannot understand a man who I admire so much talking to him in the friendly way that he is, especially after what I have just said about his performances in relation to national growth, inflation, employment and the other matters which I have mentioned. I cannot think of a greater failure in the history of this country than the honourable gentleman. It must be a surprise to everyone-ever y single thinking person in this House; every single person in the community-that a man with such a record can be sustained in office. Let us look at another angle of his criticism. As far as the 2 statements which have been made are concerned-the one made on television by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the other made in this place by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch)-the honourable member for Werriwa ought to listen to what Mr Hawke said. In the Australian of 24 May we see in the heading to an article that Mr Hawke, as the chief of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions, said that the statements are very acceptable. I simultaneously thought of a cartoon which appeared in the Australian of the same date. It depicted Mr Hawke looking at a railway engine which ought to be marked 'Labor'. Broken down, derelict, unable to pass the crossings or proceed further on the permanent way. It had Mr Hawke making this statement to Mr Fraser. 'I'd give you a hand, mate, only I would be wasting my time; there is a national rail strike now on'. He might have added these words: 'And you haven't yet overcome the problems created by my predecessor in the leadership'. He would be referring to Mr Whitlam. What are the national tasks that are immediately ahead of this Government which flow from the performance of its predecessor? We have got to repair the damage done by 3 years of Labor Government; 3 years of unparalleled damage that no one could ever have anticipated and which we all hoped would not in fact occur when Labor took office in 1972. First of all, we have to try to establish the essential conditions of national growth. I think, and I believe very deeply, that with sound government of the kind that is now being provided, we can get that growth again to go to a rate of 5.5 percent, which was the average during 10 years of former Liberal-Country Party governments. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has stated that we want, if we can get achieve it, an inflation rate of no more than 7.5 per cent nextfinancialyear. In other words, the Government recognises that in the case of a country like ours- a great trading country-w e cannot get out of step m inflationary terms with our trading partners or we will cost ourselves out of the international markets, cost ourselves out of production, and therefore cost ourselves out of increased employment. I turn to other things that have to be done. Of course, we accept the fact that unemployment created by Labor-a n estimated 270 000 unemployed-ha s to be reduced. I remember that when the present Treasurer was the Minister for Labor we had unemployment down by diligent effort to 88 000, according to the published figures, and it was reduced even further, in seasonally adjusted terms, for the succeeding 5 months. We want to restore confidence, and in doing so we want to make certain that investment increases, that business solvency and recovery are achieved, particularly in manufacturing industries and in building and construction. Let me look at the prelude, if I can call it that, to the Budget. First of all our changed pohcies were adumbrated by the Prime Minister and then filled in in detail by the Treasurer. Our income tax indexation scheme will expand the tax grouping and will result in a reduction in income tax paid of something like 13 per cent. It will mean there will be a cost to the Budget or a loss to revenue of $ 1,050m in 1976-77. That, I should state, is an estimate or forecast of forward estimates for 1976-77.1 point out that one of the changes that has been introduced and that the Labor Party ought to be saying something pleasant about is that for a single person there is the taxation threshold of $2,604 and for a man with a dependent spouse $4,299 before any tax is paid. Government forward expenditure has been cut from $4,700m by $2,600m to $2,100m. That is a cut in expenditure-no t the deficit, which is about $ 100m more. I turn to the third element, namely, child endowment. I do not think there is a person who does not welcome the change. Any person who has a regard for children and a love of family will desire to ensure that the mother will have a better opportunity to feed, clothe, entertain and ensure the recreation of her children. We were told by the Treasurer that more than 300 000 famdies and 800 000 people will benefit from that measure alone. Yet we hear the contemptible statement of the former Prime Minister, now the temporary Leader of the Opposition, that he does not beheve that anyone will benefit from the changes made in the proposals. He impUes that he does not believe in the women of this country; he does not believe in the kiddies except one whom he got promoted in an electoral division with the help of Mr Fred Daly. I want to look at the forward estimates because I think that this is one of our great problems. The Government rightly has not stated what it believes the forward estimates will reveal in terms of afinancialdeficit in 1976-77. It has not done what the former Labor Treasurer said that it should do. That is, to disclose the estimates of revenue itself. I am glad it has not done so, cause everyone ought to know, and above all the former Treasurer ought to know, that one does not reveal thosefiguresunless he is reasonably certain of what the amount is likely to be. The honourable member was able to turn an estimated deficit at Budget time of $2,960m into a deficit of $4,200m. This deficit, but for the actions of the Fraser Government, would have been between $5,000m and $6,000m. Under the circumstances can we take any notice of a man hke the honourable member for Oxley? That deficit of $4,200m is after the deduction of Australian savings bonds of well over $1,100m. Can we take any notice of that. Can we take any notice of a man who forecast in his one and only Budget that there would be a 22 per centrisein wages-it is now running at about 11 per cent- a 5 per cent increase in gross national productrunning at a negative rate-that employment would rise by 1 per cent-in fact it is falling-and that all the other assumptions as set out in table 2 of the Budget would be achieved? No, sir. If ever there was a faUure after Cairns and Crean it was he. I place him at the top of the list of failures or rather at the bottom of the hst of failures. Mr Nicholls-What about you, Bill?",54
88,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"At least I stayed in my Treasury portfolio for 4 years and did very well. I now come to this: I ask everyone who can analyse what are the likely effects of changes in policy in these 2 statements as a prelude to the Budget. No one can doubt that there wiU be a diversion of funds or spending power from various groups in the middle income and the upper income brackets into the pockets of the less well off groups, particularly the mothers. There is no doubt that there must be a stimulatory effect on consumption expenditure, not in the white goods it is true, but on food, clothing, entertainment and recreation, as I mentioned a few moments ago. No one can deny either that supplementary to this-and I have not heard this mentioned before by anyone, including members of my own Party-is in fact that housing is booming today. As houses are commenced and completed there can be no doubt that there will be a substantial increase in the purchase of the white goods section of Australian manufacturerefrigerators, washing machines and any sort of equipment that goes into homes, including radio and television. We have to remember also that supplementary to those policy changes there is already an investment allowance of 40 per cent with double depreciation. I believe that these policies in combination create part of the conditions under which we can hope for an increasbe- ing consumption expenditure with a multiplier effect and by means of the increase in consumption expenditure to ensure increases in the order books, then to the factories and then into employment. I believe that we achieve more than that, because under the present provisions, particularly with regard to the indexation of wages and income tax supplementary to an increase in wages and child endowment increases, we have estabhshed the proper basis on which we can now approach the trade union movement in order to ensure that the unions are persuaded come to the party and agree to an incomes and, more particularly, a responsible wages pohcy. I believe that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet wererightin agreeing to take action to make reforms to the secret ballot legislation because this provides the opportunity and the bargaining power to handle the most serious problem that faces this country today. That most serious lem relates to wages in excess of productivity. This does not complete the story but at least does present the foundation on which, with sible, reasonable discussions with the trade union movement we can hope-and we have good grounds for hoping-that we can get a sensible and proper response in the best interests of this country. I have not lost confidence in the trade union movement. I believe that there are more leaders in the trade union movement generally with common sense and goodwill than one have would gather from the actions and statements of the Australian Metalworkers' transport union and the building unions. I believe that there is a prospect- a httle prospect very perhaps, but growing into a bigger one as the expenditure days go by-that those wise men in the trade ordinary voter union movement will help the Government to some very skilled succeed in achieving goals that national development of this country and the 'wasted', as the Treasurerhave welfare of most Austrahan people.",55
89,Mr UREN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS," I have 2 reasons making this response to the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). As the former Minister for Urban and Regional Development I must say that my special area of concern has taken heaviest blows from the so-called 'expenditure cuts'. The communities concerned with the qualforecast ity of life in the suburbs were sufficiently large 1972 and again in 1974 to place and to keep Labor government in office. I , and my ment colleagues, were and continue to be deeply comunnecessarily mitted to the goal of a better life for the ordinary people in Australia. When in office we attracted number of skilled and dedicated people to plan and implement our government programs. In the area of urban and regional development we managed to bridge the gap between governwelfare. ment and the people. The community, for the firsttime,was consulted in a regular way. provision was being made for people and for the future life of our communities. Now in a bloodyof minded way this Government has hacked all ticularly those programs to pieces. It has not escaped the attention of thinking people in this country that the main reason for this savage attack on the Department of Urban and Regional Development to is petty, high-handed revenge by the Liberalpohcy National Country Party Government on concepts and efforts that were basically good for the Austrahan people. Dear as Labor's urban and regional programs are to my heart my second reason for responding to the Lynch Budget statement is probably the most important. That is this: That I see in the attitudes, the activities and the statements of this probGovernment, such as the one last Thursday, a fundamental, arrogant and aggressive attitude to it the ordinary people of Australia-thos e people senwhose interests the Austrahan Labor Party represents. Specifically I take the cornerstone of the Liberal-National Country Party Government economic pohcy-that is, that real wages must fall so that new investments can take place-to be an unnecessarily harsh attack on the interests of all people who rely on wages and salaries to provide for, and maintain, their standard of living. I to hand it to this Government; it has made a very clever effort at clouding its intentions to Union, the the man in the street. The Treasurer says that he has managed a significant cut of $2.6 billion in government for 1976-77. But it is difficult for the to understand that this cut is not saving of taxpayers' money will improve the that would otherwise been spent or seems to equate the 2 words. No, this much publicised cut is from the for forward estimates from the preliminary and rough projections for 1976-77 that are a normal early step in drawing up a Budget. It is almost as if the Treasurer has just discovered what the prothe cedures for Budget construction are. The Treasurer has cut $2.6 bilhon from a very rough figure. Afigurethat is 'secret' because of in Treasury's refusal to release it, and given the sly a behaviour of the Liberal-Country Party Govemin the past, quite possibly a fictitious and inflatedfigureinto the bargain. If this Government is trying to talk up business and a consumer confidence it will have to try something a litde less transparent the next time. The so-called mini Budget has been presented to the man in the street as some great advance in At this point I must say that I am pleased at the implementation of one of the Some recommendations of the Henderson report on poverty. Some relief is provided to the suffering the poorest families in our community, parby a measure directed at the children of poor families and is deserving of support. The only trouble is that the rest of the package bined with this Government's pohcies for reduction of real wages and the maintenance of high levels of unemployment in order to wage claims will guarantee that more and more managers. families and more single people, both old and young, will be sucked down below the poverty line. The package presented to the wage earnerthe plus items of wage indexation and increased endowment, combined with the minus of the they Medibank levy and the loss of deductibility for children-wa s presented as a 'sensible policy' that would add to his, the wage earner's, welfare. Yet from the Treasury minutes pubhshed in the Age newspaper, the Government knew that per cent of taxpayers would be worse off as result of the measures announced last Thursday night. Let us take this 57 per cent and work from there. Many of the other 43 per cent of wage salary earners will also be worse off in 12 time, if their incomes after tax do not increase at least the same rate as the consumer prices including indirect taxes. Under the arrangements worked out by the Labor Government wage indexation guaranteed standarding that growth wages would go up in Une with prices. Net wages were eroded to some extent by the taxation but amounts still close to the real wage very were maintained and employers became familiar with the principle that their wage bill would go up by an amount sufficient to compensate workers for pricerises.Now we are on the brink of shattering that understanding. The Fraser Government has not introduced tax indexation orchestrated out of any concern for the workers' tax bill. Prime Minister has introduced it as one contax venient part of a plan to break wage indexation and thereby ensures that the real wages of wage and salary earners is more quickly eroded. To the 57 per cent who were direcdy worse off as a result of last Thursday night, plus the great bulk who will also lose out when wage indexagovernment tion is busted, we have to add those who will lose out by the now widely anticipatedrisein indirect taxes. The Federal Government looks odds on to increase indirect taxes in order to balance the Budget in August. Also, since Mr Fraser's benefit, federalism basically means 'squeeze the States', it seems certain that the States will have to increase their indirect taxes simply to maintain on-going programs. Any of the wage and salary earners who have escaped so far have also to consider whether they have a mortgage on their home or hire purchase commitments because the inevitable outcome of the coalition's approach economic management is that interest rates wili comrise. Also, these people have to remember that the the Labor Government's scheme of making interest rates on housing loans tax deductible has temper been abandoned by Mr Fraser's economic There are around 88 per cent of taxpayers on less than $240 a week. Around 98 per cent are on less than $300 a week. This vast bulk of the people who do the work in our economy will lose out directly, in terms of their incomes and what can buy with them, as a result of the Fraser Government's economic strategy. On top of this there is an extra indirect loss. Because the provision of certain pubhc goods adds to the ordinary persons standard of hving, the pattern of 57 cuts in government spending announced on a Thursday night will mean maximum losses of pubhc services to the ordinary man and woman. An extra ship in the defence budget or the gross and and anti-egalitarian hand outs of superphosmonths phate bounties did nothing to improve the by suburban famUies' standard of living. The massive cuts in expenditure on sewerage, the shutting down of community health centres, the dismantling of Medibank certainly have reduced their of the of living-reduce d the standard of livmajority of Australians. The costs to vast majority of the people of this Government's economic policies and phUosophies is high. Now let us look at who benefits. Take, for example, the tax indexation and the Government s wages policies. The combined effect of these measures is a 2-fold Governmentbenefit to the private profit sector of The the economy. The Fraser Government provided indexation so that the employees' wage demands can be cast aside. In effect, the Government pays, in the form of revenue foregone, part of the wage and salary earners'justified incomes increases in 1976-77. This is not to help the employee, but it is to help the employer, at a cost to revenue. Then, the Government intervenes in the wages case, and makes the case for breaking wage indexation on the grounds that it, the Government, has provided tax relief. If that case is successful, the employers again their wages bUls do notrisein line with prices and the employees take the loss. The result-and this is the whole point of this Government's attitude-is that the private sector profits. When we really look at the Government policy intentions, we can see that those intentions make a mockery of the Prime Minister's claims that his Government is working for the well-being of all to Australians. Such claims are becoming as transparent as his attempts to talk up business confidence. I will go so far as to offer a litde advice. Government should begin to treat the people this country who sell their labour, if they can, earn a hving, with somewhat more respect. It should credit them with some more sense than it does at present. It should be somewhat more honest in its dealing with them. After all, 88 cent of them rely on less than $240 per week live. These are the people who will be hardest by the indirect losses brought about by the Government's economic package. These are the federalism. people whose standard of hving will drop because the Fraser Government has ceased vide important pubhc services to the community. expired. The Department of Urban and Regional Development was widely recognised as the vehicle for the Labor Government's concern with the quality of life and the provision of public services. The attack on the programs aimed at improving the quality of hfe amounts to no more than another attack on real wages. Real wages equate with living standards. Real wages are not just made up of money in the pay packet; an important element is provided by the quahty of hfe enjoyed by people. The cut backs announced last week in sewerage programs, in growth centres, in land commissions, in area improvement programs to local government, in transport, in the preservation of the National Estate mean that the Fraser Government is abdicating its responsibility to most Austrahans. These cut backs mean that the Fraser Government has contracted out of improving the quality of life in our major cities. It has turned its back on 85 per cent of Australia's population. This was done in the name of Fraser s federalism. Fraser's federalism is a policy which makes less money available to the States. It is a pohcy which says that the responsibility for cities, for transport, sewerage, for the supply of serviced urban land and urban improvement hes with the States and local government. It is a pohcy which says to the States and local government: 'If you want to improve the urban environment, pay for it yourself. It is a policy which means that the States will have to increase indirect taxes, or charge a surtax on personal income tax. It will mean that sewerage and water rates will rise, that local government rates will rise and that motor vehicle registration costs will increase. This will happen all because the Fraser Government has opted out of the Federal system. The consequences of this will be enormous. The Fraser Government and its federalism has returned Austraha to the 1950s and the 1960s. All this adds up to a lowering of living This standards-a n attack on our environment and of real wages. Because there has been a major cutto back by the Government on public works there will be a substantial increase in unemployment. I dare to say that by early next year the number of unemployed people in this country will be in per excess of 500 000. We have not seen such unemto ployment since the end of the Second World hit War. That is the pohcy that this Government has put down and that is the policy of Fraser's",56

91,Mr CORBETT,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"Having just listened to the prophet of doom-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren)- I feel that I should commence on a brighter note. I believe that, because of the Government's policy, next year unemployment will be reduced veiy substantially. I remember one of the Ministers in the former Australian Labor Party Government saying that he would resign when the number reached 250 000, but he did not do that. The policy of the former Labor Government was one of the reasons for unemployment being at the level we see today. In this debate the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) said that one of the problems in the country today was the Government's failure to spend. Certainly that could not be said of the Whitlam Government. It was that Government's failure to recognise that there is a limit to the amount of money that a government can spend and at the same time retain a sound economic structure that caused many of the economic problems we face today. One outstanding feature of the proposals contained in the economic statement of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is that the next Budget for deficit will be very substantially reduced without undue hardship on any section of the community. That is a splendid achievement by the Treasurer and by the Government. Its implementation should mean that we are on the way back to sound management of our national economy and that, as a result, we should be able to look forward to a reduction in inflation and a reduction in unemployment with a return to a soundly based national prosperity. That is the objective of the Government and this program is a very substantial step towards that goal. However, if these proposals are to be fully effective there will need to be a responsible attitude to profits by business organisations and employers generally as well as a responsible attitude to wage demands by unions. I say that not because I do not accept the fact that reasonable profits have to be made and reserves built up to tide businesses over difficult dmes, but in these special circumstances I beheve that it is encumbent upon every section of the community to adopt a very responsible attitude towards trying to achieve a more stable economy than that which we have at the present time. The Government has given a splendid opportunity through these proposals for these major sections of the community to work together with the Government for the common good of all Austrahans by providing an economic program which is vitally concerned with social justice in conjunction with sound economic management. The Australian community should think about that fairly clearly. Inflation has seriously and versely affected all sections of the community but in no area has it been more severely felt than in the area of the low income group and disadvantaged families. Indeed the Henderson Report on Poverty shows that those who suffer most from inflation and unemployment are the poor. That is a fairly obvious fact. It has become increasingly obvious that the system of taxation rebates was of little benefit to families whose taxation was either at a very low level or even non-existent. This redistribution of social welfare assistance will not be as costly to the community as many people may think. It is estimated to cost something over $ 1,000m in the first year, but that will be offset by a saving of some $900m by the aboUtion of the rebate system. It has been estimated that about 70 per cent of taxpayers do not claim rebates for dependent chUdren, so their take home pay will not be affected. While tax rebates for dependent chUdren have been aboUshed, the rebates for a dependent wife, housekeeper and daughterhousekeeper have been raised by 25 per cent from $400 to $500. In the light of the steeply increased cost of living, this is a well deserved increase for which the Government should be commended. To sum up, it means that the new approach to social welfare wiU go where the need is greatestthat is, to the lower income group and to the disadvantaged. In this way it is much more effective and much more equitable than any single social welfare measure introduced by the former Labor Government, despite the fact that that Government claimed a great deal of credit for what it did in this direction. This measure provides the complete answer to those people who are constantly claiming, without any foundation, that this Government is concerned only with the people in the higher income bracket. It proves conclusively that this Government has a better understanding of the needs of the poorer people than the previous Labor Government had, and that this Government is prepared to back that understanding with action. Some concern has been expressed about the proposals relating to Medibank. I have found this in my home State of Queensland where people have enjoyed free medical attention and free hospitalisation in public hospitals over many years. Those who wanted to insure to enable them to go into an intermediate ward or a private room and to have the doctor of their choice had avaUable to them the privately run organisations. These people are somewhat concerned about what it will cost them under the new scheme. I adbeUeve that there is some general confusion in relation to that matter. Therefore I think that people should not make a judgment on this matter in a hurry until the details of the proposals are known and understood so that individuals can then work out for themselves what they want to do under the new proposals and what it will cost them. One essential feature is that no one wiU be forced out of Medibank whatever their income level. That is something which has been suggested in this chamber. The Opposition has said that the proposed scheme will divide the community into 2 sections. No one will be forced out of Medibank unless he desires to leave it. So it must be remembered that the scheme does apply universally. Some people may prefer to obtain insurance through a private fund instead of through Medibank but that will be their decision when all the details are known to them. It is important to note that those on the lowest incomes, including pensioners, will receive Medibank benefits free of charge. Two-income famUies will not be forced to pay 2 levies. It may be cheaper for them to do that. If they decide to pay insurance premiums that will be their decision. It should be emphasised that the choice wiU be their own. Therefore I believe it is important that they should wait until they are fully acquainted with all the detaUs before they make that decision. It is noted that there will be no tax rebate for health insurance premiums. The new Medibank scheme will operate from 1 October, so people wiU have time to wait for the full detaUs before making a decision. I warmly welcome the personal income tax indexation proposal in the statement. One of the causes of continually increasing inflation has been that when wage increases have been apphed to cover increased costs of hving or for any other purpose, the wage increase has had to take into considerauon the greatly increased taxation that would apply to the individual when the wage increase was granted. Tax indexation is designed to lessen greatly the amount of wage increases needed to provide a specified increase in the take home pay. Because of the beneficial effects on inflation of personal income tax indexation there will be an inbuilt protection for the value of future wagerisesand there will be a protection of the value of savings that have been made down the years to the extent that inflation has been eating away at the value of those savings at a completely unacceptable rate. It is worth noting too that tax indexation will be providing increasedfinancialbenefits for the taxpayer year after year. Under the new scheme it is proposed that indexation adjustments will be automatic every year. The extent of the indexation will be determined by the rate of inflation over the previous 12 months. A very good feature of these proposals is that in future tax increases can be made only by legislation, which will require the Government to introduce a Bill into Parhament and have a debate on the proposed increase. It will allow the Parliament to debate the need for the increased taxation, and the parliamentary representatives of the people from all over Austraha will be able to present a case if they so desire against the increase or against the extent of the increase. This will bring, to this extent at any rate, in Government operations and, goodness knows, looking at the record of the last Labor Government it is hightimethat we took all steps that can be taken to keep any Government of this country as honest as the Parhament can make it. The Government is to be warmly commended on its decision to introduce full tax indexation on 1 July in addition to the 25 per cent increase in the tax rebate for a dependent spouse, housekeeper or daughter-housekeeper which I mentioned previously. There is also an increase by $150 to $350 in the single parent rebate. In both these instances the increases will be warmly welcomed. They are justly deserved. To obtain the full advantage of tax indexation I believe it will be necessary for all sections of the community to act with restraint in an endeavour to bring the full benefits of these proposals into operation. I hope this will be done by the community at large. If all sections of the community are prepared to work in this way to reduce inflation it can be reduced very substantially indeed. The Government recognises the need for restraint and has itself been active in the direction of reducing government expenditure where it is practical to do so. Of course, it is a great temptation for .a government not to do that because people are clamouring for expenditure everywhere. Governments are tempted to meet the demands of the community at large. Despite the Government's recognition of the vital importance of reducing the completely unacceptable size of the deficit which could have eventuated as a result of Labor pohcy, it should be noted that in some areas the Government has been sympathetic and understanding in relation to expenditure. I refer to the areas of education and social security as examples of the Government's understanding. Despite this, it looks as if the forward estimates will be cut by approximately $2,600m and that is a tremendous effort on the part of the Government in its endeavour to achievefinancialstability. In the field of social security no changes are to be made to the existing arrangements relating to age pensions and allowances, invalid pensions and sheltered employment allowances. Again this demonstrates the Government's sympathy for these people most in need of the Government's assistance. The Government is also embarking on a 3-year program which will cost some $225m to finance the backlog of aged persons accommodation applications. That expenditure will- I must add this in all fairness-be limited to $45 m in 1976-77. There is a very great need in this area and this is recognised within the community. In honesty my own area 2 aged persons homes have been built in recent times. I am very happy to see that the Government is making an effort to catch up with the backlog in this area. An amount of $140m will be available to local government authorities in 1976-77, and as someone has said, this will be available shortly so there will be a lot more done if we can get thefinance.People within the community have done a tremendous job in this area. That amount of $ 140m which will be available to local government authorities in untied general revenue assistance represents a 75 per cent increase. This is another area that has been badly treated over the years and to which the Government is giving full consideration. It has been suggested that 2 per cent of personal income tax should be made available to local government. As I understand that, this was going to be done. I hope that this does come about because local government does need it. In the area of local government, the authorities have had to keep on borrowing money to fulfil their obligations and they are in pretty difficult financial circumstances at the presenttime.It is high time efforts were made to relieve them of some of this burden. There will be a marked increase in defence expenditure. Surely there would be no one who would fail to realise that unless we have the pacity to defend our country we are running risk of losing it. Unless we are able to provide the security of Austraha then all the other things we are doing will be for nought. So I welcome increase in defence expenditure, some details which were given today. I believe that the Austrahan people must be brought face to face with the fact that we have been living beyond our means and that no of individual, no business and no nation can conlights. tinue to do that without coming reckoning. It is very fortunate that we have change of government because it will enable the present Government to apply those measures which will bring us back from what could have sured been completefinancialchaos resulted in a disastrous reduction in the value of event the Austrahan dollar. I beheve that the Ausabout along tralian media have been ungenerous in its apsomething proach to the economic pohcies put forward in again because the Treasurer's statement. For example, in one far. headline blazoned across a newspaper, or perhaps in more than one newspaper-this was mentioned here today-it was said that some per cent of the people would be worse off under the Government's proposals. The newspaper did not say that 43 per cent-eve n on its own figures; and they may not be correct-woul d at least be well or better off under the Government's provide posals than they were before. There has been splendid effort when one considers the total effort of the Government to restore financial stabUity to this country.",58

93,Mr WILLIS,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"The cona text in which this economic statement which we are now debating was brought before this House was certainly not as a culmination of 6 months successful management of the economy by the Government. Quite the opposite in fact. This statement was made after 6V2 months of office which this Government had not only not brought about a recovery but had stifled the recovery which was underway at thetimeit took office. the period that it has been in office we have not a reduction in unemployment levels but fact an increase over the last couple of months. Unemployment was falUng when this Governand ment came to power. It fell during the 4 months after October, but in the last couple of months for which thefiguresare avaUable it has in fact increased, that is taking unemployment on a seasonally adjusted basis excluding school leavers which is thefigurethe Australian Statiscatician says one should take. Inflationwise there the has been no sign whatever of any substantial for reduction in the rate of inflation. So on these 2 key indicators we can see there has been no the remarkable effort by this Government- a of government which came to power on the basis that the Labor Party could not manage this country and that it would be able to get the economy back on its feet, turn on the Ughts and all that sort thing. The fact is that it has not turned on the It has not put the economy back on its feet to a day of in those 6V2 months. had a The reason this statement comes before the House now is that the Government is being presby businessmen and others to do someand could have statementgetis the thing to economy going. That is why this being made. It is not just one more the line; it is a special event brought by the pressures on the Government to do to try to get the economy moving it has not succeeded in doing it so The objectives of the package as they are 57 outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) are twofold in my view. Firstly, to reduce the size of the public sector. That is said to be necessary to give the private sector room to expand and also to as reduce inflation. The second objective is to prothe basis on which to reach agreement with a the unions regarding wage moderation-agai n to try to reduce inflauon. In my view, and in the view of the Opposition, it is highly unlikely, for various reasons, that either objective wdl be achieved. The Government's decision to reduce public sector when the economy is in a reis a desperate gamble and I think everyone in this country should realise that. This is not sound economic policy based on solid economic forethought or analysis. It is a desperate gamble- a dangerous gamble at least-becaus e it of depends solely on an event over which this Government has no direct control. It depends entirely for its success on the consumers of this in country deciding to spend more money because by reducing Government expenditure the Government is taking out of the economy expenIn diture on goods and services thereby reducing seen demand for all the various products which are in produced in this country, and the only way in which that cannot lead to higher unemployment more recession, less economic growth and so on, is for people to start spending more money. So the Government is gambling on that happening. If it does not happen, then we are going to go into a far worse recession than we are in at the present time and have been in for the last year or so. I think there can be Uttle doubt that reducing government expenditure will accentuate the recession. The fact is that for thisfinancialyear, which has almost ended, government expenditure increased by 22 per cent. Under the Budget proposals put forward last Thursday night by the Treasurer government expenditure increases wiU be something of the order of 11 per cent which is a very substantial reduction. Indeed, given that the rate of inflation is now running at something like 12 per cent, and there is not likely to be any immediate substanual reduction in that rate, it seems likely that there will be no real increase m the rate of Government expenditure in 1976-77. So that is a very substanual change from the previous year. It is a substanual withdrawal of demand in the economy which must be made up somehow if we are not to have more recession. Secondly, the cutback in government expenditure undermines the confidence of consumers and investment. Confidence is something which I think we all agree is quite important. I refer to an article produced in the British PEP pubUcation in February this year by the Oxford economist Santosh Mukherjee. I think it is an important article. Talking of the importance of confidence to recovery, he said: Yet, in the words of the Secretary-General of the OECD 'Confidence is unlikely to improve if unemployment goes on rising and unless reasonably clear signs of recovery emerge'. Cutbacks of public expenditure before recovery has firmly set in would undermine rather than help to get European economies on the move again, and if the mcipient upswing falters, governments must be ready to restimulate demand. He is saying that it is highly dangerous to cut back government expenditure before the recovery has begun. No one in this country could argue sensibly that recovery has begun now. There are some signs that one might be on the way despite the efforts of this Government to this time, but no one could argue that a soUd, sound recovery was under way now. So it is a dangerous thing, as the article from which I quoted mentioned, to cut back public expenditure. As I have said, the Government assumes that consumers will increase their spending, but there are various reasons why this is unlikely to occur. Firstly, there is the recessionary environment which is created by the withdrawal of government expenditure, the factor to which Mr Mukherjee referred. When there is more unemployment, people are unlikely to cease squirreling, or salting away their money rather than spending it. It is generally accepted that the reason people have increased their rate of saving in the last couple of years is the much higher rates of inflation and unemployment we nave been experiencing in this country. Even if there were some cutbacks in the rate of inflation, if unemployment became higher people would still be likely to save their money, and we would not get the increase in consumer demand which would be necessary to get into the recovery stage. People would still be saving. Secondly, many wage earners will be worse off as a result of the package. At the point of implementation of the package, that is, when tax indexation is introduced and we have the Medibank levy and the child endowment and dependent children's tax rebate manoeuvre, a lot of people will be worse off. It has been said that 57 per cent of wage earners will be much worse off. Admittedly, most of them will not be much worse off but there has not been an increase in their welfare. I think it is illusionary just to look at the point of implementation. The point is that tax indexation is not a tax cut. Tax indexation simply means that the Government no longer increases the proportion of a person's income that it takes in tax. It is not a tax cut in the sense of reducing the proportion of income one pays in tax. It is simply a means of ensuring that the tax burden does not increase. So over time people will be worse off because tax indexation is only a tax cut if their income does not go up. If their begin to income goes up in line with the tax indexation formula and inflation it will not be a tax cut. It will simply mean that they will not have a tax increase. But the Medibank levy is a tax increase, which means that people will be paying a higher proportion of their income in tax. So there will not be a tax saving as a result of these measures. It was said originally that 57 per cent of people would be worse off at the point of implementation but, taken over the whole year, a vast majority of wage and salary earners will be worse off because they will be paying the Medibank levy in addition to having tax indexation. This is an important point in terms of whether they will increase their rate of expenditure or save. If they are worse off they are unlikely to increase their rate of expenditure. We must not lose sight of the fact that the tax deductions on mortgage interest payments have been abolished. A lot of people will be paying more tax because of this and therefore they will have no incentive to spend more money. The increase in child endowment and the abolition of the tax rebates for children mean that families will have less cash in their pay envelopes. They may have more money in the bank but it will go straight into a savings account. It will not be in their hands in cash and in that circumstance it seems to me rather hkely that there will be a tendency for savings as a proportion of income to increase rather than to be reduced. Furthermore, the tax deduction for private health insurance payments is to be abolished. This will mean that people who now itemise their private health insurance payments and claim more than the current block deduction of $540 to get a tax rebate will not be able to do that any more. They will be paying more tax. Taxpayers will also be worse off than it appears at present because there will be an increase in State government taxes and charges. Everyone acknowledges that the States will have to carry a bigger burden. Therefore they will increase their taxes and charges and people will be worse off. Furthermore, there is the possiblity of increases in direct taxes in the next Federal Budget. The Government has not said that it will not increase indirect taxes in the Budget. Indeed, the Budget deficit which one can work out from the statement made by the Treasurer last Thursday night will be over $3,000m. If the Government is to reduce thatfigureto any degree-ther e is some suggestion from Treasury leaks and so on that it ought-it would mean an increase in indirect taxes, given that most other aspects of reducing the deficit are tied up and given that the Government will not cut expenditure any more or increase income tax or company tax. The only thing left is to increase indirect taxes and if happens there will be less money in wage earners' pockets and therefore less incentive to increase their rate of expenditure, particularly as the Government has argued that such indirect tax increases should not be passed on by the Austrahan ConciUation and Arbitration Commission in the form of wage indexation. While the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is telling people to spend, his Government is encouraging savings. It is doing this in 2 ways. Firstly, it is doing it through the Australian savings bonds, which have taken over $ 1,000m this year and which are still taking savings. Undoubtedly they are an incentive for people to save rather than to spend. The rate of interest is still relatively attractive. The introduction of the homes savings grant scheme is another incentive for people to save to get the maximum grant. Clearly, there are many reasons for assuming that consumers wiU not increase their spending. In fact, there are a lot of reasons for thinking that they might be persuaded to reduce their spending somewhat. All this is based on the Government's ideological hangups about the size of the government sector and the size of the deficit. Previous speakers from the Opposition have made the point that the size of the deficit is not related to the rate of inflation. Indeed, we have shown in previous debates that there is no correlation between countries which have a large deficit and high rates of inflation, nor is there any correlation between countries having a large government sector and high rates of inflation. One can get almost the opposite picture by looking at the statistics. One of the motivating factors is an ideological factor rather than an economic factor-a n ideological hangup about the large government sector. In fact, the Australian government sector is not large. Compared with most other countries it is a small sector. Figures pubUshed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last year showed that of the 24 OECD countries the government sector in Australia was the sixth lowest. Yet, by the way that the Prime Minister talks and the way that the Government is acting, one would think that Austraha was near the top. Most countries, including the United States of America, have a much bigger public sector than we have. Another factor I refer to is the second objective of the package; that is, providing a basis upon which the Government can get co-operation with the unions to reduce the rate of increase of that money wages. This has been given great importance by the Prime Minister but it is highly unlikely in the Opposition's view that the package presented by the Treasurer on Thursday night will enable such co-operation to be obtained. There are various reasons for that. Firsdy, while attacking wage indexation and arguing for reduced real wages, the Government gives most workers Utde, if anything, by its recent measures. The Government is arguing for wage indexation on a basis which means real reductions in wages for all workers earning more than the minimum wage. It is arguing that full indexation should apply only to the minimum wage and above that all workers would get a reduction in their real wage. They would get the flat money sum which would be obtained by applying the indexation factor to the minimum wage; this means, therefore, reductions in real wages for all workers. That is a basic element of the Government's policy at this stage. Yet, whUst trying to get the union leaders to co-operate the package gives them absolutely no reason to say to their mema bers: 'Look, you have something from the Government-bi g tax cuts'. There are no big tax cuts. There are tax increases. In the main, and salary earners will be overwhelmingly worse off by this package. There is nothing in the packmakes age which gives the unions reason to say members: 'Let us co-operate with the Governconcernedment. Let us cop reduced real wages. We will get it back in tax cuts'. The unions will not get reduced taxes from this package. In the States of America and in the United Kingdom, where attempts have been made to get trade not union co-operation, the governments have gone out of their way to make big tax cuts and have tried to give the unions something to hang They have said to the unions: 'You can get what you have lost back another way'. But that is happening in this country. Also what the Government gains in goodwill by introducing tax indexation- a basic union be objective-it loses completely and utterly Medibank levy, not just because of also because of the conceptual factor. Medibank is something which unions appreciated and wanted and they are upset about the attacks on which have been launched by this Government. It is not just the cash; it is the conceptual as well. The Government has paid no attention to selective employment programs. It is running down the National Employment and Training scheme. It is giving no more money to apprenindexation ticeship schemes. It is having nothing to do with schemes like the Regional Employment tax Development scheme. It is showing no interest looking after jobs.",61

96,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"He rambled on very quickly. He was very nervous. nobody on the Government side says and no sensible person says that a deficit is of its nature a bad thing. Nobody with any sense says that. What has been said and what I have said over and over again is simply this: It is an absolute tragedy that Australia's economy was so under1919 utilised that the Government, which is now the Opposition, had to plunge this country into deficit qf over $4,000m. The size of that deficit reflection of the size of the failure of the previous Government to have the economy operating at full employment level. That is a fair dewage finition of what a deficit is about. The second point the honourable member is that he is not worried about the size of to their the government sector. He was overI was fascinated with this overconcern-to say all the time that the tax indexation proposition, so strongly supported by the United honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) and myself in the Liberal Party, is really a reduction in tax rates. A Bill before Parhament is designed to bring in tax indexation. It involves a reduction in effective tax rates by 13 on to. per cent. It does that by changing the tax brackets. If one lives in a continuum in terms of not economic experience it means that the proposed rates of tax to be paid after 1 July of this year will be 13 per cent below the proposed rates of tax to paid during June of this year. That is an effecby the tive reduction on any simple common sense the cash but analysis of the proposition. Let us look at the other side of the argument. A few months ago the Opposition, when in governit ment, was arguing that it could not introduce tax indexation. Members of the Labor Party said aspect they could only go a certain way towards introducing it. They said that they might look at it. Their proposition would have amounted to $395m. They said they could not introduce tax because it would reduce revenue too much. They were saying that they could not give cuts of that size. That was the argument a few in months ago in 1975. The fourth point made by the honourable member is another fascinating He was saying that the transferring of some rebates and other funds to family allowances means that money is more likely to be saved than to be spent. Anybody knows, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) has said it over and over again over the years, that the respending coefficient of cash transfers is be much higher than the respending coefficient of wages, and the tax rebates represented disposable income in the form of wages. Therefore the honourable member for GeUibrand in 15 minutes made only 4 errors, but each was very In the first place significant. There are those who look at history as they look at a scroll. They see history over a long period and draw a line and try to compartmentalise one period from another. They look at and say that what happened then had nothing to do with 1918 and before; that what hapa pened in 1933 had nothing to do with 1932 and is before. They say that they will draw a line across 1945 and say that 1946 was a completely new ball game. The Opposition, with this distorted view of history, is trying to draw a line across scroll as at the end of 1975 and say: 'Let us forget all that happened in 1975 and before'. I promise the Opposition that it will not be allowed to get that. It is not only silly pohtics but also very distorted picture of any reasonable view of history. The Opposition has to live and it must Uve overall with the economic history which it created.",64

All the time that the Opposition was in be Government I felt it was committed to fuU emfiscal ployment, but it was not committed to the other side of the bargain. To use Beveridge's famous words which revolutionised the Western world, one can attain full employment only in a free society, in a society which is predominantly a vate enterprise society, which is predominantly free enterprise society. It cannot be attained otherwise. So the headlong run into the made. replacement of private with pubhc expenditure by the Opposition when it was in government represented an ideological commitment. I make the point because it is important. To Ulustrate this crucial and central point, I quote from a nal caUed the New China News which is put out by Peking China. The issue of 19 May states: No Unemployment in New China Peking-There is no unemployment in New China. Among the 800 million population even the blind mutes take pan in work that is within their power under care of the Pany and the State. Those last five or six words are important cause they contradict what should be the aim any government here, whether it is a government from the Labor Party or the Liberal and that National Country Parties. One can obtain free choice and full employment only in a society in which private enterprise is expanding as rapidly foras possible. That brings me back to the other it is a point. The central feature of our society",65
99,Mr UREN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,'Rapidl y as possible' is the big question.,65
100,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) might laugh. He produced explanations for the 3 years of Labor which resulted only in misery being we caused. I was fascinated when he spoke here this We afternoon. He said that he regretted what is being done with growth centres, parks and expenditure on aU kinds of institutions. He said one word to express regret at what he a senior Minister had helped to cause in terms of full employment. It is no good having growth parks and free institutions if they run only on the same track as in a country where hundreds of thousands of people are on the dole. That represents the phUosophically different posaccordition between the Opposition and the Concerning the package itself, the honourable member for Gellibrand, who is a clever person, attempted to analyse the fiscal aspect. I have respect for him as a clever person. But he the made 4 errors and the nature of those 4 errors were pointed out before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. In total thefiscalpackage might mUdly deflationary. The positive sides of it in terms are the change to child endowment, tax indexation-whic h is one of the most important changes ever introduced in Australia-and , of course, a transfer from the rebate system to a cash transfer system. The negative elements are prithe fact that government expenditure is not prea sumed to rise in real terms over the next year and of course some health payments will have to be But underlying all of this has to be the proposition that private enterprise needs to expand in these circumstances. This brings me once again to looking at the jourposition of the Budget deficit. We say that the national deficit, as defined by this Budget, exists in order to cause economic activity to occur. That is a flexible definition. If it can be so organised or financed as to cause more economic activity to and deaf occur than would otherwise be the case one the changes the nature of the Budget deficit to do so. The Opposition used the Budget deficit in order beto make what was predominantly a private of enterprise economy into one which became a minority private enterprise economy. There is an economic and an ideological difference between the Opposition and the Government in respect of that matter. The package that the Government has offered is a unique package which has been offered in a country which is trying to bring cost pressures under control. Whenever there was significant inflation in Austraha before, or whenever mini budgets were brought in before-in 1953, 1956 and in 1974-the basis of the package was never designed to guarantee disposable dollars to people in order to encourage them to cooperate in the matter of bringing cost inflauon under control. They missed. For example, in 1974 when the Opposition was in government it introduced a reduction in tax rates which nificantly less than the reduction which is being made now. So the key of the Government's program is to try to guarantee disposable doUars in the pockets of those who need the dollars in order to co-operate in the batde against unduly rising cost pressures. In a sentence, that is the way m which we hope that the package will be understood. The British Prime Minister at present, Sonny Jim, who is a respectable person with a respectThat able history as a member of Parliament and in terms ofhis values, has problems with cost pressis ures but he is not seeking to make an offer which guarantees disposable doUars in the way in which this offer is designed to guarantee them. One cannot dispute the Government's intentions and motives in that respect. The key of any government's attitude has to be its attitude towards deficits. In no circumstances can a deficit be allowed to become an absolutelyrigidpropEnough osition. If it were to become arigidproposition there are many different ways by which deficits can befinanced.By fastening one's figures one forgets that a deficit is there for the purpose of generating economic activity. The Opposition used a deficit as an ideological comthe mitment to change the balance and the nature the Australian economy. It was one which could not deUver Beveridge s proposition of full emthe ployment in a free society. The Opposition wanted to socialise the community and to tem bureaucratise it. That immediately removes of the sentence which mentions full employment but one also has to consider the nature of society. Over the previous 3 years the previous Government made all kinds of explanations as to the position it was in. It almost added an explathere nation daily. But it should be remembered that the Opposition cannibalised the Australian econthe omy over those 3 years. It destroyed its innards and its soul and it did it by its control of expenditure. Above aU, it forgot the balance that needs to be induced in the Austrahan community in order to get progress. By the introduction of this package the Government is attempting to restore that balance. I beheve that it can be put back again. But, above all, those people who have a vested interest in the economy not developing, or who have a vested interest in destroying confidence, are the ones who will do the greatest harm to Australia and to the Australians who are most vulnerable. It is the most vulnerable Australians that the Government has attempted to deal with and to help in terms of the disposable dollar package that I believe it has marketed especially for the benefit of the Conwas sig- ciUation and Arbitration Commission. Debate (on motion by Mr Nicholls) adjourned. NA COMMISSION BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 May, on motion by MrStreet: the Bill be now read a second time.",65
101,Mr UREN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"The aim of this Bill to destroy the regional concept of assistance to local government which was carefully built up by the Labor Government. This is implied rather than stated plainly in the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), which faUs to put the Government's much vaunted new federalism policy into any sort of logical framework. has come out of the speech to show that the marked improvements in support for local government made over the past 3 years are mind on the about to be destroyed. I want to commence my remarks by looking at impact of these changes on the evolving conof cept of regionahsm. Then I want to look at the impact of the Government's federalism policy on finances and the functions of local government. The Minister claims that the regional sysis artificial and that this artificial system has half been imposed on shires and councUs against their will. According to this sort of fuzzy thinking the regions are a tool of the evU central government designed to frustrate local government units and deny them the funds that they need. That sort of distortion ignores 2 points. Firstly, has been a very high degree of acceptance of regionalism by local government. Secondly, use of regional organisation is by far the most effective way of delivering a large number of pubhc Government programs at the community level. Let me develop those points in turn. There is no doubt that in the initial stages much of local government was sceptical about the sort of regional framework we sought to develop. Each local government unit had become used to working in its own area. It took some vision to accept that there were advantages in joining together on a regional basis. It is also true that much of the previous experience with regionalism had been unfortunate. For example, previous federal governments had worked with some 38 different concepts of regions for the functioning of day-totity day government. There were also completely differing sets of regional concepts devised by State governments. Those regional concepts were reflected in sets of regional boundaries which showed remarkable variations. As a result, local government had to thread its way through a confused and inefficient maze of regions. It is little wonder that the regional concept was unpopular with local government. We set out to overcome that bad image and to put regionalism on a rational basis. We tried to define sensible groupings of regions which could be used for a whole range of functions and programs by all levels of government. Rather than seeking to impose regions upon the States and local government, we worked very closely with the State and local government authorities in deciding the best regional boundaries. In the great majority of cases those regional groupings were the same as the groupings favoured by the States. Where the regional groupings did not exist, as in some major metropolitan areas, we suggested the boundaries. In the beginning, some States were not happy to apply the groupings in the large cities, but they accepted the regional concept for Grants Commission purposes after dialogue between officials at an Australian-State government level. In no case did we impose a regional grouping which was not acceptable to a State government. Gradually the States came more and more to see the merits of the regional framework and to work within it. Over the 3 years of the Labor Government there was an increasing acceptance that the regional organisation of councils that we had defined should become the basis for all regional programs and regional administration. Even more encouraging was the marked movement of local government to strong support for regionalism. That was reflected in resolutions passed by local government conferences and in statements by local government spokesmen. There is no doubt in my mind that the majority opinion of local government now favours the use of regions as a planning tool and as a vehicle for program delivery. In no sense is the regional concept that we sponsored an artificial one. Most of the boundaries for State and local government units are artificial. The logic behind the boundaries of the mainland States and the shires and councils of Austraha are lost in the archives. It is not possible to define 75 or so regional boundaries with complete logic, but we tried to bring local government units together in accordance with an idenof interest. That was not always possible, but for the most part the job was done as well as it the could have been done. In the purest sense the regions may be artificial, but they are no more artificial than most of our other units of government. The initial reason for drawing up the regions was our decision to open up the processes of the Grants Commission to local government. By loosely grouping more than 900 shires and councils into 70 or so regions it was possible to evolve a regional framework for the purposes of the Grants Commission. This framework was gradually being extended to our other programs-in particular, the area improvement program and the Regional Employment Development scheme. At the sametimewe were bringing those regions based on local government units into closer harmony with the regions evolved for the Australian Assistance Plan. It is no secret that there was some conflict between those two sets of regions. The Australian Assistance Plan was based for the most part on the participation of community groups, and this was resented by local government. On the other side, community groups which felt that they had got nothing out of local government preferred to work through a regional concept based on the community. There was an element of justice in both arguments. One of the great things about the regional approach was the way in which it brought a closer relationship between local government and the level of community participation. Much of the community was alienated from conventional local government. But the programs of the Labor government for thefirsttimebrought the national government down to the community level. The demands of the programs brought local government and the community into a closer working relationship. In many ways that was the greatest achievement of regionalism. It was reflected in the growing awareness that the 2 patterns of regionalism could be reconciled. The Labor Government was also extending the use of the regional concept in other ways. Much work had been done in selectprograms ing regional centres where the Australian regional Government could decentralise and locate its services. A lot of the work of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government as a Administration was directed towards decenState tralising the services of government. In particular much progress had been made in the area of switching the delivery points of specific services out of Canberra and out of the State capitals regional centres. This was thefirststep in a planned evolution of administration away from the centre. This process of getting government away from the centre and out to the people has been tragically reversed by the so-called new federalism. The people of Austraha should ask: Who are the centhroughout tralists? Is it the Government which makes a firm commitment to switch pubhc servants and proremoval gram delivery out of Canberra and out of capital cities to regional growth centres and other centres? Or is it the Government which scraps the transfer of Australian pubhc servants and wipes out the programs on which decenfinancial tralised federalism linking the community the 3 levels of Government can be based? The pohcies of new federalism are strongly centralist policies; I have no doubt about that point. The record shows that our party was antipoorer centralist. The Department of Urban and Regional Development, in particular, was an anti-centralist department and everybody knows it. Whether Mr Hamer or Mr Dunstan is asked one will find that they will stand up and publicly agree with that statement. The 3 years of Labor Government included the most concerted effort in Australian history to reverse the centralist thrust of federaUsm.This process was hinged on building up an effective basis of regionalism, process which is aboUshed by this centralist government with this centralist Bill. There is no doubt that support for regionalism is growing. I want to refer quickly to just one example for this backing. There are many others but this is one of the most recent. I refer to a gram from 8 South Austrahan regions representgovernments ing more than half of that Stated population. was sent earher this year to Senator Greenwood. The telegram asserts the aim of the regional organisations to continue working together be the cause of the value to local government of concommissions solidating on a regional basis. It goes on to Ust strong reasons for the value of regionalism forum for local government to discuss and resolve common problems; as a structure it through which general purpose planning may occur; as machinery for delivery of government and funds; as a delivery point for services; as a means of spreading information; as a means of giving professional help to member councUs as they cope with change; and means of giving advice to assist federal and governments in decentralising their functions. All are strong reasons for the preservation of regionahsm. Despite the wide support of local government, this process of voluntary and coto operative regionalism based on groupings of shires and councils is to be destroyed by this Bill. Three years of painstaking effort to get a regional system working is to be axed at a time when it is plainly successful and welcomed by local government. Now the only statutory basis for regional organisations of shires and councUs Australia is to go. This is the first tragedy of this reactionary Bill. The second is the of the Grants Commission from the prothe cess of local governmentfinance.There is no to doubt that this has been a great boon to local government. The Grants Commission has unique experience in the process of equalisation of assistance. By opening up this expertise with to more than 900 local government units throughout Australia principles of equalisation were apphed to local government. The whole thrust of this effort was to bring assistance to shires and councUs whose facilities and services were lagging badly behind. Undoubtedly there were defects in the process because we cannot buUd up this sort of machinery overnight. A handful of shires and councils missed out on grants and a small proportion of councUs felt that they had been shortchanged. The overwhelming number of councUs accepted the formulas appUed by the Grants Commission and welcomed the quite substantial assistance it provided. Now a access of local government to the Federal Grants Commission is to be abolished. Instead, the Government is to allocate afixedproportion of revenue to local government. Part is to be allocated on a weighted per capita basis. We know what this means. It will be weighted telein the same unfair and unjust way as coalition have weighted the electoral boundIt aries. Areas of real need which benefited from the Grants Commission approach will be sacrificed to the wealthier councils. The rest of aUocation is to be distributed by new grants to be set up in the States. This is the 7 policy of the so-called coalition of small governas a ment. It abolishes the work which was being done effectively by one commission and replaces with 6 State commissions. A government pledged to cutting out waste and duplication has no qualms about forcing duplication on the States. It should also be stressed that the Federal Grants Commission has built up expertise in principles of equahsation over 40 years. How can the new grants commissions of the States match these skills and experiences? Honourable members know that the skills and experiences necessary in such grants commissions are in extremely short supply in this country. Now the Government intends to abohsh one such commission and create another six. There is going to be competition. Do the States have the money and the apparatus, the strength and the will to set up these grants commissions with the necessary expertise to carry out equalisation programs? Can such bodies equal the experience of the Federal Grants Commission with its 40 years of expertise? Even the Federal Grants Commission has developed enormously over the last 3 years as a result of its involvement with local government. Not only was there a difference from State to State, even within States we found a great of inequaUty. That is why the Labor Government moved into that situation and supported that concept in the first place. If we look a Uttle closer at the percentage of personal income tax going to local government it emerges quite strongly that local government will lose from this change. I know that local government always has urged that it be given a fixed proposition of revenue in this way. On the face of it local government might appear to be better off. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has announced that $140m will go to local government in 1976-77 under the new formula. At first sight this seems substantially more than the $80m distributed last year in the operation of Labor's equalisation program under the Grants Commission. But if we look a little closer it emerges quite plainly that local government wiU be much worse off than it was in the last 2 years. For a start there is the spht-up between per capita grants and equalisation grants. There doubt that the Government is strongly in favour of most of this money going into per capita grants. The principle of equahsation, of giving help to the needy shires and councils, will be given very low priority. AU the States except Western Australia want most of this money to go into equahsation grants. So do most of the local government units. That is the view of the States and that is the view of local government but this centralist government has made up its mind. It set its pattern without dialogue with local government. Yet the lion's share of this $140m will be directed to local government in a way which will produce gross inequities. There will be a redistribution of income away from the poorer to the wealthier shires and councUs. Another factor is the appUcation of tax indexation which substantially reduces the value of personal income tax as a growth tax. For this reason the State governments have sought assurances that the new growth tax will not be eroded by indexation. No such guarantee will be appUed to local government. Even if local government thinks that it is starting off well in the first yearand I question that it is-it will steadily fall behind. Another element of strong injustice to local government is that the decisions on what it gets wiU be made at the June Premiers Conference, where local government will not be represented. Tbis leaves local government at the mercy of State Premiers who have never been disposed to treating local government fairly or to increasing deal its access to funds, as honourable members opposite will know, because they opposed the referendum we put before the people of Austraha in relation to local government, just as many of the conservative State Premiers opposed it. Even the level of assistance going to local government is open to criticism: The States and local government have sought a minimum of 2 per cent a year. The allocation of $ 140m is well below the 2 per cent of personal tax collections; it is nearer to 1.5 per cent, and possibly below that figure. Even at the outset local government is getting a bad deal from the 'New Federalism'. If we take into account the funds which flowed to local government from Labor programs, most of which are now abolished, local government is worse off. Local government got a substantial injection of funds from the national sewerage program. Funds made avaUable under that prois no gram have been savagely slashed by almost 60 per cent, and local government will suffer. About 75 per cent of the Regional Employment Development scheme money went to local government. That scheme has now been abolished. It should never be forgotten that that employment creating scheme, based on local assistance, was chaUenged in the High Court of Australia by a Liberal Government at a time of rising unemployment. Now the Fraser Government has completely abolished the scheme, even though unemployment is stUl high and will certainly increase in the months ahead. The Area Improvement Program, which gave substantial assistance to deprived regions throughout Australia, has been abolished. The national estate program has been chopped. Much of that assistance also flowed through to local Government. Federal funding of the Austrahan Assistance Plan, which was devoted to local activity, is on its last legs. Other community programs have either been abolished or reduced to the point of uselessness. If all of these programs are taken into account, then the new federalism has brought heavy penalties to local government. In the 1975-76 Budget Labor made about $230m available to local government. If honourable members examine the Budget Papers which are available in the Bills and Papers office they will clearly see on page 133 of Budget Paper No. 7 that $230m was made available last year to local government. Thatfigurecan be compared with the $140m proposed to be made available this year. That $230m represents about 2.2 per cent of personal income tax yield. Taking into account indexation and expected lower tax yields, it would amount to about 3 per cent in 1976-77. Honourable members should compare that with the $140m, or less than 1.5 per cent, that this Government intends to direct to local government. I stress that thefigureof $230m does not include, with the exception of the Area Improvement Program, the programs I listed earlier; nor does it include assistance to local government for roads. If all thesefiguresare totalled, there is no doubt that local government's relative position has fallen dramatically. That is what the new federalism has done to local government. It has given it the illusion of greater freedom and independence from its new federal partners. But at the same time it has chopped off much of the flow of existing revenue to local government. It has redistributed the amount of assistance given in a grossly inequitable way. The new federalism is a gigantic fraud. The States were conned into looking on it favourably at the last Premier's Conference. They will not be so charitable in June. Ask Sir Eric Willis what he thinks about the new federalism. Ask any Premier who has to counter therisksof double taxation what he thinks about new federalism. It is just as dangerous and unfair in its treatment local government. Local government should be aware of the fact that it will lose hand overfistif it blindly accepts the new federalism system. There is no doubt in my mind that the new federalism will be a colossal failure. In a year'stimeit will be so badly discredited that it will be doned. The Labor Party has nothing to fear from these pohcies of new federalism. The victim of the new system will be the State and local government bodies which have put their faith in it. This tragic experiment which is doomed to fail has destroyed 3 years of creative work in evolving a new federal structure based on the community and linking the 3 tiers of government together in decentralised patterns of administration. We completely oppose the Bill and we completely oppose the federalist philosophy which underpins it.",66
102,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"The Commonwealth Grants Commission Bill which is before the House is a significant piece of legislation in that it is part of a framework introducing the Fraser Government's new federalism policy. We heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), a long dissertation on regionalism, but what he failed to tell the House, as he failed to tell the people when he was in government, is that the Labor Government sought to use regionalism as a means by which to change the structure of government in this country. No one would deny the importance of the various spheres of government co-operating and working together for the common good of the people, for it is quite clear that very often the implications of a program or a proposal extend beyond the boundaries of one local government body, beyond the boundaries of a State, and affect wider areas. But the use of the need for an examination of that type of inter-relationship as a cloak to cover a mechanism designed to change the political structure in this country needs clear identification. The reason why the Labor Government in office pressed to establish regions, which in fact were not used by the Grants Commission other than as an easy way in which to receive evidence from the 900 local government bodies throughout Australia, was that it ultimately wished to change the structure of government in Australia in order that legislative power could be centralised in Australia. We in the Government today do not believe that legislative power should be centralised. We believe that it is in the best interests of the Australian nation that legislative power should be distributed among 3 of spheres of government.' We believe that wherever possible the power to legislate should be as close as possible to the people affected by the decisions involved in that legislation. That is an attitude to government which is diametrically opposed to that expressed by members of the aban- Opposition, the previous Government. They sought to abolish the States. They sought to abolish local government and they sought to substitute in its place, not a second tier or sphere of government with legislative responsibiUties, but administrative regions. All the pohcy decisions were to be taken here in Canberra by a centralist government remote from the people. It is our view that in the interests of a democratic nadon, it is important that power be distributed, that there be checks and balances. Had it not been for the checks and balances contained in our Constitution, with the States being vested with certain powers that enabled them to prevent the rush to centralism by the previous Labor Government, we could wellfindourselves today in the position of being a centralist nation with a government that was, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam),' a unitary system of government, a unicameral system of government', in other words, one Parliament only with no Senate representing .the diverse interests of the 6 States of the Commonwealth, with no States with legislative power and with a capacity to check the excessive abuse of power by a power hungry centralist government. We in the Liberal and National Country Parties, in putting into operation our federaUsm poUcy, do so because we believe that in the short run it will be in the interests of the Australian nation and that in the long run it will be to the great benefit of Australian people. Amongst other things, it will not only take decision-making power closer to the people, but more importantly it will entrench guarantees that protect the Australian democracy, the right of the Australian citizen to have a say in the way in which his country is governed. There is no doubt that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in a quite clever and subtle fashion whUe he was Minister in charge of urban affairs, pretended that he wanted to co-operate with local government. To some extent he succeeded in convincing some people that he was genuine, but in fact he was merely being the faU guy to achieve the purposes of his Leader who wanted fewer local government bodies and, as he said, more States. He did not want States in the sense that we understand them today-State s of sovereign governments with a legislative power and capacity-bu t administrative regions. He, in his regionalism pohcy, was seeking to estabUsh the structures that would enable him to so destroy the States and at the sametimeabolish local government bodies as representative forms of government, replacing them with administative regions implementing the poUcies determined here m Canberra. As I mentioned earher, this comment about the importance of looking at the structure of government, determining whether or not one believes in a distribution of power in order to prevent its abuse, is not an argument which denies the importance of adjoining local government bodies concerning themselves about the effect of their own decisions upon their neighbours. We in the Liberal and National Country Parties hope that as the strength of local government is improved local government will recognise that it has not only a role within its own area but also a role that sometimes affects the areas surrounding it. We hope that as local government's role is enlarged under our poUcy local government will continue and expand the co-operative mechanisms that were advanced as the justification for the introduction of a pohcy of regionalism. I have no doubt that in those areas where advantage is to be gained from co-operation, local government will do just that. The Bill before the House is designed to remove some inappropriate references to local government-inappropriat e now because of the introduction of our federalism policy. But it is also designed to empower the Grants Commission to advise the Government with regard to assistance to local government. The Deputy the Leader of the Opposition, in his speech to the House this evening, tried to tell us that local government would be a victim of the decisions taken by State Premiers. The fact is that local government knows how much money it will receive for the year 1976-77. It will receive $ 140m-7 5 per cent more than it received under the last Labor administration. Not only will it receive that amount in the coming year, but it has an assurance that it wiU receive in the following years the amount that that $ 140m represents as a percentage of this year's income tax. Something of the order of 1.5 per cent to 1.6 per cent of income tax will in the years to come automatically go to local government. As a result, local government can plan ahead in the knowledge that it will receive a guaranteed share of income tax, a guaranteed revenue base that will increase as the tax coUections increase as money wages rise. In the future local government will not fall victim to the same extent it has in the past, of the inflationary pressures on its own wage structure due to the rigidity of its previously limited revenue base. This policy has expanded the revenue base of local government; as a result local government can expand. What does that mean for the average citizen? It means a great deal. Much has been said of the rising cost of councU rates. Local government can now take account of the fact that a significant proportion of its revenue will be derived from its share of income tax on a percengovernment tage basis. It means that in the current year, ing it on a broad basis across the nadon, there distribution to local government of approximaway tely $10 a head throughout the nation. If one puts it on a household basis, it would be someit thing of the order of $30 to $35 a household. the distribution were upon that basis, that is extent to which householders would otherwise have had to pay in additional rates if it were for the introduction of this aspect of the federalidentifyism policy. The money will be distributed under a 2-level formula. The Grants Commission-and this for legislation is designed to achieve this aspect the program-is charged with the responsibihty of distributing, or recommending the distriened bution of, that $140m as between the States. each State a proportion of the State's share will be distributed on a per capita basis, sometimes weighted to take account of such matters as diselectors. tance and area. Each State is being asked to put forward its recommendations. I have no doubt that the Grants Commission is also being asked to express a view as to the amount to be disrespect tributed in each State on a per capita basis. The reason for looking at it on a is that some States like Victoria, closely settled and relatively small in area, may find that they are in a position where they want a greater portion on an equal per capita basis than a State like Western Australia or Queensland where tances are much greater. The balance of the money will be distributed between the local government bodies by the State grants alleged commissions. At the Premiers Conference in April all Premiers agreed to set up State grants missions. But no action has been taken in some States. There was no announcement in South Australia until Iflushedout of Mr Virgo, the taxation. Minister for Local Government in South Mr Austraha, the Dunstan Government plans to carry out the undertaking that Premier Dunstan gave at the Premiers Conference. Even then all that I have been able to achieve is a statement from Mr Virgo, the Minister for Local GovernwUl ment, that he might introduce grants commission legislation in two or three monthstime.He is reluctant to do it as he thinks the necessary work could have been done in Canberra by the Comportion monwealth Grants Commission. In my view a grants commission composed experts with an understanding of local government in South Australia could, if it were tively established, do as good, if not a better, in distributing the equalisation grants to local in that State. It is time that the takLabor Government in South Australia got off its is a seat and started legislating and governing in a to assist the people of that State. All that that Government is doing is bellyaching because is not prepared to carry out its own responIf sibilities of governing. Notwithstanding the the praise of the federalismpolicy given by Dunstan following the Premiers Conference, his Ministers not are now criticising it. The only reason I can",70
103,Mr UREN,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,Ask Willis.,72

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interprojected a few moments ago with the words: 'Ask WUUs'. I gather from his interjection that he was disexpressing a phoney argument that was circulated by members of the Labor Party in the recent New South Wales State elections about double taxation effects of the federalism pohcy. The poUcy does not involve double taxation. I was interested to read in the Queensland the Courier-MaU of 17 May- a week ago last Moncomday- a leader article headed: The new federalism does NOT mean double Kenneth WUtshire, the writer of that article who is senior lecturer in government at the Queensland University said, amongst other things, that the federalism policy did not in any way involve double taxation. He said that there be one tax return and one tax paid by the taxpayer. What the taxpayer wiU know, and will know for thefirsttime,is the proportion of his tax that is payable to State government, the prothat is payable and used by the Commonwealth Government and the amount of revenue out ofhis tax on a percentage basis that of is going to local government. effecThe time under the Labor Government injob volved Australian taxpayers in a doubling of taxation. The massive amount of taxation that was collected meant that State governments were able to spend money that they did not have the responsibihty of raising. If democracy is to continue and a federal system is to last it is very important that each sovereign level of government have the capacity to raise through its own efforts a large proportion of the revenue required to fund its expenditure obligations. Independent political authority must imply an independent fiscal authority. The need for each level of government to have matching political and fiscal powers is quite apparent. The problem in Australia has been that the political power of the States has not matched their fiscal power. As a result of this disequilibrium, the fact that they have not had matching fiscal powers to what has been their constitutional political responsibility has resulted in a centralisation of decision making in the hands of the government that has had thefiscalpower. A measure of political power and authority is the ability to make spending decisions. If a government does not have the ability to raise funds it ends up losing the ability to make decisions. Labor wanted the States to lose that ability so it gave themtiedgrants. It made them spend the money in accordance with the decisions of the Commonwealth Government. We in the Liberal and National Country Parthis ties want to reverse that trend. We want to guarantee the continued existence of the federal system where the power is distributed the 3 spheres of government. We want to ensure that wherever possible legislative power is matched by a responsibility to raise funds the decisions of that level of government and that the decision making should be as close to people as possible. This Bill is a step towards achievement of that goal. Therefore I support Bill and urge its early passage.",72
105,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"As the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) said, this is an important piece of legisthis lation. This small Bill of some 16 clauses has purpose and one effect; that is to remove the access, the direct access, of local government the Grants Commission of this nation. In future local government will have access only through the States if the States choose to grant access, the States choose to be the spokesmen for local government. There will be no access for local government as such. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) delivered what I thought was one of the best speeches in this House in respect the difficulties of regionalism. He did not say that regionalism was the answer to all the problems of administering this country, of delivering services and structuring government. But he did talk about regionalism as a dynamic instrument for getting around some of the old static organisation of federal, State and local government. He talked about how this arrangement was working. His remarks deserved the attention of every member of this House. However, I do not believe he was getting this attention. I cannot believe that the honourable member for Sturt was listening to what he had to say because the honourable member came back again and again to the word 'federalism'. We hear a lot in this House about the policy of federalism. But this policy is nowhere evident in this Bill. All this Bill deals with is the access of local government bodies to the Grants Commission of this country. If one wants to be a purist, federalism is something that can occur only between States and some federal compact. When one talks about the 3 levels of government one is talking about nothing that is magical; one is talking about nothing that is an inherent part of federalism. There is no reason why there could not be four,fiveor six levels of government, as indeed, on a super refined view there may very well be. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), who is at the table, acknowledges when he talks about having to acknowledge certain specific purpose authorities which carry out local government type functions. So federalthrough ism is a phoney concept. Government supporters-Oh ! to fulfil Mr ANTONY Whitlam-Honourable members opposite should think about it. In the the United States of America context, federalism in the that country only exists between independent the States and the Federal Government of that country. Local government can never have any constipart to play in federalism. Let us talk about the proper inter-governmental relations in country. Let us talk about them not in some one structured ideology that devolves everything to the States-to the old colonies-whic h are, as the to Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, the greatest centralist structures in this country. Every State in this country is ruled from a square mile. if One will not find any devolution of power from the State capitals of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and around the coast, to their hinterlands. One will notfindanything in Sydney that makes the people of Murwillumbah feel that they have anything in common with the people of Albury. One finds a terrible centralism in of some of every Australian State. But let us talk about the so-called federalism the policy. What is it? The Government has put up only 2 speakers in this debate, and certainly the honourable member for Sturt did not tell us what it was. What is this magical percentage? The honourable member for Sturt said that an independent political authority requires independent fiscal authority. All right. Is it not then just as logical to give income taxing powers to local authorities as to offer to give them 2 per cent, 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent of personal income tax? That is not giving them any independentfiscalauthority so the Government should not make a pretence that it is doing so. What it is doing is removing their access to the Grants Commission, which operates on very different principles, and giving them a flat percentage of personal income tax. The Government will not say what it is but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has worked it out and, on the basis of the statements of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) the other day, it looks like \ h per cent Let us see what this Fraser federalism means for local government in Australia. In a special supplement to the Australian Financial Review yesterday the journalist, Mr Ian Davis, talked about the Fraser federalism and what it might mean. He said: A figure of anywhere from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of income tax revenue has been tipped. The upper, more optimistic range would provide a significant assistance to local government; a figure at the end of the scale would almost certainly lead to a worsening of the present nnancial situation. In fact it has not been 2 per cent, it has been \ Vi per cent, and that will be significantly less than local government was receiving from Federal Government revenue sources during the past couple of years when the Labor Government was in power. Mr Bailleau-What does Davis know about it?",73
106,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"We will get to the States again in a moment. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations talked about the new tax sharing arrangements providing for afixedpercentage of personal income tax going to local government. I hope that in his reply in this debate he will tell us exactly what that percentage is, because until he does we frankly do not know what we are talking about. We are talking in a void. This piece of legislation is premature. It is not a matter of throwing out the baby with the bath water; we are throwing out the baby and hanging on to the bath water. I am very glad that I will be followed in this debate by a member of the Country Party because I will be very interested to hear what he has to say about the approach of this Government to the so-called Fraser federalism. Again we can rely only on vague Press releases. No legislative proposals have come before this House or the other House. I will be interested to hear what he has to say about per capita grants and about the possibility of equalisation or topping up. Members of the Country Party will know that under the Grants Commission recommendations forfinancialassistance to local governments over the last couple of years, local authorities in rural areas have benefited very much from the recommendations which were adopted by the Labor Government. It meant not per capita grants at all. It meant that people living under local authorities in rural areas received the equivalent of about $3 for every $1 that was aUocated per capita in the metropolitan areas. Under what we see now of the so-caUed new fedl eralism that will disappear. We have heard a lot of talk in this debate from the Minister, from senators in the other place and from the honourable member for Sturt about bureaucracy. There would be no leaner bureaucracy having served this country well than the Grants Commission. It is an extremely lean bureaucracy. It has buUt up a body of expertise particularly, as I suspect members of the Government parties are concerned, in working with this principle of equalisation which it lower applies in relation to the appUcations from States forfinancialassistance and which over the last couple of years it has been able to refine in dealing with applications from local government bodies grouped together in regions. What the Government is proposing to do is to create a furthe r bureaucracy - a further 6 bureaucracies- 6 State grants commissions which do not exist at the moment. One State has a grants commission, a part time body of no expertise. The Government is turning its back on the traditions of this country where we have had one Grants Commission for our nation which has assessed the needs of the States for special assistance and has, over the last couple of years, developed considerable expertise in processing applications from local government bodies grouped together in regions. One of the most laughable things in the Minister's second reading speech was the suggestion that artificial regional groupings had been formed under the Act of 1973. Any grouping, from a State to a local government body, is of its nature artificial. The groupings into which the Government will presumably insist that the States force their own bodies will be artificial in some way. There will simply be more of them. There will be more people- 6 times the number-to duplicate the work load that could be serviced here by our national Grants Commission.",74
107,Mr BAILLIEU,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"That is not right. Not all wisdom is in Canberra, you know.",75
108,Mr ANTONY WHITIAM,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"The honourable member for La Trobe interjects that not all wisdom is in Canberra. I would have thought that the whole theme of the Grants Commission Act 1973 acknowledged that But what it sought to do was to give local Government, with its expanding responsibilities, access to the national revenue. Let us be in no doubt about that. What is happening now is that the Government parties are supporting a measure that will cut off access by local government bodies to that revenue. It will insist that local government bodies approach the Federal Government, if at all, through the States, through a level at which they have no vote at all. If honourable members read the Bill they will see that is what it says. . Mr Birney-What clause?",75
109,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"The clause that deletes section 17. Let us look at the Bill. As the Minister said in his second reading speech-thi is really comical: It also defines 'assistance to a State for local government purposes' in such a way as to comprehend the unincorpormight ated areas in some States where local government-type vices are provided by the State government. The Bill says nothing of the sort. If one looks at clause 8 one will see that the proposed new section 17 subsection (2) says that a reference to 'a grant of assistance to a State for local government . . . purposes shall mean purposes declared by the regulations'. Where are the regulations? Do we see them? Not at all. At least the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was more frank in his statement in February 1976 after the Premiers Conference when he said that he would ask the Grants Commission what local government purposes were. He has to go back to the body which honourable members opposite are reviling and which the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Bailleau) says is not the font of all knowledge. Of course it is not the font of all knowledge but it is a body with considerable expertise in processing apphcations brought forward from local government. I am often amazed to hear people here talking of local government as the third level of government in this country. There are nofirst,second and third levels of government in this country just as there is no upper House. I defy honourable members to go to the Constitution and find that expression. Local government in this country is the primary form of government. It is the form of government at which most people have most contact. It is the area in which they know most of their aldermen or councillors. There are many more of them, and their doors are knocked on more often than are the doors of people in this chamber. Local government is what people see as the primary form of government. We on this side are concerned that local government should have access to the national revenue of this country and it should have access on an equal, fair basis. That is why we support a principle of equahsation which has been administered by the Grants Comniission over the years in dealing with the States, and a principle which has been administered over the last couple of years in deahng with local government regions. It is a principle which the Government parties are not supporting here today. It is unfortunate and I am surprised that from the metropolitan area of Sydney, which I know best, we have no speakers listed. They are some of the areas in which local government authorities have benefited from this very principle. In his second reading speech the Minister s seemed to be terribly concerned about assistance under the so-called Fraser federalism. We are dehghted at every indication we get as to what it mean, because it is not reflected in this serpiece of legislation. He said: Assistance to all local government authorities will be provided. No longer will some councils be excluded from sharing the moneys provided for local government purposes; . . . So it will be the same old principle of per capita grants across the board. To those who do not need it will be given more than they need and to those who do need more much less will be given.",75
110,Mr BAILLIEU,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,Rubbish.,75
111,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"Let me tell you what Councillor Thwaites, the President of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, said on 17 May and that is pretty recent. He said: There is also some disquiet in local government circles over the lack of definition so far in the new system as it concerns the proportions distributed between 'per capita' and 'needs' classifications in the total assistance program. Clearly, if per capita assistance is concentrated on at the expense of needs assistance, the rich councils will getricherand the poor poorer, and the imbalance between the two institutionalised. I come from a constituency where the councils are poorer and where they have benefited very gready over the last couple of years from Grants Commission recommendations of the assistance that they should receive. I would be delinquent in my duty if I did not stand up in this Parhament and resist the principle which those who do not need it and take it away from councils such as those in my own area which need it. I am going to be interested to hear what the honourable member who is to speak after and who comes from a rural area has to say about the same principle because he will know that the ability of every local government thority in terms of deahng with its rate base is the same. This particularly applies at the ment in rural areas. They will be very distressed to see the principle of per capita grants sneaking in just as those who represent the more disadvanbodies taged areas in the metropolitan areas of this country are also extremely distressed. The problem is, as the Deputy Leader of the by eacharewhich Opposition put it, that the Government premature with this legislation. It is dismanding a system which has given local bodies direct access to the Grants Commission. It is doing before it has delineated what it says it will do they after the Premiers Conference next month-the Minister details of its federaUsm pohcy. There has rarely ister of aofState been a piece of legislation that has come before this House which has been so premature, which Minister justifies by reference to detaUs yet announced. Constantly as one reads the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment granted. and Industrial Relations, who is sitting at the table, one wiU see that detaUs are yet to be announced. But when government supporters get up and say that in some way members of the Labor Party are supporting some kind of centralism they are so wrong. This is not just about centralsonal ism at all. It is, as the Deputy Leader of the position has said, about the most effective form of decentralisation. There can be no one who has fought harder in this Parliament or in his party in all the councUs of the party or outside for centralisation of decision making. Regionatism, as he said, is not a perfect system but it is a namic system that was developing. It was one suiting the purposes of local government. I revert again to something that was said in same survey I have already referred to in yesterclause day's Australian Financial Review, and not by a journalist but by a man who is the Secretary of the Local Government Association of New South Wales, Mr Miles, who is no member not of the Labor Party just as Councillor Thwaites no member of the Labor Party. Mr Miles says: One aspect of the new federalism which has made local government observers uneasy is that the emphasis on therightsof the States could serve to confirm some centralist policies within individual States which operated very much against the interests of local will give more to government. I trunk that is the nub of the matter. I think that is do the problem, and that is the problem that arises out of this piece of legislation. It is not the probme lem that perhaps arises out of some concept of what ideaUy the new Fraser federalism might mean because we do not know what that is; but auwe do know now what this piece of legislation is not doing. It is made very clear in thefiddlingwith mosections 17 and 18 of the existing Act, and that makes it very clear that local government bodies which are defined clearly in the existing Actincorporated under statute by each of the States, bodies that we do not seek to say will not be treated as local government bodies but bodies regarded as local government bodies is so CommissiontheinStates-shal of l approach the Grants course they are artificial, as artificial regions, in regions. Of every unit of government in this country is artificial, but are they it regions imposed by a Canberra authority? No, are regions that are agreed on between a this national Government and a Mingovernment. Between them they have agreed on regions that are dynamic, that a will change from time to time and that can apto be proach a Grants Commission and seek aid on the basis of need, as the Grants Commission has That is what this Bill is seeking to remove and that is why it is a thoroughly objectionable piece of legislation. That is why however many objections we may have to the so-called Fraser federalism, to guessing at what percentage of perincome tax will be made available to local Opgovernment bodies, we at least now have a system that is working, a system that is working to the advantage of local government authorities. It or is a system which is grantingfinancialassistance a deto them for which they are grateful and which they are using. Here we have a Minister who dycomes in and talks about a Bill which he says will define in the Act 'assistance to a State for local government purposes'. Yet every government party supporter in this chamber will vote for this the Bill knowing, as I have pointed out, that in fact 8 of the Bill does no such thing; that it this time leaves it up to regulations. It is about time that in this Parliament we did leave it up to Ministers by regulations to set is priorities about what is a suitable local government purpose. We should insist that that is something we talk about here in the Parliament. many National goal setting about where and how we of the make decisions should be decided here in open have debate and not by some ministerial decision gazetted, you can be sure, in the 2-month recess before the Budget when we are all back in our constituencies. That is just not good enough. We ought not to be in any doubt when we vote on this Bill. I will make sure that every member of every marginal constituency held by a Liberal Party or a Country Party member in this chamber has his constituents know they are voting to deny the local authorities in their electorcompleted ate access to the Grants Commission in this country and for no good reason. It is a shameful piece of legislation.",75
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS, completed Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,77
113,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"The change implementation of the Government's federalism poticy requires a different role for the Commonadministration wealth Grants Commission than has since 1973. This Bill before the House makes the changes to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act so that it will be appropriate pohcy and so that it will make special provisions for the Commission to advise the Government on matters relating to assistance to local governreports ment under this new policy. It also, of course, removes the obUgation on the Commission to report on apphcations by local government bodies. It should be emphasised that this Bill leaves unchanged the true role of the CommonI wealth Grants Commission; that is, the right of Thwaites: States to apply for supplementary assistance to The correct difficulties caused by small populations, been remoteness and other special circumstances. The in whole object of our policy is to provide each level vital of government with a known share of the gressive national purse, increasing as the nation's economy grows. It wiU remove the instability brought about by ad hoc changes in Government policy it not? or priority. It wiU allow long term planning based on known expectations. There is, however, another major advantage in the proposals put forward by the Government and that is that it ensures effective and responbuUt sible government with maximum community that mvolvement. We intend to getridof the behef held by the previous Government, and obviously by previous speakers, that all wisdom and perienced knowledge reside in Canberra, that governments and bureaucrats far removed need can make decisions efficiently. I could cite . . one example which refers to the regional employment development scheme. Despite its bodies many values to the community and particularly differential. to the employment of unemployed people, the the decision by the Labor Administration to halt that scheme created many injustices to local government authorities and organisations. We are all aware of the numerous appUcations that were prepared at considerable expense by local government authorities and even in some cases were approved by the Labor Government but then were not funded. We are all aware of projects that were commenced and were unable to be due to a mandatory holding of funds by the former Labor Government. Local government authorities should be able to expect an assurance that, having undertaken a commitment to a project funded by a government, it can be without bringing additional cost to the ratepayers. This example emphasises the effect of changes in government pohcies. Economic difficulties brought about by either a of government or a change in government pohcy can be detrimental to the efficient and financial management of existed local government authorities. Both the previous speaker, the honourable to our member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam), and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) quoted from policy statements and Press of Councillor Thwaites and Mr MUes of the Austrahan Council of Local Government Associations. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition believed that the views he expressed were the views of local government authorities. However, quote also from statements by Councillor Council is extremely pleased that the principle has established that local government should have its share the new revenue-raising arrangements, lt sees this as a first step towards rescuing local government financing from the bad old OUver Twist days and putting it on a proand systematic footing. Mr King-That knocks Whitlam's story, does",77
114,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"That is right. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that everything done by the Grants Commission in relation to local government funding was done effectively. I will not deny that the Grants Commission had up considerable expertise. It is indisputable it performed its duties commendably but the second report of the Grants Commission for 1975 points to some very serious difficulties it exin administering its duties. I think it is fair to quote from that report. On page 21 the from the area of Commission says: . considerable difficulties were experienced in the first year in assessing grants for local governing . . . particularly in relation to the expenditure Because of this the Commission had to resort to use of judgment of the evidence, including an examination of each local governing body's own expenditure on a particular function. This evoked criticism from several sources. However, the difficulues stemmed from data problems which offer no short-term solution. It must be emphasised that these problems would be evident for any method used to determine a distribution of funds between local governing bodies on an equitable basis. They arise because of long-standing differences in accounting practices tween local governing bodies within States and between States, some of which are of a fundamental nature. In addition, there are significant differences in the bases property values arefixed;these provide the basis for the distribution of the rate burden, and hence a measure of taxable capacity. Later in the report the Commission points to the difficulties that local government authorities have and the ability of many local government authorities in providing submissions to the Grants Commission. The report states: . . . a substantial number of submissions were of little assistance to the Commission for the assessment of revenueraising capacity and expenditure disabilities. This was disappointing in view of the guidelines contained in the First Report and further detailed in circulars to every regional organisation and local governing body. Many submissions were simply' shopping lists '-list s of projects which cils would like to undenake, some amounting to many millions of dollars, without any attempt to indicate why they could not be financed from their own resources or what cost disabilities they would encounter if the projects were implemented. There were, of course, a number of excellent submissions that concentrated on identifying and quantifying revenue-raising and expenditure disabilities; unfortunately the number was not great and the Commission had to attach a great deal of weight to the evidence from these bodies in assessing the claims of their neighbours. These 2 problems encountered by the Commission indicate in the first instance that State Grants Commissions should be able to cope as effectively. Firsdy, there is a greater degree of similarity between municipalities within States, although there are by no means standard procedures. Secondly, the ability for consultation with the Commission would be greatly enhanced. The brief time that the Commonwealth Grants Commission could spend in individual municipalities, or even in regions, was severely restricted. The second problem in regard to local goverament authorities' ability to prepare a meaningful submission will become a major subject for discussion in the formation or increased responsibility of State Commissions. It is to be expected that the expertise developed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the data information compiled will be freely available to the State Commissions. It will be invaluable and should assist in smooth and effective changeovers. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) in his second reading speech pointed out clearly the precise role to be played by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in the implementation of our federahsm policy, which has not yet been fully determined. The honourable member for Grayndler always seems to be in a great hurry to hear the pohcies that our being espoused daily by the Government. As recorded in Hansard of 19 May he be- made a statement that the only pohcy yet put forward by the Government was a $13m giveaway on which to the rural sector. Of course, he conveniently forgot the tremendous advantages that the investment aUowance, the drop in interest rates and the homes savings grants, which had all been implemented before that date, were conferring upon the Austrahan economy. If the honourable member had waited another day to hear the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) on Thursday, 20 May, he would have heard two of the most significant reforms since Federationpersonal tax indexation and the implementation of the famUy allowance scheme. It is quite clear that this Bill considerably modified the Commission's role as related to the counlocal governmentfinances.There is no doubt that local goverament is in a painful dUemma. It has been asked to pay for more sophisticated and comprehensive services, yet payment is becoming more difficult. Local goverament authorities simply do not have the capacity to raise the money. The rate of growth in local government tax revenue has been only half of State growth and only 77 per cent of Federal Government growth or, in comparative terms, increases have been 29 per cent and 25 per cent as compared with 20 per cent. Rural shires have suffered in this regard more than any others. For example, with the fall in incomes in wool grower municipalities their abUity to raise income has dropped by 22 per cent. In pastoral municipalities this decrease has been even more prounounced with income decreasing by 48 per cent. The decrease has not been so substantial in grain producing municipalities, where a decrease of only 6 per cent has occurred, but when one considers that municipalities have had to cope with an inflation rate of up to 16 per cent over the last two or three years one realises the serious difficulties they are having infinancingtheir projects. During this time too the increasing range of services that local government authorities are supplying has increased from 23.8 per cent in 1969-70 to 26.3 per cent in 1973-74 of current expenditure items. A statement of policy by the Austrahan Council of Local Government Associations points out that: Local government, provider of some of the most basic services to the community, should not have to depend for its finance on the vagaries of Federal-State politics, the waxing and waning of Federal-State relations, Tor it effectively to meet the expectations of the people who depend on it. This demands two imperatives: Financial assistance to Local Government must be linked as an adequate percentage a major revenue source . . . This percentage must grow as total revenue grows. This is exactly what our federalism pohcy sets out to achieve. Local government does not deserve its status as the poorest of the 3 relations. Local government is nearer to the people, scrutinised more closely by the people and is more immediately accountable to the people. Yet it is the most cost effective level of government in the nation. Its plans are made and its priorities allocated in a constant pubhc spotlight. People hving in the shires and municipalities throughout the nation expect adequate water and sewerage facUities. They expect physical services such as libraries, swimming pools, sports grounds, etc. They expect a whole range of services for groups in the community which have special needs such as the old, the sick, the young, women and Aborigines. Yet local government is heavUy disadvantaged when it comes to paying for these expectations. Total expenditure on pubhc services by councUs throughout Austraha is running at an annual rate of $ 1,200m and $230m of this has come to local government thisfinancialyear in the form of federal grants. Roughly $300m is raised through the Loan Council. The rest, which is more than half of the total, comes from rates. Rates are neither a progressive nor equitable way of raising revenue. They are a sectional tax often bearing most heavUy on those least able to pay. They are a subsidy of the whole of the community by one segment ofit and there is a limit to the sum that can be raised by them. Indeed, the point is admitted on all sides of the problem that rates have been pushed up about as far as they can go. I feel that the effects of local government problems will be felt most tragically in the country where local government is a major employer of labour and also on the fringe of capital cities where local government services are most appreciated and most necessary. The economic statement of the Treasurer last Thursday night of necessity cut forward estimates of expenditure. However, in the announcement of its final decisions it ensured that special considerations will be given to the future of the problems of low income families and the needy to provide justice to the individual taxpayers. The important role that local government plays in our system was not overlooked with $ 140m to be made avaUable in 1976-77 in general untied revenue assistance. This is a 75 per cent increase over the previous year. This Bill proposes necessary changes and is setting the stage for a true federalistic with to government. It sets out to give everytierof government a real share of avaUablefinanceand a new responsibiUty for decision making. The honourable member for Grayndler quoted from the statement by Councillor Thwaites. There is naturally disquiet in local government circles, particularly concerning the proportions of funds distributed per capita and needs classifications in the total assistance programs. Clearly per capita assistance must not be propounded at the expense of needs assistance or greater inequalities will develop. This, of course, is why the federalism policy is being discussed and why there is close consultation with the States and local government authorities. It is not our aim to push forward with the implementation of legislation as the previous Government did only tofindthat it was not applicable to the circumstances that the previous Government was endeavouring to correct. There is no reason why this Government, if it is prepared to consult and to co-operate and not to dictate and direct, will not by its genuine effort be able to treat local government as a highly responsible and desirable element of our system of government in Austraha. I support this Bill.",77
115,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,"in reply-The Opposition spokesman who led for the Austrahan Labor Party in this debate, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), talked at one stage about colossal faUures. I shall be charitable. I shall admit that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and members of the Australian Labor Party are fully qualified to talk about colossal faUures. Their recent record indeed proves that that is about the o-iy subject about which they know anything. Tnat leads me to the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent most of his speech defending the Labor Party's concept of regionalism. That amounted to trying to impose a new level of government. He alleged that the States more and more were coming to see the merits of the system. Of course the point is that the States had no choice. They had to like it or lump it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also said that the majority opinion of local government supports the Labor concept of regionalism. All 1 can say is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition must have been talking to different representatives of local government from those to whom I have talked over the last few years. The fact is that the only people who are sorry approach to see the demise of the Labor Party's regionalism are the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and members of his Party, certainly local government which will be getting $140m this year compared with $56m the year before last and $80m last year-no t $230m as I heard alleged by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tonight. I remind him that that figure included a large amount- I think from memory something Mr Lynch: like $135m-unde r the Regional Employment Development scheme which the Labor Government made a hopeless mess of and which it has fallen to my lot to try to clean up. Under the new proposals that have been outlined in this Bill there will be tax sharing rangements. Local government will get a fixed share of the personal income tax collections. like the lucky dip pohcy of the Labor Party, local government will get some assistance. top of that I remind the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whidam) that areas of readily low population or municipahties or shires special disabilities will be protected by the addition of top up grants through the States grants commissions. That was spelt out with great skill and clarity by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher). I thank them for their tributions to the debate. This Bill ushers in a most far reaching imaginative restructuring of thefinancingof government in Australia, particularly local government. It is the most imaginative proposal since Federation. It has been widely acclaimed by all sections of the Australian community. It a major step forward to achieving a true federal system for Austraha andtimewill prove that not only will local government be better off under the new system but also responsibihty will where it should be, close to the people who are close to the problems. That will be the experience as the new federaUsm policy of this government, diminished. of which this Bill is a most important part, comes into operation over the next few years.

116,Mr HURFORD,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,"This Bill gives effect to an agreement made by our country to participate in the establishment of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Financial Support Fund. The aragreement was signed in Paris on Wednesday, 9 AprU 1975-mor e than a year ago. Membership Unofthe fund is open to all member countries of the all OECD which becomes parties to the agreement. On WhUe in government the Australian Labor Party recognised the potential of this agreement and took part in it. In Opposition we are conwith sistent and do not oppose this Bill. The need for the fund came out of a recognition of the potential balance of payments problems confronting major industrialised countries, members of the OECD, due to steep rises in oil prices. Fortunately the problems have not been conas acute as wasfirstthought but the fund may still be required to play a valuable support role. The fund cannot be looked on as a panacea for and chronic balance of payments problems. For example, the problems faced by Great Britain and New Zealand in recenttimeswould be outside the scope of the fund. However, the fund may be regarded as a useful financial facility is available to help member countries temporarily finance balance of payments deficits. In providing this facility the fund will, hopefully, deter member countries from taking unilateral action be which could hamper the free flow of international trade. In this way desirable checks to world production and employment may be As well as the particular arrangements made under this agreement, other important steps towards international co-operation in economic matters were taken during preliminary discussions. Significant steps were taken towards the industrialised nations realising that there individual prosperity depended upon mutual cooperation. Agreement was reached on general principles of responsible domestic budgetary policy. The aim of those principles is to ensure that recourse to the fund is restricted to problems in balance of payments over which the claimant countries have httle control. The Opposition sees this movement towards co-operation in such matters as an important ingredient in this effects agreement. Finance for the fund is secured through quotas Austraha. for individual members which determine their maximum financial liability and also the basis for their bonowing rights. Australia's quota about $275m. However, as the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) pointed out in his second reading speech, the provisions of the fund agreement are drawn up in such a way that there is virtually no circumis stance in which there could be a direct impact upon the Australian Budget. The fund members' liabilities are virtually guarantees to enable drawer countries to borrow on internauonal markets. It is only if money were not available in the markets that Austraha would make a direct contribution. That would then require budgetary appropriation and, of course, it would come through this Parhament. I would like to mention now something about borrowing guarantees. They will function in two have modes. Firstly, the guarantee will be provided by bate individual members and the fund would be able anywhere to borrow its share of funds. Secondly, the fund itself would borrow on the collective guarantee of all members. A number of safeguards for guarantees is incorporated in the agreement. Kingdom? Members who receive loans will be required to follow pohcies consistent with the general principles of the fund. Decisions to grant loans up a member's quota will require endorsement by two-thirds majority of the governing committee on which all members will be represented. above the quota will require higher majorities the committee. Turning my attention now to the circumway stances which made this fund necessary and the relevance of the fund to Austraha's current econcontinue omic problems, I point out that the Treasurer traced the path which followed the intervention by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the world oil market in second reading speech he correctly diagnosed that this intervention had considerable consequences for inflation in non-OPEC countries. Opposition Those problems reinforced those associated with the downturn in the international trade cycle culminated in the most serious recession since 1930s. Austraha, as a vigorous participant ternational trade, could not be isolated from inflation and the recession. By far the biggest tor contributing to Austraha's recession has been the international downturn. It is spurious to argue that Austraha was saved from massive rises in oil prices through being dependent upon internal supphes and hence could be isolated be from inflation and recession. The secondary of therisesin oil prices on our trading partners ensured that world recession did not escape It is important to keep the international situation in perspective, especially if we are to is implement pohcies which will lift Austraha out of the present recession. The OECD financial support fund will have a role to play in supporting recovery from the international slump. But it important for those countries wishing to join in this recovery to recognise the role international forces will play. If the Australian Government bases its pohcies for recovery on false premises, then recovery must be delayed. If the Government continues to ignore the realities of the international economy and continues with its false and damaging assumptions that all of our problems may be sheeted home to Budget deficits, then Australia will miss out on an early return to prosperity. Cuts in government spending-w e been debating another lot of them today and we will continue to debate them after the deon this Bill is completed-ar e not being used else in the world as a means of obtaining a recovery in the economic system.",80
117,Mr STALEY,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,What about in the United,81
118,Mr HURFORD,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,"The Minister for the Capital to Territory interjected: 'What about in the United a Kingdom?' He is not known for his economic expertise. If he were to study what is going on in the Loans United Kingdom he would find out that the of United Kingdom is merely looking very far ahead at forward estimates and has not in any way cut its level of government spending in the that is being done here. This Government's* ideological obsessions have postponed and will to postpone recovery. The unfortunate situation may be reached where Australia slides further into recession and itself has to call upon the resources of the OECD support fund. I trust 1973. In his that this will not happen. I am delighted to take part in and lead for the in the debate on this Bill. I give notice that we support the Bill. I have had the pleasure and of visiting the headquarters of the OECD in the Paris, of visiting the Austrahan Ambassador to in in the OECD and of knowing some of the staff in the our embassy to the OECD. It has also been my facfortunate lot on 2 occasions to take part in debates in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on the OECD's annual report. It is fortuitous that on the 2 occasions that Australian parliamentarians have taken part in such a debate I happened to in a position to be present. I was present firstly as a member of the Opposition in 1971 and then last year as a supporter of the Government. Knowing Mr Van Lennep, the Secretary General of the OECD, knowing the quahty of the work of the OECD, knowing the valuable work that the Organisauon does not only for our country but also for improving knowledge in the difficult art-o r is it a science?-of economics all countries of the world, but particularly member countries, it is good to see this further step being taken in setting up thisfinancialsupport fund. I hope that fund resources will not be needed by our own country, but at least it is gratifying to see the international co-operation that has brought about the setting up of this fund. I support the Bill.",81
119,Mr SHORT,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,"I welcome this opportunity to express my strong support for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Financial Support Fund) Bill. I am pleased to note that a bipartisan approach has been adopted to this Bill in this chamber. Like the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), I have had various associations with the Organisations for Economic Co-operation and Development. I was particularly closely associated with it at the stage that Australia templated joining it and in the early years of Austraha's membership. In my view the OECD is one of the prime international institutions in the world for a co-operative approach to economic matters. It provides Austraha, as a member, with a wonderful opportunity, which I think we have accepted over the recent years in which we have been a member, to play a full and a constructive role in debates and the furtherance of international economic co-operation. I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because it is too infrequently that members of this chamber have an opportunity to speak in a debate on externalfinancialmatters. As an aside, I hope that this is something that we may be able to rectify at some stage before too long. I think there would be great advantage to this chamber if we were to have a wider debate on international economic matters than this Bill provides, although it does provide an opportunity, because these are matters which are of the greatest importance to this nation. They affect not only our external economic and trading position but through them our domestic economic situation also. As well, external economic relations cannot be divorced from our overall foreign policy. We hve today in a highly interdependent world, a world where the economic and commercial circumstances of any one country, particularly where that country is an important international trading country, have important impUcations for the economic and commercial for circumstances of other countries. The lack of economic and commercial harmony or the presence of it between nations is a major element of the total foreign relations picture between nations. The Bill before us is a not insignificant addition to international economic co-operation. I would Uke to come back to this issue later in my remarks. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) outlined in his second reading speech the basic features of the agreement establishing a Financial Support Fund of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which was signed by aU member countries, including Australia, in Paris on 9 AprU 1975. The objectives of the fund are to encourage and assist membersfirstlyto avoid unilateral measures which would restrict international trade or other current account transactions and which would artificially stimulate visible and current invisible exports; and secondly, to follow appropriate domestic and intercon- national economic policies, including adequate balance of payments and co-operative policies to promote increased production and the conservation of energy. Another objective of the fund is to serve for a limited period of 2 years only, to supplement in exceptional circumstances other sources of credit to which members encountering serious economic difficulties have had recourse, and to ensure that the risks on loans by the fund to members are shared equitably amongst all members. It is important to note that the fund will act only as a lender of last resort. This means that the potential borrower must first have made the fullest appropriate use of its own external reserves and fuUest use of other possible sources of capital including other multi-lateral facUities such as the International Monetary Fund. A potential borrower can borrow only in circumstances where it is encountering severe balance of payments difficulties. Criticisms have been made of the fund fromtimeto time that because a borrower has to follow appropriate domestic and mternational economic policies, that country is thereby abrogating from itself its abUity to dictate its own economic policies. In my view this criticism is quite fallacious for 3 main reasons. Firstly, the country does not have to borrow from the fund. Secondly, by the time it has become eligible to borrow from the fund it already will have borrowed from the ternauonal Monetary Fund and will of necessity have had to agree in particular terms with the IMF on appropriate economic pohcies. Thirdly, the Support Fund cannot autocratically dictate economic pohcies to the lender. - Section 3 (C) of the agreement provides conditions related to economic pohcies needed shall be agreed between the borrower and the fund at the time the loan is granted. Experience with the IMF in any event indicates that tries agreeing to certain pohcies generally do on a best endeavours basis. The agreement in itself in no way inhibits Austraha's freedom of action in any direction beyond what our existing international obligations impose on us; for example, through our earlier acceptance of OECD's trade declaration. It is also important note that a member of the Financial Support Fund can seek exclusion from providing funds for a borrowing by another member if the countation. try called is itself in present or prospective ance of payments difficulties. Similar safeguards apply to all participants in respect of borrowings by the fund in their own internal capital markets. '-. A welcome feature of the fund is the close States liaison that it will have with other major international nnancial institutions, notably the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for Intertant national Settlements. These institutions will have representation at meetings of the Support governing committee and provision exists for Bank for International Settlements to be appointed as agent for the fund for various ministrative purposes. If Austraha ratifies the agreement it will have a quota in the fund which will be the basis for any drawings for or contribupath tions to the fund of special drawing rights -$300m. As the honourable member for Adelaide said, this is something in the order of $A275m. Australia's proposed quota is the equal twelfth largest of the twenty-four OECD members and reflects our importance as a major trading nation and as a significant member of the OECD. It unlikely in the extreme that Australia will be borrower from the Financial Support Fund. It also perhaps unlikely that we wdl be required contribute in any significant way. If we do, visions exist which would mean that there would be almost certainly no direct budgetary impact. I would like to return now, briefly, to the wider context in which I beU eve this Bill should be considered. ThefinancialSupport Fund was conorderly ceived at a time immediately following the matic increase in oil prices by the Organisation Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1973 when the balance of payments positions of most of the Inmajor western countries were convulsed by the OPEC action, an action which played a critical part in the recession in major western countries which occurred in 1974 and 1975 and from which they are only now recovering. The original idea stemmed from 2 proposals by the United that States of America and one by the Secretary General of the OECD, Mr Van Lennep. There were some who thought that the United States proposals would be damaging because they counmight imply an attempt to confront the OPEC so countries. That is a matter of opinion, but whatever one's judgment it is now entirely irrelevant. The discussions and the negotiations which the United States and the OECD's Secretary General's proposals promoted have led to the esthe tabhshment of a fund about which the OPEC to countries appear to be quite unconcerned. There is no evidence to suggest that OPEC countries regard the fund as an instrument of confronEven France, which was concerned about balsome aspects of the United States proposals on this score and which declined for this reason to participate in the International Energy Agreement which also stemmed from the 2 United proposals, has signed the Support Fund agreement. In short, the new fund marks another imporstep forward in realistic and essential international co-operation. It provides an additional Fund's supplementary safety net to OECD member the countries experiencing major balance of payments difficulties and will help enable them to admake necessary external adjustments without resort to restrictionist and beggar my neighbour policies which could plunge the world down the towards recession. The facility is restricted of to OECD members, the great majority of which are developed nations. It is these countries in total which face the largest of any oil induced balance of payments deficits in the future. At the sametime,developing countries have not been overlooked by the internationalfinancialcomis munity. The International Monetary Fund has a recently substantially liberalised access to its is compensatoryfinancingfacility which applies to mainly to developing countries. As well, profits profrom sales of a portion of the IMF's gold stock are to be used to establish a trust fund which will be available to the lowest per capita income countries on highly concessional terms. Australia stands to gain immensely from an and stable worldfinancial,economic and dratrading environment. We have been through an of unstable period in recent years. The so-called Bretton Woods international monetary system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates has broken down. There has been economic recession in most major developed countries which has had widespread international ramifications. There has been resort to increasing barriers to international trade. The wonder of it all is perhaps that the international economic order did not collapse into a state of chaos in the last 4 years so. The reason it did not is that the major countries pulled back from the brink of the restrictionist and beggar my neighbour pohcies which characterised the 1930s, We in Australia have a lesson to learn from this. We must recognise that we cannot hope to solve our internal economic problems by attempting to insulate ourselves from the rest of the world. We must recognise that we are an important and an integral part of the world economy and that we depend importantly for our own economic health upon the pohcies adopted by the rest of the world. We must recognise that we have a responsibihty not only to ourselves but also to our trading partners to put our own economic house in order; and that is precisely what this present Government is moving so rapidly towards doing. We must recognise that if own economic house gets out of order we must adjust to put it back in order rather than attempt to protect ourselves by cutting ourselves off from the immense advantages that accrue to us through international trade and the relatively free flow of capital across national boundaries. What this means is that we must continue to learn to live co-operatively with the rest of the world. The OECD nnancial support fund agreement is a significant and a wortWhile further step in international nnancial co-operation. Accordingly I wholeheartedly support its ratification by this Parhament.",82
120,Mr LUSHER,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,"It gives me great pleasure to take part in the second reading debate on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (Financial Support Fund) Bill 1976, particularly as the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) has again indicated his support for a proposal of the Government. I think it is the secondtimein probably less than a week that I have had the opportunity of speaking in a debate in which the honourable member for Adelaide has indicated the Opposition's support.",84
121,Mr HURFORD,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,You recognise that I am a countries reasonable man.,84
122,Mr LUSHER,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,"As the honourable member hope points out, he is an eminently reasonable man, and I have a great deal of hope that he will be able to impose the views he holds upon other members of his Party. I look forward to an increasing degree of co-operation between the Opposition and the Government in relation to the actions that the Government is trying to take to reduce inflation and unemployment and to deal with the other problems that we face in or Austraha at the moment. I am sure that if the honourable member for Adelaide is able to argue on this occasion as convincingly as he has on other occasions amongst members of his own parUamentary Party we will see a great deal of co-operation in this Parhament and, before a great deal of time has elapsed, jointly we will see Australia revert to a situation of far greater economic stabUity and a much larger degree of cooperation in the Parhament. I commend the honourable member for Adelaide for his approach, because it is refreshing, after a period of some years, to find an economic spokesman who is prepared to put to the Parliament on behalf of the Opposition constructive views and who is prepared to argue along the hnes that the Government itself would argue in relation to so many of these issues that we face. It is a matter of record that the oil crisis which obtained in the world in recent years had a significant effect on the economies of a large number of the trading nations of the world, particularly amongst the OECD countries. As was pointed out by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his second reading speech on this Bill the net effect of the oU crises was that the OECD member nations, as a group, went from a situation in which they were running a balance of payments surplus on cunent account of US$2.5 billion in 1973 to a situation in 1974 in which the current account surplus turned into a deficit of US$33.25 bUlion. That turn around of something in excess of US$35 bUlion is representative of the effect largely of the oU crisis and the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in pursuing the policy on the pricing of oU that they chose to pursue. It is very difficult for many nations to adjust to the burden that that significant turn around has placed upon their domestic economies and their relationship with other countries. That is the background to the desire to implement the agreement which has been put by the OECD and which some 8 countries have already ratified. We understand that a further 4 are about to do so. It appears that the remainder of the member countries of the OECD to be able to implement formal ratification of that proposal by the end of May. It is, I think, one of those examples of significant international co-operation in thefieldof trade that Australia, in concert with other member countries of the OECD, is prepared to undertake commitments which will assist the world as a trading entity to see that the effects of the oil crisis will not be long term and will not cause significant degrees of disruption. The Austrahan economy is significantly dependent on overseas trade and obviously in our economic considerations we have a vested interest in seeing that trade is allowed to continue on a stable and growing basis and that we do not have significant disruptions in the pattern of world trade as a result of events such as the oil crisis. We therefore have a vested interest in seeing that this agreement is implemented. It appears from the suppon which has been offered by the honourable member for Adelaide-that most reasonable man-that there will not be any difficulties within this Parhament in the ratification by Austraha of the agreement. A smoothly operating world trade situation, free of major upheavals, is certainly in Australia's interest, and it can only be in Australia's interest. Therefore I think there should not be a great deal of argument about the ratification of this agreement. One of the important features of the legislation is that it has the effect of giving Australia's agreement to the fund, and the fund is intended to play a great role in assisting in the recycling of the funds which flow between developed countries and which will offset the disadvantages which may be felt by individual economies as a result of the oil problems which we have faced in recent years. We hope that we will not have to face the problems again, but it certainly is not beyond the bounds of possibihty that they may have to be faced. The implementation of the fund will have the effect of providing a degree offinancialcooperation amongst the OECD countries during that adjustment process. I think that that is particularly important. One of the main points of the Fund is that the intention is to assist OECD members so they will not have to take unilateral action in terms of trade and other measures which may restrict trade in order to try to alleviate the position which may exist in their own domestic economies as a result of the problems which flowed from the increase in the price of oil. Assuming that countries which are members of the OECD do manage their economies in a sensible fashion, and as long as they take the appropriate internal actions to overcome the problems that they may have encountered, and also as to the best of their ability they have taken the steps that are available to them in terms of other international funding arrangements, then as a provision of last resort this particular fund would come into operation for them. I think it is important from Australia's own budgetary viewpoint that we be too clear about just what the implications are in our own economy. The Treasurer has made it quite clear- I think there is no argument on either side of the House about this-that there is no immediate and probably no long term demand on Australia's budgetary resources as a result of our agreement to ratify this arrangement and to be a party to it. The system operates in such a way that each country has a quota. That quota is initially provided by way of guarantee. It is only in a last resort situation that any member country may be called upon actually to 'come up with the money', if that is an acceptable term to use. The size of the Fund will be equivalent to $A18.5 billion. The quota that Austraha has agreed to meet is $A275m or about 1.5 per cent of that totalfigure.That is the maximumfigurewhich Australia could conceivably be involved in guaranteeing at some stage or, in an extreme situation, having to fund. Member countries, including Austraha, have access to the Fund under the anangements by which as I indicated earlier and as previous speakers have indicated, they undertakefinancialdomestic management and have made appropiate approaches to other resources of an international kind, statutory deposit reserves and other forms offinancialassistance that may be available to them. All these things failing, a country-and Australia could conceivably be included among those countrieshas arightto go to the Fund and request an allocation from it. In that event the Fund will have a couple of options open to it. It can initially call on guarantees from the member and constituent parts of the Fund. It may have to make a direct call upon members, but if that is necessary, it is up to the member nations of the OECD to determine whether or not they will provide cash, whether they will raise loans themselves on the international market or whether they will allow the OECD to come into their own domestic capital market to raise the funds which are necessary. It is important to understand that in this legislation there is no circumstance in which there needs to be a direct budgetary impact upon our economy or our own resources. If the situation should arise in which Australia could be called upon to provide either a direct contribution or a guarantee then Australia could ask the Fund to bonow the required amount of money on its behalf in overseas markets. It is a pretty extreme situation that might occur, but in the event that it did happen that no funds were available on the overseas markets, then the contingent liability which falls to Austraha means that it would have to make a decision as to whether it would allow the Fund to borrow in our own capital market or whether Austraha would come up with the money. These are pretty remote situations. But even if it were to be the case, Australia would certainly earn a reasonable rate of interest on funds that it might have to contribute. By and large the Fund is certainly an exercise in internauonal co-operation. It is designed by the OECD to meet the problems of particular countries in overcoming the domestic problems that might arise as a result of the acuons of the Organisauon of Petroleum Exporting Countries which caused what is generally called the 'oil crisis' of the last couple of years. In some countries those problems can be extreme, but any country which is suffering those problems can at least operate in the secure knowledge that there is a lender of last resort in the form of this The Fund is there as a standby to assist that particular country and its economy to overcome oil crisis-related problems. I think the Bill ought to be commended by Parliament as a whole. I think it is a credit to OECD that it has been able to negotiate an arrangement which will work to the benefit of its members, an arrangement which will enable the member nations of the OECD, should they have a problem arising from the oil crisis, to have problem satisfied. That is conditional on their having taken the appropriate internal and external measures that may have been required to be taken before they approach this lender of last resort. The National has given a great deal of consideration to this particular Bill. The National group, joins with the Liberal Party in wholeheartedly supporting the proposal which is before the Parliament. It is a matter of record that the National Country Party is committed to stability and growth in the overseas trade situation. Considering that no significant problems are developing between Austraha as an economy must and the other economies with which we have dealings, on this occasion the Party has asked to make a specific point to the Minister assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Post and Telelist communications (Mr Eric Robinson) who is at the table, that the Party is completely fourducts square behind the proposals which the Government is putting in this respect. We have a great deal of respect for the OECD as an organisation. We feel that this proposal can only be of benefit to Australia. As such I , my Party, the Government. ment as a whole and, I am pleased to say, on occasion the Opposition suppon this action of the Government, thus making a totally united force in this Parliament. I commend the Bill to the House.",84
123,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,"The Government believes that the the Financial Support Fund will constitute a valuable financial facility that could assist countries to adjust to changed economic circumstances without resort to measures which could damage world trade, production and employment. Austrahan participation in the Fund wdl be a demonstration of our support for a significant initiative in the field of international co-operation which will thereby strengthen our relations with our major allies and with our major trading partners. It is therefore gratifying that we have had the bipartisan approach to the debate on this occasion. On behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Fund. Lynch), I thank the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). I regret that I was unable to be in the chamber to hear him speak. I also thank the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Short) and the this honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) for the their very valuable contributions to the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. that Message from the Governor General recomof course mending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Country Party forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Eric Robinson) read a Country Party, as a third time. NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed.",86
124,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS," I say that I am a Uttle bit surprised that this matter should be resumed at 10.20 p.m. when at me 10.30 p.m. the question will be put that the House adjourn. However, I am the next on the to speak so nobly I step into the breach. But I think that the way in which the Government conthe business of the House is a httle casual. If I may I wdl plunge into the substance of the economic statement made the other night by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). I want to separate what seemed to me to be the major aspects ofhis stateFirst of all, the statement on the one hand this makes substantial improvements in respect of child endowment and on the other hand it takes away the tax rebate system for children. Secondly it purports to give its own variant of what it calls indexation of the tax schedules. Thirdly, it imposes a new tax under the guise of sustaining Medibank. This afternoon I listened to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) who chided one of my colleagues for saying that he made 4 propositions all of which were contradictory. I would suggest that the basic measures that were encompassed in this statement are contradictory as far as any improvement of the economy is concerned. First of all I want to take the question of child endowment versus tax indexation. We are told that the combined cost of child endowment plus the tax rebate system is of the order of $ 1,021m of which something like $240m, or about one-quarter, is attributable to the child endowment bill and something like three-quarters of the total cost is attributable to the tax rebate system. These 2 items make up the net cost of $ 1,021m that was given in the Treasurer's speech. It is now proposed that we should introduce a child endowment system that will have approximately the same total cost but will distribute the overall benefits somewhat differently. It rather surprised me that the Liberal Party, of all parties, would introduce this system the way it has done. Mr Millar- I bet you were shocked.",86
125,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"I was not shocked; I was rather surprised, particularly when I listened to the sorts of arguments that were used in this House about 18 months ago when the new system of taxation was introduced. I simply make the point rather categorically that from now on the difference between married and single taxpayers as far as the tax system is concerned is no longer contained within the tax schedule but is contained within the payments for child endowment. I do not know whether this is an equitable way in which to meet this circumstantial difference. All I suggest is that not enough credit has been given or attention paid-and I think this is implicit enough in the kind of explanation that was given in the Treasurer's speech-to what was done recendy by the tax rebate system that was supposed to operate, and will operate certainly for the year ended June 1976, but will be terminated with respect to children as from 1 July 1976. I would have thought that the logical step would have been not only to remove deductions for children from the tax schedules but also to have removed deductions for wives from the tax schedules and put some kind of cash benefit upon what a wife is supposed to be worth.",87
126,Mr LUSHER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,A good idea.,87
127,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,Exacdy. All I am suggesting is that as usual the Government has not,87
128,Mr LUSHER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,They are priceless. How can you value them?,87
129,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,The Government believes that we can value children but it does not believe that we can value wives. All I suggest is that this situation simply shows the hotchpotch that can emerge if things are done in haste. When one looks at the Mr Sullivan-Would you not agree that they are 2 different arguments?,87
130,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,I think they are 2 different arguments but I do not think that the Government has examined one of them. I am trying to suggest that the Government has been pushed hurriedly into doing something,87
131,Mr LUSHER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,Has Mrs Crean considered the proposal?,87
132,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,Mrs Crean does not have to because we have no children left of a dependent age. But I still have her apparently valued as a tax rebate to me of $500.,87
133,Mr SPEAKER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,Order! I suggest that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports address himself to the Chair and leave the honourable member for Hume to make his own judgment.,87
134,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"Mr Speaker, I am glad that you are now in the chair because I am a httle bit irritated that this serious subject has been brought on for discussion at 10.20 p.m. and that presumably the debate will soon be terminated. I hope that someone wdl be courteous enough to extend to me the opportunity to continue my remarks to 11.35 p.m. which is thetimeat which my speaking time normally would run out. I simply say that the Government proposes to take children out of the tax system altogether. I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is in the House because he made a great speech in this place a few weeks ago in which he referred to a charge of 35cin the dollar. I hope that he will acknowledge that that iniquity has been perpetrated by the method now being adopted. There is now a new definition which I am sure people have not acknowledged. There is a difference now between what was taxable income 2 years ago and what is the taxable income under the new regime that we introduced and, as I have said, the present Government is continuing. The Medibank proposal for a levy of 2.5 per cent, not of tax but of taxable income certainly bears out this difference. Nearly every honourable gentleman in this chamber at the moment will have a taxable income ximately $20,000. Mr Sullivan-No way in the world.",87
135,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,And 2Vi per cent of that taxable income will be taken up by the Medibank levy. honourable gendemen opposite dispute this I suggest that they have not foUowed this matter through carefully enough. They have made breach. Who will gain except the supposed 800 000 children who belong to the 300 000 famUies whose incomes are not taxable? Mr Abel-Are you opposed to it?,88
136,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"I am asking honourable members opposite to think this matter through carefully. I do not think they have done so. Some payers lose by what the Government is doing cause every taxpayer on the sort of income level of honourable members in this place-and the Treasurer highlighted this point-los week. If one adds up the present chUd endowment rate plus the allowance of $3.85 per week, which the tax rebate system for the year ended 1976 applies, there are not too many gains in the process. Debate interrupted. NA",88
137,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., accordance with the order of the House of February 19761 propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",88
138,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT, I require the question to put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed.,88
139,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"I thank the House for the courbe tesy of aUowing me to finish my speech this evenThe ing. I have another question to ask: Given that the chUd endowment costs approximately the same as the chUd endowment plus the rebate, incomes. what wiU be the effect on 1 July ductions no longer apply for chUdren? There wiU be an immediate withdrawal of take home the extent of $780m.",88
140,Mr LUSHER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"What , in thefirstweek?",88
141,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"No, at the annual rate. Surely goodness you have enough intelUgence to know that I am talking about an annual rate. They your sums after all, not mine. Mr Sullivan-If you are rude I will move that of approyou be not further heard.",88
142,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"You cannot. Anyway, I hope you do not. This seems to me to be one of the matters which has not been thought through. If Every married taxpayer wiU lose his entitlement to claim for chUdren and therefore his weekly deductions will be so much less. Carried through on a an annual basis it wiU mean a withdrawal of $780m, matched presumably by that sum being transferred to the mothers of the community. I suggest that it is a bit hard to say whether there will be much net difference in the consumerMrBaume-$120m.",88
143,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,The honourable member can taxargue this later. The other thing I want to talk beabout is what I caU the Government's swindle of indexation. I heard it suggested here this afternoon that it means that people will be paying 13 e $3.85 a per cent less in taxation.,88
144,Mr LUSHER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,No .,88
145,Mr CREAN,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,"The former Prime Minister said that this afternoon in his speech. I hope that the honourable member beUeves that he is wrong. I have suggested here on other occasions that tax schedules should be adjusted annually. It may be done by the mythology of calling it indexation. If I may say so, it is a curious form of indexation. in The Government chooses its ownfigure-13 per 18 cent-whic h is the consumer price index minus the effects of indirect tax. That is a dubious kind of application, to say the least. The Treasurer chooses as his prime example an income that be may go from $10,000 to $11,300. What he does not say is that something Uke two-thirds of the population earn less than $ 10,000 anyway. It is nice to be able to choose your own example. What the Treasurer does not indicate, although he does it in the kind of odd lines, is that if a person happens to be somewhere between his range of $5,000 to $10,000 less than $11,300 there will no change in his marginal rate of tax at all. main advantage is in the lower down adjustments. Again, the effect of this indexation is to give the greatest advantage to the highest when the tax de Mr LUSHER - No . pay Mr CREAN-Well, the honourable member should work it through. All the junk about average rates being the same as before is, if l may say so, sheer nonsense. It is not the case that average to rates for higher up will be somewhat less but rates for lower down will be much the same. are Candidly, I do not know how the Government sells this kind of junk. Honourable members should consider this themselves. If a person's income goes up from $10,000 to $11,300 he still pays additional tax on the $1,300, whatever the case may be.",88
146,Mr SPEAKER,FISCAL POLICY DECISIONS,Order! The honourable gendeman's time has expired. Debate (on motion by Mr Baume) adjourned. NA Navigational Aid Vessel-Unemployment-Health Care-Hospital Bed Costs-Trade Union Movement-Broken Hill Mining Motion (by Mr Newman) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.,89
147,Mr THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week during the grievance debate I was severely criticised by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) for my alleged failure to protest about a decision not to proceed with the building of a navigational aid vessel in the Cairns shipyard of North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd. During his speech, to drive home his point, the honourable member for Newcastle mentioned me at least 6times.I am nattered that he should have taken the trouble to mention me so often and I wonder whether he is worried that I may be doing an effective job in my electorate. His speech was full of misrepresentation and half truths. It is perhaps unfortunate for him that I have been taking a very great interest in this firm, NQEA, which is the largest employer oflabour in Cairns. I do not intend to involve myself in the gutter politics of innuendo and character assassination. I will confine myself to the facts of the case, which are well documented. In rather complicated syntax the honourable member for Newcastle criticised, to use his words 'the decision this Government to withdraw the decision of the Labor Government to award the tender to the North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd in Cairns'. The facts are as follows: Tenders for the construction of a navigational aid vessel closed on 11 December 1974. In April 1975 NQEA in Cairns was asked to accept the tender. Unfortunately the contractual financial terms were not satisfactory to NQEA. I understand that the company would have had to carry the sum of approximately $2m over a period of 2 months pending completion of the vessel. As a What result, on 18 September NQEA sent a telex Department of Transport, then headed by the honourable member for Newcastle, which read in part: We are not prepared to accept the order or continue any funher negotiations to build the Navaid vessel except on our conditions of profit on escalation and payments. On 3 November 1975-not e the date-the Department of Transport, still headed by the honourable member for Newcastle, sent a letter to NQEA which said in part: . . . it has been decided not to proceed with this project for the time being. On 6 November NQEA sent a further letter to the Department which said: We consider now that the refusal to negotiate comes from your Depanment and not from this company. The firm, NQEA, alleges that the Department of Transport refused to negotiate on the financial terms of the contract. It was the Department of Transport then headed by a Labor Minister, the honourable member for Newcastle, which cancelled the contract, not the present Government. I agree that first class navigational aids are required for the area between Cairns and Darwin. Because of the delays in building the navigational aid vessel mentioned by the honourable member for Newcasde, his Department arranged for the building of a smaller vessel of, I think, 260 tonnes which has been built and is in service. The Department, under the honourable member for Newcastle, was satisfied that this smaller vessel could adequately maintain the navigational aid system as an interim measure. I understand that the situation will be reviewed in the light of experience to see whether a larger vessel is required. I have been working very actively in an effort to assist NQEA to obtain further contracts and I have arranged appointments for the directors of that company to see appropriate Ministers and departmental officers on a number of occasions. I reiterate that the attack on me by the honourable member for Newcastle was quite unjustified as of the contract to build a navigational aid vessel was cancelled by the department when he was Minister for Transport, not by the present Government.",89
148,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT," I want to read into the Hansard record an article which appeared in the Cathohc newspaper of South Austraha, the Southern Cross. It was written a couple of months go by Father P. R. Wilkinson. I beheve the sentiments of the article are admirable. It is headed 'To be unemployed is a social crime'. It reads: kind of spirit makes a lynching mob out of respectato the ble southern towns in the United States? Probably the same instincts that inspire Australians with jobs to put the boots into the unemployed. To be unemployed in the 1930s was a human tragedy. To be unemployed in the 1970s is a disgrace. Worse, in fact. It is a social crime. That is a fair conclusion from the general complacency at the present levels of recorded unemployment-the highest since the Great Depression. Ask 10 people what is their first thought associated with 'unemployed'. These days it is a fair bet the commonest answer will be 'dole bludgers'. There seems to be convenuonal wisdom around the country that the unemployed are long-haired surfies who do not want to work and who deserve to suffer. What no-one seems to publicise much is the fact that the numbers of unemployed exceed job vacancies by 10 to one. Hard work in searching may find someone a job, but mathematically he has only beaten nine others back in the queue. For 90 per cent there is always no job. Who are the unemployed? Where are they? There are no unemployed up and down our street. There are no huts on the Torrens, no soup kitchens. They must be surfies. Everyone who reads this paper knows someone who really wanted work and went out and got it. The neighbor's boy or the nephew's friend. And it just shows if they really want work they can get it. We have all read about the employers who advertise for labor and get no-one. It all proves that we virtuous ones are working hard, being taxed out of existence to support bludgers like those longhairs up and down the streets. No wonder there are bloody-minded cheers every ume a new Government obstacle is put in the way of the unemployed. That will make sure they get off their tails and get an honest day's work like the rest of us. Lynch another dole-bludger. From the sort of interjections we are hearing toreading. night this article sums up well the attitude of those on the Government side of the House. The time article continues: The white poor of the United States Deep South lynched their Negroes because they all had their horror stories Negroes who raped and killed lied And that shows you that Negroes are all sub-human deserve to be lynched. The quesuon is which stories are most significant-th stories of the rapist Negroes quiet, responsible and long-suffering Negroes? Which does the press live on? Let one person continue receiving unemployment relief after he has work and there will recently appearing in the Advertiser, 'He can't stop dole cheques'. The papers are not carrying too many stories about worker with a wife, four children and no job who is on the dole at $27 a week below the poverty line of the Commission. That is the gap between the dole and the poverty line for a family ofsix. People find it hard to get by even on average wages. But who puts up stories in the press about the round of second-hand clothes, kids without new shoes, cars without registration, monthly payments funher and funher behind, the fans of life of family unemployment?",89
149,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,You are reading.,90
150,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT,The article continues: Do you know Uke the rest of Australia that Surfers Paradise is just full of young dole bludgers Uving off you and me? The fact is that unemployment relief in the Gold Coast area is up to IS per cent below the national average of unemployed on relief.,90
151,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,He is reading.,90
152,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Holt will cease interjecting.,90
153,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"Those sort of interjections by the honourable member for Holt give him away and the sort of attitudes that he has. The article continues: As for the large-scale dole cheating that we hear of in horror stories, last year's total convicted of this was about 100, out of around 300 000 on benefits. And what about the ones who put themselves down as deep-sea divers in AUce Springs or drovers in Hobart? Well, how quickly would you take one job when you knew you had other qualifications? Why do Australians take horror stories of bludgers as representative of the unemployed instead of the exceptions in a great human tragedy? It is because most of us have the lynch mob mentality of people with jobs, security and a good deal of privilege. On the other hand, one in 20 in the Australian workforce knows the disgrace today of being unable to get a job. The greatest tragedy is that they are being made to feel they are bludgers because our society does this to them.",90

156,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT, I intend in of fact to speak to the House rather than to read to and assaulted and stole and it.,90
157,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable and member will resume his seat. The honourable member for Holt has interjected. The purpose of e his interjection was to draw attention to the fact or the unspectacular stories of that the honourable member for Adelaide was reading. In fact, the honourable member for Adelaide was quoting; that is why he was be a page one story like that reading.",90
158,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise a point of order. I must apologise to the Chair. I thought the honourable the member for Adelaide was reading, but as you, Henderson Sir, say he was quoting, I must accept your ruling.",90
159,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"I intend to speak rather than to read or quote. A most regrettable aberration took place in New South Wales quite recently where as a result of some promises, some deceit, and some misstatements the people of New South Wales were convinced that a gentleman known loosely as Nifty Neville but otherwise I beheve described as the now Premier of New South Wales advised the constituency that in fact he would not impose double taxation unless it happened to be by indirect taxes, and he also brought into power a collection of people who have a degree of responsibihty which is evidenced in the Sydney Morning Herald of yesterday. One of his Ministers, allegedly an expert in the area of health, said-and I quote, if l may: People in New South Wales would now be forced to carry the full burden for heavy cost of health care without any Federal financial assistance. This is the sort of material which is run in the Press in New South Wales, which according to honourable members opposite is in the hands or is the plaything of this side of the House. I might say that that story has not been denied in this newspaper. It is totally untrue. The facts of course, as I presume even some members of the Opposition would be well aware, are that $ 1,000m of Federal Government funds-that means taxpayers' money-wil l go towards medical care, Medibank or whatever its subsititutes or alternatives are in the coming iinancial year. An amount of $800m wdl in effect be provided by these money raising procedures, which of course are simply aimed at requiring those people who can afford to pay for medicine to contribute to that cost. It is extraordinary, it is unbehevable that a Minister of the Crown of a State would not only be ignorant but also would be dehberately disruptive, deliberately misleadingdisgracefully I believe-and determined to set out to mislead the people of New South Wales about Medibank, about its future and about what is I believe a right and a proper end to a situation in which the workers of this nation have subsidised the health care through their taxes of the silvertails of this nauon, to use an expression of the gentlemen who sit opposite. It is absurd and disgraceful that this gentleman in New South Wales should reject out of hand the proposition that the charge for private and intermediate hospital beds should, in fact, be something approaching-no t close enough in my view-thei r economic cost. Do the Premier of New South Wales and the well-informed Mr Stewart, who can tell such unspeakable hes in the newspapers, knowing them to be untrue, support the view that pay as you earn tax collections from workers should go towards the maintenance of beds in private and intermediate wards? Do they support the view that the workers of this country should be subsidising the unnecessary health care, as it is described by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), that goes on in private and intermediate wards. The honourable member for Prospect has some flashes of brilliance. I used to see them every now and then when he and I played football together. I support him very strongly in the comments he made last night. I entreat him to go along to Mr Stewart in New South Wales and inform him of the facts as he endeavoured to inform the people of Australia yesterday.",91
160,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (10.52)-It was very gratifying this evening to hear the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) mention that excellent newspaper, the Southern Cross, and tell us how concerned it was about the tragedy of labelling sincere Australians as dole bludgers. It reminds me of my approach to the Liberal-Country Party Government some time in 1972 concerning the closure of the South Mine at Broken Hdl. On that occasion 750 miners were concerned that they may have to go on the dole and a big delegation came from the mine to confer with the Government of that time. To Mr Street's credit, he went to Broken Hill to investigate the matter.",91
161,Mr LUSHER,ADJOURNMENT,Early 1972?,91
162,Mr FITZPATRICK,ADJOURNMENT,"That is right, early 1972.",91
163,Mr LUSHER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Street?,91
164,Mr FITZPATRICK,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes . Unfortunately no solution to the problem was found, even though it was pointed out that a lode in that town called the Western Mineralisation contains many mdlions of tons of low grade ore, and there was the possibility with a little assistance of finding another major ore body, as Northern Broken Hill Ltd did recently. Some 700 mine workers were to be put out of work. Fortunately a company called Mineral Mining and Metallurgy reopened that mine and in 6 months made over Sim profit. It introduced a new system and the workers themselves accepted sometighteningof working conditions. They even went to the extent of offering to forgo the first 6 weeks wages so this company could get into operation. Unfortunately, it has now worked out most of the payable ore and without some government assistance those workers who showed the extent to which they were prepared to go to stay off the dole will be put out of work once again. The reason for my rising tonight is that the honourable member for Adelaide reminded me of these things. I have been informed by telephone today that of the 350 workers remaining, 250 will be retrenched. Only the residue dumps will be worked to keep these employees working. I think it is tragic that a body of men who will go to any extent, even to the extent of accepting a worsening of working conditions and putting in their own money to get the company operating, will be unemployed. Fortunately, the company was able to borrow money and the employees did not have to forgo the first 6 weeks wages although they did buy a lot of shares in the company, and that is what helped keep it going during that period. I ask the Government to consider this situation because there is every possibility that if the Government contributed half the amount pf the social security benefits that would be payable to the 250 workers this mine would be able to keep going. One must remember the great amount of money that was paid into both the State and Federal Treasuries from the production of this line of lode. It started in 1S83 and is still going. Rich and wealthy mines are being worked at both ends of the lode. With some Government contribution the possibUities of the Western Mineralisation are enormous. There is a theory that as well as the main lode which has been mined since 1883 there is another major lode. This possibility is borne out by the fact that the North Mine was able to find another lode which was an extension of the main lode. A lot of low grade ore with pockets of good ore in it has already been found. I appeal to Government members to do their best to give these employees another opportunity to work the South Mine.",91
165,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,92
166,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I say at the outset that what the honourable member for DarUng (Mr FitzPatrick) said impressed me and I believe the matter he raised should be considered urgently. I am proud of the fact that over a number of years, in a Uttle place hke Hobart, I have been able to have a close connection with the trade union movement, not only as a member of Parhament but also as a practising lawyer advising individual trade union members. One union for which I have a great affection is the Austrahan RaUways Union. Apparently that union has some affection for me because barely 10 weeks ago it invited me- a Liberal member of the Federal Parliament-to accompany a deputation to confront the Premier of Tasmania, a Labor Premier, and his Labor Minister for Transport. It sickens me to see a union which is held in high esteem in Tasmania covered with shame and disgrace because of the action of 20 union bosses who decreed, without reference to the rank and file, that 50 000 members of the Australian RaUways Union were going on strike because one man determined that he would not carry out his duty because of a view he held in relation to the mining of uranium. I have no fixed view at this point on the mining of uranium. But I suggest that the mass violence, the power outside the Parliament, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) urged on the students at the University of Western Australia, reared its head yesterday with an abuse of power by the trade union movement which, in my opinion, shows that we have an irresponsible left wing element in this country which must be curbed and put down firmly by this Government. I believe that this is the only Government with the courage to take on these union bosses who decide that, whatever the majority of Australians want or think, they will make determinations and decrees and take over the country. To give an idea of how Utde the people in Tasmania knew about this matter, the Australian RaUways Union held a meeting yesterday morning in Hobart and the resolution it passed and which was made public by the Tasmanian President, Mr Jones, straight after the meeting was that it would not go on strike again in response to a national directive unless it was told the reasons for the strike and unless it had an opportunity of expressing an opinion at rank and file level. I suggest that yesterday's performance was an abuse of power by an irresponsible minority which is determined, as is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to destroy the parliamentary system which operates in this country. As a former trade unionist and an honorary life member of a trade union-that might surprise honourable members opposite- I want to say that the dinkydie",92
167,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 p.m. the debate is interrupted. The House stands adjourned until 2.15 p.m. tomorrow. 1 House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon nodce: (1) Is a search of 30 per cent of baggage of overseas visitors adequate to prevent the introduction of exotic diseases into Australia. (2) Is there in fact a 30 per cent search; if not, what is the actual percentage. (3) What checks are made by his Department to ensure that Customs officers do search an agreed percentage of baggage. (4) Have 100 per cent checks been carried out at any points of entry to Australia in the last 12 months; if so, where, for what reason, and for what length of time.",92
168,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The fact that Australia is free from many exotic animal and plant diseases is largely due to the effectiveness of quarantine precautions including the Customs examination of passengers' baggage. (2) There is no 30 per cent search requirement per se and passengers are classified according to the degree of risk which it is believed each group presents. Dependent on the disease status of their country of origin passengers from selected groups may be subjected to a complete (100 per cent) baggage examination; conversely passengers from countries with a similar disease status to Australia may only be examined on a random basis. There is therefore a wide variation in the percentage of passengers whose baggage is searched on a per flight or per ship basis. (3) Quarantine and Customs officers work alongside one another in examining passengers' baggage. Close liaison is maintained at the operative level. Quarantine activity in relation to incoming travellers is the subject of on-going consultations at various levels between officers of the two Departments. (4) See (2) above. One hundred per cent checks for quarantine purposes are made fromtimetotimeofthe baggage of passengers from particular countries and on different flight and ships. In the interests of effective future quarantine operations, I would prefer not to disclose details which might allow the patterns of quarantine baggage inspections to be determined. River Murray Waters Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Resources, upon nodce: (1) As sub-clause 28A (3) of the River Murray Waters Agreement requires the River Murray Commission from time to time to inspect or cause to be inspected such portions of the catchment of the Hume Reservoir as it thinks fit, (a) at whattimesand in what areas have inspections been carried out since 1948, the year this the Agreement, (b) on what occasions and in connection with what works has the Commission considered that measures or works undertaken in this area by the States were not effective, and (c) has the Commission ever required action from the States under sub-clause 28A (4). NA upon notice were circulated: Exotic Diseases (2) With reference to the report of the Commission for 1973-74 wherein it is noted that a feature of the repeated (Question No. 66) ftoodings of 1973-74 was the large run-off from the low foot hills and the flood plains of some Victorian catchments and the increased salt loadings of such flood discharges, (a) what studies have been made of this source of River Murray salinity and (b) are any schemes, to prevent water of high salinity which may arise from these areas intimeofflood,being investigated or considered by the relevant authorities. (3) What information is available on the effect of European Carp on the quality of River Munay water. (4) What studies have been made, or are being made, on the long term effects of European Carp on the ecology of the River Murray system. (5) What means are available to control the number of these fish, and what measures are currently being considered by the relevant authorities to control their numbers in the River Murray system. (6) What steps have been taken, and by which authorities, to ensure that catchment conditions in the Lake Hume region do not deteriorate due to pressures from the Albury Wodonga development area. (7) In view of the great expansion in 10-20 acre farmlet subdivisions in hills surrounding major Australian cities in the last few years, is he able to guarantee that the strong pressures that will arise to create this type of sub-division in the Albury-Wodonga area can be resisted. (8) Will he consider ways of ensuring that the constructing of tracks and water storages, and the grazing of cattle on steep land within the Hume catchment area, can be better controlled and policed to ensure that the stability of the catchment is not threatened. (9) Does the Commission or any other authority measure the concentration of pollutants, such as weedicides, insecticides, and fertilisers in the River Murray. (10) If so, how regularly, and at what locations, are measurements made. (11) Do these measures distinguish between the various types of pollution. (12) Is the information obtained sufficient to pin-point the areas mainly responsible for this type of pollution. (13) Are any alternative types of weedicides or pesticides available which would cause less damage to the environment than those found in the River Murray. (14) Are there any particular brands or types of pesticides and weedicides found in the River Murray that are causing most concern; if so, why. (QuestionNo. 113) (15) What proportion of these pollutants reach the River Murray from tributaries not under the jurisdiction of the Commission, and in particular, what is the estimated amount of pollution reaching the River Murray from the Darling River catchment area of Queensland, a State which is not party to the Agreement. (16) To what degree do pollutants of the type mentioned in parts (14) and (15) break down chemically in passing down to the lower reaches of the River Murray. provision was incorporated into (17) What controls are placed on the use of pesticides, weedicides or fertilisers in the River Murray catchment areas. (18) What steps are being taken or are proposed to reduce the amount of these pollutants in the River Murray.",93
169,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) (a) The catchment of Hume continuously and comprehensively by the Soil Conservation Environment, Services of New South Wales and Victoria on behalf of the the Albury/Wodonga River Murray Commission, and these State authorities provide reports each year for inclusion in the Annual Reports the River Murray Commission. (b) There have been no occasions when the Commission has considered that the measures or works undenaken in catchment area of Hume Reservoir by the States were not ment effective. (c) No. (2) (a) The Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission has considered this matter during its recent comprehensive investigation into salinity control and age in northern Victoria which is now the subject of a torian Parliamentary Public Works Committee Inquiry. This matter was also discussed in Commission entitled 'Murray Valley Salinity Investigation' by Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey in 1970. (b) The Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply mission has proposed surface drainage works and ground water pumping schemes which would, if implemented, assist in the prevention of accumulation of surface salt which turn would minimise the input of salt to the River Murray from the surface of the land during storm run-off. I advised that the complete diversion or retention of all face run-off from salt prone areas would not be feasible. appropriate to mention, however, that when such areas are flooded, it is usual for the River Murray to be carrying a high flow which is able to dilute the salt inflows to acceptable Umits. (3) As far as I have been able to determine very little power specific information has been complied on the effect of unilateral European Carp on the quaUty of the River Murray water. (4) Inland waters do not fall within the jurisdiction of Commonwealth Government and primary responsibility for control of European Carp in the River Murray rests with the State of New South Wales. However, the Commonwealth involved in problems of this nature through its representation on the Australian Fisheries Council by the Minister for Primary Industry. I am advised that the Council's Standing Committee on Fisheries has acknowledged the wide pubweedicides, licity given to the reported increase in the population distribution of European Carp within Victoria, South Australia an New South Wales, and that, at the present time, scientists from these three States are preparing a situation report on the European Carp problem for submission to the Standing Committee. I have instructed my Depanment to seek what funher information might be available at present time on the status of that repon and the impUcations as far as Commonwealth involvement in River Murray matAustralia ters is concerned, bearing in mind made by the Federal/State River Murray Working Party its October 1975 Repon which I expect to be tabled in Parliament in the near future. (5) I am advised that there are various measures available New for controlling the number of the carp, which include: poisoning with fish-specific poisons; exclusion of adults from areas by physical and electrical Commission barriers; promoting commercial and amateur carp fishing; and use of water level controls to inhibit breeding. The most effective method of control would involve have measures to prevent the spread of carp to new waterways, coupled with attempts to find a species-specific capicide, biological control or a means whereby cenain species of carp are disadvantaged compared to the understand that the Victorian Fisheries Depanment is currently investigating the introduction of a carp virus. (6) Commonwealth Government responsibility for Reservoir is inspected Albury-Wodonga development is vested in the Minister for Housing and Community Development, but designated area incorporates only secof tions of the Lake Hume foreshore within the Lake Hume catchment. The Development Corporation does not, therefore, exercise control over the Lake Hume catchment. However, I understand it is conscious of the need to plan for the future pressures which could be executed upon the catchand liaises with appropriate authorities in this respect. I am also advised that the Corporation has expressed strong opposition to inappropriate developments in the catchment and has recommended a joint regional study in which I expect my Depanmental officers wdl be included, to consider detailed future planning in the context of the growth draincentre. The Lake Hume catchment has been proclaimed Vicunder the Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation Act 1958, in order to ensure a uniform procedure for land use planning. the Report to the River Murray (7) The main pressures for farmlet subdivisions will arise outside the Albury/Wodonga designated area and control remains the prime responsibility of the Planning and ComEnvironment Commission (N.S.W.) and the Town and Country Planning Board (Vic). I am advised that the Albury/Wodonga Development Corporation is concerned in in this matter and has recommended joint regional planning studies with the two State planning authorities. Within the am designated area for the growth centre, the Development surCorporation will have the powers to resist development It is pressures of this nature and is planning accordingly. (8) These are matters for which the States of New South Wales and Victoria retain primary responsibility and on which the Commonwealth Government would have no in terms of the Australian Constitution to take direct, action. Clause 28A of the River Munay Waters Agreement provides for measures and policing of measures to protect the catchment of the Hume Reservoir and I have the no reason to believe that these are not adequate (see answer pan (1)). However, any specific matters which are demonstrated to be of serious concern will be taken up in joint disis cussions with the respective State authorities. (9) The River Murray Commission does not of its own accord measure the concentration of pollutants such as insecticides and fertilisers in the River Murray. and Such matters are at present outside its chaner. The bulk of data avaUable on water quality in the River Murray is available from South Australia. Until recently, such measurements of water quaUty were more directly related to agriculture. However, with the increase in use of the River Murray for domestic and recreational purposes, the health aspects have been gaining greater prominence. Fifteen locations along the River Murray in South are now measured for a wide range of parameters cenain recommendations on a monthly in Depanment. basis by the Engineering and Water Supply The Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of South Wales carries out measurements on salinity on a regular basis at a number of stream gauging stations along the River Murray. In addition, the State Pollution Control of New South Wales has carried out surveys of pollution sources in New South Wales affecting the Murray and has commenced monitoring at selected stations. In Victoria, pollution orientated monitoring programs been initiated by the Environmental Protection Authority of that State. Bacteriological sampling and sampling of a various chemical and physical indices are being carried out at a number of stations in the River Murray system by that native fish population. I State.

(11) (See also answer to pan (9) above). Based on knowledge, salinity is the main form of pollution in the Murray and nutrients represent a potenual problem. Available information shows that apan from salinity the River Murray are relatively unpolluted from the source to the mouth.

These include physical, measures for the control of pollution details of which are set out in Section 5 of Appendix A of the October 1975 Report of the River Murray Working Party. (18 ) The Water Quality Committee of the River Murray Working Pany concluded that existing legislation three States provides adequate control of both direct and indirect polluted discharges into the River Murray. The River Murray Working Party has also recommended that the River Murray Waters Agreement should be amended to enat able the River Murray Commission to take account of water quality in its operational and investigational role.
