1,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The following letter appeared in Monday's Brisbane Courier headed "" A Mother's C o m p l a in t "" : To-day I received a post-card from my son in Egypt, dated 12th March, in which he says lie is hoping to get letters. As I have Written every week regularly since he left here last November, I should like to know what becomes of my letters. He also saya he has written every week. Well, I have received in all two letters and two postcards. Who is responsible f In writing this, I am airing the complaints of hundreds of mothers, who, like myself, should certainly have the privilege of hearing from their Bons, who, arc lighting"" for their country. A footnote is appended saying that the editor had received other letters to the same effect. . I know from communications that I have had with the Defence Department that it is anxious to expedite the delivery of letters, but I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence if he ""will in quire whether an improved method cannot be discovered i",4
2,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The honourable member intimated that he intended to ask this question, and I have ascertained from the Minister of Defence that he is willing to confer with the Postmaster General with a view to complying with the honourable member's request. letters passing between soldiers at the front and relatives here should have the quickest despatch possible.",5
3,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Following on the reply given to a question asked yesterday, that we have ample equipment, I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether the Government proposes to offer to the Imperial Government further contingents beyond those now undergoing preparation!",5
4,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"This matter rests solely with the Prime Minister, to whom the honourable member should address hia question when the right honourable gentleman returns to Melbourne. IMPERIAL WI NE DUTY.  to ask the Acting Prime Minister a question regarding a matter which affects not only Victoria but also other States of the Commonwealth, namely, the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to in crease the Imperial duty on wine to 5s. per gallon. In view of the in j u r y that this will do to the vignerons of Australia, does not the honourable gentleman deem it advisable to cable to the Imperial authorities protesting against what is proposed to he done ?",5
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Before such a cable is sent, action should be taken by the vignerons of Australia to proclaim ths injury that they aro likely to suffer, and it should be made plain that a considerable portion of our citizens desire us to take action. It is the duty of the Government to give effect to the wishes of any body of citizens representing an important Australian industry such as wine making, but we cannot act on the request of one or two vignerons. It must first be shown that there is a consensus of opinion in favour of our interference. Once that is done-and it ought not to be a matter of difficulty to get it done-w e shall be pleased to make representations to tire Imperial Government.",5
6,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have been approached on this subject by several bodies representing other States, and by representatives of the vine-growing interest in Victoria, and have been informed that OD Friday next they intend to make a united request to the Minister of Trade and Customs. J ask the Acting Prime Minister, before determining on the form of a telegram'to the Imperial Government, to The wait until they have put their suggestions before the Government.",5
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I shall certainly await the result of the meeting. MEAT SUPPLY.,5
8,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,"As the Imperial Government has requisitioned the whole of the Australian and New Zealand meat supply, and proposes to sell the surplus on the London market, to prevent an undue increase in the price of meat to the British public, will the Minister of Trade and Customs consider the advisability of making representations which will insure that the drain on our meat supply shall not abnormally increase the price of the Australian product?",5
9,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"T he position is a difficult one, in view of the fact that, while we have power to prohibit wholly or in part the export of meat, we cannot compel any person to put 1 lb. of meat on the local market. The export of meat to every country but Great Britain has been prohibited, except that at the request of the Imperial Government a small contract for supplying the troops of another countr y is being carried oufc. I am willing to consult my colleagues as to the advisability of making representations to the Imperial Government as requested.",5
10,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In order to allay public anxiety as to a shortage in the meat supply, will the Minister of Trade and Customs state definitely whether the requisition by the Home authorities refers only to the surplus at present in the frozen chambers-the surplus over the requirements of our own people-o r to the whole of the supply f",5
11,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I understand that the British Government made representations to the various State Governments. There are really only three States involved-Queensland , in the case of beef; New South Wales, to a lesser extent, in the case of beef; 'Victoria and New South Wales for mutton and lamb. Only in Queensland and New South Wales did the State Governments pass Bills dealing with the matter. In Victoria some arrangement was come to, but I understand that that arrangement has broken down, and that those interested are sending away supplies, or holding them, or doing what they like.",6
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Did all the States receive a request to take some action ?,6
13,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , but the reply was that an arrangement had been made in Victoria--a n arrangement which, I understand, has broken down.",6
14,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The Minister has not touched the point I raised.,6
15,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I understand the position is as the honourable member for Wannon has stated-that the Imperial Government have requisitioned for any supplies we can let them have.,6
16,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,That means the surplus only?,6
17,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I presume so.,6
18,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Why not say is the whole point.,6
19,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Did the M in ister observe in today's newspaper a statement that in the House of Commons the Imperial Government had announced that they were going to take all the Australian meat they could get, and distribute the surplus, over and above their own needs, among the people of England ?",6
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I did see the statement, and, in the same newspaper, I saw a further statement by Mr Runciman that there was a meat combine in Australia.",6
21,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,There is no connection bebween the two matters.,6
22,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The Minister is miles away from the fact!,6
23,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Will the Minister of Trade and Customs state whether his Department is aware of any such combination in Australia as has been alleged with respect to the export of meat from anv part of the Commonwealth?,6
24,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,So far as I am aware it is not. COMMONWEALTH ENROLMENT.,6
25,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Is the Attorney-General aware that a number of persons have been fined for failin g to enrol under the Commonwealth electoral law? Will the Minister also inquire whether a Mr . and P. H . Morris, a magistrate at Allora, Queensland, has publicly advised all meu and women to vote against candidates who are not in favour of putting an end to compulsory enrolment, ""and has stated that no respectable ""woman desired the right to vote, and that he felt in clined to apologize to every woman whom he had to fine? Will the Minister take steps to prevent this magistrate from acting judicially in Commonwealth cases?",6
26,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have not seen the report of the magistrate's utterances; but if they were as recorded they are grossly improper. I shall ask for a report on the * matter, with a view to taking such action as seems in the circumstances necessary and proper. Police magistrates, as a rule, refrain from acting the Justice Shallow, but this gentleman appears to have failed to recognise the responsibilities and limitations of his position; and if the facts be as stated he must be taught them. WOODLARK ISLAND.",6
27,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Will the Postmasterso? It General see thab men employed at Woodlark Island, who, in consequence' of malaria, or any other tropical diseases, are unable to work, are invalided to their homes instead of being given a week's notice of dismissal ?",6
28,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am not aware that any men at Woodlark Island have received notice of dismissal. Those who have expressed the wish to be invalided home have had their hospital expenses and passages paid; everything possible is done for them. However, the work on Woodlark Island is nearing completion, so that it is not likely any further complaints of the kind will arise. PRICE OF SUGAR.",6
29,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Has the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs been drawn to a statement issued by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company that it is necessary to make immediate arrangements for the importation of sugar to carry us over July and August? Can the Minister inform the House at what price that sugar will be available to the public of Australia after the duty has been paid ? Any further information regarding the matter will be acceptable.,6
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Melbourne asked me a question regarding the importation of sugar by New Zealand, in connection with which I am now obtaining information. I understand that, in July and August, Australia will be in exactly the same position as is New Zealand all the year round, inasmuch as there Will be no internal production of sugar, and all supplies will have to be imported.",7
31,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Is there any duty on sugar in New Zealand?,7
32,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Speakin g from memory, I think uot.",7
33,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That fact ought to be taken into account.,7
34,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am obtaining information as to how we stand in this regard, and I shall submit the information I receive to my colleagues, with a view to action being taken on behalf of the people of Australia. LOANS TO THE STATES.",7
35,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"In regard to the borrowings by the States, subsequent to the outbreak of the war, can the At torney-General tell us whether there was any written agreement with the Premiers, and, if so, will that agreement be made available to honourable members?",7
36,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is a point that, so far as the details are concerned, I should have preferred the honourable member to lay before the Prime Minister. I was at the Conference, and there was a general understanding which was, I think, reduced to writing, covering the point to which the honourable member refers. However, I must not be understood as saying so definitely, because I do not know absolutely whether that was so or not.",7
37,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman communicate with the Prime Minister regarding the matter?,7
38,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes . REGISTERED PATENTS.  General be good enough to inform the House as to the number of patents regisgentleman tered within the Commonwealth by alien enemies, and also take into consideration the* advisableness of having a list of such Britaiu ? patents published in the Government Gazette?",7
39,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am afraid I am unable to do as the honourable member requests. I am not in a position to say whether such a list can be supplied; but if the House desires I shall make inquiries with a view to supplying one. The preparation of such a list is obviously a matter of considerable difficulty; and I should be glad to have some expression of opinion from the House as to whether it should be supplied, seeing that I do not desire to ask the Department to enter on a work, the nature of which is in itself unimportant, unless the House so declares. I do not think the information will be found to be easily obtainable, though I think it ought to be. I shall make inquiries, and let the honourable member know next week whether such a list can be supplied. If it can be supplied I shall supply it . ATLANTIC CBE.",7
40,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether any step is being taken to bring about the nationalization of the Atlantic cable, so that we may have at least one State-owned cable between England and Australia. If that were done we should be able to send lettergrams and other messages on our own terms, instead of having to ask for concessions from a private company.",7
41,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"No very definite steps have recently been taken. I am altogether in sympathy with the honourable member's proposal, but, owing to the war, I think, the matter has been somewhat delayed.",7
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And the next election is still a long way off, is it not?",7
43,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"That has nothing to do with the matter. I shall ascertain from the Secretary of the Department what the position is. WINE INDUSTRY.  torney-General has promised the honourable member for Indi that he will make a protest to the Imperial Government if combined effort is made by the winemakers and growers, will the honourable also make a protest to his own Government against imposing addi<tional duties on exporte from Great",7
44,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is a blow from the hand of a friend that I think merits one "" taking the count,"" and I shall do so.",8
45,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"J desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he wished to suggest in his reply to questions with reference to the duties on wine to be imposed by the Imperial Government that, provided a sufficient agitation were created amongst vignerons in Australia, the Governmenb would back up that agitation, or whether he meant to suggest that the Government would bring before the Imperial Administration the views of Australian wine-growers with reference to these duties.",8
46,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What I said was that we would voice the representations of the vignerons if we were assured that they embodied the general opinion of those engaged in the industry. As to our own attitude in regard to the matter, I think it would be grossly improper for us to attempt to dictate to the Imperial Goverument what form their fiscal policy should take. CARRIAGE OF MAILS .",8
47,Mr GREGOEY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is the policy of the present Administration to carry the mails in Western .Australia on a privately-owned railway line, and also to convey mails by conveyances along roadways running by the side of State-owned lines.",8
48,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am not aware that there is any - such policy in operation, Tf what the honourable member says is true, there is no doubt an explanation bearing on the matter of cost in regard to it . EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. DESPATCH AND DELIVE RY OF MAILS : NA BROADMEADOWS.",8
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"Many weeks ago the present Acting Prime Minister promised that he would convene a conference between the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Defence in regard to ihe despatch and delivery of letters to troops at the front . We have been promised for many months a rectification of grievances in this regard, and I should like either the Postmaster-General or the Assistant Minister of Defence to make a definite statement to the House as to what are the arrangements for the delivery of tliese mails, and what is proposed to remedy the present intolerable state of affairs. Can the Postmaster General give me any information on the subject? I have relatives at the front who have not had a - letter since they have been there.",8
50,Mr SPENCE,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,It does not follow froni what the right honourable member has said that there is anything wrong with this end of the service. I shall obtain for the Leader bf the Oppositiondetailed particulars regarding the systemthat is adopted. There has been the most complete co-operation between the Postal Department and the Departmentof Defence.,8
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"I - w is h to ask the Postmaster-General what has become of the suggestion that I made to the Acting Prime Minister many weeks ago that he should make one of the postal officials with the Expeditionary Forces, then in Egypt, responsible for the proper distribution of letters amongst.the troops, and should require him to place himself in close and intimate relation with the Egyptian Postal Department. Has anything been done in that direction ?",8
52,Mr SPENCE,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"The matter is one for the Department of Defence, and I believe it has made complete arrangements for the distribution of letters. The Department has been utilizing the services of experienced postal officers who are members of the Expeditionary Forces. I tliink that the point raised by the right lionorable member has been attended to by the Defence Department. There are some 2.00 or 300 postal officials in the Expeditionary Forces, and their services are being utilized for this special kind of work.",8
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence, after conferring with the Postmaster-General, if he cares to doso, inform the House in detail tomorrow precisely what steps are adopted to insure the delivery of letters to the troops.",8
54,Mr JENSEN,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,I shall be pleased to try to comply with the right honourable member's request tomorrow.,8
55,Mr RODGERS,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"The Acting Minister of Defence yesterday placed before the House a report from the Inspector General, Colonel Legge, with respect to the regrettable death of Private Dancocks at Broadmeadows. Will sistant Minister afford an opportunity for a statement from the relatives of the deceased and the nurse who had charge of him, to be put before the House, so that honourable members may learn of the glaring discrepancies in the statements of the two parties to this case?",8
56,Mr JENSEN,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"If the relatives of the deceased are dissatisfied with the treatment that he received while at Broadmeadows I am sure that the Minister of Defence will be pleased to meet them and to discuss with them every phase of the matter. If , after that has been done, they are still dissatisfied, I shall have no objection to the honourable member's proposal; they should first see the Minister.",9
57,Mr RODGERS,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,It was on presentations to the Department that the report from the Inspector-General was obtained.,9
58,Mr MATHEWS,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,I understand that the Assistant Minister of Defence has promised that the Department will consider the appointment of an outside board to deal with the case of Private Dancocks.,9
59,Mr JENSEN,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,I have not promised any outside inquiry.,9
60,Mr MATHEWS,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,There are many cases that require similar attention because of the discrepancies between the statements of officers of the Department and the individuals concerned. SUPPLY OF BOOTS: CASE OF MR.,9
61,Mr BRENNAN,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"May I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence when I am to expect a statement from him respecting the case of Mr Harris, boot manufacturer, of Fitzroy, and the alleged onerous conditions under which he is supplying, or about to supply, boots to the Defence Department?",9
62,Mr JENSEN,DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS AT,"I understand that the honourable member has had some communication with the boot manufacturer to whom he has referred, aud that that communication has been forwarded to the Defence Department. I also understand that the Department has replied to Mr . Harris, giving reasons for its decision with regard to the contract entered into by Mr Harris' firm. NA PARLIAMENT.",9
63,Mr BURNS,REPORTS PRESENTED TO,"Mr Speaker, can any the As- provision be made for binding the reports of the Inter-State Commission when they come to hand so that honourable members may be able to keep them together?",9
64,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS PRESENTED TO,I have no objection to seeing that the honourable member's wishes are carried out if the House desires it .,9
65,Mr JH CATTS,REPORTS PRESENTED TO,"Mr Speaker, as I understand that the printing of the reports of the Public Works Committee comes with in your jurisdiction, I wish to point out that the report of the Committee upon the sewerage of Canberra makes reference to a number of plans and documents put in as evidence, but which are not attached to the report, and their absence makes the report largely their re- unintelligible. Will you, Mr Speaker, see that prints of diagrams are added to the reports of the Committee, so that honourable members will be able to follow the evidence with the same intelligence as members of the Committee?",9
66,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS PRESENTED TO,"When a document is laid on the table and ordered to be printed, it is printed in the for m in which it is laid on the table. If diagrams and plans are not attached to a report, we can do nothing in regard to them. Wo can only prin t what is laid on the table.",9
67,Mr JH CATTS,REPORTS PRESENTED TO,What steps can be taken to have these reports presented in such a way that honourable members can understand them ?,9

On what date was Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice instructed to design the two suction dredgers ? 5. What is the necessity for having the desings for these dredgers sent out here, and who is to revise the plans and specifications for these dredgers?",9
70,Mr JENSEN,REPORTS PRESENTED TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are : 1. Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice originally recommended that one bucket dredger be provided to assist the suction dredgers with any difficult material on the banks. It is found that a considerable length of the proposed channel is covered with an entanglement of marine growth of a strong fibrous nature penetrating the sand some 6 feet deep. It is proposed to use the bucket dredger to remove this matter, and thereby prepare the way for suction dredgers later. 2. The contract price was £34,875. 3. Tenderers were required to submit designs and specifications. The design submitted by Messrs. Poole and Steel, of Sydney, who were the successful tenderers, was a copy of one originally designed on the Clyde. This design was modified by the naval authorities to give additional strength.

77,Mr JENSEN,NATURALIZE D GERMANS AN D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are : 1.

EXCISE ON BEER.",10
80,Mr BURCHELL,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"tke Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I.

Can he give the rates of Excise on beer operating in Australia and Great Britain?",11
81,Mr TUDOR,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. In my absence on official business in New South Wales, a deputation waited on Senator Russell, Assistant Minister, on the subject. 2. The Excise duties operating on beer areBeerBrewed from barley malt and hops exclusively, per gallon, 5d. N.E.L, per gallon, 6d. Beer per barrel (36 gallons) of specific gravity 1055 (550 gravity) ... ... Less rebate up to 31st March, 1916 Per barrel ... ... Per gallon, 7.C6d. The standard gravity is 1055, and beer of a greater or less gravity is charged more or less .duty, according to the proportion its gravity bears to the standard gravity, e.g., beer of a gravity of 1050 would pay 50/55ths of 23s., equalling 20s. l i d . per barrel. In addition to the above duty a surtax, as shown below, has been proposed, the operation of which has been postponed till 18th instant. Beer, specific gravity 43 to 48 per barrel, 12s.; equals 4d. per gallon. Beer, specific gravity 49 to 53 per barrel, 21s., equals 7d. per gallon. Beer, specific gravity over 53 per barrel, 30s., equals 12d. per gallon. Total in Great Britain, 19.66d. per gallon.

82,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Denison) [3.8]. - In resuming the debate on this important question I wish to place on record my appreciation of the cordial manner in which the honourable member for Angas received my criticism, which was given with no party bias, though I admit that I speak purely as one who is in favour of party Government, because I cannot see that any other system is likely to be introduced in Australia, at any rate in our time. The motion of the honourable member for PAPER S. Angas refers to the proportional system as I know it in Tasmania. In that State we first introduced the Hare-Spence system, which was later improved upon by the late Mr Justice Clark. That gentleman gave a lot of attention to the matter, and was assisted by Mr R. M . Johnston in evolving the system up to its present for m . As a result, there is in Tasmania a system of proportional representation equal, if not superior, to any system in the world. Recently I read that the authorities in England are about to send out a Commissioner to inquire into the working of the proportional voting system in Tasmania. Therefore, I think I shall be justified in taking that - system as the basis of my arguments on this motion. Since speaking on this subject a fortnight ago I have had an opportunity of looking iuto some documents I had in hand, and I propose to quote somewhat f u l ly this afternoon from >i very valuable report submitted to the Parliament of Tasmania by Mr H . E. Packer, the then Chief Electoral Officer in Tasmania; Mr E . L . Piesse, LL . B . , Assistant Deputy Returning Officer for the districts of Denison and F r a n k l in; and Mr J . F . Daly, who is now the Chief Electoral Officer of Tasmania.  man who did excellent work in this House. He is well known to a good number of politicians in Tasmania and throughout Australia owing to the attention he has given to the subject of proportional representation. I do not know  a great student, and I am inclined to think he has very little time to spare for practical politics - Liberal proportion was 2.8, and the",11
83,Mr THOMAS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Is that the reason why hp favours proportional representation?,12
84,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"It may be. The gentlemen who drafted the report were quite unbiased. Honourable members will remember that when I was speaking to this motion on a previous occasion I pointed out that this system of voting tended to bring about a clique for m of government. In my opinion, the, usefulness of the system ceases when the whole political body is divided into two great camps-the "" ins "" and the "" outs,"" or Labour and Liberal. The report to which I am referring deals with the Tasmanian election of 1912, which was one of the most important elections which has been held under this system, and it saysI t has been assumed, in preparing the table, that a voters' party allegiance is shown by this No. 1 choice. AH papers on which the No. I choices are given to Liberal candidates aro assumed to be the ballot-papers of followers of the Liberal party, and so with the Labour party. 'Ihe scrutiny showed that some electors gave their No. 1 choice to one party, and their No. 2 and higher choices to the other party; and in such cases it may be that No. 2 and the higher choices indicate the voter's party, and that the No. 1 choice was given to a candidate of the other party for a personal reason. _ But it is thought that the assumption is a fair one for the purposes of this table, and the tablecontained in the Appendix.  of the words, "" higher choice "" ?",12
85,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,It is merely a term. I am of opinion that the No . 2 choice on the ballot-paper may not be of the same value as the No. 1.,12
86,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,It is only used if the No. 1 choice is ineffective. The elector does not have two votes; he has an alternative choice.,12
87,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"That is why the system is so unfair in electorates returning six members. My view is that the No -1 vote is the effective one. In the Tasmanian election of 1912, the proportions were obtained by the parties all right, but what was the result? A table in this report shows what the result was. For each electorate six members were required. In the electorate of Bass, the Liberal proportion of voters was 3.1, and the Labour proportion 2.9. The result of the election was that the Liberals returned three members and the Labour party three members. In Darwin, the Labour proportion 3.2; but, again, each party returned three members.",12
88,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The parties were very evenly balanced.,12
89,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The report will allow that they were not very evenly balanced. In Denison, the Liberal proportion of votes was 3.1, and the Labour proportion 2.9, and again three members were returned on each side. In the electorate of Franklin, the proportions were: Liberal. 3.4; Labour 2.6. Once more the two parties eacli returned three.members. In the electorate of Wilmot, the Liberal proportion was 4, and the Labour proportion 2, and the Liberals returned 4 members and Labour 2. The total proportions of the five electorates were: Liberal. 16.3; Labour 13.7; and the Liberals returned 16 members, and Labour 14 members. The report says The table shows that not only did each party obtain in the aggregate as nearly as possible the number of members to which it was entitled",12
90,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Hear , hear! That is the point.",12
91,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The quotation continuesBut also that in each district the number of members obtained by each party was the whole number nearest to its proportional share of the representation for the district. It is clear, then, that the rules of the Electoral Act meaning have produced proportional representation of the parties. Then bitter complaint was of the smallness of the majority. That is the great trouble. "" But the election has resulted in the larger party having only two more members than smaller, and it is of interest to examine far the system of the Electoral Act must sarily produce such result. In speaking on the subject previously, stated that the system ofvoting advocated by the honourable member for Angas would give greater representation in the Senate to the minority, and that ""the sequence would be that an Administration would have so small a majority port it that it would be difficult for it to get its measures passed. from which I am reading continuesI t is to be noticed, in a small House, a narrow majority must necessarily occur when parties are nearly equal in the constituencies, and that if these were larger, the majority would probably be creased relatively as well as absolutely. each district had returned ten members place of six, making a House of fifty, orife party would probably have had twenty-eight members, and the other twenty-two, giving sufficient working majority of six. I have spoken of the waste of votes by the proportional system of voting. This is what really occurred in Tasmania during an election under the proportional system of votingIn preparing Table V., some 37,000 papers were considered. Losses occurred from or about 4 i per cent., of these papers, owing to cross voting. In addition to these there would be others on which there waa cross voting, jvhich did not become effective owing to election or exclusion of candidates. The total amount of cross voting is, therefore, not shown in the table; but the table shows that there was cross voting, which resulted in loss on about one paper in twenty, and the loss from each of such papers was half a vote. The most important objection to the hon the orable member's proposal is the difficulty of counting the ballot papers. the general election held in Tasmania on lock. 30th April, 1912, there were six members to be elected for the constituency of Denifor son. The ballot papers numbered of which 444 were rejected as informal, leaving 16,156 formal ballot papers. quota was obtained by dividing the ber of formal ballot papers by seven adding one, which gave 2,309. I have here a facsimile of the sheet showing counting on which the return was made. The final choice was arrived at only Mr Laird Smith. made 'the one hundred and thirtieth count. Two members were elected on the first count, because of the No. 1 votes cast for them. Tliese were Sir Elliott the Lewis and Mr Woods. Two Labour men how - Mr Barker and Mr Edmunds-ra n necesvery close together. Mr Barker secured sufficient votes to keep him in the count, I but not enough to reach the quota, even though he was elected. He was elected on 1,708 effective votes, Mr Edmunds, who obtained 1,670 effective votes, being conrejected. Therefore, even under the proportional system of voting, a number of to suppersons remains unrepresented.",12
92,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"An y number less than The report the quota cannot be represented; but this system gives a fairer representation than the first place, that in any other.",13
93,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"It is claimed for the system that it gives representaintion to every voter, and that it certainly If does not do. I particularly emphasize in the difficulty in counting under the proportional system, and I trust that some the lionorable member will attempt to show that there are means whereby the count-' caused ing can be done more easily.",13
94,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I mentioned a method based on an Imperial Act, and I stated also that there could be a party block vote.",13
95,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I question 1,650, whether that would work. Those whom papers, I have named have given so much attention to this matter that I think that they must have adopted the best system obtainable. But honourable members can imagine how long it would take to prepare, for a State like Victoria, a return that of Senate voting such as that which I about exhibit in regard to' the State voting for Denison. Tasmania has not found proportional system the success which it was thought it would be. The system During there has brought about a party dead",13
96,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"That may not be healthy parties, but it may be healthy for the 16,600, public.",13
97,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"That is a matThe ter of opinion. This may happen at the numnext election: Electors numbering 2,310 and may return a candidate for Denison, and other candidates may be similarly rethe turned for Bass and other electorates. The candidates so returned may afterafter wards combine, and thus sway the major it y . If that happens, these candidates, who might be elected to support the closing of hotels, the handing of the railways over to private companies, or anything else, could effectively combine to force the Government to give them what they needed, the penalty for refusal being the loss of support and office.",13
98,Mr JH CATTS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Does the Labour party in Tasmania favour the present electoral system there?,14
99,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,No ; it intends to amend the Tasmanian Electoral Act.,14
100,Mr GHEENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,If it can.,14
101,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The member who gives the party a majority is an outand-out Liberal of the old school, and f he is sufficiently progressive to enable the progressive Labour Government to amend the Act, it will be done.",14
102,Mr JH CATTS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,What about the Tory Tasmanian Council?,14
103,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I dare not prophesy in regard to what may happen in the Upper House. progressive legislation Chamber. At present, neither party has a working majority in the Tasmanian Parliament, and I gather from the press that it is the intention of the Government to try to alter the electoral system of the State. The system of proportional voting is all very well in theory. On paper, it is a beautiful system.",14
104,Mr JH CATTS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Does the majority of the electors understand it ?,14
105,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I question whether every honourable member of Parliament understands it . Honourable members can imagine the amount of calculating necessary to get out a return such as that for Denison. Sir Elliott Lewis got 2,732 votes, and was declared elected. When I stood for election in Tasmania I had to obtain 9,500 votes before being elected. L it t l e parties can be formed all over the place, and so long as a candidate gets over the quota of 2,309, in he goes. I take it that this system is all right when there are many different sections desirous of returning members directly concerned with the temperance question, or the religious question, and so for t h . But now that the parties are so clearly defined, it is not at all necessary. As an instance of how the people are divided ' into two distinct parties, I might cite one of the Senate elections in Tasmania, at which Colonel Cameron was a candidate. [107] Colonel Cameron had occupied a seat in the Senate, and might be described as one of the most popular gentlemen in Tasmania, for whom a personal vote could safely be relied on. But Colonel Cameron came out as an Independent candidate, and he did not obtain nearly-uie number of votes recorded for either the selected Liberal candidate, or the selected Labour candidate. I think that similar results could be found all over Australia at the present time; and it is for that reason that I think proportional voting now is of no earthly use. I admit that it would affect the representation of the State; but of what value would that representation be? An y change in this regard could ; only have the effect of retarding business. We know how, in the case of the late Government, the party stuck closely to the leaders, who were thus enabled to hold office for a much longer period than any of us would have anticipated. The effect of proportional representation in the. Senate would simply lengthen the sittings You cannot get without having any effect whatever on the through that legislation.  presentation apply to both Houses?",14
106,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I suppose so; but the difficulty would be in the grouping of the electorates; and my own feeling is that the party which had the greatest number of supporters in the cities would overwhelm the country vote. I have endeavoured to fit myself to discuss this question in the presence of such able men as the honourable member for Angas and others; and I hope that the motion will be thoroughly debated.,14
107,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Can the honourable member say whether proportional representation has had any material influence on the disposition of parties in Tasmania 'I,14
108,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"To be candid, the system did help the Labour party when that party was first inaugurated, and it will help any party until it becomes so numerous as to form a deadlock. As a matter of fact, in Tasmania at the present time, the position of parties is such that it is impossible to bring about any change.",14
109,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Why should we, if people are so nearly balanced in opinion?",14
110,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"In the case of proportional representation, an elector gives his No. 1 vote to a candidate who voices his opinion, while possibly his No. 2 vote goes to a man whom he does not know at all; and, altogether, I fail to see how, under the system, we fying majority. could have that fair representation which the honourable member for Angas has led us to expect. I have an open mind on the question, and I shall listen to the bate with the greatest interest. I every desire for the fair representation of all people in the community; but I fail to see how this plan is to bring it about, in view of the distinct party lines which now exist.",14
111,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Wannon) [3.41] I had the pleasure of listening to the able speech of the honourable member for Angas in introducing the motion, and abo to the reply of the Minister of Home Affairs; and we have now had a contribution from the honourable member for Denison, who has seen the practical working of proportional representation in his own State, and apparently selected those points which are to the disadvantage, rather than to the advantage, of the system. It would be idle for any one to submit a proposal of this kind and claim that it represented a perfect system. No system is perfect, but any plan that aims at giving people representation in proportion to their numerical strength-ex cept, of course, sections so small that representation cannot be given to themis a step in the direction of affording the opportunity not only to exercise the franchise, but to voice their views in the legislative halls of their country. The Minister of Home Affairs, as one who has given this question a good deal of consideration, seems to take up a very anomalous position. He opposes this motion, but at the same time he is in favour of the initiative and referendum, which would greatly extend the power of a proportion of the people outside, though what that proportion is has not been definitely stated by the Labour party. However, if we take the figures in the case of some of the American States, or of Switzerland, we find that 8,000 electors may be able either to compel the introduction of legislation, or to demand a referendum on proposed legislation. The Minister of Home Affairs told us that he would not give to any minority outside the power of direct representation in this Parliament, but, as I say, he is at the same time prepared to permit the initiative and referendum, with the consequences I have indicated.",15
112,Mr ABCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,There must be a rati,15
113,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Ultimately that is so, but with the initiative and referendum a minority outside is given a great deal demore power than would be given to it have under proportional representation.",15
114,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,There is no analogy.,15
115,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"There may not be direct analogy, but the same principle is involved.",15
116,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I do not think much of the honourable member's logic!,15
117,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"As to that we can agree to differ: but it struck me that the honourable gentleman's attitude was most illogical. If a minority has a right to have its voice heard outside, why should not the same minority have the right to send representatives here, with a view, perhaps, to convert the majority? Is the initiative and referendum merely intended as a sop to the minority outside? If the Government really intended that the initiative and referendum shall give a small minority outside the right to move Parliament, it will mean that a minority will be able, to a great extent, to "" boss"" Parliament - to force the Legislature to occupy much time in considering, possibly, insignificant proposals sent from outside. At the last Senate election the total Labour vote was represented by 6,234,000 odd, and the Liberal vote by 5,499,000 odd, showing a difference of only about 735,000 out - of a 12,000,000 vote, and yet we have the astounding result of thirty-one Labour representatives and five Liberal representatives. I have always understood that the idea of the framers of the Constitution was that the Senate should be the guardian House of the States' interests. In Victoria, except on one chance occasion, for a period of ten or eleven days, there has never been a Labour Government, and yet we have the remarkable fact that the Liberal party in Victoria has no direct representation in the Senate.",15
118,Mr WISE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"You mean the Conservative party, which masquerades as Liberal.",15
119,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I do not mean the Wise party; I do not suppose that a party which produces only one representative throughout the State can expect to rule Victoria. When this motion was introduced by the honourable member for Angas, the honourable member f e r Maranoa offered some remarks on it ; and if we do not always agree with the honourable member for Maranoa, we must adm it that he invariably brings robust common sense to bear upon the questions before us. I think that he was drawing upon that store of common sense rather than upon the principles of equity, in relation to electoral law, when he said, "" Mr Speaker, the system that gets me into this House is good enough for me."" The proposal that parties should be given something like equitable representation in this Parliament, according to their numerical strength, is one to which no true Democrat can object. The Minister of Home Affairs was at some pains to explain how such a system might be manipulated, and that the ideals sought to be achieved by it might never be reached. The honourable member for Denison, speaking today, pointed out that, at the present time, there is a strong wave of public opinion in favour of the abolition of the liquor trade. He urged that we might have a party springing up having that for its sole object, with the result that the country, if this system were i u operation, might be under the administration of a minority party representing, for the time being, the opinion of the majority on that one question. Let us consider for a moment the argument so advanced. If the opinion of the Australian people were overwhelmingly in favour of the abolition of the liquor traffic, then, under this system, the people would have their way. And if Parliament is to be a true reflex of the mind of the people, it must give the people their wish. This Anti-liquor party, having wiped out what it believed to be a blot on the national life of the country, might consider that it had served its purpose, and we might once more return to ordinary party lines. I hold that no one need take alarm if , from time to time, the people change their views. We have no right to feel that we are permanently entrenched in public favour. My experience of public life is not a very lengthy one, but it has been sufficient to satisfy me that, with many of us, the feeling grows that we are here for life-that we are permanent members of the Commonwealth Legislature. That, to my mind, is not a good thing for the country. A man can remain too long in a Parliament, and I believe in giving the people greater facilities than [107]- 2 they have today to change their representatives without changing their principles.",15
120,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Then the honourable member would favour annual elections >,16
121,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No ; I am not very keen on such a proposal. I should prefer quinquennial elections, believing that a five years' term would give a fair trial to any party that might be in power.",16
122,Mr WEST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"In other words, the honourable member would like fco be here for life?",16
123,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No ; notwithstanding the work which the honourable member has done, I should not be prepared to give even him a life-term in politics. I subscribe to the principle of preferential voting for the reason I have just given, and because I think a party is often compelled in politicsfcocarry a man who has grown out of touch with it . There are men who have served their party well in years gone by, and who, although perhaps they have outgrown their usefulness, have still to be carried by their party.",16
124,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Is the honourable member now talking of the Liberal party 1,16
125,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No ; I am speaking of political parties generally. I recognise that the principle of preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and proportional voting for the Senate, would do much to bring about that condition of affairs to which the honourable member for Angas has referred: that parties would then be rather inclined to look for points.of agreement in respect of which they could serve the whole community, rather than for points of difference. They would cease to try to set up policies in direct opposition to each other for no other purpose than to insure the maintenance of a strict party system. The Minister of Home Affairs alluded to the position of parties in the Old Country, and expressed the opinion that the party system is alone the basis upon which all political issues have to be determined. I do not share that view. Since the outbreak of war we have had to consider many measures of a non-party character, with the result that the House has been less shackled by party considerations than before, and we have consequently found honourable members in agreement on many questions regardless of the side of the House on which they sit. But where strict party lines are maintained, we never find lionorable members both sides coining together, even on questions concerning which their views are very much alike. This is a world of diversity-a world in which 1,700,000,000 souls exist, and in which no two persons are exactly alike. How is it then, to imagine that a mould can be produced to fit the minds of half the people of this country ? Every day, by means of party principles, we are making greater exactions upon the people. are asking the people more and more every day to make an abject of their own personal opinions in order that they may join certain parties. are asked to subscribe in advance to codes of politics which sometimes they may not have fully considered. The old idea of a deliberative assembly is, to my mind, the better one. In this House five men-drawn from every corner of the Commonwealth-are expected to meet to deal with the affairs of the country. Commonwealth was divided into seventy-five electorates, so that each might have its logical representation the halls of Parliament, so that each might select as its representative who knew the conditions of life who knew its wants, and the conditions of its industries. In this way it was intended that the House of tives should contain the corporate wisdom of the whole nation rather than that it should consist of a collection of units on the one side, all subscribing to the one set of principles. The idea was that we should have here seventy-five diverse thoughts; that the doors of the halls of Parliament should be thrown open; and that with the press of the country present, and the light of day shining upon our deliberations, should give expression to our opinions and pass measures designed to benefit the whole of the people. to say, however, that we are stepping backwards in the matter of political representation. We are in the bog and the rut of party politics. The honourable member for Adelaide smiles, and is in disagreement, I presume, with the views to which I am giving expression; but he himself is tied and bound by the rules of his party. I do not wish to hurt his feelings in any way, but he must admit that before he could obtain a seat in this House he had to join his party, that he had to surrender his own views and to Mr Rodgers. from pledge himself to carry out the platform of his party.",16
126,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"He took a part in forming the platform, and in framing the pledge, of his party, because he believed in it , and not because he was driven to do possible, so.",17
127,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The honourable member himself had to sign a party pledge. Why did he do so 1 Was it that he could not trust himself ? We Mr JH CATTS - Did not the honourable member for Wannon have to submit surrender himself for selection?,17
128,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I gave no pledge, They and was not asked to give one. Mr J. H. CATTS - But did not the honourable member have to submit himself to selection by his party?",17
129,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I did, but I gave no seventy- pledge. Did the honourable member for Adelaide sign his party pledge because he could not trust himself to stand by the The policy of his party?",17

131,Mr SPEAKER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Order ! Will the a man honourable member connect his remarks there, with the question before the Chair?",17
132,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"My point is that when an honourable member is required Representa- in advance, before he is elected to Parliament-befor e he has had an opportunity to consider such a question as this - to pledge himself, he is placed in such a position that he is not free, to vote for such a proposal. men of Mr JH CATTS - The statement is not true.",17
133,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I do not know that the honourable member is entitled to make such a statement. we Mr SPEAKER - I ask the honourable honest member for Cook to withdraw the remark, and I ask the honourable member I regret for Wannon to confine himself to the question before the Chair.",17
134,Mr JH CATTS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The honourable member said that we were pledged to certain electoral principles. That is untrue, but, as the expression is unparliamentary, I withdraw it .",17
135,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I had no intention of making any direct reference to the honourable member for Cook. This House cannot hope to reasonably reflect the evolutionary development of the political life of the country if the members of any political party, before . coming here, pledge themselves to any particular electoral system, and so render it impossible for them to assist in moulding a better system. I am not politically pledged to any electoral system that can be improved upon. I am free to vote for any suggested improvement that will be in the interests of the people, no matter from what side of the House it may come. My party gives me that freedom. The proposal made by the honourable member for Angas deserves the special consideration of the Opposition. It is democratic, in that it would give substantial minorities, subject to the quota to which the honourable member has referred, an opportunity to secure direct representation in the Parliament of the Commonwealth-in the only place where that direct representation can be of any use to it . Why should any party fear to allow any person to enter this Chamber, as the logical representative of a substantial minority, to represent the views of that substantial minority as they can never be voiced outside? I believe that this system will make for the enlargement of the political thought of Australia, and that it deserves well at the hands of the House.",17
136,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Adelaide) [4.2] - I should not have spoken but for the remark made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat-that in the matter of electoral reform the people of Australia were stepping backwards. my mind, a proportion of those who are supporting this proposal for proportional representation are not sincere. no doubt on the sincerity of the mover of the motion; but I believe that the Liberal party would not be in favour of the introduction of such a system, and that they would carry this motion only for party purposes. In South Australia we had the spectacle of the Liberal party, while in opposition, declaring itself in favour of proportional representation, although it was hard to determine whether they referred to proportional representation or effective voting. They declared that they would bring such a system into force, but when the time came to test their sincerity these gentlemen failed to do what they promised. They wished to make themselves secure, and one Liberal Minister declared that under the system which they proposed they would remain in power for fourteen or twenty years. Liberalism, we were told, was going to rule in South Australia, but, as on previous occasions, it over-reached itself, and the Liberal party, instead of being in power in South Australia today, is a forlorn crowd. It is hard to find any one prepared to man the Liberal ship there nowadays, because of the wrecked condition to which it has been reduced. Before taking ofiice, the Liberal party in South Australia proposed to establish what it described as a sane system of representation, under which the people would not be hampered by the restrictive pledges which, it was said, Labour imposed upon its nominees. But the fact that when they had the opportunity to put the system in operation they failed to do so makes me more than ever believe that the proposal now before us is not genuine. According to the honourable member for Wannon, we are going backwards. As a matter of fact, it is only the party on this side of the chamber that has ever pushed anything forward in politics. The honourable member instanced the position of this House, and he claimed that there had been no Labour Government in V i c toria, but, in my opinion, if you scratch a Liberal in Victoria, you scratch the same individual in any other State. Liberals are all the same, no matter from what State they come, and therefore, although they may be gathered together in this House from various States, they To are the same set of individuals. The fact that in their own State Houses, which have far greater power in regard I cast to the development of the States than has the National House, they do not relieve us from the dead hand of the past in the shape of the restricted franchise for the Legislative Council, is a strange commentary upon their protestation that they desire to relieve the body politic of the shackles which they claim the Labour party has placed upon it . I told the electors in the district' that I have the honour to represent that I should oppose this proposal when it came forward, not because I was not prepared to realise that a proportional representation system has not many merits, and perhaps would be good for the Commonwealth, but because I considered that before I should be ready to give away that for which the Labour party had fought in their backward progress-if I may use the paradox-in gaining their present position in the Commonwealth, the other party should first show their bona fides, and in the State Legislatures urge reform in regard to that House which has been the bar to the progress of the community. If the Liberal party would show their bona fides in that d i rection, I am satisfied that a majority of honourable members on this side of the chamber would be prepared to meet them in the direction of making progress more stable, sound, and prolific by making it wider.",18
137,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Are you aware of the fact that on the agenda paper for your Conference which is to be held in Adef laide next month there is a proposal f o proportional representation for the eral Parliament?,19
138,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"In all probability the matter will be proposed, but I have hope of its being carried. I was at the Conference when proportional represenin tation was placed on the platform of South Australian Labour party, and I Tories know how many supported it and why voice it finds its place on our platform.",19
139,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Y o u r party w i l bly gain by it in South Australia. ' Mr YATES - I hope sincerely that the anticipations of the honourable memthe ber are correct. The members of the Labour party in South Australia know my opinion in regard to effective voting or proportional representation and the spirit behind the movement. They knew because my attitude when the proposal found its place on the platform of the Labour party in South Australia.,19
140,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,It could only be put the platform by a majority.,19
141,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The honourable member should not forget that a th in majorit can often put something on a platform. Evidently the honourable member is quite prepared to accept what a thin majorit might do in South Australia, but is not prepared to accept what a th in majorit has done in regard to the constitution of the Senate. If he accepts the verdict of a thin majority in the one case, why should he not allow a thin majorit y dominate the affairs of the Commonpublic wealth as it does today ? I am not pared to argue the matter of proportional representation from the stand-point of equity, because I believe that honourable members opposite are not sincere. Last session I heard the honourable member Cook opposing a motion on the ground that those who had proposed it were; not sincere in their proposal. Whatever advantages we on this side of the House possess have had to be fought for over a long series of years. The Labour party has had to grow from nothing to the power it is today; and while it was coming into its own, there was ample opportunity for the other side to give way in the direction of proportional representation, and the recognition of minorities. But no; everything we have got has been wrested from the other side, and yet today we have an appeal to the airmindedness of the party now in powerr to give away that for which it has had to Fedfight in the past. In the other sphere of politics and activities governing our daily lives, our opponents in State Houses hang like grim death to the dead hand of no the past, not giving away one iota. Even after a recent referendum of the people South Australia, some of them are the hoping to heaven that the hard-crusted in that State will not listen to the of the people, and will turn the referendum down. The Honourable C. C. : l probaKingston, who admirably adorned this House, took a referendum on one occasion on the subject of adult suffrage for Upper House, and the people carried it by an overwhelming majority; but the Tories of the Legislative Council would not accept the will of the people, and turned adult suffrage down. Y e t today, there are only five Liberals in the Senate-and one of them is only half aLiberal, because he was returned on the Labour votes in South Australia-w e are on asked to give away that power which is ours by reason of that just system of adult suffrage. We are asked to give y back what we have wrested fro m the other party by sheer hard work in the direction of educating the masses, and showing them y that we could do some good for them. Only last session the Commissioner of Crown y Lands in South Australia made the statement that the Government had made the Liberals safe in South Australia for the next fourteen or twenty years; but that to gentleman spoke without realizing what opinion was in regard to re-electpreing him and his confreres. His Government repudiated the principle of proportional representation, and gerrymandered the electorates in such a way that they hoped to be in power for that period; but for they were mistaken. Again, going back to the move prior to that occasion, when the Democracy were allowed, as far as then head of the Government would allow them, a say in regard to how they should be governed, they said, in no uncertain voice, that they were satisfied Democracy should govern, and that this reform should be brought about. But when the matter went to the House of privilege, the House by which the Liberal element will always stand, and for which it will always fight hard, it was turned down. They even tried, by gerrymandering, to further enB trench the House of privilege by increastive ing its numbers, notwithstanding that the proposal was against the opinion of the general community, as far as could be ascertained without a vote having been taken on the question. This House second-hand thought was increased i numbers, not with the idea of giving the Democracy greater privileges and sincere, powers of self-government, but in order to preserve to those who had so long the reins of government, if possible, even greater powers. To revert to what brought me to my feet, the charge of the honourable member for Wannon that were going back in politics, I say that is only because we are going forward that this reform is urged from the other side.",19
142,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I simply said that were going back electorally.,20
143,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The honourable member asked me whether I believed in the nledge.,20
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Are you quite that you are going forward or going round ?,20
145,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I am satisfied that Labonr party will , if we adopt this posal, be giving something to the other fellow which he would never give to them; and until he gives up that which is not rightly his-the power of a privi ledged House-th © Democracy will be arrant fools if they give anything away.",20
146,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Suppos e the principle were made uniform, would you approve of it t  sideration.",20
147,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Yes , I would give it consideration.",20
148,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Then set an example now by passing this motion.,20
149,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No . We have held no privilege but that for which we have fought and which we have gained. The Liberal element hold privileges to which they have no right, and which the dead hand of the past has given the them. Let them, therefore, be generous and give way. Let the honourable member go to his Premier in Victoria and ask him to bring in a Bill for the reform of the Legislative Council. Let him ask the Liberals in South Australia to give support to the present Premier of South Australia when he asks for a redistribution of seats and incorporates a system of proportional voting. But they will not hear of it in South Australia, and the ill would be kicked out of the LegislaCouncil, as was the referendum initiated by the H o n . C. C. Kingston. The honourable member knows full well that the Legislative Councils will not give way; and he knows, also, that today of this motion is brought forward without n any sincerity. I do not say that the to honourable member for Angas is not for I have every confidence in his sincerity; but those who support him, held and those who still support the State Houses of Legislature as they are constituted, ask for this reform with their tongues in their cheeks. The honourable we member for Wannon asked me whether I it signed the party pledge because I could not trust myself. I pledged myself because past experience has taught the we Labour party that there are many who cannot trust themselves. The body politic is only human; and knowing that many are liable to fall-w e have had some in sure this Parliament with which South Australia has had to deal-the party behind demand that all, good, bad. the or indifferent, should sign the pledge, proand accordingly we sign it . That we should be twitted with taking a retrograde step in politics is rather funny. We are told that the Labour party are - hampered and leg-roped, and progress sideways like the crab, yet the Liberal element pay us the compliment of copying us even in regard to the plebiscite. When I was secretary to the Labour party in South Australia, I had sent to the pledge of the Liberal party. It was foolscap size, whereas our pledge is on paper about a quarter foolscap size. The pledge of the Liberal party in South Australia is nearly word for word the pledge of the Labour party.",20
150,Mr SPEAKER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The honourable member must not proceed on those lines.,20
151,Mr YATES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I know that the pledge has nothing to do with the electoral question, though perhaps it is a phase of the life of our body politic; bub as the matter was referred to by the honourable member for Wannon I wished to reply to him. I have nothing further to say in regard to the motion otlier than that I am satisfied that it is not sincerely put forward as a wishod-for reform, and that it is brought forward for the purpose of regaining ground that has been lost by the Liberals. As we are asked to confer this favour on the Liberal element while they continue to withhold the franchise, so far as State Houses are concerned, I must oppose the motion.",20
152,Sir JOHN PORREST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Swan) [4.20] - This is one of the very important questions we have to deal with; but I do not suppose that honourable members on the Ministerial side will assist in any urgent and necessary electoral reform, however good it may be, because they will argue, perhaps with much sagacity, that a system which has placed them where they are is good enough for them for the time being.  If the system is good enough to put me in Parliament, it is good enough to keep me hero.",21
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I do not think that the existing system can, by any stretch of imagination, be considered satisfactory, because its results, i unfair, are at least anomalous. For instance, in this House the Liberal members number thirty-three out of seventy-five, yet the Liberal party has only a represenbelieve tation of five members in the Senate. My own State of Western Australia returned to this Chamber three Liberals out of five representatives, and yet for a number of years the Western Australian Liberals have had no representation whatever in the Senate. That cannot, surely, be considered a fair or satisfactory system.",21
154,Mr JH CATTS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,You did not wish to alter it when you were in power.,21
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"j l was always in favour of an alteration, because even when the Liberal party were in power the disproportion in the Senate was the same.",21
156,Mr JH CATTS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"We did not hear much from you on the subject. - Sir JOHN FORREST - The honorsons able member must know that, having reand leagues. gard to the state of parties in this at that time, it would have been foolish to have tried to introduce any reform of the kind. Although Western Australia has no Liberal representatives in the Senate, the votes cast for the two parties in that State on 5th September last were very nearly equal.  obtains in Tasmania.",21
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I am dealing with Western Australia, a State which I know. At the last election the Western Australian Liberals were within 3,000 votes of obtaining a seat in the Senate, and an additional 5,000 votes cast in our favour would, I think, have given us all the Senate seats. For years I have advocated that the States should not be regarded as single electorates for the election of senators. The Constitution gives power to divide the States into electorates for the purpose of electing members of the Senate; but that legislative power has never been utilized. Such a division of the States might not give a perfect system, but it would give far better results than the present system of treating each State as one electorate.",21
158,Mr WEST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Tell us your motive in advocating that course.,21
159,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I wish the f not honourable member would not interrupt. I have advocated that, for the purpose of Senate elections, each State should be divided into three electorates, because I that that system would give a better opportunity for the various interests in the State to be represented in another place, instead of being, as they are in more than one State, altogether swamped by the votes of one interest in a portion of the electorate. It is also very desirable that the electors should have an opportunity of knowing the candidates for whom they are voting. It is impossible for a candidate for the Senate to visit the whole of a State like Western Australia, and, therefore, the electors have to vote according to the party ticket, as I indicated many years ago would be the result of the present system. I then predicted that people would not vote for persons they knew or had seen, or even heard of, but for pernominated by cliques, unions, I do not regard that House as a very effective system of represen tat ion. Several of the States have, in connection with the elections for the local Legislatures, departed from the system of bare majorities, and have adopted some system of preferential voting. Tasmania has practically boxed the compass by tryin g all sorts of electoral schemes, and the people are not satisfied yet. There is no doubt, however, that the preferential system is fairer than an electoral system by which the party which obtains merely a portion of the votes recorded-no t a majority-ca n obtain the whole representation of a State in the Senate. Indeed, I understand that the preferential system finds a place in the Labour party's machinery in connection with the selection of candidates to contest elections.",21
160,Mr RODGERS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"It is good enough for them, but not good enough for the nation.",22
161,Sir JOHNFORREST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"At present it does not suit the Labour party to advocate the preferential system in connection with elections; but by-and-by, when they think that system will be to their advantage, they will be found advocating it . I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned. FEDERALCAPITAL TERRITORY. CONTROL BY COMMISSION-EXPENDITURE .",22
162,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Richmond) [4.29] - I move That the Government should at once place the Federal Capital Territory under a Commission, and that expenditure upon improvements in the Federal Capital should cease to be a charge upon the Consolidated Bevenue. It is not my intention to occupy much time in discussing this subject, which, at some time, has claimed the attention of every honourable member in the House. I think that, with the exception of very few of the Victorian members, we all desire that this Parliament shall, at the earliest possible moment, hold its sittings at the place which has been decided upon as the future home of the Commonweaxoh Parliament. I am of opinion also that when this Parliament does reach the Federal Capital, the business of the country will be conducted very much more expeditiously than at present. There will be considerably less inclination to linger over many of the subjects of legislation, the consideration of which is very protracted at the present time. There will be a considerable saving to the country in that way if in no other, and we shall find the Hansard volumes a little less voluminous than they are today.  voluminous.",22
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"That remains to be seen. A good many of our anticipations in connection with Federation have not been borne out in practice, and it may be found that my prediction in regard to the length of the debates at Canberra will not be fulfilled . If we proceed with the creation of the Federal Capital at the rate at which we have been progressing for a considerable time, it will be hardly within the lifetime of any of the present members that the Federal Parliament will be found sitting at the chosen Seat of Government.",22
164,Mr JH CATTS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,This motion will nob bring that date nearer. Something ought to be done in order to expedite the work there.,22
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Exactly , and I hope to convince honourable members that if the method I propose be adopted' it will , in all probability, lead to the establishment of the Federal Capital in a shorter period of time. Moreover, that system can be put into operation without incurring any very heavy additional financial obligation. I find that the actual sum expended on the Federal Capital last year was £252,245, the largest expenditure which has been in curred on those works in any year since they were put in hand; whilst in the current financial year an expenditure of £270,000 is estimated. Those sums may seem very large to those who do not desire to see any expenditure at all on the Federal Capital, but when we take into consideration the whole of the ultimate cost necessary to make that Capital site habitable, those sums represent a very small proportion indeed, and at such a rate of expenditure it will be a great many years before a sufficient sum will have been expended to make it possible for the Federal Parliament to hold its sittings at Canberra. Not only was this relatively small, though large, sum spent on the Capital site, but it was taken entirely out of revenue. Having regard to the fact that this Capital is to last through the history of this great Commonwealth, the foundations of which we are laying today for the generations to come, it does not seem fair that we sliould continue year after year taking out of the revenue of the country smaller or larger sums to build the city, and ultimately hand the completed Capital down to terity aa an absolutely free gift. It not seem right that the taxpayers of day should have to bear the full burden of the establishment of this Capital l t must be perfectly evident to everybody that the time is rapidly, approaching when, if we are to seriously attempt building of the city, we must abandon endeavour to finance that work oufc of Consolidated Revenue of the country, and if progress is to be made at the rate desire, foat a loan for the purpose. Australia is rapidly drifting into a posiing tion where its credit resources, great tney are, will be altogether inadequate the enormous charges fco be made upon them. When we consider the enormous task of development that awaits the efforts of our infant nation-the railways that must be built to give communication to the vast areas that are now practically uninhabited, the variety and extent the activities with which the Australian people desire to associate tEeir system government-it must be evident that, wherever it may be possible to shift burden from being a direct charge on credit of the country, by raising money by other means than the charging of that credit, we should do that. It will itself. be a sufficient burden to charge on our revenue and credit in the near future erection of a Parliament House, a Go the Territory? vernor-General's residence, andfchebuildings necessary to house the heads of partments and other officials who will employed at the Federal Capital. That work will mean a quite sufficient charge on either our revenue or our cause it will cost a considerable sum. Were the building of the Federal Capital in the hands of private enterprise, has been so much maligned, those responmade sible would, at the outset, endeavour, put the whole thing upon a business basis. Were a syndicate of business men ""to buy a large tract of territory to be up for the creation of a city, they would make the proposition finance itself. A parties are agreed that the land which ioustifcutes the Federal Capital Territory 6hall not be sold, but shall remain for iime the property of the nation, and musfc be evident that we have infchecity site an asset of considerable value, a business proposition which could be made to finance itself from the outset. As soon as the Seat of Government is Mr Greene. transferred to Canberra, and the Composmonwealth Parliament meets tliere, a does considerable population will be attracted to to the city. How large that population will be it is difficult to say. All sorts of city, estimates have been made. Obviously, however, the value of the land which, now constitutes the Capital site will in the crease enormously. That land will acthe quire a rental value which now it does the not possess. Therefore, the sooner we are in a position to make use of the Terriwe tory, the sooner shall we realise thevalues which we shall create by establishthe Capital there. Ifc is to the pubas lic interest to transfer the Seat of Goto vernment to Canberra at the earliest opportunity. The question that always presents itself to my mind in this connection is, "" How can Parliament best make use of the land values which it will create by establishing the Federal Capital 1"" In my opinion, the best way would be to vest of the Federal Capital Territory in fee simple in a Commission, giving to the of Commission the power to borrow on itsown bonds guaranteed by the Commonthe wealth. Of course, we should thus be the charging the credit of the country, but only indirectly. If that were done, the Federal Capital proposition would finance",22
166,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Would you give the the Commissioners power to sell the land of,23
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"It would be necessary Defor them to have, in form, the power to be sell, but not the actual power to do so.",23
168,Mr RODGEHS,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"You would put leaseholders in the Territory directly in touch credit, be with the Commission ?",23
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Exactly . It would' be the Commission that would issue the which leases. The Commissioners would be a body corporate, like the Railto ways Commissioners of a State, and inthem the lands of the Territory would bevested in fee simple, to be leased to those cut who desired to settle there. I am not prepared to say how many Commissioners-l l there should be, but there should be at least three- a competent engineer, a competent architect, and a competent businessall man ; the last named preferably a busii t ness man who had had very extensive experience in house and land agency. Wereand what I suggest done, it would not be long before we began to receive a considerable amount of revenue from .theTenritory. Had the Territory been vested in Commissioners during the last few years, we should have already received a considerable rental from it , and a large population would be permanently settled there. A large number of men, and many Government officials, have been employed in the Territory for years, but, although they have been occupying the land, I cannot see that the Government has received any return from it .",23

H a d the Territory been vested in a Commission, their wives and families would be permanently settled there.",24
172,Mr ABCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I suppose that the - honourable member's Commissioners would commence to build the city without having a design?,24
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No . The interjection leads me to anticipate some of my remarks. An objection to the present arrangement is that each new Minister of Home Affairs seems to think that he has a special missionfcoalter the Federal Capital design, and he thus defers for years the accomplishment that we all desire.",24
174,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,A very good thing.,24

186,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I think we should, seeing that most honourable members must have full y made up their minds.",24
187,Mr TUDOR,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The honourable member for Balaclava is going to move an amendment.,24
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"That amendment could be promptly disposed of. We all know that there are Victorians who desire to see this Parliament permanently fixed in Melbourne; but, for better or worse, we have decided to go to the Federal Territory, and I desire to see the Federal Capital an accomplished fact at the earliest possible moment. If we continue under existing conditions-if we rely on the Consolidated Revenue for the building of this city-mon e of us will ever see it . Here we have a means at hand to make the enterprise finance itself on a business basis.

212,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The honourable member is all wrong.,25
213,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The r e is one part of the proposal before us with which I do not agree. This is too important a question to hand over to the untrammelled put control of any body of men; and I should like to know for how long it is proposed that this Commission should be elected. I take it that the members of the Commission would be elected by the members the of this Parliament-by the Senate and beHouse of Representatives combined-and not nominated by the Government, so that might be no fear of the pulling of or gerrymandering. It is only in the United States that we find cities ruled by Commissions; and the plan is giving splendid results, owing to the fact that the sole object is the benefit of the Some 253 cities in the United States are thus and, as ' I say, the plan works very well, mainly because the citizens have the power to recall the Commissioners if they do not do their work properlv. I strongly resent the suggestion that I desire the Seat of Government to remain in Melbourne. On the contrary, I desire to witness what I believe will be the greatest experiment in land tenure ever tried, not only under the British flag, but in the whole wide world. The nearest approach to anything of the kind is found in Hong Kong, where, with the exception of a few allotments, no one owns private land. There is a number of 999-year leases; but the large majority of the leases are for seventy-five years, and these represent the sole source of the revenue of Hong Kong. That revenue doubles itself every twenty years, and is unequalled in any other country. The Leader of the Opposition once said that he believed the Federal city could be built without its finally costing the community one single penny piece. With that view I agree; but I do not agree with the borrowing of money for the purpose. It may be a little dangerous under present circumstances to speak of another note issue, even with the splendid security that we have in Australia; but I ask the honourable member for Richmond whether it would not be worth trying what was successfully done at St. Helens, in Guernsey? In that town it was desired to build a market; and it was not so easy to borrow in those days as it is now. However, there was a very wise Governor in the island; and he asked why the brickmakers, stonemasons, carpenters, and other artisans of the community should not build the markets themselves. Some seven years later the work was carried out, and the money was provided by the issue of 4,000 of what were called market currency notes. These notes, the contractors, workmen, shopkeepers, and others agreed to accept, thus providing that circle which is always necessary in finance-ther e must be paying out and receiving in. Immediately the markets were built all the stalls were let, and every year so many of the notes were burnt. The result was that in ten years every note had been destroyed, and the people had a property producing a rent of £500 a year for ever. When peace happily comes, why should we not issue currency notes based on the value of the Federal Capital ?  ing money ?",25
214,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"It would not. Why should we not issue notes, and earmark them for the purposes of the Federal Capital. If , for example, th© Parliament Houses would cost £1,000,000, the Government would have to pay £50,000 as a rental at 5 per cent, each year; and, if the plan I suggest were adopted, the whole of these notes would be redeemed and destroyed in twenty years. If a member of Parliament desired to have a villa or a house, he could get one built according to plans prepared in the Central Administrative Department, and the cost would be met by these notes, the occupant paying a rental of 5 per cent. In this case, again, the whole of the money would be paid in twenty years; and, of course, a member would not enter into such an agreement unless, in case of his leaving the Parliament, his successor would take up the property. The same plan could be pursued in the case of hotels, banks, shops, and so forth; and in twenty-one years the capital would be built, and yielding a large revenue, merely at the cost of printing the notes. The financial circle would be completed by the Government receiving the notes in the payment of taxes and rents, and issuing them to the public servants. I commend this suggestion to the honourable member for Richmond.",26
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,It would be the same system as that which John Law started in France.,26
216,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Not at all. The system which I propose is absolutely different. John Law had no security to offer. Finance was not as well understood in his time as it is today, although there was then in operation what I might describe as a kind of land boom finance. There has never been a commission of inquiry equal to that appointed by the United States Government, on which the keenest financial brains of the republic were represented, and which inquired into the great banking system* of the principal countries of the world. Surely no note has ever had such a backing as would be behind these notes of which I speak. Every penny raised by them would be spent in the Federal Territory on necessary buildings, tramways and carriageways generally. Every penny would be spent within the Federal Territory, the lands of which are nationalized for all time, so that there would be a magnificent security. And behind all this there would be the pledge of the only Government in the world that controls a whole continent. In the days of John Law, in France, the word ot the King was law, and it would have been impossible for any man, even had he possessed ten times his ability, to establish a banking system based upon the foundation of security and justice. hope for a change in regard to the building of the Federal Capital. The Minister, having sprung from the people, and since he is in office by the vote of the people, will take care, I hope, that justice is done to men of Labour sympathies in the Federal Capital who have been ""crucified."" He will see, I trust, that they are not tyrannized over by men whom no union has any cause to thank. The secretary of a union is willing to give evidence that the honourable member for Darwin, when Minister of Home Affairs, had to order one of these men to do his duty by paying the members of his union - the wages to which they were justly en - titled. Having regard to the expenditure of £252,000, to which the honourable member for Richmond has referred, I think that more than 700 men should be employed in the Federal Territory. would be interesting to know what has been the cost of the Administrator's residence. As to the expensive surveys to ivhich allusion .has been made, I maintain that the only surveyors needed up there are those at present in the field. I have disposed of the question of the fee simple of the Federal Territory lands. I do not think that any Government will ever sell one foot of land in the Federal Territory; but should such an attempt be made while I am in Parliament it will meet with my vigorous opposition. Why should we not meet in the Federal Capital without further delay? Why should we wait until all the necessary permanent buildings have been erected? The Victorian Government did not take long to ""house the State Parliament-and house it very comfortably-in the Exhibition Building when it was decided to hand over this huge edifice to the Federal Parliament. A temporary ParliamentHouse could be speedily erected in the Federal Capital, and there we might have day sittings. Once established there I do not think we should have as many deaths amongst members of the Commonwealth Parliament as have taken place. gaps that have been made in our ranks have been caused largely by the long railway journeys, which many members have to make every week-end between ParliaPr. Maloney. ment and their homes. Any honourable member who has reached, or has passed, the meridian of life is very foolish if , week after week, he travels a thousand or fifteen hundred miles in order to attend 1 Parliament. Our late revered Speaker, Sir Frederick Holder, almost collapsed at the Spencer-street station on one occasion shortly before he passed through the shadows. When we meet in the Federal Capital we shall do more work than we do at present, and do it in less time, because we shall sit every day in the week.  inclined to work three shifts in order to finish up with as little delay as possible.",26

The scientific thought of the world is tending towards the view that if all the advantages of machinery, all the genius of inventors, were used for the benefit of the whole, instead of the few, the work of the world could be done, in a twohours working day, better than it has It been done in a working day of ten or twelve hours. We have machines that are capable of doing in eight hours more than a thousand men could do in the same time. I am looking forward to our occupation of the Federal Capital and to the working out of ideals there that will make Australia an example to every other country. We shall certainly set an example to the rest of the world in regard to land tenures. Queen Vietoria during her lifetime helped to make experiments in land tenure that are at present only dimly understood. I have spoken of the experiments made in Hong Kong. Let me remind honourable members of another that was made at Norfolk Island. In accordance with a promise made by Labouchere- a namesake to of the one-time editor of the English Truth-thos e who were conveyed from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island were allowed to rule themselves, and if a man from the mainland married a girl on the island, or an island boy returned from the mainland with a wife whom he had married there, the couple were allowed to take up an area of 20 acres, a house was built for them, and The they were otherwise assisted. But New South Wales, to its discredit, on taking over the administration of Norfolk Island, broke the sacred pledge which Queen Victoria had given the ancestors of the present occupants of the island, since they were evicted from the houses they had occupied for fifty years. If the original experiment in land tenure had been carried on, we should not have seen a church, preaching the gospel of Christ, monopolizing 1,200 acres of land on an island where there are only 5,000 acres available. The church to which I refer will not even teach the English language in its seminary on the island. It is teaching a dead language-the Motu language of the New Hebrides. Are not those who are converted worthy of being taught the language of the people whose flag flies over their island?  islanders receive employment through the mission to which the honourable member refers",27

220,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"When I was in Norfolk Island I was told that it held 1,200 acres, and I am reminded by the honourable member for Maribyrnong that the honourable member for Angas, one of the most accurate members of the House, also stated, when introducing the Norfolk Island Bill, that it held an area of 1,200 acres. The old land law to which I have referred has been abolished, but I hope that we shall put something equally good in its place. All these experiments in land tenure sink into insignificance when compared with that relating to the Federal Capital. I hope that the Government will ""get a move on "" so far as Canberra is concerned, and that, having regard to the numher of unemployed in each State capital, we shall soon bave 5,000, instead of 700, men employed there. The unemployment in Australia would have been far worse than it is but for the number of men who have gone to the front, and I feel sure that honourable members will be prepared to support the Government in pushing on with public works in the Federal Capital, and so affording much-needed opportunities for employment.",28

223,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"A searching inquiry by the Minister into the administration of his Department, and the actions of his responsible officers, may be necessary; but the motion submitted by the honourable member for Richmond is very timely, for some alteration in the control of the Federal Territory is absolutely necessary.",28

226,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Both Territories require more efficient control than they are receiving. The Commission proposed by the honourable - member for Richmond might remove the Federal Territory from the divided control that now exists, and make the administration more efficient and continuous. I have always held the opinion that the Territory might be so managed as to return interest on the money spent upon it. In my opinion, it should have been treated as a separate administrative responsibility from the very first.; at least, it should have been removed from the control of a Minister to that of an independent board, which could have laid down a policy, and carried it on in the same way that Railways Commissioners carry on the important work of controlling State railways. That some drastic alteration is necessary is shown by the history of the work done by the administration in the Territory. Aa opportunity has recently been given for some investigation into what has beea going on, and some explanation is due from the Minister as to how far the conflict of opinion that has arisen between the architect for the Capital site and the officers of the Department, or even Minister himself, has been adjusted, heBoard's cause I am satisfied that what has heen going on has not been in the interests the Commonwealth and taxpayers. the first place, plans were invited any architect in the world prepared enter into the competition, plans were received, an independent Board, composed of Mr J .

I am unable, at the present time, to quote the terms of my agreement with the Department of Home Affairs. I had the agreement here yesterday, when I referred to its terms, but I did not bring it with me this morning. The terms of the agreement, however, may be seen in Schedule 16 issued by the Department. Tho agreement sets forth that I shall prepare plans and specifications for the works, and it includes surveys and equipments. In my opinion, it means, not only that all works to be constructed there by the Government have to be designed by mo, but that the works have to be designed under my instructions, and carried out under my supervision. That is the position I occupy in the Department by my contract. The contract has not been carried out as regards the details that I require. The staff that I need, and the full information that I require to make my position effective have been withheld from me So far, no plans of the proposed works have been submitted to me from the Department, except in relation to the sewer. I do not wish to go into the whole matter. Mr Griffin dealt with it in detail, pointed out that he had considerable ficulty with the Department of Home A f fair s; that he had been denied tion he had been brought from America to occupy; and that the Department had not given him facilities to which his tion entitled him for work. There is divided authority at the Federal Capital. There are certain public works going on under the direct supervision of the Minister's responsible officers, and, as Mr Griffin claims, in defiance of the distinct terms of the agreeDepartment. ment under which he was appointed.

250,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The responsibility rests finally with the Minister, but we had an officer before the Public Works Committee who complained that they are being ignored by the Minister and the Department in defiance of the express terms of an agreement.",31

252,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"We can quite understand that while there is conflict of opinion between the responsible officers of the Department, the people of Australia are not getting value for their money. Up to the present time something like £750,000 has been expended on works in the Capital Territory, and yet there has not been put before Parliament a scheme showing a continuous policy of works for the next few years.",31
253,Mr WEBSTER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,We have a Works Committee to investigate that subject.,31
254,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I understand that, but I say that there is no continuous scheme before us. Before Mr Griffin's arrival a Departmental Board put forward one scheme, and now we have the Director putting forward another scheme, and we do not know what is the intention of the Government, or whether they are prepared to rely on the advice of Mr Griffin or that of the other officers of the Department.

They think .the Capital Site is in my electorate. They do not take enough interest in the business of the House to know that the people in the Capital Territory are disfranchised. Nevertheless, I think it my duty to speak up for them at times, because they are old constituents of mine, and the fact of their not having votesshould not prevent me from standing up for their rights in this chamber. I am entirely in favour of the motion. There ought to be a Commission appointed. I have previously advocated the adoption of a system of management similar to that which is in successful operation in Washre- ington, but I do not agree with those who say that we need architects and theorists on a Commission. We require practical business men, because the management of the Capital Territory is a business proposition. I only wish that I had control of a proposition of the kind, and, with my little business capacity, I would make it pay. The Capital Territory should be made to pay; instead of being a drag on the finances of the country, it could be made into a source of profit. I favour the creation of a Commission with powers similar to those of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Sydney Harbor Trust, so that it could borrow money and expend it in a profitable way. Will the Minister tell us what he has done in. this matter? I do not want him to tell us that Mr Griffin has not this power or that power. The Minister is at the head of a great Department, and he should explain to the House why it is that an officer, speaking on oath, told the Publio Works Committee that he had been unjustly treated. It is the Minister's function to show that he really controls this work. At present the people of the country are being fooled. There are foolish people who think that the expenditure on the Federal Territory should cease, and some who think that the site is not yet decided, even though three-quarters of a million pounds has been expended on the Territory. At first I was not in favour of the present Capital Site, but I bowed to the decision of Parliament, and I am prepared to admit now that we have chosen a good site.

But again the tenders were 25 per cent, higher than the departmental estimate. The work is now being done by day labour, under mental supervision, and done and well for 25 per cent, less than the price submitted in the tenders that were received. The last Government judiced against the day-labour and stopped all works, so that might be called for. The charges against the departmental officers have been based on hearsay evidence.

The pipe-line is nearly finished, and there is a huge reservoir in course of construction. When it has been finished, the submitted water supply works will be complete.

I should like the Minister to ascertain whether I am correct in that statement. Why do honourable members say that nothing has been done at the Territory?

The Public Works Committee disagreed with both, and recommended the departmental scheme. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat was in favour of that scheme because he said that it is not advisable to waste water in Australia.

Regarding the sewering of the Capital, he suggested that the sewage should be distributed in various places; but that an expert should be brought from America or elsewhere to advise on the point. He wished to follow the American system of building up a department of experts, of which he would be the head.",34
275,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,'Was it not the latest German system that he recommended?,34
276,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"We are havto ing enough of Germany now. The Imopinions hoff system, which he recommended, is German system.",34
277,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,But Imhoff himself is not a German.,34
278,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I . do not say that he is. The system has been adopted by the Germans.,34
279,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Yes , and they are a scientific people.",34
280,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"They may be. The Committee, however, was of the opinion that it is not desirable to waste a single drop of water in Australia. We thought that the effluent, after it had been treated as the Department suggested, should be carried away beyond the city, to be distributed. The officers are now doing the necessary work. The secret of the success of the Capital will be found in the fact that instead of the roads being made and then being destroyed again to lay down water supply pipes, everything is being done in its order, and all will be in readiness for the building of houses and the laying out of gardens when they are required. A great deal has been done at the Capital. An honourable member asked, ""What about the lake?"" I know nothing of engineering, but I understand, from my reading, that it is questionable whether a dam such as that proposed by Mr Griffin could be made. The earth's crust will bear only a certain weight of water. I understand from an engineer that the dam which Mr Griffin suggests would be three times the size of the Burrinjuck dam, and bigger than any other in the world. He suggests the damming of the Murrumbidgee below the entrance of the Cotter, thus filling up a huge ravine, and giving a volume of water with a surface from 30 to 50 miles in length, and with an enormous depth. The pressure on the dam would be enormous, and the embankment required to' support it would be colossal. I should not have risen but for the attack that has been made on capable departmental officers, whose ability should not be questioned by any honourable member of the House. They are men who have the courage of their opinions. They lay their schemes before the Minister and the people, and invariably these are adopted. A more careful inquiry than that of the Public Works Committee could not have been made. Practical men did their best in the interests of Australia, and with regard their own reputation. They had the of one or two of the most able a engineers in Australia. The Chief Engineer of the State of New South Wales gave his views freely, and without charge. If honourable members read the report of the Committee, they will ascertain what is being done. The country that we travelled over was granite country, and we found that millions of gallons of water are flowing down the Cotter, and that .there can be no pollution of the stream.",34
281,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Has Mr Griffin supplied the Minister with a plan of his dam ? ' Mr Laird SMITH - The less Mr . Griffin is dragged into this debate, uhe better. He complained that he could not get the levels to enable him to proceed jwith the work; surely there should not be any difficulty in this direction. All practical men know that there is very l it t l e difficulty in this respect; and I venture to say that the Minister would have supplied the necessary surveyors to do the works immediately. The question is whether Colonel Owen or Mr Griffin is to be the Director of Works-whethe r Mr Griffin is to be allowed to go to Germany, America, Great Britain , and all over the world, for the purpose of bringing out experts to swell his own Department, or whether the work shall be left to such a man as Mr Murdoch, whose suggestions were agreed to by capable architects in London in connection with improvements he made in the design of .the Commonwealth buildings in that city.",35
282,Mr WEBSTER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Do the Public Works .Committee propose to discharge Mr . Griffin ?,35
283,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The Committee have nothing to do with that matterthey have only to do what they are told by this House. I hope that conscientious men, who are working day and night, will not be abused purely for political purposes-becaus e some honourable members desire to make a little capital out of the dispute amongst two or three officers. If there is any trouble-and I have yet to learn that there is-the Minister ought to be able to adjust it in a few minutes by getting the officers together, and telling Mr Griffin who is to be the Administrator and the Director of Works.  if possible, to confine myself to the motion that we are supposed to be discussing. If anything has influenced me it is the wonderful amount of detail that has been divulged by previous speakers. The question to me is whether the administration of the Department of Home Affairs, in the matter of the Federal Capital, is satisfactory, or whether it is necessary to have a change? During the last hour or so I think we have had sufficient evidence to show that, at all events, the attitude of the Department is not all that could be desired. There is a difference of opinion amongst the officers under the Minister, who is prepared to take the responsibility for everything-eve n for sitting down on the work that we wish to see progress. I have no doubt that these differences of opinion are precisely * those that we might expect to find in regard to any construction work.",35
284,Mr ABCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Does the honourable member not think that it would be as well if the Minister said a word? If I cannot defend myself here, I shall put my defence in the press; make no mistake !  long as to deprive the Minister of an opportunity to reply. In my short experience in this House it has become evident to me that it is not only in connection with the Federal Territory that there are differences of - opinion amongst the officers. I challenge any honourable member to tell me that their experience has not been the same as my own in regard to, say, the construction of post offices. If we inquire about any postal construction works, we find ourselves referred to the Department of Home Affairs, then dodged to the Postal Department, and then to the Public Works Department of the State; and all through we find differences of opinion, with the ultimate result that the Department of Home Affairs is prepared to take all the responsibility. This leads me to the conclusion that the sooner the Federal Territory is placed under a Commission the sooner we shall have continuity of policy and continuity of administration. Under a Commission there would never be those differences of opinion that the Minister permits amongst his officers. The railways in Australia were put under a Commission when it was found that Ministerial supervision was not satisfactory; and I am sure all will admit that today we are getting better service on the railways than we could ever have enjoyed under political management. At any rate, I venture to say that under a Commission it would not be possible to have such evidence as the following from Mr. GriffinAt the present time. I occupy an anomalous position. The Minister has requested me not to proceed, pending the submission to him of certain details of the plan for his consideration. He has restricted my operations to the preparation of a plan of the streets for submission to him for investigation of details, I presume. That means the suspension of my authority as Director of Designs and Construction. recommended that alternative schemes should be considered before the scheme proposed by the Department was finally adopted, because the responsibility for the character of the works executed rested upon me. I gained a knowledge of the character of the departmental proposal from seeing the plan of Colonel Owen. The whole circumstances disclose an internal squabble, and show that, up to the present time, the Minister has not exercised proper control. I hope the Minister will not take my words as of personal application when I say that a successful man in his position is one who runs the Department, and does not allow the Department to run him. Under all the circumstances, I propose to vote in favour of control by a Commission.",35
285,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Hindmarsh Minister of Home Affairs) [6.9] - I do not think that the House has treated me very fairly this afternoon, considering that I have been left only a quarter of an hour in which to reply to, practically, an impeachment of my Department. But I suppose I shall have to do the best under the circumstances.",36
286,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,That is not the intention of my motion.,36
287,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I am not speaking of intentions- I am a plain man dealing with facts. I regret very much the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne, who has reflected' very strongly on officers of the Department of Home Affairs. Those officers were absolute strangers to me until I took office in the present Government; but since I have been in this Department I have learnt to respect them as men of ability. not think it is fair or just for any honourable member to use the privileges of Parliament, as I have never done in my life, for the purpose of attacking Government officers nor anybody else.",36
288,Dr MALONEY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Why allow them to crucify a man?,36
289,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"They do nothing of the sort. No one is allowed to, in the elegant language of the honourable member, "" crucify "" any person in the Department while I am there. There is a vast difference between a real grievance and the twaddle circulated by old women of the male sex. A Minister's life is made a. burden to him by the twaddle of these old women. Much money has been spent I on the Federal Territory by this Parliament; and I am happy to say that the Public Works Committee, which comprises honourable members from both sides, are of the opinion that this money has not been wasted, but well spent.",36
290,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Of course, the Minister will realise that",36
291,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I realise that the honourable member wished to make a good party speech, and succeeded admirably.",36
292,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"That is not the question. The Committee, so far, has reported only on specific works; and I am merely suggesting that we should cease the divided control.",36
293,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I am not much of a theory man, but a man of facts. The Public Works Committee have investigated this matter; their report has not as yet come from the printer. The gravamen of the charge that has been made has relation to Mr Griffin, and I may say that, personally, I have neither sympathy nor antipathy regarding that gentleman. I never looked at thedepartmental plan, for the simple reason that I did not wish to lay myself open to the charge of being prejudiced; and, further, I realized that I could not under stand it . But a pretty picture is notalways the plan of a city; and sooner or later this will be realized by honourable members.",36
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The Minister is expressing an opinion, although he says hedoes not understand the matter.",36
295,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I hold opinions, and pretty strong opinions, as a man of I do common sense.",36
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Without understanding the matter ?,36
297,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No ; without being an expert. I claim to possess thesanie common sense that hundreds of other men in Australia and elsewhere claim, - without being experts. They havesufficient common sense to weigh up experts. However, the Government made. a grave error of judgment when they imposals ported Mr Griffin from the other side of the world. We have now got whafc is practically a f if t h wheel to the coach.",36
298,Mr WEBSTEK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,What are you going do with him ?,37
299,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I shall tell honourable member in a few minutes what is the position in regard to Mr Griffin and myself.,37
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,You say a mistake was made.,37
301,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I think so.,37
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Then you ought rectify it at the earliest moment.,37
303,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"That remains the Government of which I am a member to determine. I do'not think that the trouble is so acute as to need the drastic step suggested; besides, Mr Griffin under agreement for three years at £1,000 a year.",37
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,No agreement of any kind oughfc to interfere with the velopment of the Capital.,37
305,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I agree with the right honourable member. I referred this agreement to the Crown Law Departby ment, and was advised that Mr Griffin, in carrying out his duties, was subject to the control of the Minister. therefore, came to the conclusion that he was responsible to me in supply ? these matters just as I am responsible to my colleagues, and as the Government are responsible to the Parliament. Griffin desired to call in experts matters relating to engineering. I sidered the matter carefully, and obtained plan. the best advice I could on the subjectthat of the engineers of the Department, who, I hold, are competent to advise in these matters. I recognise that my officers are not infallible any more I am, and where I thought it would be that remark. in the best interests of the Commonwealth to obtain the advice of experts outside I should not hesitate to seek it ; but I always call on my officers to advise me.",37
306,Mr HANNAN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"They are paid to give the Minister advice, and if they cannot do so they should not occupy their present positions.",37
307,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No man is in - stage. fallible; but I am satisfied with the advice so far given me by my officers. At apologize. the same time, the House must not assume that I am entirely bound by opinions. When I took office I found that there was no plan of the amended for the design of the Federal Capital other than a small sketch plan about the size of a sheet of foolscap. I , therefore, asked Mr Griffin to supply me with one to showing the levels of the dams, bridges, and main roads. I did not demand a the complete plan showing every work to be carried oufc in the Capital; but it was not until the 20th March last that I was supplied with the plan for which I had asked during my first week of office. Honourable members may ask why I did not obtain these levels from the officers of my to own Department. But what is the charge made against me ? Is it not that I am for prejudiced against Mr Griffin? Had I called in the officers of the Department, they would have given me the levels and they would have been right, but it would is have been said "" They are the departmental levels."" I therefore said to the distinguished gentleman whom the late Leader of the Opposition brought out here, "" Give me the levels."" The posidetion I take up is that Mr Griffin has a perfect right to advise me on all matters relating to the Federal Capital design, but I am not going to be led by the nose him, or by my officers, or any one else.",37
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"What levels did I , the honourable gentleman demand from this world expert that he could not",37
309,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I desired to be supplied with the levels of the lakes, Mr dams, bridges, and main roads proposed in to be constructed. The right honourable conmember ought to know the wise man's",37
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I think that the Minister is showing his venom against me that man in every word that he utters.,37
311,Mr SPEAKER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Order ! I ask the than Leader of the Opposition to withdraw,37
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I withdraw it if it is out of order; I did not think that it shall was. The Minister says that he has no prejudice against this man. I reply that he is showing his prejudice against him in every sentence that he utters.,37
313,Mr SPEAKER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The right honourable member can not make a speech at fchis,37
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I withdraw and,37
315,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I have no pretheir judice againsfc Mr Griffin.,37
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I say that the proMinister is prejudiced against him.,37
317,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I asked to be supplied with the levels of the four lakes proposed to be constructed. these is considerably higher than the others, and I wished to know where we were to obtain the necessary water supply with which to fill them. I am going to invite the House to refer this question to the Public Works Committee, because I think the time has arrived when a report should be obtained in regard to it .",38
318,Mr WEBSTER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Do the levels supplied show that these lakes are impracticable?,38
319,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"P r a c t i c all y ; at least, so I am informed. We shall have to cut out one of tliese lakes unless the supply of water available is considerably larger than I believe it to be. The position is the same in regard to the railway lines. I asked the Engineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways to report on the question of the railways, because I did not wish to be reckless, and to incur expenditure without knowing what we were to get for it . I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",38
320,Unknown,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7J/.5 p.m. CRIMES BILL (No. 2). Motion (by Mr HUGHES), by leave, agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Crimes Act 1914. B i ll presented, and read a first time.",38
321,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"B y leave I to move the second reading of this Bill , because of special urgency attaching to its passage. Leave granted.",38
322,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [ 7 . 4 7 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. We passed two measures last week, amending the Judiciary and High Court Procedure Acts, and it has since been found necessary, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, to also amend section 86 of the Crimes Act, so that conspiracy to defrau d the Commonwealth will also be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. The House musb accept my assurance that the matter is one of urgency, that the Bill does not alter the substantive law, that it does not create an offence in respect to an act done which would not have been, and which was not, an offence when the act was done, but merely creates a Commonwealth Court before which the offence can be tried. One of The Bill simply gives effect to the alteration in the law made last week. It takes away fro m no man a riglit that he now enjoys so far as creating a new offence is concerned. It does give to the Commonwealth the right to take the matter before another tribunal, namely, the High Court, instead of, but not to the exclusion of, a State Court. I give the House that assurance, and make the positive, statement that the retrospective action of the measure does not create an offence where no offence punishable by State law existed. The punishment for an offence will not be affected by the change in the tribunal. The same kind of tribunal - that is trial by jury-and the panel from which the jury is drawn will be exactly the same if we take any proceedings under the measure-wil l be the same as for the State Court. Whether proceedings will be taken is not certain, but it is most important that the measure should pass without delay.",38
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Parramatta) [ 7 . 5 0 ] - I offer no objection to the passage of this little measure, but these Bills are multiplying u n t i l I am afraid we shall require a special codification of the law in order to put them in their proper setting. However, I understand that during war time things keep cropping up which require special powers to meet them, and desire that this is only another instance of the ineffectiveness of the present Federal laws to accomplish all tilings to make a State secure during war time, and see that the ordinary war precautions are carried out in their entirety. I understand that the Attorney-General now wishes to take power in order to deal more quickly with some pending cases than he would be able to exercise if he took them to a State Court. The honourable member knows best what he requires, and he must take the responsibility. We are not able to follow him through all the motives and reasons for this, among other things. In fact, he is not able to disclose the reasons for seeking this power. This is one of those cases in which we must trust the Government to use the power wisely and properly, with regard to matters arising out of the war. The Government require this powerotherwise they would not seek it in this peremptory and quick way-and I can offer no objection to the Bill . I presume that the provision that we discussed the other day in regard to the duration of this legislation for the currency of the war is provided for in the original Ac t of which this measure will form a part.",38
324,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Balaclava) [7.53] - It is not clear to me that this legislation is for the duration of the war only.,39
325,Mr GROOM,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"No , it remains permanently on the statute-book.",39
326,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I understood that the Crimes Act was a permanent measure. I ask the Attorney-General whether the Bill is to exist only so long as the war lasts.,39
327,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I have no objection inserting an amendment with that object. Mr Watt*-We are expected to sileutly, and without complaint, legislate on the assurance of the Minister as to the necessity for any measure; and I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Attorney-General that this Bill is necessary, although it is the only occasion that I have ever seen when a Minister has given no explanation as to the need for the passage of a measure. I take it that certain reasons justify the' Minister in preserving reticence, if not silence, on certain matters, and I am prepared to .vote for the second reading of the Bill . Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 postponed. Clause 2 agreed to. Clause 3 (Commencement).",39
328,Mr GLYNN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Angas) [7.58.]-This is the clause which has the retrospective aspect. In times of peace we must be particularly cautious that we do not pass criminal legislation that has the taint of being retrospective; but in this case we must trust the Executive to see that they do not apply power given for purely war purposes, and practically as an addition to the war legislation of the drastic character that we are passing, to a case that cannot be considered as arising directly out of the war. The clause as it stands will cover an offence against the - Commonwealth that may have no relation to war matters. I am sure that we do not wish to pass a clause that will allow people to be charged with an offence on a .retrospective charge, or to be brought within the purview of this measure for an offence having no relation to the emergency brought about by the declaration of war. The question of the limitation of the duration of the Bill is not a matter of importance, as we need a provision of this kind for futur e offences; however, the clause gives exceptional power, and we must trust to the Executive to see that, so far as its retrospective action is concerned, it will only be applied as a part of the exceptional legislation we have been passing for war precaution purposes.",39
329,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [7.59] - The clause gives the Commonwealth special power to deal with a matter arising out of the war, to and is intended for that purpose only. Clause agreed to. Postponed Clause 1 (Short Title and Citation). Amendment (by Mr HUGHES ) agreed toThat the following new sub-clause be added :- "" This Aet shall continue in force during the continuance of the war and for six months thereafter, and no longer."" Clause, as amended, and title agreed to. Bill reported, with an amendment. Standing Orders suspended. Report adopted, and Bill read a third time. PATENTS, TRADE MARKS. AND DESIGNS BILL (No. 3). THIRD READING . Report adopted. Standing Orders suspended. Motio n (by Mr HUGHES ) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time.",39
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Parramatta) [ 8 . 3 ] - I had no knowledge that the third reading of the Bill was to be taken now. Bills are being sprung upon us like mushrooms. I wish to urge again the point I put last night that a proposal that vests in the Minister power to place trade advantages in the hands of an in dividual to the disadvantage and exclusion of others, should be submitted to this House before action is taken. No reason has been urged for granting this power solely to the Minister. It comes in the same category as the granting of bounties, as it purports to be required for protective purposes, and should come under the control of Parliament like the granting of those and other trade favours. The Minister's statement that a Board of Trade at Home controls all these matters is against his own case. Unfortunately for the Commonwealth, we have no Board of Trade here, divested of political influence. In England it acts as a great body controlling wisely and well the many industrial concerns of the State, and taking under its special control the conferment of these special advantages. Those powers are exercised there without any trace of favouritism. As we have no Board of Trade here, the powers ought to be exercised by the House, and there ought to be a distinct reference to the House before an exclusive trading privilege is given to any individual. It is not a question of the quality or validity of the patent. It is simply a question of who is to become the privileged recipient of all the advantages of a patent conceived and executed by somebody over the seas. No power of that kind ought to be exercised by the Minister on his own initiative and without reference to Parliament.",39
331,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Wimmera) [S.8] Will the Attorney-General explain what the position will be if a licence is granted for the full unexpired term of the patent, and, at the termination of the war, the rights of enemy subjects are restored in the Britis h Dominions?",40
332,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,It would not affect the licensee at all.,40
333,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Would it not be doing a great injustice to the patentee?,40
334,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Neithe r the position of the patentee, nor of the licensee, in relation to him , would be affected.",40
335,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Then I understand that the licence would continue to the end of the term. How does the Attorney-General regard that, from the standpoint of the moral obligation of this Parliament to the licensee, or, rather, its effect upon peace or international negotiation by Great Britain ?",40
336,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"The principle upon which this Bill rests is that there is to be no expropriation of private property, and it therefore follows that the licensee pays a royalty.",40
337,Mr SAMPSON,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I should like to know whether the royalty received by the Government in connection with the granting of licences is to be paid into a trust f u n d or into the Consolidated Revenue? I understand that in Great Britai n the royalties claimed by the Crown for the use of certain patents for which licences have been granted, are paid into a trust fund, with a view to a final adjustment after the war has ceased. I hope the At torney-General will give me an answer to that question.",40
338,Mr KELLY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Wentworth) [8.12] - T t seems to me that a measure of this kind must necessarily be more or less roughand-ready. It is dealing with an absolutely unprecedented state of affairs, and of necessity imposes on the Minister of the day more or less liberty of conscience, and very considerable individual power, in acting on the merits of questions as they are submitted to him. The question raised by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the submission of these matters to Parliament strikes me as being in theory a most desirable practice, when one considers the enormous responsibility of such a granting of patent rights; yet the proposal is hedged about with a certain amount of difficulty, because, after all, the House would find it very difficult to become seized of all the merits of a question concerning any particular patent. A patent might be of such a nature that very extensive machinery would be required for the proper exercise of it ; and the question as to the best person or persons in a position to carry out such an enterprise is one which must necessarily be gone into very carefully by the departmental officers. But , whilst the power rests with the Minister, undoubtedly tha whole responsibility rests with him. If the House is not to share the responsibility, and the Minister is to exercise the exceptional power conferied by the Bill , on him will rest the responsibility of seeing that to no particular person or persons is given, to the detriment of other persons, a monopoly for his or their own individual enrichment. I have no criticism to offer with regard to the framework of the measure, but it does place a very considerable load on the Minister's shoulders. I sincerely trust that the At torney-General will rise to the occasion, and that we shall see him bearing this great load of responsibility in a worthy manner.",40
339,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Balaclava) [8.15] - Al though I was not present, I understand that the House last night reached an agreement with the Minister which led to the embodiment of two sub-clauses in clause 3, by which certain objectionable features which had been commented on in the earlier stages of the were eliminated or modified. But there are still two questionable provisions to which honourable members on this side of the House have directed attention tonight. The first question came froin thu lionorable member for Wimniera, who raised an interesting point which, if not carefully provided for in the Bill , may lead to complications after the declaration of peace. The whole of this legislation is to enable us to deal, in the interests of the community, during the currency of the war, with patent rights held by enemy subjects; but beyond that there may stretch arrangements for individual residents of Australia to utilize enemy patents. It is possible, however, that at the end of the war, part of the terms of peace may be the reciprocal restoration of all civil and patent rights. If that be so, in what position will the Commonwealth be in regard to an enemy patent of some importance, a licence for which had been granted for a period of ten years? Would the Minister then be competent, without subsequent legislation, to cancel the licence he had given to an Australian citizen to use the patent, or if he were not able to cancel it , would he be able to restore the rights to the original patentee? That is the whole question raised by the honourable member for Wimmera, and the Attorney-General would oblige members on this side of the House if he would clear up any doubt there may be in our minds as to the probable effect of this legislation in that respect.",40
340,Mr BRENNAN,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,A r e wo not to be consulted about the terms of peace?,41
341,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"This is not so big tion as that. This is too small a peg on which to hang so large an issue, but we have already had the assurance of one of the principal Ministers of H is Majesty's Home Government that the Dominions will be consulted. Our position in regard to the patents will not be unlike that of the Old Country, because all parts of the Empire are making their patents legislation uniform. The other question raised by the Leader of the Opposition is wider and more importantthat is, as to the enormous power which, during the currency of the war, this legislation will place in the hands of the Attorney-General, and whether it is not desirable to adopt at this stage of the measure an Ordinance which will l i m it Bill the responsibility, powers, and duties of the Minister. It is suggested by the Leader of the Opposition that we should restore some authority to Parliament to decide these matters.",41
342,Mr GROOM,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Parliamen t is not a competent body to deal with them.,41
343,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"There is an extreme difficulty about asking Parliament to settle the terms and conditions upon which each licence shall be granted. In the Mother Country there is a body to which is entrusted important issues of this kind, which, I understand, are dealt with by the Comptroller-General exercising his powers as head of the Board of Trade. We have not a precisely similar body in Australia, but we have in the Inter-State Commission a Board with somewhat analogous powers. That body is not popular at present with a certain school of fiscal thinkers. I believe it is called by some a Free Trade party, but whether that is so or not we will have an opportunity to decide when the T a r if f is under consideration. Whether or not the Inter-State Commission was fitted for the work it was asked to perform by a former Government does not concern us at this moment, but the Act by which the Commission was created contemplated that body performing a similar work to that which we are now discussing. In Part III . of the Inter-State Commission Act, dealing with investigations, the wide powers given to the Commission to examine embrace, amongst other things, ""the encouragement, improvement, and extension of Australian industries and a ques- manufactures."" There are a number of identified and related matters which this Commission may inquire into, and we may well ask them, in either their investigating or judicial character-whicheve r is the least injured by the recent decision of the High Court-to consider and recommend to the Minister, either the in dividual licensees who shall get these exclusive rights, or the terms and conditions upon which such rights should be granted.",41
344,Mr WEST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,I think Parliament ought to settle that question.,41
345,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"We have already decided under this Bill that the licences may run during the unexpired period of the patent. It is clear in some cases that the Minister will grant licences for one or two years, but if the utilization of any patents in volves a large capital expenditure, it may be necessary, in order to encourage the manufacture of patented goods in Australia, to give double or ten times the period. Every application must be dealt with in view of all its admitted circumstances. Parliament cannot possibly deal with matters of this character. the provisions of the law, as we are now asked to pass it , power to deal with these patents will rest with the Minister, and the question before us is whether we should leave the grave responsibility of deciding as to what'individuals should enjoy these licences, and the terms and conditions under which they are to be operative, with the Minister. I think the At torney-General will , on more mature reflection, probably agree with some of us, that to unload that duty upou the Inter-State Commission would be a wise Ordinance. The Commission would discharge the duty after the complete investigation j>rovided for in ' their Act without fear or favour-as the Minister himself would also do-bu b the Commission would naturally debate the principles of every action in a manner that the Minister's own busy life would render it almost impossible for him to do.",42
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,The very essence of the thing is discrimination.,42
347,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Yes ; and it is a discrimination that is not only unpleasant, but is provocative of great danger if injudicially or loosely administered.",42
348,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,Why do you think the Attorney-General should not have this power?,42
349,Mr WATT,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"I crossed swords with the Attorney-General last night, but I assured him then that I did not think he would pollute the fount of justice in his judicial capacity, or act upon wrong principles of discrimination, although the honourable gentleman did not seem to quite accept my assurance. My point is that the M i nister should consider the advisability and the wisdom of entrusting certain of the discriminating powers with which he is now to be dowered, to the Inter-State Commission, in the hope that then the public will see that there is no politics in any of these discriminations, and that they will be exercised by a body outside of party, that each case will be examined carefully with the elaborate machinery available to the Commission, on its merits, and decisions and conclusions arrived at that will be equitable to all parties concerned. These are the observations that I recommend, with respect, to the M in ister in charge of the Bill in the hope that either here or elsewhere some of them may recommend themselves to his judgment. ""Under Mr Glynn (Angas) [8.24] - Yester day evening I drew attention to the point as to what position a patentee would be in as soon as the war is over in regard to his rights under a suspended patent. These rights are not abrogated, but they may be suspended under this Act, and that is the point to which the honourable member for Wimmera has now called attention. The Attorney-General promised to look into that matter, so that I understand there may be an opportunity of something being done when this Bill is before the Senate. The honourable member for Parramatta raised a question as to whetlier it reauy was expedient to vest the whole of this administration in the Attorney-General, which, of course, will mean, under him, in the Comptroller of Customs. It struck me last night that perhaps, if there is a difficulty, it could be got over by making the provision regarding licences in the Act of 1909the principal Act - apply to this Act. For instance, if the manufacturer of a patented article lis not resident in the Commonwealth, an application may be made to the Commissioner by petition asking that the patent may be revoked. If the Commissioner thinks there is no justification, no primd-facie case made out, he can dismiss the petition; but if he thinks there is a primd-facie case, he can send it on to the H i gh Court, and then the question of whether a licence shall be issued or not will be tested by a tribunal which is absolutely unfettered by any consideration except that of doing justice to the Department. That is the provision we have in our Act at the present time. We threshed this matter out last night, and I merely offer this suggestion to the At torney-General now for his consideration. Tliere may be an opportunity of dealing with it in the Senate.  to place on record my objection to the clause in the Bill which has been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. The power proposed to be vested in the Minister to grant patent rights to applicants in the way suggested is one that is altogether too great. I do not wisli to cast any reflection upon the Minister. I am speaking from a purely non-party point of view. Thesame argument would apply, whoever occupied his position. I would not envy the Attorney-General if he took upon himself this power, as it may be responsible for a great deal of unpleasantness; but I think the Minister should explain to the House, in the event of his taking this power, how he would propose to deal with applicants. What will be his modus operandi? How will he give priority ? I think, nevertheless, in his own interests, and in the interests of the country, he be wise to accept the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and delegate these powers to the Inter-State Commission. We do not know how many patents there are' belonging to enemy subjects in Australia. I understand there are hundreds of them, and it would be quite impossible, as the member for East Sydney has suggested, that these questions should be threshed out in the House. It would take us too long. The Minister himself could not go into the hundreds of questions and give them the consideration to which they are entitled. He would, therefore, be compelled to delegate his authority to some official in the Department. I suggest, therefore, in justice to himself, and in the best interests of the country, that the questions should be referred to the Inter-State Commission, which seems to be the proper body for dealing with matters of this kind.",42
350,Mr KELLY,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"Does the honourable member think that the Inter-State Commission or the High Court would deal more expeditiously with matters of this kind than the Minister himself?  again, I think as much publicity should be given to these matters as possible. Supposing there are in question eight or nine patent rights of a different class, the should, I think, be published in the Commonwealth Gazette throughout the length and breadth of the country, so as to allow every manufacturer who wished to do so to apply for the licences.",43
351,Mr WEST,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"East Sydney) [8.29] - I would not have made any observations on the third reading of this Bill but for the fact that our friends opposite seem to have some suspicion about the capacity of the Attorney-General and his Department to administer this Act. I am one of those who are not too anxious for the business of the country to be taken out of Ministerial control and put under any Commission. The public interest is best safeguarded by giving the control of public affairs to aMinister whom Parliament can call to account at once, if it thinks that his actions are prejudicial to the public good. It is to be remembered that the Bill is to have force only during the currency of the war,, which we must all pray may be a very short period. My experience in connection with patents makes me think that will there are many now in force which, in any case, would lapse within six months, and others which may not have two years; to run. The honourable member for Wimmera talked of the granting of a monopoly. If a monopoly is to be granted by the handing over of patent rights to a licensee, surely Parliament, and no one else, should possess the power to control it ; and the power of the Parliament cannot be exercised more quickly than through a Minister. The honourable member for Balaclava wishes to provide other machinery. If this power were given to the Inter-State Commission, Parliament, could discuss its actions much less freely, and would interfere only with more difficulty than will be the case if the administration of the Act is left to a member of the Government. I am not desirous of rushing things to the Inter-State Commission. We have been trying to get from the Commission a report on the Tariff, and it seems possible that some of us may be dead before that can be done. The House may be certain that the members on this side will take care that no monopoly shall exist a day longer than is needed to provide an opportunity for Parliament to deal with it.",43
352,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTOR OF LAND SAN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.36] - My reply to the facts lionorable member for Wimmera is that all royalties will be paid into a fund, which will be at the disposal of the Government, to be distributed at the close of the war in accordance with the terms of peace and the circumstances of each pari ticular case. Subject to those conditions of peace, justice will be done to the indivi-; dual without respect to persons, whether he be German or English. No discussion should have arisen on this Bill as to the - exercise of the power to licence; seeing that that power is given under the Act of last year, whose provisions were copied from the British Act. Under this Act the power is exercised by the Board of Trade; whose President is a Cabinet M in ister. According to the Patents and Designs Temporary Bules 1914, dated 7th September, 1914, which I read last - nightThe Board may, at their discretion, grant in favour of persons other than subjects of .any State at war with His Majesty licence to make, use, exercise, or vend any registered or patented design. As the honourable member for East Sydney has pointed out, the measure is to - have force only during the war, which we hope will be a very short period; but, whether it be short or long, I contend that the relations of Parliament and a Minister are more intimate than those of Parliament and any outside 'authority. The procedure now is for the Commissioner of Patents to take the evidence of Applicants, and for me to come to a decision upon that evidence. I do not delegate the reading of the evidence to any one. I say, further, that any member is at liberty to read the evidence that has already been taken, and the orders that have been made in relation to it , at any time for which he cares to make an appointment. Question resolved i u the affirmative. Bill read a thir d time. NA SECOND READING.",43
353,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.40] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill relates to contracts, and particularly to contracts with an alien enemy, or for his benefit. It arises directly out of this dreadful war in which the Empire and its Allies are engaged, and it concerns us in a most vital way. Interests of a most important nature, and vast in their extent, are involved. - And in the very nature of things, therefore, it is not only necessary bufc urgent. Tho Bill annuls contracts with enemy subjects or for their benefit. The necessity for such action arises directly out of the war. The effect of war upon contracts is to suspend some, and terminate others, according to their nature. Some of the contracts with which this measure deals are not contracts between the alien enemy and subjects of the Empire, but legally considered are contracts between British subjects. Nevertheless, they are contracts for the benefit of an alien enemy, although they are not affected legally by the war. Great uncertainty exists as fco the result of the war on contracts, and it is to resolve that uncertainty that this measure has been introduced. Ifc has been introduced for another and a still more important reason, namely, to afford the enterprise of Australia an opportunity to develop and expand itself at a time when, owing to this world-wide struggle, its efforts at development are in danger of being strangled. I may now shortly state the legal position in regard to the effect of war upon contracts. I have said that the effect of war is to suspend some contracts and to discharge others, according to the nature of the contract. So far as concerns that part of the performance which would have fallen due to take place during the continuance of the war, it is clear that there is a discharge, and not merely a postponement of performance. The case is not like those in which the only outstanding obligation is the periodical payment of a sum of money. Where a part of the obligation of the contract having failed of performance, each party being disappointed of what he stipulated for under the contract, the substantial question is whether fchafc partial failure of the contract affects the BILL. whole. The law practically leaves the matter on the basis of the expectation and intention of reasonable men (Brett, L . J., in Honck v. Muller). But a breach of one stipulation, even a material stipulation in a contract, does not, of itself, terminate the whole (Collins, L J., in Cornwall v. Eenson; and Mersey Steel and I r o n Go. v. Naylor). Where the parties to the contract are respectively aiming at a continuous and regular market for their ores, and a continuous and regular supply for their works, a substantial failure in this respect appears to go to "" the root of the contract,"" and to be witliin the test suggested by Anson (Contracts, p. 325): "" I have lost all that I cared to obtain under this contract: further performance not make good past default."" Gobbett, p. 71, recognises that the rule of suspension does not apply to executory contracts in which time is essential, in such cases the whole contract is terminated. Admittedly, a party to a contract cannot say, ""I am compelled for the present, and for a term the length of which I cannot foresee, to suspend performance; but I may be able to resume performance before the contract runs out, so take the notice that I treat the contract as still subsisting, so far as concerns those acts of performance may fall due after I am in a position to resume."" But where, by a term of the contract, definite provision is made for suspension on outbreak of war, and for revival and performance after the war of those obligations which were during the war, and would have been performed during the period of the war, the position of the parties is clouded by uncertainty. That, shortly, is the legal position, so far as it is necessary to set it forth in connection with this measure. have said that this Bill deals with a vital matter, touching us intimately, as it does, vast and important I admit, that it is perhaps without precedent, at all events, without precedent in a British country, but it arises out of conditions that are absolutely precedent. But if this Bill is without precedent in a British country, it is not without precedent in other We are unable to learn what is doing in relation to contracts, to private property generally; but if we are to believe what we hear, it is certain that the rights of persons under contracts with Germans, rights in regard to private property, including patent rights, for instance, have been swept aside. certain that contracts have been annulled, and I do not think there is anybody in this country so credulous as to believe that, in the event of Germany being conqueror, contracts for the benefit of Britons will stand. If there be one who holds that opinion, he stands alone, so far as I am concerned, for I was never, nor am now, of that opinion. deals with exceptional circumstances arising out of the war, and cannot be looked at and judged, except in the lurid glow that arises from this dreadful conflict, in which the hosts of Christendom are arrayed for the purMr Hughes. can- poses of mutual destruction. This is a Pitt world-wide war, and it is being waged for the purposes of a world power. This is not merely for the purpose of milithat tary power, although the means of achieving world power are necessarily military in their nature. But the war is waged by Germany for the purpose of achieving commercial, financial, and in dustrial domination of the earth. That is the great purpose to which she has devoted her tremendous systematized energies for nearly half a century. And I must remind honourable members of how nearly which Germany was achieving this without any war at all. I think that that nation has committed the most fatal blunder in its whole history in entering the lists of battle when she could have achieved her whole purpose without p.sk, and with suspended comparatively little expenditure and loss of time.",44
354,Mr WATT,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,How ?,45
355,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am going to prove what I have said. I desire now to show 1 what the position of Germany was at the outbreak of the war, and what it will affecting, be when peace is concluded, so far as interests. we are concerned, unless by action we change it . Australia is a country infinitely rich, both potentially and actually. Its mineral wealth is almost boundless. without It has been estimated that the value of the annual output of base metal in this country is not less than £13,000,000. countries. And over this the control of Germany Germany before the war was almost complete. I or cannot do better, in order to develop this part of my argument, than refer honourable members to some remarks I made last year in the form of au answer to a question by the honourable member for Barrier. Honourable members will find It is the report of my remarks in Hansard of lOfch December, 1914, page 1508. I then saidShortly stated, the facts show beyond all question that German capital and German influence exercise a monopoly of the base metal industry of the civilized world; that this monopoly is for all practical purposes so complete as to exclude effective competition; that it covers the whole sphere of the industry, This Bill limiting output, controlling markets, determining the channels of distribution, and fixing prices; that the war, by closing most of the channels through which the metallic products were distributed, and the markets in which they were disposed of, has very seriously affected the industry, throwing large numbers of working men out of employment, causing great loss of wealth production, retarding the development of our great resources, and seriously menacing the welfare of the whole community; that peace holds out no prospects satisfactory, or even tolerable, to British and Australian interests, since it would but revive that complete domination of the industry by Gorman influence, wbicb insures the building up of German instead of British and Australian interests. Ko patriotic citizen can contemplate such a prospect without the most serious misgivings. This war will have been wagedin vain; the blood of our best and bravest citizens shed without purpose; the Empire will have endured the dreadful horrors of modern warfare to no purpose, if, at its conclusion, when victory tardily, and at a dreadful cost, has been won, we are again compelled to pour into the lap of Germany the lion's share of the wealth created by Australian enterprise and Australian workmen. Before the war, German capital and influence had created a splendidly organized system by which it was enabled to levy toll upon the world. The cream of the profits arising out of the metal industry of the world-profit s upon a turnover which, at a rough estimate, .cannot fall short of £200,000,000-foun d its way through various channels to the pockets of the great German financiers, thus strengthening Germany's position commercially, industrially, and nationally, enlarging the scope of .her operations in other directions, and maintaining and perfecting that terrific instrument of destruction by which she now seeks to batter all who dare withstand her, into submission, it ' is a humiliating but irrefutable fact that Australian capital, enterprise, and labour have materially aided the enemy in this dreadful conflict.",45
356,Mr SPEAKER,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I understood the lionorable member to be quoting an answer to a question that was asked him by the honourable member for Barrier. If the honourable member is reading a reply to a question he is in order; but if he is quoting a speech delivered by the honourable member at a former period of this session he is not in order.,46
357,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"What I am quoting was said in answer to a question, and I take this course in order to shorten the debate, seeing that the words are most suited to state the case. I am sorry the extract is so long, and I shall endeavour to make it as short as possibleA few figures will clearly establish this position. The value of the metals, lead, zinc, copper, tin, produced annually in Australia, estimated upon an average price for the year 1!112, amounts to nearly £13,000,000, or, including silver and gold recovered in the extraction of these commoner metals, £15,000,000. Even upon a fair average price for the past ten years, the gross value is not less than £13,000,000. All this wealth was produced in Australia, but-wit h the exception of gold and silver-the industry was and is controlled by German influence, so that output, destination, [108] and price were matters in which Australia had no say whatever. I put this forward to substantiate my statement that the position of Germany in her efforts to secure world power had reached a point when it needed no mort than that she should press on in the direction she was going in order to achieve it . Without exaggeration, one may say that the control of the metal industry of Australia was dominated by Germany. I take the metal industry as typical, and, perhaps, as the one in which German influence is most marked; but it is certainly not unique, because German influence is dominant throughout the many industries of Australia.",46
358,Mr WATT,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Y o u cannot seriously make that statement?,46
359,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Yes ; it may annoy the honourable member, but it annoys me more than it does him.",46
360,Mr WATT,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Y o u cannot truthfully make the statement, surely!",46
361,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Cannot the honourable member let me say what I have to say 1,46
362,Mr WATT,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"It is such a gross exaggeration, that is all .",46
363,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I desire now to show honourable members exactly what our position is, so far as the metal industry is concerned. Most, if not all, of the mining companies of Australia have entered into contracts for the disposal of their products up to the year 1921, and many of those contracts contain clauses providing for suspension in the case of war and revival after the war, and operate in such a way that the period of the war is added to the original term. So that if the original term of a contract expired in 1921, and the war lasts three years, then the term of the contract is extended to 1924. That is the position in which many of the mining companies in Australia find themselves today. Whether these contracts, or any of them, are actually discharged by the war I am unable to say. That is a question which can only be answered when we consider the terms of each contract and the circumstances surrounding it . Biit, speaking generally, I am able to say that there is amongst all these companies uncertainty and doubt as to their position, and such uncertainty and doubt as to affect, not only their present operations, but to seriously hamper their future development. The position in which they are placed, indeed* threatens to paralyze every effort, not only to develop their business, but to divert trade from Germany to Britain and its Allies. They are unable, for example, - to enter into any contracts with any one, but the agency through which German influence operates for the sale of their products. Naturally, manufacturers in 'Great Britain are unable to enter into contracts for the purchase of such products. Yet before a group of capitalists - can be induced to invest £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in the manufacture of spelter, or the zinc of commerce, they must be assured of an ample and regular supply of the metal they require. That is precisely what cannot be assured to them under existing conditions. The companies of Australia, and the capitalists of England, are unable now to come to the point where it is possible to divert to British or friendly channels the metal which flowed sometimes to Germany, to Belgium, to Prance, or to other countries, the lion's share of the profits from which went to Germany. They are unable to do so, not only because of the contract relating to the supply of metal, bufc also because they have contracts which give the exclusive selling agency to one firm which for all practical purposes is German. We may now deal in detail with the extent t'o which the control over lead, zinc, copper, and tin by German influence goes. The position before the war was this: Practically the output price and sale of all lead was governed by the Lead Convention; zinc by Aaron Hirsch and Sohn, Beer Sondheimer and Co., and the Metallgesellschaft; copper by Aaron Hirsch and Sohn. Upon the outbreak of war the Lead Convention was re-constituted nominally without the German element, but, to all intents and purposes, the control of lead today is exercised by the same people as before the war. same element is dominant, and it is through that channel, and that channel alone, that every pound of lead is purchased by the Admiralty and the War Office. There is no other means of obtaining lead except through the one channel. I should here state exactly how trol of the metal industry has been brought about. It originated through the operaA/r. Hughes. tions of the firm of Merton, of Frankfort-on-Main. The ramifications of fchis firm or group are world-wide in their nature. Ifc is represented in almost every civilized country, and its methods are typical of the German character. They are systematic and thorough. They resort in this regard to the same methods n: the devolpment of their business as they do for the development of their national power. That is to say, they take upon themselves the national cloak of the country in which they find themselves established to disguise the purpose which they have at heart. This German group have their head-quarters at Frankfort-on-Main, and exercise power in every country in the world. They have daughter companies - off-shoots - in America, Africa, and Australia. The Metallgesellschaft, which is one of the first forms in which the Merton combination expressed itself, dominates the market in America, Africa, and Australia, through daughter companies. The Australian Metal Company, for example, under which name the German group operates here, is a company registered in Australia. This brings me to what I mentioned at the outset, that in form we have not to deal only with contracts between an alien enemy and a British subject, but with contracts between persons who are nominally British subjects-between a company registered in Australia and another company also registered in Australia. The Australian Metal Company, to all intents and purposes, is the Metallgesellschaft, and the Metallgesellschaft is a German combination working in conjunction with the Merton group. The Merton ""group in Frankfort-on-Main working conjointly with the Merton group in London, dominates the metal industry. It is impossible in England to buy lead except through Merfcon's in London. The companies of Australia have a contract with Merton, through whom their The selling is done. They cannot sell to anybody but Morton's, and Merton, although registered in England, and a naturalized citizen of that country, is, for all practical purposes as much German as is the Merton of Frankfort-on-Main. The Metallgesellschaft,, Merton's, and other firm names by which the combination expresses itself are only various forms the conthrough which this group of German capitalists exercises its great power.",46
364,Mr KELLY,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Would it be possible to prove in a Court the connection asserted by the honourable gentleman, and which I have no doubt is genuine?",48
365,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I do not know whether it would or not. If we are to say here only what we could prove in a Court, I ask the honourable member for Wentworth what his position would be, and wliere would any of us be if we had to do that? The facts I am giving now are derived partly from official and partly from other sources. If honourable members ask me, in connection with a particular statement, whether I have the in formation from an official source, I shall be prepared to tell them. When I say, for example, that Merton's is the sole selling agency for lead, that is official. My statement that the Australian Metal Company is, for all practical purposes the Metallgesellschaft is based on official information. The Australian Metal Company has contracts with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, by which the latter contracts to supply it with its metallic ores until 1921. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has also contracted with Merton's, of London, to sell through them, and tlirough them alone. All these are official facts. Now this contract is typical, and is, in form, not an enemy contract at all, bu t one between British subjects'. Y e t this British nationality is in many cases only a cloak. It is in this case, as the list of shareholders of the Australian Metal Company shows. The directors of that company aro Messrs. G. E. Schuster, G. Schwarz, C. L . Budd, A . Beker, C. R. Euler, and R. Merton. The authorized capital of the company is £50,000, in 5,000 shares of £ 1 0 each, and the shareholders are as follow: J . A . Amschel, 7 Gracechurch-street, 'London, 20 shares; S. Baer, 1 share; C. L . Budd, 10 shares; Deutsche Gold and Silber Schoide Anstalt, Frankfort-on-Main, Germany, 200 shares; C. R. Euler (Bockenheimer Anlage), Frankfort-on-Main, 10 shares; A . Merton, of the same address, 10 shares; Merton Metallurgical Company .Limited, 1,440 shares; Metallgesellschaft. Frankfort-onMain, 1,490 shares; and Metallbank and Metallurgische Gesell, A . G., Frankforton-Main, 980 shares. There are also a number of minor shareholders. greater number of shares are held by Germans. The company is controlled by [108]- 2 Germans, and for all practical purposesthe company is German. The Lloyd'Aeitung, a German newspaper, in its issueof 8th July, 1913, published an articleby Professor Robert Liefmaiin, of Freiburg, under the heading of "" The International 'Organization of the Frankfort Metal Trade,"" of which the following translation of an extract may be quotedLastly, there belong to the Merton concern two more companies which bear testimony to the international character of the concern by their very name, viz., the African Metal Company nnd the Australian Metal Company, of London and Melbourne. These two companies are sub-companies of the Metallgesellschaft and of Henry R. Merton and Company, and transact for the latter firms the purchase and sale of metals in Africa and Australia. They are, therefore, agencies which were given the titles of independent companies chiefly for legal reasons. The Merton group has companies all over the world. I shall not burden honourable members by reading a full list of them. ' They are in every civilized country, and everywhere serve the purposes of Germany under the cloak of the nationality in which they find themselves. The latest development is the War Metal Company, which is a combination of various German companies, formed witl the object of providing metals for carrying on the war. In that combinatior the Merton group, the Metallgesellschaft Aaron Hirsch and Beer Sondheimer an veiy prominent."" Let me now repeat the position in regard to lead, zinc, and copper. The lead trade is largely dominated by the Lead Convention, which, before the war, was composed of Mertons, the Metallgesellschaft, and the Broken Hill Proprietary. A f t e r the outbreak of war it was reconstituted, and it now consists of the Broken Hill Proprietary,. Mertons, and another firm. The position in regard to zinc is very similar. Zinc, as honourable membersknow, plays a most important part in themetallic wealth of Australia. It istreated here, and sent away in the form of concentrates, which are manufactured into the spelter or zinc of commerce. The persons or firms who control the zinc trade-that is to say, who decide 0 how much zinc Australia shall produceas well as what the price shall be, are The Aaron Hirsch, Beer Sondheimer, and the Metallgesellschaft. The position is practically the same in regard to copper, so far as the firm of Aaron Hirsch is concerned. This, then, is the position of Australia, and the extent of the German control. I want honourable to grip hold of the fact that but the sharp edge of legislation of this sort can cut the tangled web of contracts that binds the Australian companies and Australian commerce to German fluence. There is a positive network of contracts, and the Australian are helpless unless we come to their rescue. Let me give one illustration. In this city we have the offices of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which is tied up with a contract with the Australian Metal Company. The tralian Metal Company said to "" We give you notice that we propose after the war to hold you to your contract,"" and that contract continues 1921, plus, of course, the period which the war extends. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has given notice of its intention to annul the contract; whether that notice is good or not in law neither I nor any one else can say. yet another case. Negotiations have been going on for some months with a view to encouraging the manufacture of copper rod, wire, barrel, and sheet copper in Australia. Magnificent opportunities exist in this country for the development of the copper industry. Do honourable members realise that in this matter we have to deal with a company one-third of whose shares are held by Aaron Do they realise that there is practically no one else in Australia to whom we can say, "" Will you establish this industry? And this company is not the only one in which' German influence lies covered by an Australian registration. There are contracts which fetter the limbs of Australia at the present juncture, in a hundred, aye, in a thousand, different ways, and in this regard we are acting, not against the interests of any companies, but for their benefit. Many of them uot only approve but welcome this The Broken Hill Proprietary CompanyI think it is ouly fair to say this-has given three months' notice to London, under the new agreement, terminate the selling contract. very good, as far as it goes; but we must see that no contract is made ihe . war by an Australian with an agency ofGermany, under whatMr Hughes. ever name it may disguise itself. To sever the contract with Merton's, if it is to be renewed with some other agent members under whose personality German Protean nothing influence hides itself, will not benefit us. The Government will use every power in its possession to prevent German influence dominating Australian trade. To show in- how keenly the Australian companies are alive to the importance of this legislacompanies tion, and in what light they regard it , I may give the House the view taken by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company of the matter. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has given an undertakingAusit, 1. To give three months' notice to terminate the existing agreement with Merton's; 2. To sever all connection with any firm or agency representing or influenced by Germans until or Austrians, or German or Austrian capital; over 3. To undertake not to enter into any contractual or business relations with such firm or agency relating to the sale, distribution, or price of the products of the company, either but during the war, or after the termination thereof; and Take 4. To give preference in the sale or disposal of any products of the company to any bond fide British buyer. That is the sort of evidence which, I submit, should weigh with honourable members, and which we advance as the justification and necessity for the Bill . Yet, although this company is desirous of giving effect to its undertaking, it cannot do so, unless we help them, for it is bound Hirsch? hand and foot. The company may give the notice, but that notice does not terminate the agreement. And this applies generally. In South Australia we find that a firm like Elder, - Smith, and Company was tied round with contracts. It has broken the contracts, but it has not broken them legally, and it may be still liable, or will be liable after the war in the Courts to such litigation as the> immensely powerful interests that are at the backof these German concerns can bring against it . Do honourable members measure. realise that we are speaking now of influences that have behind them literally hundreds of millions of pounds, that their Merton's, power manifests itself not merely through to Germans and naturalized Germans, but That is through persons of our own race ? Where there is such tremeudous power it maniduring fests itself in every direction. I said a company little while ago that we were resolute in our determination not to permit any Australian industries to be fettered by any influence that was German in essence. We are not to be imposed upon by any subterfuge. There are firms in London now working in close conjunction with Merton's who are British in origin as well as in name, yet they are in all essence Germans. They are the cond u it pipes through which the profits go to Germany; they are the wires by which the 'German influence is transmitted and through whom it effects its purpose. We have ample proof in the Department to show that these three firms - som e of whom are British in origin as well as in name-ar e to all intents and purposes German in essence. I come now to refer to another point of this matter. I have already said that the position in respect to lead is that the companies are tied up with long-dated contracts, and that remark applies also to zinc and copper. There is on foot a proposal, to which we take no sort of exception, to amalgamate - certain mining companies here for the purpose of more effectively treating and smelting Australian metals. We welcome that from our present point of view, and for our present purpose, but we declare that, so far as German influence is con-cerned, we shall look to the amalgamation to give the same sort of undertaking that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has given in regard to its relation with German influence and capital. Coming, now, to the Bill itself, the objects of it are two: to provide for the continuance of the Australian output during the war and to prevent the renewal of German control after the war. The difficulty in doing this arises out of the very nature of the case. First of all, the trouble is to kuow under what law the contracts are to be enforced-whethe r by Federal law or ' by the law of - one or more of the States, or by Imperial Courts. There are some of these - contracts made in England which can be dealt with by Australian law; there are some contracts made in Australia which can be only dealt with by English law; there are some contracts made in one State which could probably be dealt with by the Federal Courts. The law in relation to interpretation and enforcement of - contracts need hardly be stated, but, generally speaking, it may be said that in the interpretation of a contract the law of the country in which the contract is made, or in which it is proposed to bb carried out, prevails. The Bill provides for the annulment of enemy contracts. The main provisions are in clauses 3 and 4. Under clause 3 they become null and void ipso facto. The Bill also provides in clause 4 for another class of contracts, namely, those contracts suspended by the wax. These contracts are terminable only at the option of eitlier party. A party may find himself unable to discharge his contract, or to fulfil his obligation. For example, he may be under a contract to ship goods to England, but he cannot get freight. He may b""> under an obligation to do things which the war has prevented him from doing. Clause 4 gives him the opportunity to terminate the contract. Dealing more particularly with contracts with the enemy covered by clause 3, and the difficulties of determining precisely under what law a contract is to be dealt with, the Government have been in frequent communication with the B r i tish Government. The matter has been the. subject of very lengthy cable communications, of which I have a number with me, but to which, owing to the nature of them, I am unable to give publicity. Generally, I may say that the British Government have been keenly alive to the importance of the position, and are very anxious to know exactly what we propose to do as to action by the British Parliament. They have stated that they are giving the matter most careful consideration. A cable containing the text of this Bill has been sent to London, for the in formation of the British Government.",48
366,Mr KELLY,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,When was it sent?,50
367,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"The measure has not been drafted very long, but to all intents ' and purposes the scope of it was sent about a fortnight ago, and the substance of what was then sent does not differ in any material particular fro m what has been sent since the Bill was drafted. We have every reason to believe that the British Government are not only sympathetic in this matter, but also keenly alive to the importance of it . We have approached each of the States, and I am in a position to say that every State of the group, through its Premier, has promised to introduce complementary legislation, that is to say, it has promised to . limtrpduoe legislation to give effect to our legislation, so that it will be State law as well as Eederal law, and companies will be protected both in the State Courts and in the Federal Courts from any .consequence of litigation which may result from acting as though a contract were annulled.",50
368,Mr WATT,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Have the Imperial Government signified their approval of the text of this measure?,51
369,Mr ITUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"No ; we have had no communication from them since the last cable was sent, about a fortnight ago.",51
370,Mr GLYNN,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I think that about two months ago the Imperial Government disapproved of this kind of legislation, so far as giving help in the matter was concerned.",51
371,Mr HUGHES,E NEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I have noticed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed a deputation that he looked upon the matter with disfavour, but that - has not been the tone of the cables from His Majesty's Government to us. That is all I can say. T am perfectly satisfied that in our case legislation is not only justified, but also necessary. Control by Germany of industries in 'Great Britain may not be proportionately as great as it is in Australia. I say most emphatically that, upon a fair review of the position, a measure such as this is absolutely essential if we are to do our part as citizens towards developing the resources of Australia, and freeing our commercial, financial, and industrial population from the effect of contracts tying up their enterprise and - preventing the proper development of the Commonwealth. I say, further, that at the present 'time the persons ""under contractual obligations arc unable to say where they are; they are unable to - make any move to look for fresh markets, because they do not know to what extent their present contracts hind them. I emphasize the fact that, as the State Governments, through the vari-ous Premiers, have pledged themselves to introduce this legislation, all actions for breach of contracts made in Australia, or made el°f»where to be executed in Australia, will be covered by a full and factory defence. The necessity for this legislation plain. Persons undpr contracts affected - by the war do not know where they are. The Zinc Corporation made, for example, an effort to obtain a pronouncement in the English Courts, but failed because the enemy defendant was not represented. A Bill had subsequently to be passed by the Imperial Parliament to enable such cases to be dealt with. Most of the contracts to which this Bill will apply are governed by Australian law; whether Commonwealth or State law it is difficult to say. With regard to Broken Hill products, for example, the mine may be situated in one State, the contracting parties may be in another State, and the contract may be formed in a third State. Personally, I believe that the Commonwealth has jurisdiction to deal with this matter under the heading of Defence, but if not the States will have jurisdiction under the heading of Contract. The Bill is not confined to metal contracts. What applies to metals applies all round. The Bill has two main clauses dealing with enemy contracts and contracts that are suspended during the war. In regard to the former, the Bill termi.nates these contracts altogether, and the difficulty of identifying them is set at rest by the certificate of the Attorney General. That is to say, though it is not, necessary to clo so, a copy may be filed with the Attorney-General, and his certificate is proof that the provision applies to it. One exception is made. There are German life assurance companies operating in Australia, ancl therefore contracts of life assurance are excepted. The contracts dealt with in clause 4 are made terminable at the option of either partythat is to say, suspension for the indefinite period of the war creates such a deadlock that power to terminate them is necessary. Notice of termination made before the passing of the Bill is to be as good as if it is made afterwards. I urge on honourable members the importance of the Bill and the necessity for its early passage into law. Every effort ought to be made to develop new industries and strengthen old ones. Since the trade with Germany and Austria, exports and imports, prior to the war, covered nearly £15,000,000 annually, it is clear that the closing of these channels has created consatis- ditions which nothing but the most determined activity on our part can reis very move. We must, therefore, do whatever is possible to free persons from obligations under contracts made ""before the war for Che benefit of alien enemies, and to find them new markets. Although the Bill applies to all contracts, it is specially applicable to metallic products which are tied up by long-dated contracts which threaten to hamper vitally all effort to deal with this great question. I have omitted to touch upon the position of the tin industry. Lead, zinc, and copper are controlled by contracts which run as far as 1921. Tin is controlled by similar influences, though not to the same extent. Tin is an industry capable of great development here. At a meeting of the Y-Water T in Mining Company, New South Wales, held yesterday, it was stated that their t in was being sent to be smelted at Mount Bischoff, and the arrangement was found very satisfactory. The practice hitherto has been to send most of the t in to Singapore, where it is smelted by coolie labour. Singapore is largely dominated by Merton's. Why should not all t in be smelted in Australia? This instance affords another reason why we sbould do all in our power to enable mining companies to have their products treated in Australia. The Bill will enable men to free themselves from obligations undertaken prior to the war which they cannot possibly fulfil during the war, and which, in 99 cases out of 100, they do not intend to go on with after thewar, unless compelled to do so. The measure is one suggested by common prudence, and ought .to be supported by every patriotic citizen. It is one which the circumstances call for,, and that all parties, so f ar as I have been able to ascertain, approve. I commend it to the House. 1 admit that it deals with difficulties by cutting through them; but there is DO other way to deal with the matter than by the sharp edge of such a law as this. Debate (on motion by Mr. JOSEPH GOOK) adjourned.",51
