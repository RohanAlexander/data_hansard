1,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice- ' 1. Whether the additional 5 per cent, paid on salaries of postal officials ana others on the goldfields of Western Australia, on account bf the increased cost of living, is still paid? 2. Whether the same concession is not now enjoyed by the whole service, and consequently there is no additional payment on the goldfields? 3. What is the reason for this reversal of action ?",13
2,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information in reply to the honourable member's questions :1. Cold-fields omcers receive district allowance under the prescribed scale, ranging from ie to 50 per cent, on the first £100 of salary, j \ to 35 per cent, on the second £100, and 5 per cent, on the excess of salary beyond £*oo. The 5 per cent, allowance is payable at Perth and elsewhere to officers who do not draw the higher scale allowance. a. No. Gold-fields omcers receive the higher allowances mentioned in 1. 3. There has been no reversal of action. - IMPORTATION OF HORSES.  and Customs, upon noticej . Will ihe Minister direct the Quarantine Branch of his Department to take action immediately to see that no horse or other animal is brought to Australia from India either directly or through any other country? 2. Is there any prohibition Against saddlery, harness, or other articles in connection with the furnishings of horses coming into Austialia from India or any other' country; and, if so, what is the nature of such prohibition?. 3. Could the Quarantine Branch insist upon having.a certificate signed by a certified veterinary surgeon at the time and place of exportation that horses or other animals aTe free from glanders or other infectious diseases before being admitted into Australia from India or any other country?",13
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. The importation of horses from India into the Commonwealth is ' prohibited. countries from which horses may be brought to Australia are the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, and New Zealand. Certain restrictions, including veterinary examination, are imposed by these countries on the importation of horses from India. The Australian Quarantine Regulations provide that any horse imported into Australia from the United Kingdom must be accompanied by(1) A declaration from the owner certifying(o) that the animal has been free from disease during the six months nextpreceding shipment; (6) that it has' not ' been in contact with any animal suffering from disease during the six months next preceding shipment; ic) that it has not, otherwise than as required under (2) been tested with mallein during the thirty days next preceding shipment. (2) A mallein test certificate by a qualified' veterinary surgeon - Defence {3) A certificate of general health from an approved veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment, who shall, unless he himself - has applied the mallein test, also endorse the mallein test certificate to the effect that after due inquiry, he has no reason to doubt its correctness. A further condition is imposed in regard to> horses imported from the United ' States aritl, Canada, a certificate being required front a Government veterinary surgeon that neither dourine nor epizotic lymphangitis has been' known to exist in any State in which tha animal has been located for a 'period of twelve] months prior to shipment. * z. A proclamation was issued in March last prohibiting used or second hand harness, saddlery, or horse effects from any country from which horses are prohibited, and from any other country unless certain prescribed conditions are complied with. 3. A certificate to this effect is now required by the quarantine regulations, the mallein test for glanders being applied prior to shipment, and a certificate of general health being given by an. approved veterinary surgeon. The mallein test is also applied while the animal is in quarantine .in Australia. ' WHITE POPULATION OF PAPUA.",14

Amendment (by Mr SINCLAIR) again proposed - That the item ""Naval Barracks, Submarine Depot . . . Towards cost, ,£53,000,"" be reduced by £53,000. : Mr MCWILLIAMS - Will the Minister tell us what amount is proposed to be spent on the Naval College site. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin Minister of Home Affairs) [2.36] - Nego tiations for acquiring the land are in progress, so that no exact information can be given respecting its cost. - Mr GROOM - Is the Government acquiring it compulsorily? - Mr KING O'MALLEY - We are making surveys of the land, to be in a position to compulsorily acquire it. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - What is its area? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Fro m 190 to 200 acres, and it will probably cost some amount between £25,000 and £40,000, but I cannot give a definite estimate. We know, of course, what land tax was paid on it, and have other similar particulars.'",14
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [2.38] - I wish to know if honourable members are being asked to commit themselves to the acquiring of the site for the Naval Training College to which reference has been made? If so, I am opposed to that - course, because I understand that the Defence Department selected an admirable site . at Jervis Bay which it regarded as in every way suitable for the purpose. It is said that that site is to be abandoned in favour of one nearer Sydney, in consideration of the Government receiving ,£43,000 which was collected from the subscribers to the Dreadnought fund. I am altogether' opposed .to that. The Commonwealth can find the money needed for its defence without such assistance.  the Prime Minister could settle this question V in one act."" Last night we could get no information at all as to whether the ,£43,000 was for a special site in any particular locality in or near Sydney, or £ 4 3 , 0 0 0 ? as to where the selected site really was. The proper place for the College is at Jerourselves. vis Bay in Federal Territory. The Go the contributors. vernment were very anxious to have the Royal Military College- I am pleased to see that it has that title-establishe d in Federal Territory for many reasons, but why .they are taking the Naval College outside of Federal Territory is beyond my comprehension. I wish to say emphatically that if the Government are going to accept the sum of £43,000 as a sop for putting the Naval College at any particular site, I am going to vote against it, even if by that action I vote myself out of Parliament. No one can gainsay that the Labour party both in this House before the last general election, and on the hustings at the election, fought against the proposal to provide a Dreadnought for the Old Country-as some people thought, in a time of danger-and for us as a party to now accept that money from the Dreadnought fund as a sop is more than my flesh and blood can stand. I want to know from the Minister of Home Affairsfor the Prime Minister now says he can give us the information - whether that is going to be done.",15
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.42] - The honourable member for Franklin desires to know what ultimate cost will be involved in building and equipping the Naval College at a particular site near Sydney, the honourable member for Herbert asks whether the site has been selected because of some condition attached to the offer of a sum of £40,000 odd to the Government, and the honourable member for Maranoa takes the view that the College ought to be established at Jervis Bay in Federal Territory. My advice is that if the naval authorities were to have absolutely the best site in Australia for the purpose it would not be on the mainland at all, but that there are other circumstances which compel them to have the Naval College at some convenient spot-the spot most convenient in many senses, and the most economical. They say that the site which has been selected is the best, taking the whole merits of the question into account. The ,£40,000 odd that will be a contribution towards the building or equipping of the College was not a matter that weighed with the Government in the selection of the site.  as to any site in the presentation of that",15
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Not so far as regards I think it was so as regards -.,15
8,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"If some other site were selected, would that £43,000 be still available?",16
9,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If a site was selected in another State, I think not.",16
10,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,O r in any other part of New South Wales?,16
11,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not in a position to say, but there is no obligation on the Commonwealth Government or Parlia : ment to accept that money unless they so desire. The site as a site would, however, still have been recommended by the naval authorities.  £43,000 ?",16
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes . I should like to add that the Government feel under obligation to put these Estimates through at this sitting. I hope that they will be passed at a convenient hour.,16
13,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [2.45] - I assure the Prime Minister that it is with no desire to delay the Estimates that I address myself to this question, because, in my opinion, the site that has been selected is the best that it would be possible to choose for the purpose in Australia.  it really is. Mr KING O'MALLEY - At the National Park, 13 miles from Sydney.",16
14,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is near Port Hacking, and is an excellent site for the-purpose.  ber is on his feet, would he mind asking the Minister how much it is to cost?",16
15,Mr KELLY,Unknown,There are some difficulties in the way of giving that information.,16
16,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It will be compulsorily resumed.,16
17,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member for Maranoa will see that, if we were to say at this stage what land we proposed taking over, we should throw additional obstacles in the way of an amicable arrangement of the price. I understand that the information is withheld at this juncture in order that the matter may be arranged amicably if possible.",16
18,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,It is very kind of the honourable member to supply the information.,16
19,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I gauged it from the Minister's reply a few moments ago. There is one point which might be cleared up. Whilst I believe the site selected is worthy of standing upon its own merits, - whether or not we get any gift made by patriotic persons in the State of New South Wales or elsewhere",16
20,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,How many miles is it from Sydney?,16
21,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I should say 17 miles, by road. The 13-mile post is at George's River, and the site is another 4 miles from there.",16
22,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The distance is practically 15 miles, according to the ordnance map.",16
23,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is more than that by road, but I do not know how far it is as die crow flies. I have, however risen to ask what considerations weighed with the Government in not placing the College at some other site than Port Hacking. The Prime Minister said that if the naval advisers of the Government had had a free hand, so to speak, they would have selected some place not upon the mainland, t presume the honourable member referred to some site in Tasmania. He went on to say that certain considerations made it expedient that the present site,- which was their second choice, should be selected. Were those other considerations purely strategical, or were they considerations of some other character?",16
24,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Consideration s of general utility and economy.,16
25,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Econom y of management and general utility?,16
26,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes .,16
27,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I could understand considerations of general utility seriously interfering with a proposition to locate the Naval College at Jervis Bay, because it is obvious that we ought to start the institution at the earliest possible moment.",16
28,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"O r with a proposition to establish it at Fremantle, for instance.",16
29,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . There ought to be no delay in establishing the College. If we sought to erect it at Jervis Bay, we should undoubtedly be putting its opening off for a year or two, which is time we cannot afford to waste.",16
30,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,Migh t not temporary buildings be used in the meantime? Why establish the College at Port Hacking?,16
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable member mean temporary buildings at Jervis Bay?,16
32,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,At any place you like.,16
33,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I think the College ought to be on Federal territory.,16
34,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is all very well, but there must be a vast organization in connection with a college of this character. If it is conducted on the lines of the West Point College, we shall have to house two or three times the number of cadets who eventually will graduate, and there will be required large professorial and managerial staffs.",17
35,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,Thes e wil l grow.,17
36,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"But we ought to deal with the matler from now out. This naval scheme is so big that, for many years, we shall have to borrow men and officers from the Imperial Navy; and if we are to obtain sufficient Australians, we shall have to start the College at the earliest possible moment.",17
37,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"For the "" purpose of general utility,"" to use the Prime Minister's expression, would it not be better to have a temporary building near a centre of population ?",17
38,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"What is confusing us, I think, is a desire, under the pretence that we are considering the Commonwealth, to kindle the old-standing, and, to my mind, utterly ridiculous, jealousy that undoubtedly exists between two big cities.",17
39,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I raised the quesaside tion, and I have no such feeling.",17
40,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I think that the honorknow able member for Franklin would have had a better right to ask why the College is not situated in Tasmania.,17
41,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"The feeling of jealousy at, in Tasmania. does not animate ""Queensland representatives.",17
42,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The feeling was up in a singular way last night.  actuated by such a feeling is Sydney.,17
43,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I always see a look bland camaraderie come over the honourable member's face when the question of a vote State. of any small sum for Sydney is under consideration. He looks as if he had taken his orders from a newspaper down the street he ever saw. to be as aggressive and as "" national "" as possible in his opposition to the expenditure of a single penny on the Federal Capital. After all, however, this is the Parliament Hobart. of the Australian Commonwealth, and those jealousies, if they unfortunately do exist, ought not to be allowed to delay our busiperhaps, ness. There may be jealousies between Sydney and Melbourne as to the progress they each make, but we ought not to conto cern ourselves with that, but see that select the best site. [84]",17
44,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"It is purely commercial rivalry, and it is good for the country.",17
45,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is good for the country that there should be commercial rivalry, but it is deplorable that two cities, each of which has its merits and advantages, should be constantly trying to detract from each other.",17
46,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,How does Melbourne come into this matter ?,17
47,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It came into it last night when no one could have failed to observe the unanimity of our Victorian friends in using the opportunity to embarrass the Government.  members on this side desire the College to be at Jervis Bay, and not in Melbourne.",17
48,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member displays much anxiety about the Federal Territory, since.it offers the only opportunity to prevent the College being established at Sydney.",17
49,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,We shall have hours of discussion if the honourable member for Wentworth goes on in this way.,17
50,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am trying to throw "" oil on the troubled waters."" Putting these small provincial jealousies of our Victorian friends, we are entitled to what the considerations were, other than strategical and naval, that weighed with the Prime Minister in fixing the site at Port Hacking, instead of, as he hinted Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Wai t until we have to deal with the establishment of worked a laboratory and Customs House at Williamstown.",17
51,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I hope . the honourable member for Lang will extend to. Victorian of votes that broad"" sympathy always displayed by the representatives of the Mother Mr KING O'MALLEY - Captai n Chambers says that this is one of the best sites",17
52,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is certainly the best site I ever saw, though I think there is a very good one in the ne'ghbourhood of It is obvious that the Naval College ought not to be in a place which might be isolated in time of trouble; and, immediate convenience requires its establishment, hot in, but within reach of, a populous centre. The College ought be instituted on a firm foundation at we the outset, and not as a mere temporary expedient. We must grapple the question with a view of the future, and the best way would be to pass the item. We should have the satisfaction of knowing that, _ so far as we can arrange it, the Australian naval unit is being given a good launch by the establishment of a place where the omcers may be efficiently trained.",17
53,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [2.57] - It must be admitted that Commonwealth industries and institutions of this kind ought to be located within Federal Territory; and I am unable to understand why the Government, without submitting reports to the House, should have selected a site near Sydney. As honourable members know, I have no bias against Sydney, Melbourne, or any other State capital. The fact that Sydney is obtaining some advantage ought not to cause any concern. The only question to be considered is whether it is the most suitable place. If we look to the United States for a precedent, we see that the West Point College, though in the State of New York, is situated very far from the capital of the State. Honourable members ought to have had the benefit of the reports of the experts who recommended this site to the Government. The appearance of the Estimates is the first intimation we have had of the project; and it is doubtful whether the House is in a position to give a vote on the matter at this stage. It may be well to remind honourable members that this is not the first occasion on which governments have departed from the healthy principle of establishing all such institutions on Federal territory. When the Small Arms Factory was established at Lithgow there was scarcely a word of protest, although that was an instance in which we ought to have insisted on its location being on Commonwealth territory. Then, close to Melbourne, a cordite factory has been established at Maribyrnong. As I have said, this Government are taking no new departure; but, seeing that the Capital site has now been definitely selected, which was not the case when these other works were established, we ought to be given reasons for the choice of a site for this College. It stands to reason that all such buildings placed on the Federal Territory add to the value of the land there. We get the increment of value; whereas, by establishing the College close to Svdnev, we are assisting to enlarge a city that is already too big-a n observation which applies to Melbourne and all the other Australian capitals.. I trust the Government will afford us more information, and to that end this vote could easily be postponed, so that the reports of the expert officers may be laid on the table.",18
54,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [3.0] It is not often that I find myself in disagreement with the honourable member for Wentworth, but so far as the item under discussion is concerned nry views are entirely at variance with those expressed by him. The Minister must be convinced that the feeling of the Committee is that great national institutions of this character ought to be established in national territory. We should follow the example of other countries. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has pointed out that the young naval officers of the United States are trained a long way from any large centre of population, whilst England's great naval training college is at Dartmouth, in Devonshire.  population.",18
55,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Entirely . One of the main arguments in support of the establishment of the Naval College at Port Hacking was, I understand, that such an establishment could be conducted far more cheaply in the vicinity of Sydney than at Jervis Bay. Such a contention, however, cannot Be seriously put forward. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The United States Naval College is at Annapolis, Maryland-the capital of the State.",18
56,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"But England, which has set an example to the world, has its great Naval College a long way from the metropolis. I am satisfied that in any event after the lapse of a few years the Naval College will be established in Federal territory; people will not consent to the naval cadets' of Australia being trained outside the national territory. The expenditure of a large sum in erecting a Naval College at or near Sydney will prove within a few years' time to have been a waste of money. The proper course to for pursue is to erect only temporary buildings until the territory in the vicinity of Jervis Bay is in a more advanced state of development. The erection of temporary buildings in the meantime would meet the situation, and eventually the College could be erected where it ought to be-in Federal territory on Jervis Bay.",18
57,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [3.3] - I can assure the honourable member for Wentworth that I cannot recollect having ever voted or spoken against the interests of Sydney. I have never gone to that city without anticipations of pleasure, nor have I left it without feelings of regret. Last night it was absolutely impossible to obtain information regarding this item, and one Minister so far forgot himself as to suggest, when he was being pressed for further details, that advantage was being taken of Cup night to create trouble. ",18
58,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am glad to hear it. Why have a national territory if we are not going to plant there everything pertaining to the central authority? There is not likely to be a large population at Jervis Bay, nor is a continual influx of visitors to that part of the territory probable. I always advise visitors to Sydney to go to Port Hacking, and those who know the place are well aware that there is a constant stream of visitors there, especially on Sundays. Another point to be remembered is that the Government have not told us how much they will have to pay to acquire private land there for this purpose. Is the land to be resumed upon the basis of the valuation for land and income tax assessment purposes?",19
59,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It will be compulsorily resumed if an agreement cannot be arrived at as to the price to be paid. It is, thereBay, fore, unwise to state at present what is the difference between the valuation on behalf of the proprietor of the land and that of the Government valuer.",19
60,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,If we cannot obtain the land at a fair price are we to resort to compulsory arbitration ?,19
61,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The law provides for that.,19
62,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I am aware of that. But can the Government say that they will take the land at its valuation for land and income tax purposes last year?,19
63,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That valuation would be evidence, but not absolute proof, of value.",19
64,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I fear that the Federal Government may become the milch cow.,19
65,Mr FISHER,Unknown,We do in cities what I have said practically every day.,19
66,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"That may be, but it is not good enough for me when we can obtain what land we require in our own territory.",19
67,Mr FISHER,Unknown,We can resume land even in the honourable member's own city.,19
68,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The law of aninent domain allows a nation to take anytning [ 8 ] -2 4 it pleases in the case of national necessity, but I do not know how the Government could resume land in Melbourne .in the basis of a land and income tax valuation, since there is no such tax in the State.",19
69,Mr FISHER,Unknown,We have the Federal land tax.,19
70,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The Minister of Home Affairs, who has great knowledge of the United States, will admit that West Point, although in the State of New York, is some distance from the City of New York, the population of which is not as large in comparison with that of the United States as a whole as is the population of Sydney when compared with that of Australia. The population of Sydney, I believe, is more than one-eighth of the population of the Commonwealth. Another point to be remembered is that the journey by road to West Point is not an easy one, and I do not think that the railway runs right up to the college. I have here a splendid picture of West Point, which was published in that magnificent report presented by my dear friend, the late Major General Hoad. Having read that report very carefully, and studied West Point as far as the limited means of our library will permit, I have come to the conclusion that the College should be established at Jervis in Federal territory. . Let us establish it there, and adopt the splendid system that is followed at West Point, students at which have to live on their salaries, and are not permitted to receive presents, even from wealthy relatives, if they have any. If we establish the Naval College at Port Hacking it will become another show place, and visitors to Sydney will say, "" Let us drive out to the College where the naval cadets are trained."" No one can deny that we shall have to pay more for the land there than we should have to pay for land at Jervis Bay, within the territory given to us by New South Wa'.es. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - We were always too generous.",19
71,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"My honourable friend will admit that he has never heard me speak against Sydney-in fact, I should be very pleased to settle there if I could take with me all the friends I have here. Let us hear no more of this petty nonsense in regard to rivalry between Melbourne and Sydney. Australians ought to be proud of both cities. I am doing all I can to wipe out the terms "" Melbournite"" and "" Sydneyite,"" and to substitute "" Australian."" There is no big population at this place; and no influx of visitors to it as there is to West Point from New York and New Jersey.",19
72,Mr WEST,Unknown,Does the honourable member wish to bury the students?,20
73,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"No , but I think that the College should be near Jervis Bay, because in the future the study of military tactics will be one of the keenest, ahd already the military nations of the world are devoting their best talent to the consider a- earth ? tion of questions of defence. I should not hesitate to endow with any amount of monej an adequate institution, upon the condition that it must be open to every individual, so that there shall not be built up a privileged class, such as is today injuring the naval and military fabric of Great Britain. I hope, too, that the Minister of Defence will declare that the uniform which is good enough to fight in shall be good enough for - ocial engagements. Personally I would insist that, whenever a member of our Defence Forces accepts an invitation, he should appear in the uniform in which he may have to fight. Such a regulation would do away with the ridiculous practice of spending ^TOO on dress and undress uniforms, the wearing of hats which provide no shelter from the sun or rain, and the like.",20
74,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,What have these remarks to do with the question before the Chair?,20
75,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I shall connect them by saying that if our naval academy is near a centre of population, pressure is more likely to be brought to bear in regard to the adoption of nobby uniforms, and gilt-spurred roosters are more likely to predominate, than if it is established at Jervis Bay. Near a big city it must become a show place. We know what happens at Queenscliff, especially in the summer time. It is all very well to say that no one will be admitted within the gates, but it is impossible to keep out visitors. Will the Minister of Home Affairs tell us approximately what the site at Port Hacking would cost, and what the Jervis Bay site would cost? Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [3.18] - I would point out to the Committee that West Point is purely a military college for the training of fighters on land. The Naval Academy is at Annapolis, in the State of Maryland, on a bay. One is for the training of land fighters, and the other for the training of fighters on the deep sea.",20
76,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"What is the difference ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - On e man fights while walking, and the other man fights while swimming. Treating the subject from the financial stand-point, I ask honourable members whether twenty years hence, when Sydney has a population of 2,000,000, land within 17 miles of it will not be much more valuable than it is now.  Mr KING O'MALLEY - The College is to cost about £75,000, and the land that we buy by the foot will tie saleable by the square inch twenty years hence.",20
77,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [3.20] - On e is dumbfounded by the Minister's earth hunger. He seems desirous of buying up Australia. When it was proposed to resume a certain area in New South Wales for the Federal Territory, there was an enormous outcry, but the Minister, in addition to the territory already acquired, is buying large areas in the State. He evidently wishes future generations to recognise his prescience regarding land values. Our object, however, should be, not to acquire land to be sold later at a profit, but to make the best use of the territory ceded to us. The areas outside the Territory held by the Commonwealth will become legion if we proceed as at present. I should have thought that this before all Governments would have been in favour of placing all Commonwealth buildings within the Federal Territory whenever that was possible.",20
78,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Would the honourable member put the Maribyrnong Cordite Factory there?,20
79,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"No . The honourable gentleman's military studies should have informed him that temperature and climate are primary considerations in the location of a cordite factory, and the climate of New South Wales would not be suitable at all times of the year. When it was proposed to connect the Federal Territory with the sea, honourable members were assured that that was desirable, for one reason, in order to give an opportunity for the training of our future navy. I am sorry that there should be any question of Melbourne or Sydney. No honourable member has suggested that the College should be placed at Melbourne or Westernport.",20
80,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Westernpor t would be an ideal location.,20
81,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"Yes , but notwithstanding its claims, there is a higher consideration, namely, the desirability of placing within the Federal Territory every Commonwealth establishment that can with safety and advantage be placed there. The Minister has not told us what he proposes to pay for the land, but he has endeavoured to inflame our cupidity by telling us that it will fetch an enormous sum at some future date. We do not want to re-sell this site.",20
82,Mr RILEY,Unknown,It is not proposed to resell it.,21
83,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"The Minister has told us that what we buy by the acre we shall be able to sell by the inch. I hope that there will be no re-sale. The College should be built at the most suitable place, and remain there. I agree With those who say that it should be established as soon as possible, and that could be done without waiting for the erection of costly buildings, by permitting the students to attend lectures at the Sydney University pending the getting ready of the College at Jervis Bay. To place the College and other Commonwealth buildings in Federal territory will foster the national sentiment. I hope that the Government, for the sake of economy and for what the Prime Minister calls general - utility, will adopt my suggestion, and, omitpolitical ting the item under discussion, will provide a smaller siim out of the ordinary Defence vote. If the present attitude of Ministers - is continued, many honourable members will support the motion of the honourable member for Moreton, because they cannot conscientiously agree to placing extra-murally, so to speak, of the Federal Capital area, these institutions, one and all of which should be placed within it, and be maintained there under proper supervision. I am not going to add to what has already been said with regard to the disturbing influences of a large and pleasure-seeking population, except that we do not want to place our young men who are going to do this very important work near distractions such as a large city undoubtedly affords.",21
84,Mr WEST,Unknown,Are they to have no pleasures? Would the honourable member put them away in the bush ?,21
85,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"-The honourable member seems to have a peculiar idea of what pleasure is. Some find pleasure in a crowd, others take much more pleasure in solitude. I would suggest to the honourable member that he might try the latter. It would be not only conducive to his own well-being, but would be a relief to a very large number of other honourable members in this Chamber.",21
86,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [3.26] - I wish to support the protest against putting the Naval College near Sydney. I do so mainly upon general principles, because where other things are equal-and I think they are fairly equal in this case-al l our big Federal institutions should be placed on Federal territory. I am given to understand that the official reports favour Jervis Bav as much as they favour the site now under consideration. We are therefore safe as regards efficiency, convenience, and suitability in putting the College in our own area. I fully endorse the arguments which have been used against the selection of a site near Sydney. I object to putting the cadets under the pernicious influences of a big city, as would be the case if they were taken to Sydney. The Minister's remark with regard to a profitable deal in land goes by the board, as it is not the Government's function to become landjobbers. Another consideration which appeals to me strongly is that it would be a very good thing for our defence system, and particularly the educative institutions connected with it, to be in touch with Parliament and politicians, not because I think that that will bring the military under control- a result which I should deprecate-bu t because it will lead to a better understanding between politicians and the Defence Forces. This may in future years help us to avoid those disasters which have befallen other nations when political influence in military and naval matters has become too strong. The plan I suggest would lead to politicians gaining a better understanding of the true relations between the army and the State. I have heard that there is a condition attached to the giving of the money from the Dreadnought fund to the Government, to. the effect that if the money is accepted the institution must be placed near Sydney. If so, I should not allow that consideration to influence me at all. It would be much better to forego the donation entirely, and maintain all our institutions in the place where they ought to be.",21
87,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [3.28] Like other honourable members who have spoken on this side, I am opposed to erecting any Federal buildings of this character outside of Federal territory. The Minister has given us no definite statement as to whether the authorities who selected the site now under consideration have also visited the Federal Capital and Jervis Bay. It is the duty of the Minister to give honourable members the fullest possible information regarding the report of the authorities on this matter. He should state whether they made a second choice, if any, and whether they visited and took into consideration the places I have named. Up to the present moment, as that information has not been given, I feel inclined to. support the motion, in order that we may have the College erected in the Federal City, and, if possible, every building for Federal purposes, should also be built there.",21
88,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [3.29] - The discussion has wandered somewhat from its original purpose. It concerned originally the best site at which to establish the Naval College, but the proposition now being debated is how best to develop Federal territory. If honourable members wish to use the naval and military defence votes for the purpose of developing Federal Territory, well and good; let them wipe out this site and start at Jervis Bay. That would be perfectly logical and legitimate from the point of view of the development of Federal territory. But I take it that our purpose now is to consider how best we can start the Australian naval unit of the Imperial Fleet. If the Committee take the College to Federal Territory, they will undoubtedly put off its initiation for a few years, which will be a bad thing for the Australian people.",22
89,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Why should it cause that delay ?,22
90,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the honourable member knew Jervis Bay, he would know that it would be necessary to build a vast number of roads before anything could be done there. According to the Minister's report, the officers of the Home Affairs Department found that all the roads in the Federal Capital area had been "" let down,"" and that it was necessary to spend about £14,500 in putting them into a decent state. If we intended to establish the College at Jervis Bay, it would be necessary to start first of all to build roads there, and then, when the Naval College was established, we should have to begin the construction of a railway line from Nowra. At present the line stops short at Nowra on the northern side of the Shoalhaven River, and we should have to build a 20mile railway to connect with Jervis Bay.",22
91,Mr RILEV,Unknown,"It is part of the plan to put a railway there. - Mr KELLY - That plan has not been accepted by this Parliament, which must consider it afterwards upon its merits. Parliament should not be tricked into endorsing it at this stage, by taking an advance vote on this question now. The whole question of whether or not we shall have railway communication between Jervis Bay and Sydney, and between Jervis Bay and the Federal Capital, will have to be discussed on its own merits when the proper time comes. I venture to predict that this Housewill be very loth to construct the line between Jervis Bay and the Federal Capital,, in view of the fact that no advantage will be conferred on the Federal area thereby. It would be of great advantage to the State of New South Wales if that line were constructed with Federal money, and, from a narrow point of view, I should be very happy to see it done; but I. think the chief anxiety of this Parliament, after starting; seriously to work to construct the Federal Capital itself, will be to limit, as far as possible, the total cost of the Federal Capital as a complete proposition. Railway construction will add to that cost, and this House, which represents the taxpayers of Australia as a whole, will, I am sure,, be very sorry to sanction the useless or avoidable expenditure of money on making; roads and railway lines that need not be constructed from a Federal point of view. That position will have to be considered later on; but why prejudge the matter now by deciding to establish the College at Jervis Bay, when the cost of roads, communications, and connexions will be mucb greater than the whole proposition put before the Committee in these Estimates?",22
92,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,What do we want with roads ? Why not have communication by water ?,22
93,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If we want comunication by water with. Jervis Bay, we shall' have to start immediately to construct wharfs and jetties, and also breakwaters for small boats. Jervis Bay is a vast stretch of water as big as Port Phillip, and the harbour sea kicked up in even an ordinary blow there makes a breakwater necessary for small craft. All this will add to the capital outlay.",22
94,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Thos e things will have to be built at Jervis Bay in any case.,22
95,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That question will arise when we decide what to do with Jervis Bay. The work will have to be done if we decide to have a Federal port there, but we have not yet so decided. We have simply arranged with New South Wales for the possession of the territory in case we want the port, but considerations of economy, and consideration of the fact that haulage from Jervis Bay to the Capital will be just as costly as from Sydney to the Capital, and that port facilities, owing to the absence of population there, will not be so good, will, I think, all operate against the construction of a Federal port at Jervis Bay in years to come. However, as a New South Welshman, I shall be very glad to see that port developed.",22
96,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The fact that we got that port was one of the factors that induced a number of honourable members to vote for Yass-Canberra.,23
97,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The question of the port had nothing whatever to do with the decision as between the Yass-Canberra and the Dalgety sites, because there was a port at each place. Undoubtedly Jervis Bay as a port is better than Twofold Bay, and that consideration might have weighed with honourable members. I ask honourable members, however, to consider that matter on its own merits. The question now before us is a naval one. If it was a question of how best to develop the Federal area, how - could the honourable member for Laanecoorie possibly advocate the construction of a cordite factory in Melbourne, while advocating the taking away of a work which has been given to Sydney from Sydney to Federal Territory at Jervis Bay? The thing is too transparent. We see this provincial bitterness, which all of us, I think, Tegret, springing up in the most unlikely - quarters. Even the honourable member for Laanecoorie, who knows and likes Sydney, is influenced by it to the extent of wanting to take this institution from even the bourhood of Sydney and to place it in the Federal area, not because he really cares about the development of the Federal area, but because he wants to see as much as possible done to prevent the Northern capital of Australia from getting anything in the way of the spending of public funds. I do not know that this proposition will benefit Sydney. I do not think it matters a brass button to Sydney whether the Naval College is placed at Jervis Bay or not. From the New South Wales point of view, if it is placed at Jervis Bay, the State will be benefited more than if it is placed at Sydney, because it will undoubtedly mean taking the first step towards the construction of a line from Nowra to Jervis Bay, and from Jervis Bay to the Federal Capital. That work will benefit New South Wales.",23
98,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member really think that we are afraid of benefiting New South Wales?,23
99,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have not had the privilege of knowing the honourable member sufficiently long to learn whether he comes within the category of those "" broad nationalists "" who have often excited the amusement of honourable members generally in this Chamber. I do not know that he does. I hope that he does not, but undoubtedly we do see signs of a desire to secure the spending of public money in this State, and to prevent it being spent in other States. Such a tendency is most lamentable. The honourable member for Batman should ruminate over the fact that the honourable member for Laanecoorie says it is absolutely essential that the Cordite Factory should be built in or near Melbourne, because, if you please, the climate of Melbourne is the only climate in Australia in which it is safe to manufacture cordite 1",23
100,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Nonsense ! Does the honourable member believe that ?,23
101,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It was said by the honourable member.,23
102,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,He said the climate of New South Wales was not suitable.,23
103,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Personally , I find Melbourne an excellent place, and do not see this bitterness reflected in the hearts of the Melbourne people. They are always most hospitable and generous in their treatment of those from other States, but we do find the influence I have mentioned in politicsan influence which is really initiated by the selfish interests of a section of the Melbourne press. That is what we are suffering from in this debate. If it is a good neighthing to have everything centred in the Federal area, what an absurdity it is to talk about the climate of Melbourne requiring the cordite factory to be situated in Melbourne 1 It might as well be urged that the relaxing climate of New South Wales is a dangerous one in which to bring up young men to serve in the Navy, because it might sap the vigour of their constitution. The idea is absurd, and we have heard enough to realise that this debate is based purely on provincial considerations. The suggestion that we should develop our Federal area by establishing this College there, is only a side wind by which it is hoped to prevent money being spent even in the vicini' y of Sydney. This expenditure cannot benefit Sydney one iota; and I believe that people who have private residences at Port Hacking will resent the establishment of the College there. However, the cost of construction at Port Hacking will be much less than at Jervis Bay, and the former is a much better situation from a naval point of view-a n opinion for which we have the authority of the advisers of the Government. It is not worth our while paying ,£40,000 for a second-class site; and in view of what we have heard from the Prime Minister, we should sink all our little provincialisms. If people desire to throw money at us let them do so by all means. To establish the College at Jervis Bay would be to commit ourselves to railway construction. This, no doubt, would be excellent for New South Wales; but 1 question whether the taxpayers of the Commonwealth would care to embark on such an enterprise.",23
104,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [3.42] - I am as desirous as most people to see our Federal Territory developed by the establishment of industries and of such institutions as that under discussion. There are, however, exceptions to every rule; and the Prime Minister, supported by the authority of his expert advisers, has, I think, made out a good case for the Port Hacking site on the grounds of utility and economy. These, of course, are the two chief factors that should guide us in determining the matter. There seems to be some objection to the site owing to the proposed gift of money to the Commonwealth. Our first consideration, however, is whether this is the most suitable site; and, in this, we ought to be guided by those who have had experience in defence matters of the kind. Under all the circumstances, I , for am prepared to take all the money people who may care to devote it to this particular purpose, if people, sufficiently patriotic, are to be found willing This, of course, as I have said, is subject to the fact that the site is the best one can be secured; and on that point we the assurance of the Prime Minister. It is necessary that the College should be established as early as possible, so that every accommodation may be provided for those who desire to enter the Australian Navy.. We shall have to wait a considerable time if the College is not constructed until it can be established in the Federal Territory. There must be railway comthat munication to the Territory before the lege could be of any utility.",24
105,Mr CARR,Unknown,The students could go to the being on Federal territory. university in the meanwhile.,24
106,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Eve n so, there must be considerable expenditure. Nothing could be done with a Naval College at Jervis Bay until wharfage accommodation had been provided in order to afford facilities for reaching the place; and we know at present that there are travelling facilities neither by land nor water, and no hope of any for years to come. Honourable members who imagine that this Parliament will be meeting on the Federal Territory in four or five years will be very much mistaken, for, I think, ten years is more like the lime that will be required for the necessary preparation. It is not proposed to send the students to the university for the reason that we have the best expert advice to the contrary.",24
107,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"The College will take several years to build. . Mr Charlton - If that be so, we can realise that it would take a good many years more before we could hope to construct a college in the Federal Territory. I should say that quite two or three years longer would be required if we decided against Port Hacking in favour of the Territory. My opinion is that the Government are doing the right thing under the circumstances. We all desire to build in the Federal area as much as possible, in order to attract population, and give the Federal City a status; but we must remember that in the past honourable members have not made much fuss about expenditure on Commonwealth undertakings outside that Territory in Victoria, New South Wales, and elsewhere. one, Mr MCWILLIAMS - Did the experts refrom commend this as the best site? .",24
108,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The Prime Minister has assured us that this site was recomto do so. mended on its merits.,24
109,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It was recommended as that the best site on the mainland. There was have another site, but not on the mainland.",24
110,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It is necessary, in my opinion, that the Naval College should be in close proximity to the water, so as to give facilities for training, and I think that this vote ought to be passed.",24
111,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.50] - It is quite clear that honourable members, are anxious the Naval College should be established Colwithout delay. The only question is as to the site; and doubtless there is a patriotic feeling in favour of the establishment I ask the Committee to negative the amendment of the honourable member for Moreton, and pass this £53,000. I promise that the question of the site shall come up again for consideration.",24
112,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin [3.51]. - The Committee ought, I think, to accept the offer made by the Prime Minister. There is no desire to embarrass the Government in the slightest degree; but we hope that this debate will be taken as an indication that, not only the Naval College, but other Commonwealth buildings of the kind, shall be erected on Federal territory. The Commonwealth buildings are being scattered all over New South Wales and Victoria; and wherever one is established in one State, it seems necessary to give an equivalent in the other. The statement of the honourable member for Hunter that this has been recommended as the best site should not go unchallenged. If the honourable member will read the report, he will find that the site regarded as the best is in the vicinity of Hobart; so that, if the Government rely entirely on the recommendations of their naval advisers, the College will not be established at Port Hacking. The Military College has already been established on our own land, and I repeat the hope that the Government will take this debate as a strong indication that all such Commonwealth work should be carried on there. Amendment negatived.",25
113,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [3.55]. - I should be glad if the Minister would explain the item "" Launch for trawler, £ 2 2 2 , "" and also give the Committee some information as to the benefit which the Commonwealth is deriving from the work of the trawler, upon which we have,spent something like £30,000.",25
114,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.56] - I shall deal with the general work of the trawler when we have before us the general Estimates covering the salaries of the Fisheries Department. Last year, a sum of £400 was voted for the purchase of a launch, and of that amount £ 1 7 8 was expended. Honourable members are now asked to revote the balance of £222. It was considered by the Director of Fisheries, and the captain of the trawler, that a launch was essential to enable the shallower waters, more especially around the islands, to be investigated. As honourable members are aware, the launch could be used where the trawler - could not possibly go. This proposal was first made some two years ago, and 'when I resumed office as Minister of Trade and Customs, I called for further reports on the subject. It was then arranged that the launch, if found not to be absolutely necessary to the work of the trawler, should be transferred to one of the other Departments. There is work for such a launchin the Naval Department, and even in connection with the Department of Trade and' Customs. If the trawler can carry on operations effectively without it, we shall devote this launch to other purposes.",25
115,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [3.59] - I should like the Minister of Trade and Customs to explain where the proposed vote of £12,726 towards the cost of new quarantine buildings in New South Wales is to be expended.",25
116,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.0] - The only quarantine buildings in New South Wales of which I know are those at North Head, and the animal quarantine station at Bradley's Head. The amount for which these Estimates provide is not sufficient to enable the whole of our quarantine stations to be placed in a proper state of repair. The States, anticipating that the quarantine services were to be transferred to the Commonwealth, did not keep the buildings thoroughly up-to-date, and, as a matter of fact, the quarantine station at Brisbane was done away with altogether, the buildings being converted into a leper station. On this year's Estimates, it was proposed by the Quarantine Department to provide for an expenditure of about £100,000 under this heading towards cost of construction and repair. The total cost would be about ,£250,000, but we decided that we should first of all ascertain exactly how we stood in relation to the matter. Believing it possible for us to learn something regarding the position of quarantine in other countries, and having regard also to the increasing size of steamers coming to our shores, which means increasing the accommodation. I took the matter to the Cabinet, and it was agreed that before we incurred so large an expenditure, we should inquire what other countries were doing. The Director of Quarantine, Dr Norris, was accordingly despatched to the United States and Europe to make inquiries. He will also visit one or two eastern countries, and, upon his return, will submit a comprehensive report on the result of his investigations. The item of £12,726 to which the honourable member has referred is merely to put the buildings in such a state of repair as they should be in before people are quarantined in them. This is one of the items that we watch very carefully; but as quarantine is in the nature of health insurance, it is most important that we should keep our quarantine buildings and grounds effective tor the purpose. I have not the details at hand, but I believe that the particular item under discussion is to provide for certain alterations which must be made to the buildings at North Head in order to make them habitable.",25
117,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [4.2] - 1 notice that all the items under the heading of ""Quarantine"" are ""towards cost"" of new quarantine buildings. Are we to understand that new quarantine stations are to be established in every case?",26
118,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Not - in all cases.,26
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Will the total cost amount to £250,000?",26
120,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.3] - Quarantin e to be of any value must be effective. VVe are unable to say at present what expenditure will be necessary to make our quarantine stations thoroughly effective, but, as I have already mentioned, inquiries are being made. Pending the receipt of the Director's report, we intend only to carry out works that are immediately necessary. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [4.4] - I should like to know whether it is proposed to establish an up-to-date quarantine station in North Queensland in the neighbourhood of Thursday Island?",26
121,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There is a station at Thursday Island. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Thurs day Island is the first port of call for vessels made. coming from, the east which are most likely to bring to Australia infectious diseases. It is, therefore, very necessary that we should have in the north of Queensland an up-to-date quarantine station, so that vessels arriving at the entrance to Australia from the east with cases of infectious diseases on board will not have the experience of the steam-ship Eastern, which was recently sent down to Sydney to be quarantined at tremendous cost to the owners, and also to shippers of cargo and passengers by that steamer. Will the Minister state where the sum of £1,200 towards the cost of new quarantine stations in Queensland is to be expended, and whether a new station will be erected with a view to provide for such a' contingency - as I have mentioned?",26
122,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.5] - I believe that Port Darwin is the first port of call for vessels coming to Australia from the East, but if the establishment of a quarantine station, further south instead of in the tropics would meet the requirements, I think it would be preferable to the spending of a large sum in establishing a quarantine station in the neighbourhood of Thursday Island. If we cari make effective the quarantine station already in existence there we shall do so, but if , in addition,, a new quarantine station is necessary, I think that it should be erected in a more temperate latitude than that of Thursday Island. We expect to receive the report of the Director in February or March next, and unless this item be' passed, it will be impossible for us to acquire a site should a new site be necessary at Brisbane, or between Brisbane and Rockhampton. We desire to have this money available if the report of the Director is favourable to the construction of another quarantine station.",26
123,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [4.8] In regard to the item of £500 towards the cost of a new quarantine station in Tasmania, I wish to ask the Minister what steps are being taken in the matter? Last year we had on the Estimates an item to provide for the purchase of a site at Triffitt's Point, but every one now recognises that the establishment of a quarantine station there would have been most undesirable. Land in the district is now being subdivided into building blocks. I think that the Department stayed itshand",26
124,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No ; inquiries are being; * Mr MCWILLIAMS - It is very essential that something should be done. Several good sites are available, and the establishment of a station should be proceeded' with without further delay. Hobart is the first port of call for vessels of the Shaw Savill Company, and for many othersteamers; yet there is no quarantine station there. Mr TUDOR.'-There is one at Barnes'' Bay.",26
125,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That has not been taken over by the Commonwealth. It is a most excellent site, and I regret that the advisers of the Government did not see their way clear to recommend that it should be taken over. I hope that the Government will establish a quarantine station in Tasmania without more delay;",26
126,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.9J - Las t year we expended £ 1 6 under this heading, that representing the cost of inquiries to ascertain the best available site for a quarantine station in Tasmania. I understand that Dr .Purdey, Chief Health Officer for Tasmania, and also, I believe, Quarantine Officer for the Commonwealth, is malting inquiries either independently or in conjunction with others, and that the selection has been narrowed down to three sites.",27
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,W h e r e are they?,27
128,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I cannot say from memory. When the honourable member put a question to me a fortnight ago in regard to the matter I made inquiries from the Acting Chief Officer of Quarantine, and was told that the selection had been narrowed down to three sites. He expects to have & report from Dr Purdey as to which is the best of these. The honourable member may rest assured that we are full y alive to the necessity for a quarantine station at - Hobart. I agree with the honourable member for Lang that it is undesirable to overcarry either passengers or cargo where that - can be avoided, but we do not want to - expend large sums of money upon the upkeep of quarantine stations when it may ; be possible at slight inconvenience to avoid .anything of the kind.",27
129,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [4.10] - At the beginning of the year, I wrote to the Minister of Home Affairs about the Fleming.ton rifle range, on the Sydney side of the Nepean electorate, and was informed that a contract had been let for repairs to it, .and later I received a letter saying that ;the work was being expedited. Since then I have been told that the range has been resumed for railway purposes. suggested that further provision for rifle practice could be made in the neighbourhood, as there are about six clubs to be .accommodated. I thought that something - could be done for the extension of the - range at Ryde, but my suggestion was unfavorably received, as was also another - suggestion relating to the Parramatta range. The Flemington range having 'been resumed by the New South Wales Railway Department, the Treasurer will have received money for it, and that money - might fairly be expended in purchasing a new site in the district. If further accommodation cannot be given at Parramatta or Ryde, a new site should be purchased. The departmental replies on the subject Jiave been very unsatisfactory, and I should like a definite answer from the Minister this afternoon. It is a hardship to members of the Granville, Clyde, and Technical College rifle clubs to have to pay fares to visit the Randwick range, frequently to find that the targets are in use by members of the regular Forces, they and the Randwick rifle club having the first call on the Randwick range. The members of the rifle clubs in the district to which I refer are beginning to think that the Government discourages rifle shooting.",27
130,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [4.15] - In quite a number of items provision is made for the construction of drill-halls, an expense which, no doubt, will grow, as in time every centre of population will demand a drill-hall. In view of the big expenditure which would be needed to meet these demands, I suggest that it would be better to do without drill-halls, and to disband the boys on wet nights, without counting it against them as a drill lost. I rose, however, to direct attention to a more important matter, namely, the need for providing facilities for drilling within reasonable distance of the places where the boys who have to be drilled live. I regret that the Department has been very slow to attend to a complaint which I made regarding the practice of requiring the lads from Morpeth, a fairly large town, with a considerable population surrounding it , to travel to East Maitland to be drilled, a distance of from 3 to 5 miles. I have protested against the arrangement on two occasions, but have not yet received a satisfactory reply. It is not fair to ask parents to pay the expense of railway fares in cases of this kind, and the boys cannot be expected to walk. Drills should be held close to where the boys live. The case to I have which I have referred should have been dealt with by this time; the Department ought not to need five or six weeks for its consideration.",27
131,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [4.18] - The honourable member for Hunter points out that the expenditure on drill-halls will greatly increase in the future, and at the same time suggests an increase to facilitate drilling.",27
132,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I suggest that the area officers should drill the hoys in the localities where they live.,27
133,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"1 understand the honourable gentleman to suggest the securing of sites for drill-halls, within a reasonable distance of the places where the boys live.",27
134,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,No .,27
135,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The general instruction to area omcers is to facilitate drilling in every way possible, meeting the convenience of the lads by paying the fullest regard to local conditions, which, of course, vary greatly. In the providing of drillhalls, local authorities have, in some cases, assisted the* Government, but, in other places, there has not been the same patriotism. I cannot undertake to suggest that on wet nights lads ""should be dismissed without there being a drill j because, during a wet year, the efficiency of a corps might, under such an arrangement, f all below the necessary standard, which those belonging to it would not like. The Minister will, however, do his.utmost to remove inconveniences. I shall suggest to him the advisability of getting the area officers to do a little more travelling, so that the lads who are being drilled will have to do less.",28
136,Mr MCWILUAMS,Unknown,So m e of the officers work well.,28
137,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am glad to hear it . I hope that that can be said of all of them. It requires exceptional tact to bring our new Defence scheme into smooth working; but when it is thoroughly understood, its individual, as well as collective, benefits will be generally recognised. T am unable to give the honourable member for Nepean the details for which he asks; but, whereas last year only £ 1 7 , 0 0 0 was expended on rifle ranges, this year nearly £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 will be spent. While there may be irritation in some localities, rifle shooting is receiving so much consideration from the Department, that I think generally the efforts will be appreciated. I shall put the remarks of the honourable member before the Minister, and hope to be able to furnish a reply tomorrow.",28
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Can give us information respecting the progress of the Lithgow Small Arms Factory ? Personally, I regret that it was not located in Federal Territory. Is it too late to reconsider the question of site?",28
139,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"We regard the whole of Australia as Federal Territory, and think that no one place can command the whole expenditure of the Commonwealth. Small Arms Factory is nearing completion, but there are circumstances regarding it which may demand the attention of the ,Attorney-General's Department; and, therefore, I suggest that honourable members should not press for detailed information.",28
140,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The request is a yery fair one. If the subject were not receiving the attention of the Attorney-General's Department, the Committee would be entitled to demand an explanation regarding the delay in the completion of the contract.",28
141,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [4.25] - I ask the Minister whether it is intended to provide accommodation for the men who will be employed in the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow ? It was announced in my electorate some time ago that land would be resumed, and cottages erected for their accommodation ; but there is no provision for that in the Estimates. If the factory starts within the next six months, it will be difficult to secure accommodation for those who will be employed there. Houses are not to be obtained in the district for the number of workmen that will be required there. A scheme was propounded some time ago for the acquisition of land and the building of workmen's dwellings on it area by the Government. I do not know whether that is the best thing to be done, but in any case the Government ought to be able, at this stage, to give the Committee some satisfaction in the matter. I am told that at present, on account of the strike, there are about ninety empty houses in Lithgow, but f u l ly 300 men will be employed at the Small Arms Factory, a largeproportion of whom I presume will be married. The moment the trouble at Lithgow is over the houses will all be filled again. Rents around the Small Arms Factory have gone up enormously, and a good many questions are being asked in Lithgow about this matter. The proposal that was put forward for the Government to build houses for workmen really prevented private people in the neighbourhood from speculating in the way of putting up new dwellings, and in that respect it has done a certain amount of injury, and has rather the Minister aggravated the evil. If the Small Arms. Factory is opened by the new year, as We all expect, the Government will be met with a serious difficulty, and I should like to know if any arrangement has been madeto overcome it. Three hundred workmen cannot be accommodated there under present conditions. The Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [4.28] - The point raised by the honourable member for Nepean is very important, and deserves the consideration of the Minister, especially in view of the steps which are being taken by private enterprise in Great Britain to properly house the employees in large industries, and cater for their amusement in their leisure hours. Garden cities are springing up in connection with large enterprises, and the Commonwealth Government should set a good example in Australia in connection with the treatment of their employees in these large factories. No doubt the Minister has been giving it consideration, and has ordered his Department to look into the question of the proper housing and catering for the welfare of the employees in Commonwealth factories. Better work is got out of a man if he is properly fed, housed, and looked after. This question is a big one, and Australia seems to be very far behind 'the times in regard to it.",28
142,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Tak e what has been done by Cadburys' for their work people. ' Mr KELLY - I could mention Cadburys' garden city, the Sunlight soap city, and others established in the country in England. When we begin to establish our Australian factories, we should work them on similar lines. I shall be quite satisfied if the Minister will promise to let us knowexactly what has been done by his Department in this matter. Perhaps the best tiling would be for him to lay the papers on the subject on the table. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Minister reamongst presenting the Minister of Defence will make a statement, because the matter is in his Department.",29
143,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The whote question of the construction of the factories would in the Home Affairs Department. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I shall be glad to let the honourable member see the papers.,29
144,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Will the honourable memfor ber lay them on the table of the Library? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes .,29
145,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Minister's promise is entirely satisfactory to me. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [4.31] - When a previous item was under consideration, nearly all the members representing Victorian constituencies were unanimous in regarding it from the "" broad national stand-point ""-as viewed through Victorian spectacles. I hope they will take the same broad national outlook with regard to the proposed votes for the penditure of large sums of money in conand nexion with the cordite and other factories at Maribyrnong. The Victorian members recently agreed, with wonderful unanimity, that institutions of that kind should within Federal Territory. I should like to test the depth of that national spirit, which always comes so much to the fore when any expenditure is proposed in New community. South Wales. Every Victorian representative objects on "" broad national grounds "" to all expenditure in New South Wales, especially anywhere in the vicinity of Sydney. I now expect a number of Victorian members to rise and insist on the Cordite Factory and Clothing Factory being placed in Federal Territory, and not at Maribyrnong. No less than £6,500 is set down towards the cost of the Clothing Factory, which, I take it, is to supply uniforms for the Naval and Military Forces. There is also a Harness Factory to be established at Clifton Hill, which is near Melbourne. Are any Victorian members going to move for the excision of these items, and to insist on all these industries being carried on in Federal Territory? There is to be a total expenditure in the neighbourhood of Maribyrnong alone of close on £30,000 for various Federal and national items. I shall resume my seat for the present, with a view of giving some, of the Victorian representatives an opportunity of expressing their opinions on the wisdom of having all these . works established in the Federal Capital area, and not in and around Melbourne. I shall expect the honourable member for Maribyrnong to be the first to move in that direction.",29
146,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [4.35] Instead of my being satisfied with the amount of money proposed to be expended be in Maribyrnong, the Minister of Home Affairs knows that I am very much dissatisfied that another item does not appear in the Estimates. There is one item here the repairing of a road which the military authorities have put into a state of disrepair, and, in fact, made almost impassable for the ordinary ratepayer.",29
147,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Look at the rates that they bring in.,29
148,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Government have bought land on either side of the road, and so have taken away the only rateable property from which the shire of Braybrook could obtain revenue to keep the road in a proper state of repair. The exGovernment put up the Cordite Factory, cut up the road by carrying the necessary materials there. In my electorate, and in the electorate of'the honourable member for Nepean, the Government ought to be declare these roads military roads, especially when they take away the rateable property, and the Defence Department should construct them free of cost to the  thing ought to be said about these items from the broad national point of view. It is most peculiar that the honourable member for Maribyrnong should have £55,000 on these Estimates for his electorate, and yet complain, with the audacity of a highwayman, that that is not enough. At the same time, I cannot get £ 5 0 spent in my electorate, which represents half of Queensland. The honourable member could have the £50,000, and I should be quite satisfied with the odd £5,000, without complaining about roads. Did the honourable member expect the Commonwealth Government to carry the material for the Cordite Factory by flying machines, so as not to interfere with the roads? If he wants those works constructed in Maribyrnong, he ought not to complain about the roads being used to carry the materials necessary. Does he want that part of his electorate wet-nursed or spoon-fed ? Where does the national spirit come in in his case?",29
149,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Is Beerburrum in your electorate ?  ister's electorate. I am reminded by the Minister of Trade and Customs that I get for my constituency the large vote of £410 towards the cost of a. new post-office. For cool cheek and audacity, the honourable member for Maribyrnong "" takes the bun."" The Government have spent £50,000 in a little corner of Melbourne, and yet the honourable member desires that we shall also make the roads, because the cost is heavy on the local council. Of course, I am glad that money is being expended in this particular direction, because it shows that the Minister of Defence means business. have been pressing on the Government, ever since I entered this Parliament, the necessity for manufacturing our own explosives; and, notwithstanding what I have said, I am gratified to see that a commencement is being made in this connection.",30
150,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [4.42] - It is no doubt desirable to establish our military works as early as possible, but that is not the attitude of some honourable members in connection with an equally important feature of our Defence Forces. When we were discussing our Naval College, we were told, '- Oh, the College is all right, but the location is all wrong "" ! Victorian members protested against the establishment of that College at Sydney, although the advisers of the Government had recommended the site; and the protest led to a definite promise by the Prime Minister that the question would come up for further consideration. I make no attack on the choice of Maribyrnong as a site for a cordite factory ; but I think that the Prime Minister should make a similar promise in regard to this and other works of the kind as he has just made in connection with the Naval College. This is not an ordinary vote like that for the extension of a post-office or the granting of telephonic or telegraphic facilities; it is for the establishment of a factory or factories for the service of the whole Australian people. If the development of the Federal Territory is so important that the Prime Minister was willing to withdraw from the Ministerial position, and assure the Committee that he would not proceed with the establishment of a military college near Sydney until we had had further opportunities of discussion, we are entitled to the same treatment in this and other cases. I am willing to vote the money, and to believe that Maribyrnong is the right place, and to further believe that Melbourne is the right place for harness and clothing factories- I am not in a position to judgebut if, in the case of the Naval College, we are to decide offhand, not against the claims of Sydney-for none have been made, so far as I know-bu t against the recommendations of the official advisers of the Government, we ought to take the same course in regard to all these works. The honourable member for Maranoa is as keen as myself in the desire that the Cordite Factory should be pressed to a speedy completion; and I have no doubt that he recognises that the same argument applies to this factory and to the clothing and harI ness factories, as to a college for naval training. It is deplorable that we should have this provincialism in a Chamber of this kind; but the best way to stop it is to show that it does not pay. I confidently hope that the Government will give ns identically the same assurance as was given m the case of the Naval College.",30
151,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Fawkner) [4.47] There is all the difference in the world between a cordite factory and a naval college.,30
152,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On e is in Melbourne, and the other is not!",30
153,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"The great difference is that, in the case of a manufactory, it must be near a supply of labour.",30
154,Mr KELLY,Unknown,In England they are manufacturing soap and chocolate in garden cities.,31
155,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Englan d is a different proposition from Australia. many years there will not be a sufficient supply of labour at either Yass-Canberra or Jervis Bay. I have no great objection to all these factories being in the Federal Capital eventually; but for a great many years they must be near a labour supply. All that has been suggested is that if the Naval College is established at Port Hacking, it should be of a temporary character.",31
156,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable member make the same suggestion in regard to the factories in Melbourne?,31
157,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I am not sure that cordite can be manufactured in a temporary building, but if I can, I should make the same suggestion. If we spend £ 7 5 > on a Naval College near Sydney, that will fix the College there for all time. I contemplate that, at some time, all these factories will be on Federal territory, for that is the general trend of opinion; but to establish an intricate factory, which requires a great supply of labour, in a bush capital, would be midsummer madness.",31
158,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Do not shearers come to the honourable member's station when he has sheep to shear?,31
159,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"That is a ludicrous suggestion. Th'e shearing, which is the manufacturing part of the pastoral industry, is carried on for only six weeks of the year by practically casual labour. No sensible man would ever suggest bringing sheep to Maribyrnong to be shorn, or even taking them to Port Hacking.",31
160,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [4-50]. - I am not .concerned about the manufacture of harness or clothing, but I think we are making a great mistake in establishing a cordite factory in a suburb of a large city. In spite of what the honourable member for Fawkner says, the same principle applies to the cordite factory as to the Naval College. We are establishing one of the most important works that the Federation could establish in the manufacture of our own explosives.  buildings for that purpose.",31
161,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The buildings should be permanently established in the Federal territory. I thought we had made a great mistake in seeking to establish a Federal Capital at this stage of our history, but Parliament, in its wisdom, or otherwise; has so decided; and we have taken over a territory stretching to one of the .best harbors in Australia. Although we have all this land, we are purchasing For in a suburb like Maribyrnong, at an enormous price, land on which to establish a factory. It would be better for the Federation, and infinitely better for the workpeople, if the factory were erected where more room and better conditions could be provided than are possible in a closely settled suburb of a city like this, especially when, at a great cost, we are attempting to establish a city of our own. I hope that the Prime Minister, as in the case of the Naval College, will promise another opportunity for the discussion of the location of all these factories. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Cordite Factory is very nearly finished. 0 0 0 Mr Fenton - Cordit e is being manufactured there today.",31
162,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Then we have made a very serious mistake. I understood that only the site had been purchased.,31
163,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"On the last Estimates, we voted £31,00 0 for this factory. Mr W c WILLIAMS - But a great deal of that went in the purchase of land, I understood.",31
164,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,It is a pity we are too late!,31
165,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is a pity that ""the broad, national spirit,"" which is beginning to dawn on this Parliament, was not manifested last year; because I am afraid this is only one more of the very serious blunders we have made in starting. I hope that in the future all such works will be established on Federal territory, instead of our adding to the population and business of the two large cities, which already, unfortunately for Australia, contain much too great a percentage of the population.",31
166,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fremantle) [4.54] - J hope that this Cordite Factory is only a start, for I should like to see other explosive factories erected at different parts, of the Commonwealth, so that, in time of trouble, the permanent staff might be distributed. This is a country of magnificentdistances, and it would be a national calamity if , in time of war, some parts of Australia were cut off from our ouly explosive factory. We ought to establish factories in other parts of Australia.",31
167,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"On e in the West, and one in Tasmania.",31
168,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,We ought also to have one in Queensland.,31
169,Mr CANN,Unknown,To supply explosives to the miners ?,32
170,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,To supply explosives to all parts of Australia. I think the time will come when we shall have explosive factories established in different parts of the Commonwealth. No harm can be done in establishing one in Victoria. ' Mr Riley - But we need not make it big enough to supply all Australia.,32
171,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"It could not do that. As to another suggestion which has been made, I think that our defence requirements will be sufficient to keep the factory going for some time, without widening the scope of its operations. I hope that we shall have buildings and machinery provided in Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales for the manufacture of explosives. I do not say that they should all be put into work, but they should be ready to meet an emergency.",32
172,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [4.57] - I desire to have an explanation in regard to the item of £ 4 , 7 0 0 to provide for the harness, saddlery, and leather accoutrements factory at Clifton Hill . If this proposed vote is to provide for additions to that factory, I must protest against it. The factory at Clifton Hill is only a temporary one, and any further development of the work should take place in the Federal Territory. There is also an item of £ 6 , 5 0 0 for "" clothing factory, Melbourne."" Again I protest against additions being made to other people's property. We have our own Territory, and should build there.",32
173,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The permanent harness and saddle factory is established at Clifton Hill , and the proposed vote is to put it into more effective and economic working order.",32
174,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I understand that it is to complete the purchase of the present factory.,32
175,Mr RILEY,Unknown,And what is the explanation in regard to the clothing factory ?,32
176,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,We are erecting the building now.,32
177,Mr RILEY,Unknown,This House was never consulted in regard to it . Mr KING O'MALLEY - Provisio n made for it in last year's Estimates.,32
178,Mr KELLY,Unknown,F o r a temporary building.,32
179,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,The building is could being constructed of galvanized iron.,32
180,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I should like to know where it is being established.,32
181,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,At South Melbourne?,32
182,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is a very temporary looking structure.,32
183,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"If it is only a temporary building I shall not object to the item, but I think that the permanent factory should be established in the Federal Territory.",32
184,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,We would not get any employees there.,32
185,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"We should be able to obtain them without much trouble, provided the conditions were satisfactory. I hope some explanation will be given in regard to the item relating to the clothing factory.",32
186,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"D a r w in Minister of Home Affairs) [4.59] - The clothing factory is being erected on land owned by the Defence Department at the rear of the Victoria Barracks, South Melbourne. It is being constructed of galvanized iron, which, when we shift to the Federal Capital, can be utilized for other purposes.",32
187,Mr RILEY,Unknown,That is all rightj it is only a temporary building.,32
188,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [5.0] - I thought the Minister was going to give us an explanation of the item relating to the Cordite Factory. Speaking subject to correction, I understand that the Government considered one of two alternatives, or, in other words, that they had to determine between the suitability of Sydney and Melbourne as a site for a cordite factory. If those two cities only be taken into account, I believe that Melbourne is the better site for the establishment of a cordite factory. It is a question of humidity; cordite can be. manufactured more advantageously in a drier than in a humid atmosphere.",32
189,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,Quite so.  would be a still better site.,32
190,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am glad to hear the honourable member for Laanecoorie say "" Quite so,"" since there is infinitely less humidity in the Federal area than there is in Melbourne. If we are to consider the development of the Federal area on the lines suggested by the honourable member for Laanecoorie and others, why should was we not establish the Cordite Factory where, by doing so,, we should not only be developing the Federal territory, but where cordite be manufactured more advantageously than in Melbourne? I am not going to lay down at present any hard and fast lines, but the Labour Government appear to be frightened of the difficulty of getting workmen to go out where work is to be done.",32
191,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,There would be difficulty.,33
192,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Non e at all. If private enterprise in a country like England can succeed in this direction, I fail to see why our gifted Minister should not act with equal success. I am not going to urge at this juncture that the Government should recede from what is being done at Maribyrnong. ",33
193,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Government have started to erect a factory there. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is virtually complete.  diture""?",33
194,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Exactly the query I was going to put. If the factory is virtually complefe, why is it necessary to spend another £29,000 upon it? I presume that the Minister was speaking in the language of his Department, where "" virtual completion "" is arrived at when the plans have been decided upon. This Labour Government, as soon as it found that the bulk of honourable members in the Chamber required it, gave a very easy assurance that the House would be allowed a further opportunity to decide the location of the Naval College. We ought to have identically the same assurance with regard to all these matters. If we do not, then I think Australia may take it that provincialism is triumphant in this Chamber-that certain honourable members from this State, acting without the knowledge of the people of Victoria, who, so far as I can gauge, are not provincial ists, but acting on the secret influence of a section of the Melbourne press, are trying to get money spent in the neighbourhood of this city, whilst at the same time they try to prevent money being spent where the advisers of this Government have-said that it should be expended.",33
195,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Is it the honourable member's tongue that causes that lump in his cheek?,33
196,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not think that the honourable member is an authority on the construction of the human frame, let alone on the observance of common decency in regard to the expenditure of public moneys. ""Broad Nationalists"" like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who, with his colleagues, was highly indignant at the spending of the funds of the Australian public where the Government's advisers adno vised that it should best be spent, now seek to ridicule us when we suggest the application of the same principle to votes relating to their own constituencies.",33
197,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I have not said a word.,33
198,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Because the honourable member has not a case which he, even with his effrontery, could submit to the Committee and claim that it should receive support. I hope that the Minister is going to make some explanation in this regard. I am not asking for any more than he was prepared to concede to the broad Nationalists of Melbourne. If the advice of the Government's expert advisers is to be subordinated to the views of narrow provincialists in this Chamber, let the principle apply all round. If provincial jealousy is to apply in respect of one item, let it apply in both cases, and when it is found that such a system will not pay, this will become in reality a National Parliament, and not the playground for provincial jealousies. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister, of Home Affairs) [5.6] - The sum of £29,000 is the total estimated cost of providing for the following:-Permanen t Battery: Officers' quarters, stables (120 horses), forage store, barn, sick bays, pharmacy, forge, wheelwright and collarmakers' shops,"" water and sewerage, gun parks, mobilization store, company offices, guard room, men's barracks, non-commissioned officers' (married) quarters, earthworks, and lighting. Militia Batteries : Orderly room, store, gun parks (two batteries), harness room, shelters for men, and fencing. I am sorry that this provincialism has entered into the consideration of a great issue. The Committee does not appear to recognise the necessity of scattering these establishments. I am just as much for the Federal Territory as is any living man, but if a great army concentrated and captured the Federal Territory, we should lose everything if we had all our establishments there. If the United States Government had had everything at Washington in 1814, when the British Army took the city, it would not have had a gun, or even a factory to manufacture any of its requirements.",33
199,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [5.9] - I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the item- "" Williamstown Temporary Gunnery and Torpedo School-Alteration s and Additions to Naval Depot, ,£2,000."" I fail to see why this item, like that relating to the proposed establishment of the Naval College at Port Hacking, should not also be reconsidered. A school of gunnery would fit in very nicely with the Naval College. I wish also to have some information regarding the item- "" MaribyrnongAccess to Defence Property-toward s cost, £500.""",33
200,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The total estimated cost is £ 2 , 0 0 0 . Mt. CANN - I have forwarded to the Department half-a-dozen letters from the Lithgow Municipal Council in regard to the upkeep of roads used in connection with the Small Arms Factory there, but have been informed, in reply, that the Government will pay nothing towards the upkeep of roads in New South Wales.",34
201,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Then why should they do so here?,34
202,Mr CANN,Unknown,"That is what I should like to know. If the Government are prepared to provide on these Estimates £500 towaids the cost of constructing a road leading to the Cordite Factory at Maribyrnong, they should be prepared to extend the same principle to other States. I ask for an explanation from the Minister, as a very grave principle is involved. Tf these payments are to be made in one case, they should be made in all, and the equivalent of rates should be paid to the local governing authority wherever there are military or naval properties to which roads of access have to be made or maintained. In this case £500 is proposed to be paid.",34
203,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"But we are committed to an expenditure of £3,000. Mr CANN, Yes, according to the footauthorities note.",34
204,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [5.12] - I should like to draw attention to the claims of my electorate. It cost the municipality £20,000 to woodblock the road in front of Victoria Barracks at Paddington, and in addition two streets with asphalt ways have been made. If £500 is spent in compensating a local authority in the electorate of Maribyrnong age done to a road in the conveyance of material to the Cordite Factory, the local authority in my electorate should be simition larly treated. I would also point out that something should be paid for the mainorable tenance of the roads serving the Victoria Barracks in Melbourne. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have a great deal of land at Maribyrnong, and the road in question became so terribly bad that we Federal Territory. agreed to give £500 for its repair, on dition that the shire would maintain it in future.",34
205,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [5.1.6] - I do not regard the Minister's reply as satisfactory. I think that the Commonwealth should make good any damage done to roads, and if a shire in the Maribyrnong electorate is to be paid £500 to repair the road serving the Cordite Factory, the municipality of Lithgow should be compensated for the damage done to its roads in carting material to the Small Arms Factory there.",34
206,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The same principle should apply all over Australia.,34
207,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes . When it can be proved that the Commonwealth is responsible for material damage to any road, it should pay the local authority for effecting the necessary repairs. The honourable member for Nepean has received no satisfactory reply to his request for consideration, yet in a Melbourne electorate, £500 is to be given to the road-making authority, committing the Commonwealth to a total expenditure of £3,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The £3,000 is to be spent on Commonwealth property, to provide a wharf on the Saltwater River, and a road to connect the powder magazine, and to improve the gradient of the road leading from the magazine to the public street.",34
208,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The footnote would make it appear that £3,000 is to be given to the shire. Although the explanation puts a different complexion on the matter, it does not get rid of my objection that the same treatment is not being meted out to all local in Australia. It is not fair to compel the Lithgow municipality to spend perhaps _£i,ooo or ,£2,000 in mending roads brought into disrepair by the carting of material to the Small Arms Factory, when a shire in the Maribyrnong electorate is given ,£500 to repair the damage done to paththe road over which material has been to be carted for the Cordite Factory. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Case s should be for the damtreated on their merits.",34
209,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The damage done in Lithgow has been admitted, and applicahas been made for compensation, but it has not been granted. Why is the honmember for Nepean treated differently from the honourable member for Maribyrnong? A little while ago, I said that I favoured the establishment of all Commonwealth works, so far as possible, in the Ministers say that conlabour cannot be obtained there, but I am certain that all the labour needed could be obtained if it were made known that it was required. I have never taken exception to a proposal on the ground that it would benefit any particular State, but Victorian representatives are so fond of asserting that no money should be spent in New South Wales except in the Federal Territory, that it is time that we pointed out the need for locating all Commonwealth works there, so far as that may be possible. The sum of £6,500 is put down for a clothing factory, which the Minister says will be temporary, but why spend money on a temporary establishment? It would be better to build a permanent establishment in the Federal Territory. I desire that the Federal Capital shall grow, and the only way to insure its growth is to bring as many persons as possible to live there. The honourable member for Maribyrnong gets no less than £29,627 for his electorate this year, including £500 for the road under discussion. Other honourable members should be similarly treated to prevent invidious comparisons. The electors will think that because they are far removed from the Seat of Government no notice is taken of their applications.",34
210,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [5.24] - The principle supported by the honourable member for Hunter is one whose adoption I have advocated for some time past. The Commonwealth might very well agree, as an act of grace, to meet its obligations for municipal services, just as private persons have to do. If this is not done, logrolling is likely to take place. A shire council might allow its roads to fall into disrepair, to compel the Commonwealth to spend money on them. My suggestion is that the Commonwealth should pay a fair charge, but no more, for municipal services. There should be a uniform basis. The Minister has not made it clear whether this road is on Commonwealth territory or within the municipality. I know he says that it is "" access to' defence property,"" but the access itself might belong to the Commonwealth or to the municipality. If it belongs to the Braybrook Council, not a penny piece should be expended upon it until all claims of a similar kind have been equitably met. There are roads in the electorate of Nepean, in the electorate of East Sydney, and in my own electorate which are heavily used by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth refuses to pay a penny in rates and taxes. We are not here to dole out public funds without responsibility, simply because one honourable member is a little cleverer behind the scenes than another.

214,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I understood from the Minister of Home Affairs that the £ 5 0 0 was for building a road which the Council would afterwards maintain. I presume, therefore, that it is the council's road. The claims of Nepean, East Sydney, Wentworth, and other electorates where roads may be proved to have been cut up, and in some cases almost destroyed, by Commonwealth use, will have to be taken into consideration if we are to spend money on this road. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They ought all to be treated on their merits.",35
215,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will the honourable member for Nepean say whether he has succeeded in getting the claims of his constituency considered on their merits? The honourable member has not, nor has the honourable member for East Sydney, nor any other honourable member except the fortunate representative of this Melbourne constituency. Either all electorates should be put on an equal basis, everybody being treated alike, or we should not pass this item. The honourable member for Nepean is in a peculiar difficulty owing to the roads about Liverpool, and especially at Lithgow, being cut to pieces by Commonwealth usage, and the Minister's reply ought to be made to him. He is the most aggrieved. I do not suggest that he should move at this stage to reduce the amount, because the Minister might yet meet him and the Committee, whose general feeling is that the principle now introduced should apply all round or not at all.",35

If the Minister will give me an assurance that he will my electorate in the same way as he has treated that of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I shall be satisfied. It is not a question merely the Lithgow municipality or the shire Braybrook, because throughout the Commaintenance monwealth, wherever these large Federal properties are situated, an assurance ought to be given that the same kind of treatment will be extended to the local authorities is being accorded in the district Maribyrnong. It is "" up to "" the Minister to give that assurance. I do not wish to move a reduction of the item, because think it ought to be voted to pay for upkeep of the road.

The Prime Minister is present, and I expect the vernment to give an assurance that consibyrnong treat deration will be given to every claim for compensation for damage done to roads by the Commonwealth. If not, there will be trouble' in connection with these matters in of different localities. A municipal council of has to levy rates from residents for the of its roads, and if the Commonwealth establishes a factory in a district, and damages the roads to the extent of £500, it is unfair to compel the poor as people of the district to pay additional of taxes to make good that damage.",36

The road is to be put in a state of repair, and then-the Braybrook Shire Council is to keep it in repair for the future. That being so, why all this fencing? Why not tell the truth about the matter? This road is not Commonwealth property, but public property; and the treatment that is good enough for the Braybrook Shire Council ought to be good enough for the Lithgow local authority. The road at Lithgow has been destroyed by the carting of heavy material, and turned into a perfect bog; but the Minister of Home Affairs, seeing that he is in a corner, gets up and says that each case will be treated on its merits. The honourable member for Nepean has questioned the Minister repeatedly on this point; and if the Commonwealth has destroyed the road at Lithgow, we, as reaThe sonable men, should see that it is put in the same state as that in which we found it.

It would appear from the statement made by the Minister that the Government are dedicating this road to the use of the public, and saying to the shire council, "" We will put it in good order'if you will in future keep it in good order.""' I am slightly sceptical regarding promises that are made as to a municipality keeping a roadway in good order for all time. Perhaps the Minister of Home Affairs will give have had two us some information.",39
267,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [5.56] conI appear to have been made the butt of asconsiderable criticism this afternoon, but I for take the remarks of honourable members in that truly national spirit with which I always receive their comments. I admit straight away that the expenditure in connection with the Cordite Factory site and land purchased for a horse depot goes on automatically without the intervention of It is a national work, and the National Governfor ment must carry it out. The complaint I made was that the very part of the road in respect of which I had desired that asinsistance should be given to the Braybrook are Council had not been provided for on these wheEstimates, notwithstanding that the Fedeand ral Government has cut up that roadway The property on each of this road, as well as the roadway itself, is owned by the Commonwealth.",39
268,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Then it is a public highway running between public property.,40
269,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"No ; it was part and parcel of the old Maribyrnong Estate, and was the approach to the homestead. It was practically a private roadway, from one end of which there was no outlet, since it was cut off by the Saltwater River.",40
270,Mr KELLY,Unknown,In that sense only it was private property.,40
271,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"No ; it was originally part of the Maribyrnong Estate; it was like a carriage-way running up to the old homestead. The State Government, however, having purchased land on the other side of. the Saltwater River, and having established a village settlement there, constructed a bridge across the stream, and offered to pay half the cost of making this road. The position now is that the Public Works Department of Victoria is contributing £500, whilst the Commonwealth is contributing a like amount for that purpose.",40
272,Mr GROOM,Unknown,And the roadway is to be open to public use?,40
273,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Yes ; but the Federal Government have power at any time to say that no one but those desiring to approach the Cordite Factory shall be allowed to use it.,40
274,Mr GROOM,Unknown,They could not justly impose such a restriction.,40
275,Mr FENTON,Unknown,They certainly would not.,40
276,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Who is to maintain the road?,40
277,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In consideration of a mere handful of the ratepayers of the shire of Braybrook being allowed to use this roadway, the shire council is prepared to keep the road in order after the Public Works Department of Victoria and the Commonwealth Government have constructed it.",40
278,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Will they accept all liability for negligence and so forth?,40
279,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I presume that they will. The shire engineer will act in conjunction with the State and Commonwealth Government engineers, and they should be able to make the road to our satisfaction. Another point to be remembered is that the Commonwealth Government, by purchasing land on the other side of this road, have deprived the local council of a revenue of at least £ 6 0 per annum, since, as honourable members are aware, municipal rates cannot be levied on Commonwealth property.",40
280,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Commonwealth should re-imburse the shire to that extent.,40
281,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes . I shall always be prepared to assist honourable members in securing the construction of military roads in their electorates. Certain roads should be declared military thoroughfares. Portion of the road under consideration has been badly cut up by the carting of heavy loads of machinery and the materials used in the erection of the Cordite Factory. Failure to make the roadway now would involve the Government in still further expense. Heavy loss was sustained during the winter months since, in respect of certain parts of the roadway, big loads had to be conveyed through a veritable quagmire, which meant the employment of double teams. The Commonwealth Government have not gone off their own property. To all intents and purposes, the property still belongs to them; but they have deprived the shire of Bravbrook of certain rateable values, and it is only fair that this road should be constructed. As the result of this expenditure, the cost of cartage to the factory will be reduced. The Saltwater River skirts the Cordite Factory as well as the Military Horse Grounds, and access to those grounds will be obtained both by water-way and by road. Hence we have a proposed vote of £3,000, which is likely to be used for the construction, amongst other things, of a wharf. Together with members of the State Parliament, I played some little part in an effort to have the river made navigable, and that work is now being carried out at the expense of the State Government. It will be very useful to the Commonwealth Government. We are asked really to spend a very small amount to put the roadway in order.",40
282,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [6.2] - The misunderstanding that has arisen has not been due to any fault of the Committee. We have had four distinct and mutually conflicting statements-the e from Ministers, and the other from the representative of the district-and I think that that made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong is really the first explicit statement we have had bearing on the situation. The principle still involved in this question could be settled immediately by the Prime Minister saying that he would take the whole question into his consideration, and would inform the House, on some future date, of the view taken by the Government regarding the desirableness of recompensing municipalities that are put to undue and exceptional charges in the maintenance of their roads as the result of particularly heavy Commonwealth traffic thereover. I do not think anything else need be said. As to the particular road under consideration, I think that the Minister will have to dedicate it to the public as soon as it is constructed. As a matter of common justice to the men who are being settled by the State Government upon land on the other side of the river, continuous and perpetual access to their property must be guaranteed them. But if we are going to construct a road which may, later on, according to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, be closed to the public",40
283,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I did not say that it would be closed up. I said that the Government would have the power to close it.,41
284,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the Government do not intend to exercise that power, they might as well dedicate the road at once to the public. That re-opens the whole principle to which such strong exception has been taken by the honourable member for Nepean, and the honourable member for Hunter. I do not think it is fair to ask the Prime Minister to make an immediate statement, but he should take the matter into his earnest consideration, because grave injustice is being done to certain municipalities which cannot afford the expense of repairing roads badly cut up by Commonwealth traffic.",41
285,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [6.5] - In reply to the statement made by the Prime Minister, I should like to explain that the construction of the railway does not enter into the matter of paying for damage done to the Lithgow roadways. The railway, to be of any use in this regard, should have been constructed before the factory was erected. The damage was done in connection with the cartage of the machinery as well as the materials used in the construction of the factory. The road will be used for other purposes whether the branch line of railway is, or is not, constructed.",41
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [6.6] - I think most of us are convinced that the Government have not given us full information in regard to this matter, and that to their failure must be attributed the trouble that has arisen. They do not seem to know exactly what the facts are, but it is only reasonable that the Committee, when asked to pass certain proposed votes, should be afforded full information in regard to them. VVe have been told by one Minister that the municipal council has something to do with this matter, while from another source we learn that it has nothing to do with it. Then, again, we have been told by the honourable member for Maribyrnong that the roadway is altogether within Government property.",41
287,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I said that it was completely within our own property.,41
288,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Is the roadway, when constructed, to be Commonwealth property, or are the public to have access over it? Notwithstanding the long discussion that has taken place, I am not yet satisfied as to the exact position. I do not think any one present knows the facts. The Minister of Defence is not a member of this House, but the Minister of Home Affairs, who ought to know all about these matters, has made a. statement at variance with that made by the Honorary Minister representing the Minister of Defence, who said that the road was outside the Government property.",41

I know that he would not wilfully do so, but it seemed to me, owing to the conflicting statements of the Minister of Home Affairs and the Honorary Minister, that something was being hidden which the Committee ought to know. I think that the honourable member for Maribyrnong has given the true version of the facts. This was a private roadway, and was sold to the Commonwealth",41

The Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond) [6.18] - I wish to draw the attention of the Honorary Minister to the fact that in nearly every case in the Victorian and New South Wales divisions the re-vote is greater, or almost as great, as the expenditure on rifle ranges during the past financial year, which is evidence of the great difficulty in getting the Department to spend the sums appropriated by Parliament. I do not know whether it is the experience of other honourable members, but my experience is that often after rifle clubs have been formed the members have to wait two years or more before they can fire a shot. I ask for an assurance that the Department will initiate more expeditious methods. I know that delays are frequently due to difficulties with the State Lands Departments, but more could be done to expedite works. 1 hope that next year the Department will be able to spend the money voted.

298,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [6.23]. - The sum of £ 5 is put down for new drill halls in Queensland. Is that all that is to be spent there during the coming year? In New South Wales an enormous sum is proposed. There seems to be.a forward movement in that State in regard to construction of the necessary drill-halls to meet the needs of the compulsory trainis ing system. That question is becoming more and more a matter of urgent policy in all the States, and I should like the Minister to outline the proposals of the Government with respect generally to the provision of drill-halls in the future. Many new drill centres in Queensland are coming under the Compulsory Training Act. Is it the intention of the Government to build halls, or to continue to negotiate with the municipalities and other bodies for the use of local halls?",42
299,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [6.25] - I frankly admit that I am not in a position to make a general statement regarding the future policy of the Government with regard to the provision of drill-halls, but the item to which the honourable member for Darling Downs has referred is for the sum of £ 5 towards the completion of worksi for which the money was voted on last year's Estimates. The policy, so far as drilling cadets in drill-halls is concerned, will be to look at the local requirements in each case. In some instances the local authorities have very generously assisted, whereas in other centres we have not been .able to secure halls in the same manner.  Minister give some information regarding the item of £556 for a rifle range at Roma ? Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [6.27] - The information is: ""Roma rifle range, £556 to completing work begun during the previous financial year.""",42
300,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [6.28]. - Hav e the Government gone any further in the negotiations for the transfer from the State of Queensland of lands necessary for the completion of the Toowoomba rifle range ? Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [6.29] - The amount asked for is: "" For the acquisition of land and extension of range, removal and' re-erection of ten targets, and provision of firing mounds up to 600 yards; also alterations to existing range.""",43
301,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [6.30] - There is an item of £13,608 for the Beerburrum manceuvre area. Theie is a manceuvre area at Liverpool, New South Wales, over which trouble has occurred for some time. Mr GROOM.'-The honourable member should not deal with the Beerburrum area, which is in Queensland.",43
302,Mr CANN,Unknown,I was. assured by the Minister of Home Affairs that no similar areas were being resumed anywhere else in the Commonwealth.,43
303,Mr GROOM,Unknown,This was done some time ago.,43
304,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.31 to J.45 p.m.,43
305,Mr CANN,Unknown,"- I can find no provision in these Estimates for the resumption of the Liverpool manceuvre area, and therefore this is the only item on which I can ask the Minister for an explanation. I have written officially on several occasions, and the Minister has definitely promised me three times that this long-standing grievance in my electorate would be settled. Yet no provision is made towards it, while an item of £13,608 is provided for a similar purpose in Queensland. The Minister has distinctly stated time after time that the Federal Government have no power to resume land in New South Wales for this very purpose. If so large a sum can be set apart to resume land for a manceuvre area in Queensland, the Minister's previous statements to me must be incorrect. The Liverpool manoeuvre area in New South Wales is tied up with the transferred properties, and I can get no satisfaction from either the State or the Federal Department. It is ""up to "" the Minister to do the straight thing to-night, and tell me exactly where the matter is hung up. The Government should say straight out what they intend to do. I am not against the manceuvre area being at Liverpool, because I think it is central for a large part of the population of New South Wales, but at present the owners of the private lands in the area are being squeezed between the Federal and the State Governments, and can get no satisfaction from either. This vote for Queensland proves that the letters I have received from the Department with regard to the Liverpool manceuvre area have been so much bluff. It is quite time that a definite statement was made, and bluffing discontinued, so that I may let my constituents know the true state of affairs. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [7.48] - We started negotiations, with the New South Wales Government over the Liverpool manceuvre area, and were working together very conciliatorily and harmoniously, until suddenly the New South Wales Government decided that they could not go on with it until certain things were fixed with regard to the transferred properties. The New South Wales Government were to resume the land in the area, and the Common? wealth Government were to pay them interest on the cost of resumption, and then the land was to be dedicated for military purposes. We have not got any further with the matter at present, but as the whole question of transferred properties has virtually been settled, or nearly settled, I think it will not be long now before it is brought up again for consideration.",43
306,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [7.50] - If the New South Wales Government and the Federal Government do not come to an understanding, will the Federal Government take, with regard to the Liverpool manceuvre area, the same steps that they are taking with regard to the Beerburrum manceuvre area ? I cannot understand why different methods of procedure should be adopted in different States. In Queensland, the Government resume the land direct for military purposes, which the Constitution gives them power to do, but in New South Wales they get the State Government to resume the land, and pay the State interest on the cost of resumption. What puzzles my constituents and myself is why that method of procedure should be followed in New South Wales, and not in Queensland. If the New South Wales Government will not resume the land; will the Minister state clearly what the Commonwealth Government intend to do? Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [7.52] - As Minister of Home Affairs, I am not in a position to state what the intention of the Government in that regard will be, because I simply carry out what the other Departments want done. This is purely a Defence matter, and not a Home Affairs matter, so that I shall ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to speak on it. If I am ordered to do a work, then I do it, but I cannot say myself what will be done. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Where is the Minister representing the Minister of Defence ?",43
307,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland) [7.54] - Can the Minister of Home Affairs give - any information about the provision of a new post office at Yarram ? The matter has been in hand for a considerable time, and I understood that an item of £2,000 was to appear on the Estimates. I do not see it, and do not know what has happened to it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hav e we got the site?",44
308,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The Department bought the site about three years ago. There is a miserably insanitary building on it now, and the necessity for a new building is admitted. Proposed vote agreed to. Divisions 6 and 6A (Postmaster-General), j Q \ , 300,000. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [7-57]--Divisio n 6A relates to a proposal to pay into a Trust Fund on account of special works connected with telegraphs and telephones the sum of £600,000, and the Prime Minister has already promised that a special Bill will be introduced to deal with this matter. He intimated his intention to make a statement to the Committee, and I would like to know when he proposes to do so. I would remind him that when the honourable member for Darling Downs suggested that a footnote should be inserted setting out that this money is to be appropriated by a special Act the right honourable gentleman stated in reply that he had no objection to the adoption of that course. The honourable member for Darling Downs further asked - whether a special schedule would be provided, and the Prime Minister answered that he would think over the matter. Will the head of the Government inform the Committee of the position of affairs at the present time, and state whether he intends to bring in a special Bill to deal with this appropriation ?",44
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [7.59] I do not think that the paying of so large a sum as £600,000 into a Trust Fund on account of special works connected with our telegraphs and telephones is a good precedent to establish. When the matter was previously discussed I took exception to the course which it is proposed to follow. Although it may be legal, I think that the paying of so large an amount into a Trust Fund to be expended on telegraphs and telephones just as the Treasurer chooses is stretching the Audit Act altogether too much. The only reason which I can see for the adoption of this course is a desire to get this money away from the control of Parliament so that the Government may do as they please with it. At the close of the financial year the ordinary votes will expire, but the proposed Trust Fund will be a continuing one. If it be a good thing to deal with £600,000 in this way, it is equally good to deal with other amounts in a similar way. For instance, the sum of £700,000 which we are asked to vote in connection with the extension of telephones and telegraphs might just as reasonably be paid into a Trust Fund. It is a travesty upon parliamentary government to place such a large sum as £600,000 to the credit of a Trust Fund for the purpose of special works on account of telegraphs and telephones. The same practice might just as well be adopted in respect of other items. Why is this £600,000 required ?",44
310,Mr FISHER,Unknown,To bring the Post Office up to date.,44
311,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why not supply the Committee with details?,44
312,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I will do so.,44
313,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why not deal with this expenditure in the same way as other expenditure is dealt with?,45
314,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Because we propose to extend it over more than one year.,45
315,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"If we allow the Treasurer to pay £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 into a Trust Fund for a special purpose, and to expend it as he chooses, it means that we shall take that amount away from the control of Parliament. The Government have no right to exercise a discretion as to what sum they will expend during the financial year. They have to ask Parliament for what they require, and they are in duty bound to expend the amount voted by Parliament unless good reason exists for their failure to do so. They cannot ask Parlialiament to vote money and afterwards spend it or not spend it, just as they may choose. It is proposed to vote a large sum of money which the Treasurer may or may not spend as he chooses. That was the old procedure under an autocratic form of Government, when Ministers could do as they liked ; but that has all passed away in the States, and there have to be Estimates setting out exactly what works are to be taken in hand. In my opinion, the Audit Act does not permit of the Treasurer putting £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 in this way into a Trust .Fund. We have already voted £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 , without a single word of explanation as to how it is to be spent.",45
316,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Would the right honourable member have any objection if the items were set forth in a Bill ?,45
317,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No , but there is no reason why this should be treated differently from any other vote. If we vote £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 to construct a building or for some other purpose, and only half is spent, the balance has to be re-voted; and I. do not see why there should be any distinction made by hiding the money away in a Trust Fund.",45
318,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [8.8] - I suggest to the Prime Minister that he should adopt the suggestion to create a fund by a special Bill . The general scheme of our finance, under the Constitution, is annual services, as shown by the references in sections 53 and 54, where such services are clearly contemplated. This £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 is not an annual appropriawhich tion, and, therefore, I think there arises a serious constitutional objection. Mr FISHER"" (Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.10] - I regret the remark of the right honourable meml.er ior Estimates. [8 NOVEMBER, 1911.] Estimates. 2353 Swan in reference to "" h i d in g "" away money in a Trust Fund, because, coming from an ex-Treasurer, it leads to misapprehension.",45
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There was nothing personal intended in the remark; I did not mean that it was done surreptitously.,45
320,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Hansar d is read by a number of people who are not so well acquainted with the forms of the House and the Audit Act as we are, and they do not know that such a thing as ' ' hiding ' 1 away money is not possible. Owing to my temporary absence from Melbourne, 1 was not able to get the schedule of expenditure printed and - circulated, but I have the schedule here, and will have the matter seen to.",45
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I hope it wil l deal with the £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 also.",45
322,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The details as to that sum are all set forth.,45
323,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"A sum of £ 4 2 , 3 0 0 , for instance, is set down for the construction' and extension of telephones lines, but there are no details given.",45
324,Mr FISHER,Unknown,A schedule of details might have been provided had any one desired. I can assure honourable members that (here is no desire or intention to hide anything.,45
325,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Does the schedule cover the whole of the expenditure?,45
326,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes . The reason we desire to have this £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 over a period longer than twelve months is that we discovered that a good deal of money is lost to the Commonwealth owing to the absence of continuity in work-that continuity is necessary to eccnomy and efficiency. This £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 is particularly required to bring the Post and Telegraph Service up to what may be called the standard. It may be possible during the financial year to exptnd the greater portion of the vote, though, on the other hand, we may not be able to spend more than 25 or 30 per cent.",45
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Then why ask for so large a sum?,45
328,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"F o r the very obvious reason that we desire the work to be continuous until the money is expended and the works completed. This is a difficulty we inherited, and did not create. The honourable member for Darling Downs knows that, when he was in office, the Government did not, during any financial year, expend all the money that was available, and some £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 was handed back to the States, while the Post Office was going behind in the matter of permanent works and efficient working. The present Government found a difficulty, even by means of large annual votes, in bringing the 'Department up to a reasonable standard; and the scheme now proposed presents itself as the most reasonable. I admit the force of the contention of the honourable member for Darling Downs, and, perhaps, it would be better to set out these works in a Bill. We should then not be in any way likely to come into conflict with the Senate, and we should secure continuity in the work. I feel sure that if the Opposition accept the principle they will not discuss the Bill itself. I did not pledge myself to deal with the matter in that way, but I said that I would look into it, and I am satis-fied that the finances will be protected by the adoption of this plan. Every detail of information will be given to the House, as far as I can do so. I have not been able to get the schedule put into print, but if I read the principal items honourable members will understand what is meant. NEW SOUTH WALES.

These are the works which we thought absolutely necessary to bring the Postmaster General's Department up to a state of efficiency; and we ask Parliament to appropriate £600,000, leaving it to the engineers, and those who are capable of advising the Ministry, as to the best way to proceed, to recommend when the money should be expended, and generally to accomplish what we are aiming at. It is, I think, the only practical plan which can be recommended to Parliament. That is the position of the Government; and, in accordance with my promise, I have no hesitation in stating that we shall bring down a Bill, framed on the lines set forth in this schedule, and empowering the Government to spread the expenditure of the money over a period of two or three years, perhaps over a period of two and a half years. At any rate, I think that it ought to be left to our experts to. say how the money can be most economically expended in the interests of the Commonwealth, and of the people generally.",46
332,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [8.22] I think that we can accept, with satisfaction, the Prime Minister's statement that he will bring down a special B i is one thing to which we would like to draw his attention. We all admit that, owing to certain financial difficulties and problems which we had to face, and also attempts which were made to assist the States, a sum of about £2,000,000 is required to put the postal, telegraph, and telephone services in proper order.",47

336,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The only object in looking back is to try to gain a lesson, in order to prevent the occurrence of mistakes in the future.  member wants to smother up his tracks.",47
337,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I would smother up the honourable member's tracks, but I am afraid that they are difficult to smother up. It requires, I repeat, an expenditure of about ,£2,000,000 to put the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services in proper order. I think that the Prime Minister is quite right, now that the money is available, in trying to make it available for the purpose of making the services efficient. I dare say that he has now received a report from the officers showing exactly wherein the services as a whole are deficient. The statement which he has just read to the Committee cannot possibly reflect the relative deficiencies in the different States. For instance, out of this sum of £600,000, New South Wales alone is to receive £266,000, or very nearly one half of it. I do not object to that State getting all the money which is necessary, but when we find that £28,400 represents Queensland's share of l l ; but there the £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0",47
338,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There is a sum of £71,000 on the Estimates for Queensland.",47
339,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am speaking of this particular vote, and will refer to the other presently. Relatively speaking, ,£28,400 cannot possibly be a fair proportion of the total sum for Queensland, when we bear in mind the deficiencies of its services. I do not know whether it has been improved during the last few months, but constantly telegraphic communication between Brisbane and Sydney has been stopped, at one time for two or three days, owing to the deficiencies of the lines between those two cities.",47
340,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Onl y because of storms.,47
341,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member is in error. Delays are often caused by congestion of business. I recently received a telegram bearing a stamp to the effect that it had been delayed by interruption of business. My object is only to show that these services in the northern State are not yet sufficiently supplied. Knowing as I do the capacity of the officers and their desire to push on with these undertakings, I am sure they will recommend necessary works, and I hope' that when we have before us the complete scheme in respect of the £700,000 we have voted, the ,£600,000 we are now voting, and the £700,000 to be voted next year, we shall find that the Queensland services were being fairly considered.  in regard to his own State.",47
342,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Like the honourable member, he believes, I trust, in being a good Australian and a good Queenslander. I wish to know whether, when this vote is agreed to, he will have prepared a short statement showing the whole work in details with respect to each State to be carried in connection with the total proposed expenditure of £2.000,000.",48
343,Mr FISHER,Unknown,This is linked up with the proposals for next year.,48
344,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I think that the Prime Ministei misunderstood a remark made by the right honourable member for Swan in regard to the question of Trust Funds. All that the right honourable member urged was that it was inadvisable to have moneys placed to the credit of a lot of Trust Funds unless those funds came from time to time under the review of the Parliament, so that we might know their character, the amount to their credit, and the manner in which they were being expended. As a matter of fact, the Auditor General's general statement gives a good deal of information with regard to such items, but we are apt to receive that stateto ment too late to enable us to take special action.",48
345,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Budget-papers also give the information.,48
346,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I dare say they do, but they do not come before the House in the direct way in which the right honourable member for Swan suggests the information should be put before us. We shall have later on, however, an opportunity to deal with the individual items.  listening to the remarks made by the Prime Minister regarding the proposed disbursement of this £600,000, I feel that, as a Queenslander, I cannot compliment him.",48
347,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Complimen t him as an Australian.  man, the honourable member should compliment him, because more than half of this £600,000 is to be expended in New South Wales. The Prime Minister enumerated the works to be carried out in Queensland, and the list is all very good in its way; but I wish the Committee to understand that because Queensland prior to Federation put her house in order by spending large sums in standardizing her telegraph and telephone lines, she has now to suffer. All that work was paid for out of loan moneys. The honourable member for Darling Downs tried to smother up the tracks regarding the expenditure of the £2,000,000 necessary to bring the Postmaster-General's Department up-to-date, but he knows very well-and I am just as guilty as he is, since I was a member of Parliament at the time, although not a member of any Adout ministration-that we starved our postal services in order to pay to the States £6,000,000 more than we were required under the Constitution to return to them. We find ourselves, consequently, up against a brick wall today. As I interjected while the Prime Minister was delivering his Budget statement, there has not been a single mile of developmental telephonic or telegraph lines erected in Queensland since Federation. Can it be said that Queensland has had a fair and square deal ?",48
348,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"What does the honourable member mean by developmental lines?  lines where none exist today-to the system adopted in pre-Federation days. I remember reading a speech made by the honourable member shortly after his first election Parliament, in which he said that telegraph lines should precede the railways, and so bring the outer settlements of Queensland into speedy communication with centres of population. I have made a similar protest year after year. Since Federation, the population of Queensland has increased by 100,000.",48
349,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Sh e has robbed us of Victorians.  If she cannot retain these people, then it is Queensland's gain and Victoria's loss. Some of the best men we have in Queensland to-rday, I am proud to say, are exVictorians. They have blazed the track for others to follow. Mr BRENNAN.""-Le t Queensland be careful that she does not follow our bad example.  much appreciated in Queensland today that it is impossible to sell land there. That is the secret of the whole business. Tn 1902, Queensland had a total revenue of £3,535,062, whereas today her total revenue is £6,251,694. We have doubled our revenue, and largely increased our population, our exports, and our imports. The State is going ahead by leaps and bounds; yet the Treasurer comes down with a proposal to spend there a miserable £28,000 on developmental works in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department. If a telephone or a telegraph line is desired in western Queensland today, local residents are called upon by the Department to pay half the cost, and to give a five or seven years' guarantee. It was not on the half-pay system that Queensland was made what she is today; she was developed by the progressive Governments that have gone before.",48
350,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"But has not this Government made a 25 per cent, reduction in charges ?  the case of my electorate. Here apparently is another favour for Victoria, which has not been extended to any of the other States. She has received a favour in regard to the maintenance of roads, and now she has another "" lift "" on the rest of the Commonwealth to the tune of 25 per cent. I received a letter today, in which the Department not only asked people who are living in the back-blocks of western Queensland to find the money for a telephone, but also to pay half the cost of the service. Penny postage, indeed! What does postage mean to people who are living in western Queensland? It means shilling postage I Tens of thousands of pounds have been spent on constructing conduits for telephones in the big cities. In Melbourne the Department ripped up the bowels of the streets to construct tunnels for the same purpose. But they have done nothing with the tunnels since. If only a portion of that money had been spent on services to make the lives of pioneers in the remote parts of this country more comfortable and easy, by giving them better communication with the outside world, I should have said that this Government had really undertaken a truly national work. We claimed that our Government was going to [85] be a Government of progress. We were going to show other parties what a Government could do. But what have we done? We have followed in the same tracks as previous Governments pursued. We have not done one whit better. I ask honourable members, in all seriousness, Is it fair to spend such enormous sums of money in and around the big cities, whilst leaving the outside districts languishing? For my own part, I think it is about time we took a leal out of the book of country members in the State Parliaments, and formed a country party. They know how to squeeze Governments to some tune. I cannot understand the Treasurer of the Commonwealth coming down with such a miserable sum for a State like Queensland, knowing what is required for developmental purposes there. What does the Treasurer intend to do with the £[28,000 ?",49
351,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"It is all to be spent on new lines.  Treasurer intends to spend the money in Brisbane. If he can show me that a single penny of it is going to be spent outside Brisbane, or on work that is not to connect directly with that city, I shall be very glad. That leads me to mention that I fought a battle for the Treasurer some years ago, when telephone communication was required between Brisbane and Gympie. I put up the fight of my life to get the condenser system between those two places. The departmental officials said that the work could not be done for less than £8,000. But there was a post-office official in Tasmania, Mr Hallam, who knew how to do what was required. I induced Mr Sydney Smith, who was then Postmaster-General, to let this gentleman go up to Queensland, and he did the work for about £250.",49
352,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"And afterwards some of us had great difficulty in securing even a slight recognition of the services he performed.  deal more than did many of the officers in the professional division. Yet the Public Service Inspector set up a barrier to prevent him from getting over it. However. I am glad to say that his merits have since been recognised, and that today he is an electrician in the professional division. I am getting tired of asking Governments year after year to do something more for the remote districts, not only in western Queensland, but also in western New South Wales. Whenever a telephone is asked for, guarantees are required. The Department does not ask people in the big cities to give guarantees. Here, however, letters are delivered three or four times a day, and if the letter-carrier happens to be a quarter of an hour late people telephone to the Superintendent of Mails to know what has become of him. In my electorate the Department is actually reducing mail services. In some parts the people have a mail only once a month, and are told that they are lucky to have any mail at all. Those who represent constituencies in the interior of this country know very well that the arrival and departure of the coach is a red-letter day in some small towns. Of course, some honourable members regard this kind of thing with a great amount of levity, but let me tell them that these are the people who are making this country better for future generations to live in. They are the pioneers who are blazing the track and increasing the prosperity of Australia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member is quite right, though what be says sounds like a tale of fifty years ago.  amongst these men I have to listen to complaints about lack of telephone services and mails. In one instance the Department wanted a guarantee of -,£2,000. I would not ask the people for it, because I knew very well what they would say to me if I did.",49
353,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Did the honourable member get the line?  people cannot live on promises out there any more than we can who live in Melbourne. If this Government does not intend to do something to relieve these backblockers, I am afraid I shall have to consider my position. I say, without fear of contradiction, that I got more out of other Governments than I can get out of this one. T cannot even get a small telephone or telegraph line. All I can get is the promise that the matter will be ""looked into."" Sometimes they are so long "" looking into "" a case that they do not even send me a reply. Will the Prime Minister, during nest recess, "" look into "" a few of these matters himself?",50
354,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I will go up and see.  gentleman would. The year before last, at election time, when I was in the remote parts of my constituency, after leaving Thargomindah and going towards the South Australian border, I took some news out with me. I brought the same news back, having heard nothing else in the meantime. I never felt so lonely in all my life. I did not even know what the Prime Minister had been saying, and it was essential that all members of our party should keep in touch with his utterances just then. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That accounts for the diversity of statements made by members of the party.  diversity of tales told by members of the Opposition party. At Chinchilla I actually had to answer the accusation of having said, "" To hell with the farmer I "" One of my constituents said to me, "" You are the man who said it . """,50
355,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair?  by the way, I having been drawn off the track by the honourable member for Lang. I wish to know whether the Prime Minister will, during the recess, and before this £600,000 is disbursed, look into the matter of short telephone lines, and put an end to the policy of harassing and pin-pricking. If the States followed a policy similar to that of the Commonwealth, no developmental work would have been done in northern Queensland; there would be no railways, telephones, and telegraphs extending out to distant places. Had the Stafe Government taken the view that a. work must pay from its inception, there would be no telegraph line to Ayrshire Downs, or out to the South Australian border, and Queensland would not have the longest mileage of railways in Australia. But since Federation, no telegraph or telephone lines have been erected, except in connection with railways. The Department could not avoid giving connection with places along railway lines, because of the business at the railway stations.",50
356,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Then about 1,000 miles of telegraph lines must have been erected in the State since Federation.  rate, the Department has paid only half the cost of telegraph lines on railways, the Railway Department paying the other half. In many instances, the places to which railways have been made were within telephone or telegraph communication before the railways were constructed. I ask the Treasurer to consider the claims of far western Queensland, so that the people there mav have some of the comforts which are so freely given to those in the big centres of population.",50
357,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.48] - We have had an excellent speech from the honourable member for Maranoa, and I do not complain because he has reminded me of the views which I expressed in 1893, and still hold. I think that the pioneers of Australian development should be given telephone, telegraph, and postal services, whether they pay or not, so long as they can be provided at a reasonable cost. I am not unacquainted with the western and northern portions of the continent, and do not think that there can be better expenditure than in the way the honourable member has suggested. But this Government cannot be charged with neglect in the matter, because, during our term of office, we have spent twice as much on these services as any of our predecessors, while the Estimates for this year are an increase of 50 per cent, on the expenditure of last year, and we propose a further increase of 30 per cent, next year. The sum of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 will be expended on developmental work in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department during two years, if the £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 now asked for is taken into account.

I do not know whether they were new developmental lines; but I promise the honourable member that if more developmental lines are needed, their erection will have'early attention from me. If I have the honour to remain in office long enough, I hope to ascertain for myself the conditions under which the people live everywhere in this continent, and to give full consideration to the manner in which telegraph, telephone, and postal facilities may be extended to them, and bettered. Nothing would give the Government greater pleasure than to provide all. necessary facilities, and we shall do it cheerfully.",51
363,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [8.53]. - I think that this is the sixth year in succession in which I have congratulated the honourable member for Maranoa on a speech similar to that which he has made to-night. The misfortune is that we seem unable to effect an improvement in the system. No more unfair, unjust, or unstatesman-like policy can be adopted than that of the Commonwealth in regard to telephone extensions. The £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 referred to is to be spent largely in the cities on the alteration of switch-boards, undergrounding of telephone wires, ancl other admittedly necessary works, but works not as urgent as the construction of new lines. The policy which our Postmaster-General has followed is cruelly unjust. Only today I received .1 letter from a handful of people who have gone out into the bush miles away from their fellows, and, having asked for telephone communication, have been told by the Department that they must guarantee it against loss, and provide the necessary poles. But, whereas within the cities one may telephone over a large area for i d . , the further one gets out into the back blocks, the heavier the charges become. The zone system is one of the most unfair that could be used. While we promise, f i o m every platform, and in this chamber, to do what we can to assist the pioneers who, as to. the honourable member for Maranoa has said, are building up the nation, and making it easier for others to follow them, nothing is done to give them the telephone facilities for which they ask. I was one of those who opposed penny postage. I consider that it was one of the greatest mistakes the Commonwealth could make to adopt that system before we had removed from people in the back-blocks the handicaps under which they labour in the matter of communication. We carry a letter from one end of Austialia to the other for a penny, but in connection with our telephonic service the further we go from the cities the heavier the charge becomes.",51
364,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The further one travels by train the more he has to pay.,52
365,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,This Parliament should not make the paying of a telephonic service the be-all ancl end-all of Government action in the inatter.,52
366,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Can the honourable member tell me of any country in the world in which cheaper and better facilities in the matter of telephone communication are given than in Australia?,52
367,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am speaking of the system already in operation in Australia, and of the facilities and low rates to the people of cities as compared with the way in which we handicap those who reside in the back-blocks of the continent. It is time that we did something more than bark about this matter session after session. We should take some definite action to secure the adoption of an entirely new system in connection with the extension of telephonic communication to the outlying districts. Where there is established a fairly wealthy community, and the prospect of a line paying, the Government erect lines at their own cost and risk, and if the district happens to be close to a large centre of population a very low telephone charge is made, but if a scattered community in the back-blocks ask for telephonic communication, a guarantee to cover any loss on the service is demanded before the Government will undertake the work.",52
368,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Would the honourable member establish telephonic communication whenever it is asked?,52
369,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Whereve r we bave a handful of people settled in any part of Australia who have no other means of communication, we should provide them with telephonic communication whether it pays or not.",52
370,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,To what extent?,52
371,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I should be prepared to accept a very large loss.,52
372,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The Government are prepared to accept 25 per cent, more of loss than any previous Government agreed to.",52
373,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Then , in that respect, the present Government are 25 per cent, better than their predecessors, but we desire that they should go another 7.5 per cent, better.",52
374,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What is the honourable member's limit; let him state it frankly?,52
375,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It is the business of the Government to fix the limit. So far we have had no reasonable policy at all in the matter of the extension of telephonic communication in the country districts. I contend that the zone system now in operation is one of the most cruel and unjust ever adopted.,52
376,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What does the honourable member mean by the zone system?,52
377,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We have a zone system by which the charge for the use of the telephone is in proportion to the distance from the capital cities.,52
378,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does the honourable member mean to say that we ought not to charge more for speaking from Hobart to Launcesgiven ton than for speaking over only half the distance ?,52
379,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Yes , I say so deliberately. There is no more reason why the charge should be more for the use of the telephone than there is for making the same charge for letters between Hobart and Launceston as for letters carried over only half the distance or for telegrams.",52
380,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable member would charge the same for the use of the telephone from Melbourne to Sydney as for its use between Melbourne and Essendon.,52
381,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We make the same charge in respect of telegraphic rates.,52
382,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,And the honourable member thinks that we should follow the same practice in connection with the telephone?,52
383,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I do. I know that it is beyond the Minister of External Affairs. He has not yet grasped what is aimed at. As Postmaster-General he followed, as the honourable member for Maranoa has said, in the footsteps of his predecessors, and no Government has so far dealt with the question of telephonic extension on proper lines. The Department is now losing by the enormous charges which are made for the use of the telephone over long-distance lines. It is cheaper in some instances to send a wire than it is to send a telephonic message between the same two places. We are throwing our telephonic service out of order, and making it a comparative luxury for those who, like most of our pioneers, have very little money to spend. I have no objection to the improvement of the telephone services in our large cities. Those who attempt to make use of them are agreed that there is room for great improvement, but I should prefer that they should remain as they are for the next three years, if the money required to make the necessary improvements in them were to be expended in the extension of telephonic facilities to places where there is no easy means of communication. Honourable members will agree that in some cases it may be a matter of life and death to have telephonic communication in order, perhaps, to summon a medical man. People in the large cities have letters delivered to them three or four times a day. They have their newspapers delivered in time for breakfast every morning, and can use the telephone at any time for a charge of one penny. But there are communities throughout Australia that are without any means of speedy communication. Instead of continually barking about the matter when the Estimates are under consideration, it is time that honourable members like the honourable member for Maranoa, myself, and. others, who feel strongly on the subject, started to bite.",52
384,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [9-4]- I should like the Prime Minister to seriously take into consideration the possibility of withdrawing the guarantee conditions in regard to many telephone lines. I have said before in this House that I can understand that a demand for a guarantee is justified in certain circumstances. Where a line is to be constructed into a district which is not capable of any great expansion, it seems to me a reasonable business proposition to ask those who will be served to subscribe so much to meet the capital expenditure.",53
385,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,A limit must be set somewhere.,53
386,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I have endeavoured to show that the limit should be set where a line is asked for in a. district in which is no possibility of extension, owing to the configuration of the country or for other reasons. If people in such a district ask for telephonic communication there is every reason why the Department should say, -"" We want you to subscribe so much of the initial capital cost, or guarantee us against loss for a term of years.""",53
387,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Thos e people might want a doctor just as much as other people.,53
388,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I do not say they would not, but there is a reason in that case why the Department should ask for a guarantee. The Department, however, are asking for a guarantee or a cash donation towards cost of construction in very different circumstances. A handful of people who go out to pioneer back country feel the need for telephone communication, and apply to the Department accordingly. To them every sixpence is of importance, and although the Department must see that in a few years additional population is sure to come to that district, there being any amount of room for development, and that a telephone line, if constructed, must eventually pay handsomely, they insist on those few pioneers putting up cash, or entering into a guarantee. That is utterly unjust and unbusiness-like. If private firms were constructing the telephone lines they would have quite enough foresight to recognise that they could stand a loss for a few years if for all time afterwards they were going to have a profitable enterprise.",53
389,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think the telephones are paying now in Australia?,53
390,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I do not say they are, but as Australia is opened up and developed the traffic on the lines is increasing, the revenue is growing, and they are paying more and more.",53
391,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,And more and more telephone lines are going up every year.,53
392,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That does not get away from my contention that in circumstances such as I have described the Department should bear the whole of the initial cost, because eventually they are going to have a property that will pay them handsomely. This Parliament can generally do very little to help the pioneers of Australia; but in the postal, telephonic, and telegraphic services it can do a good deal. I should like an assurance from the Prime Minister that he will look into the whole of this question, and do away with the guarantee conditions and cash contrithere butions, and let the Department be prepared for a few years to shoulder a small loss on lines in districts where there is bound to be an enormous amount of extension and development.",53
393,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"A small loss? We shoulder 25 per cent, of the loss to start with.",53
394,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That percentage is based on the Department's own estimate of the cost of construction, which in nearly every instance is very large, dr on the Department's own estimate of the revenue to be derived from the line, which very conservative.",53
395,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If that is so, the better for the people concerned, because the 75 per cent, which they would have to pay would be much less.",54
396,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The result of the syssiderable tem followed by the Department is to crease the estimated loss greatly.,54
397,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,That is all to the vantage of the persons who give the ister guarantee.,54
398,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It is exactly the oppothe site. The people concerned have to put up in some cases a cash guarantee for two years. That money is a considerable item to them,, as the honourable member for Gwydir knows, and they have to stand out of it for all that time. The Department are not treating the settlers as liberally they might. The Minister of External Affairs says that the Department have conbeing sented to bear 25 per cent, of the loss. VVe are thankful for small mercies, but that 25 per cent, is based on an estimate of 10 per cent, on the capital cost of conend struction. Ten per cent, on the is a very large proportion. It is usually considered in the commercial world enough tolerated that. to cover practically everything, and the Department, in cutting the interest down 7 per cent., have only done what they 1 should have done. I wanted to ask the Prime Minister particularly about the vote of £600,000 for special works. I gather from his remarks that he proposes to place honourable members. that sum in a Trust Fund under the very same items as appear in the schedule in relation to the present vote of £700,000. years ago. I noticed particularly that the items corresponded with the schedule word for word, Personally, I think there is a great deal what the Treasurer proposes tc do. At the same time, it is a clumsy way of overcomword to use. ing a difficulty, which I , and many other honourable members have recognised for quite a long time. Practically, the right honourable gentleman is seeking to put aside ever tolerated. this money for the purpose of allocating it to the identical items which appear in the Estimates. Then, when the amounts voted by Parliament lapse at the end of the finanFund. cial year, he will have in the Trust Fund a sum upon which he can draw, so as to insure the continuance of works which I say. would otherwise be stopped.",54

402,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Ha d the right honourable gentleman done so, he would, at the end of the financial year, have had a consum unexpended, and the works infor which that money was voted would necessarily have ceased until re-votes had been admade by Parliament. But the Prime Minhas split up the annual votes into two parts. One portion has been embodied in ordinary Estimates, and the other he proposes to place to the credit of a Trust Fund. The result will be that, when the financial year closes, he will have a sum of money upon which he can draw until such time as Parliament votes fresh expenditure for new works. I have previously pointed as out that the system of lapsed votes has resulted in many important public works hung up indefinitely. But I fail to see why it is not possible to devise a scheme under which moneys voted by Parliament for a specific purpose, which lapse at the of the financial year, can be expended! capital cost for that purpose.",54
403,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No British Parliament has,54
404,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Nevertheless , that is to exactly what the Prime Minister is attempting to do under this scheme.

408,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"B y this scheme, the right honourable gentleman is doing that which, he says, no British Parliament has",54

411,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Does not the honourable member want the Estimates passed ?,54
412,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes . I am tiot objecting to the amount which we are asked to vote, but to the method which it is proposed to adopt. However, I have no desire to labour the question. I merely draw attention to it because I tliink that the whole of our financial practice, .particularly in regard to public works, needs serious - consideration, with a view to its remodelling.",55
413,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [9.23]. - A great deal has been made by members of the Opposition of the proposal of the Government to pay £600,000 into a Trust Fund for the purpose of proceeding, during a period of two or three years, with , special works connected with the Postal Department. By innuendo, too, the soundness of this method of finance has been challenged. While such criticism may prove interesting to honourable members, its tendency is to create, in the minds of the public, an impression that the procedure which it is proposed to follow on this occasion is illegal. Such an impression is utterly unwarranted; and, consequently, die line of opposition which has been adopted by honourable members opposite is, to say the least of it, exceedingly objectionable. I think that the action of the Government marks a step in the right direction. As the £600,000 which it is proposed to expend upon special works connected with our telegraphs and telephones is to be placed to the credit of a Trust Fund, the Government will be in a position to insure a continuity of policy, with the result that, before many years have elapsed, this neglected Department will be brought into a state of efficiency. I am strongly in favour of this method of a Trust Fund, instituted by a Bill, a resolution, or a statement on the part of the Government. It is not unusual, at the end of the financial year, especially if times are dull, to find a sudden cessation of work; and this is very injurious to the community. The fact that the financial year closes on 30th June does not really matter today, but it has had serious consequences in the past when prosperous conditions did not prevail. It has meant the stoppage of public works in the winter time, when it should be the aim of the Government to even strain a point in order to insure employment. This is a point on which we have no certainty under our present system, so long as the financial year closes on 30th June. I do not know whether the Government can see their way to an innovation; but it is extremely likely that the inauguration of a Trust Fund system would obviate all such evils as I have indicated.",55
414,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think the remedy is to call Parliament together earlier.,55
415,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"That may be, but it altogether depends on what Government is in office. It is quite possible that a Government might not be anxious to meet Parliament; and we ought to be constitutionally placed in such a position as to insure continuity in public works. A Trust Fund seems to me to be a perfectly sound financial method, so long as Parliament is informed, through the Government or by an Auditor-General, how the money is expended. There seems to be a fear in some quarters to trust the Government in regard to this and other matters, but, personally, I do not see any danger. The Government will have to be very smart during the next eight months to spend the money we have voted during the last few days. The chances are overwhelmingly against Ministers in this respect; but, in any case, I think they are entitled to some trust, seeing that in about eight months' time we shall be called together again, and put in a position to challenge any expenditure not in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. I think that if a Trust Fund system had been in operation in the States, some of them would have been in a better position than they are today. I never could understand why, in years of prosperity, a Government should not be able to constitutionally appropriate money under some system of the kind for the purpose of providing, say, telegraphic and telephonic extensions. Once this sound principle is admitted, it will apply to all public works; and, so far from condemning the Government, I think they have shown great foresight, sagacity, and statesmanship. Of course, such a method may be irritating to old, pedantic statesmen, who have been brought up in a narrow groove; but it is a move in the right direction, which, I think, will be of benefit to the community generally. I notice that of the £600,000 something like £41,000 is intended for South Australia, though I dare say that if all the items voted in respect of that State were added, they would amount to a much more considerable sum. I desire to urge, however, that the complaints or representations of the honourable member for Maranoa in regard to Queensland apply with equal force to the back country of South Australia. The Government ought to be most liberal in interpreting the regulations, that the pioneers of the back country may have all possible advantages of civilization. Their lot is hard enough in all conscience; and the least they can expect is that every effort shall be made in their interests, though it may entail some sacrifice on those who reside in the centres of civilization.",55
416,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [9.33] - Re peated statements by honourable members who have taken on themselves the exclusive representation of the pioneers of Australia make it necessary for the representative a city electorate to put in a word of warnpioneers. ing with regard to the treatment proposed to be meted out to every man who goes into funny. the bush to make his living. I give way to no honourable member in my admiration funny. of the grit and enterprise of these pioneers; but if we are to have great public ments, they must be conducted on business lines. I think that I have seldom listened to a discussion which seemed to be less pregnated with business principles than present one. The honourable member for do Franklin has told us that every man who has gone into the back-blocks is entitled to a telephone by reason of that fact. we are to make special concessions to piocity neers, why not give them something which they can turn to practical use. instance, a man living a couple of hundred miles from the nearest telephonic installagovernment tion. It would cost the country a great deal more to connect him with the telephonic service than to give him an outfit agricultural machinery. I feel pretty tain that if we went round the and asked the pioneers which they wanted - telephoni c communication or free tools trade-the y would choose the latter.",56

430,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Most of this money will As a matbe spent in the cities.,56
431,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is probably true, it is the cities mainly which require these facilities. The persons who use telephonic facilities used to be indicted by my honourable friends as not being supporters of We were told in those days that persons who used telephones would have to pay for them; that telephonic communicathat tions would be made purely a matter of profit, and that the rates would be raised. That was, I think, the gospel as preached according to the late Postmaster-General. The fact remains that while it is proposed to increase facilities to the extent of £|6oo,ooo to these particular classes of the Australian community, facilities to the general user of the Post Office are being decreased. It is a common complaint throughout Australia that in order to economize, post-offices are being closed at a much earlier hour than was previously done, and that postal facilities generally, such as the clearance of letter-boxes, and so on, are being decreased. It is a curious anomaly to find through a Labour administration of this great Department, that while on the one hand, £160,000 is to be spent in New South Wales in providing the telephone subscriber with more facilities, and vast sums in other States, in constructing conduits, and placing wires underground, the unfortunate user of the pillar-box, or the unfortunate sender of letters is to be served infinitely worse, in the interests of economy, than he ever has been served, at any rate, since the Commonwealth took over the Department. That is, I think, a curious anomaly, and one which deserves the most serious consideration of the Government.",56
432,Mr WEST,Unknown,I think that it will work out all right. People will get used to it.,57

In the same way, persons who live near pillar-boxes, and use them, find that theii letters, instead of being delivered next morning within the metropolitan area are delivered late next afternoon. In fact, the extraordinary rapidity with which the Department, under Labour domination, transacts postal business in a metropolitan area is such that one could walk and get a reply or message much more quickly than he could do if he used the post.",57

439,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am sure that I am not. My honourable friend, who represents a metropolitan electorate, knows as well as I do what has happened during the last few months in regard to the times for clearing the post boxes and the time for closing post-offices in his electorate. He knows the truth of every word I am uttering.",57
440,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The pillar-boxes are cleared at the same time as they used to be.,57
441,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"In parts of my electorate the pillar-boxes are cleared a great deal earlier at night than they used to be, and also a great deal later in the morning. If what the honourable member for Maribyrnong says is correct, I want to know why my electorate has been singled out for special attention. It is resented in certain quarters, and is the subject of a complaint which is being investigated.",57
442,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The pillar-boxes are cleared at 10 o'clock, instead of at a quarter past 12.",57
443,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is a very considerable difference, and it affects the transmission of the letters. When we are aslced to grant facilities to telephone subscribers, who used to be the butt of the democratic zeal of my honourable friends opposite, it is about time, I think, that we considered the general postal facilities enjoyed by the people as a whole. I do hope that when the question of facilities is taken into account in connection with the back-blocks we shall deal a little more generously with the people there than we do with those who live in congested areas, where the service The can be handled more easily. We ought to be very careful not to give way to the electioneering zeal of some of my honourable",57
444,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I think that that is distinctly out of order.,57
445,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,He is referring to the honourable member's statements regarding country telephones.,57
446,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I thought that I might not be flattering my honourable friends if I imagined they were basing their arguments upon reason. I gather that there is something behind the proposition that we are putting to the Committee, and I hope that the Postmaster-General, who is charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the public purse, will see, if we are to make vast inroads upon the Treasury in the interests of the pioneer, that we give him something that is of more use to him than are the telephones which are now being clamoured for.  give him anything far more valuable.",57
447,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have heard a lot about the use of the telephone to the back blocks subscriber; but if , say, the farmers in the electorate of Indi, could be sure of a handsome grant towards the purchase of agricultural machinery, or of a telephone - o n the chance of their wanting a doctor at some time or other- which do honourable members think they would take? Every man takes an optimistic view of life, and imagines that he will never have to send for a doctor; .all have the business instinct of geting their tools of trade as cheaply as possible. Let us be reasonable. If honourable members do wish to make a plea for the country user, let them, make a plea for cheapening his agricultural machinery.  combines are responsible for the high prices they have to pay for their agricultural machinery.",58

449,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Kee p to the telephones.,58
450,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The subject of agricultural machinery is a very bitter pill for some of my stalwart friends opposite. A lot of thera would try to persuade their farming constituents that the prices they have to pay for machinery are not due to anything for which this Parliament is responsible.,58
451,Mr WEST,Unknown,The first question I was asked in a farming district last Saturday was the name of the winner of the Derby.,58
452,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I can see in that a very excellent reason for a public telephone for these pioneers. We might help them in a thousand different ways; but the Postmaster-General, who, after all, has to bear the responsibility for what is done, will see thai; what is done is on business lines, not made merely an opportunity for honourable members to gain popularity outside without due consideration to the requirements of the public purse.

455,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.49] - Undoubt edly the printing of stamps, as well as of Australian notes, will be done at the Federal Capital, when that is established ; but, in the meantime, I think it is better that the work should be done at the Seat of Government for the time being.",58

462,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [9.50] - Be fore we adjourned for dinner, I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to explain why the money voted last year in respect of grants to rifle clubs for ranges was not expended, and whether he would take steps to see that the money voted under that heading in respect of the present financial year is expended as rapidlv as possible? Last year we voted £3,000and is in respect of New South Wales, and the actual amount expended was only £ 1 , 6 6 0 . The amount to be voted this year is not as large, but the clubs have had the greatest difficulty in inducing the Department toexpend the money which Parliament has £5,150. voted. I should like to receive from theHonorary Minister an assurance that the Government will endeavour during the present financial year to expend the money .that Parliament votes for these purposes.",58
463,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [9.51] - I remember that the honourable member asked for certain information, but the discussion proceeded, and I - was prevented in the circumstances from replying to him. Had he been in the chamber a little earlier, he would have known that I gave information in reply to a similar question, put by the honourable member for Nepean, the honourable member for Hunter, .and one or two others, respecting grants to rifle clubs, and money to be expended for the purpose of areas for rifle clubs and rso forth. So far as the expenditure is concerned, the honourable member will gather from his experience to-night, at all events, that one reason why all the money voted is not expended within the financial year, is that honourable members, undoubtedly in the full exercise of their rights, delay the (passage of the Estimates so long that a large part of the financial year is over before the Government can proceed to carry - out the works. I can promise him, how-ever, that every effort will be put forward during the ensuing few months to expend - every penny that has been voted for these purposes. The sincerity of the Government in respect of rifle ranges has been :Shown by the fact that they are proposing to expend in this direction something like £70,000 as against £17,000 spent during last financial year. Their intention is that - every facility shall be given to rifle clubs to secure efficiency.",59
464,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.54]--Divisio n No. 10, under which the Committee is asked to vote £468,700 in respect of special defence material, is designed to carry out a matter of policy. In the first place we ask for £300,000 for warlike stores, - including field and machine guns, vehicles, harness and saddlery, arms, accoutrements, and other regimental and personal equipment, including ammunition. This equipment is required to place the forces in such a state that they could take the field fully armed ancl equipped with warlike and medical stores, tools, vehicles, &c. At present many articles of equipment are deficient. This amount is complementary to the £200,000 voted in 1910-n. Then again the division includes a proposed vote of £[20,000 for the supply of cloth for uniforms required by troops on -.the commencement of adult universal training, the money to be paid into a trust fund-the Military Clothing Material Account. We ask also for £5,000 in respect of a reserve of warlike stores, to provide reserve parts for existing field batteries for war. There is no arsenal here, and the distance from England, ancl the time therefore occupied, renders necessary the provision of "" spares."" With regard to item 4, £45,000, the purpose is to provide annually four batteries of the Field Artillery complete with guns, vehicles, harness, equipment, &c. The intention is to work up to the Kitchener scheme.",59
465,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Why do the Estimates say ' towards cost "" ? 1",59
466,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The expenditure is not final. An amount will have to be voted next year towards the completion of the Kitchener scheme.,59
467,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Do these votes represent - the whole cost for this year's work?,59
468,Mr FISHER,Unknown,This vote is not a contingent vote. It is the total amount to be spent this year to provide for the equipment of the troops.,59
469,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The money will give us four batteries this year?,59
470,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes . We' may have to provide some ammunition and other things later on; but not to any material amount. The item of £2,000, which stands next on the list, is "" towards providing apparatus for wireless telegraphy in the field."" I need not remind honourable members that wireless is now in use in nearly all Continental armies, and there is no reason why Australian troops should not experiment with it. There cannot be any doubt that wireless telegraphy will be an important feature in future warfare. The sixth item, £65,000, is to provide rifles for the Senior Cadets. I am sure that no honourable member will take objection to that. The seventh item, £31,700, is for a reserve of gun ammunition. The amount provided represents half the cost of providing increased equipment of ammunition for the fixed defence and Field Artillery armaments. I have scanned the whole of these items with the Minister of Defence; and, while much more was asked for, he admits that this expenditure will bring our Forces up to a state of efficiency.",59
471,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [9.58]. - This matter, of Defence expenditure will be discussed next week in connection with the Budget. But, meanwhile, the attention of honourable members ought to be drawn to the way in which our expendismashed ture in this direction is increasing. We have just voted, roughly speaking, to buy a couple. £500,000.",59
472,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Defence vote is £3,000,000.",60
473,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The expenditure hands. on ammunition and stores amounts to nearly £500,000; and it is just as well that atman tention should be drawn to the rapid inby crease of our Defence expenditure. I know that it is unpopular to say so; but I satisfied that, in the immediate future, the House will have to consider seriously enormous expenditure to which Australia is being committed in this direction. urge the Committee, and the Government, to consider the subject very seriously, to watch carefully the manner in which been made. our military advisers are leading us into an enormous outlay.",60
474,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [10.0] - I should like to know whether the expenditure £65,000 on rifles for Senior Cadets will be spent on rifles manufactured at the Federal factory, or whether the weapons are to be obtained from abroad?",60
475,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minmob ister and Treasurer) [10.1] - I regret being unable to give the honourable member a finite answer; but I believe that the rifles are required immediately for the equipment of the Cadets. It is the policy of the Government, and the determination of Minister of Defence, to have as many of our rifles manufactured at Lithgow as posber sible.",60
476,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [10.2] There is. one omission from this schedule. No provision is made for material for an aviation scheme. I observe that Division 11 provides a sum of £4,000 "" towards the establishment of an aviation corps."" presume, however, that that is for persix sonnel.",60
477,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think that it is intended to make some experiments.,60
478,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It will be difficult our men to make experiments in flying unless they have machines to fly with. It will probably be advisable to purchase a macloth chine if any of our Forces are to be trained as aviators.,60
479,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Migh t it not be possible to hire machines and work with them in the meantime ?,60
480,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I believe that it would almost impossible to hire machines. Exfacturers. perience of persons who use hired machines leads one to suppose that they would be up very quickly. Certainly it will be more costly to hire flying machines than,60

482,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, a who is learning aviation first practices going across country. It is comparatively easy for a man to learn to fly. The diffiam culty occurs when men are taught to observe what is visible to them while they are the flying. An aviation scheme requires at least a couple of machines, and I think the I Treasurer should consider the advisableness of buying them at once. I cannot and understand why provision has not already With regard to the general vote for defence material, I wish to congratulate the Government upon the steps that have been taken to of make our Defence Forces mobile in the field. It is all very well to complain about this kind of expenditure, but I may remind honourable members that an army, to be efficient, must be something more than a of men. It must be intelligently led, capable of being led to the scene of action, deand capable of being supplied when once it reaches the field of action. In order that these three objects may be obtained, we must have efficient material, with provision the for transport on an adequate scale.",60
483,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Has the honourable memany idea of the taxation per head for defence purposes in the' Commonwealth as compared with other countries?,60
484,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not want to go into that matter now, but I am delighted to see that the Government are doing something to equip our troops for effective service. A I few years ago it would probably have taken months to put a brigade into the field. That is not the kind of thing we want if we are to have a Defence Force at all. I am, therefore, glad that the Government are for taking the necessary steps.",60
485,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [10.4] With reference to the item of £[20,000 for for uniforms, I should like to know whether that material is to be manufactured, in the Commonwealth or imported?",60
486,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.5] - I should not like to commit myself definitely, but I think, be that orders have been given to local manuI believe, however, that theycannot be fully supplied.

488,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [10.6] There is an item of ,£1,200 under division 11 for a special railway siding for the manceuvre area at Tammin, Western Australia. The Government is creating what may prove a dangerous precedent if , after paying the States all railway charges, it goes to the expense of providing sidings.",61
489,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.7] - I wish to know whether the item for replacing condemned ammunition-£10,000-is to make good defective supplies?",61
490,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No ; it is to replace cordite which has deteriorated in the hot parts of Australia.,61
491,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,An amount is set down to provide apparatus for testing ammunition. I urge the Government to give consideration to the advisability of establishing a testing station in Australia for all imported powder.,61
492,Mr FISHER,Unknown,To provide an Australian test?,61
493,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes . That is an important matter of which we should not lose sight. Great quantities of explosives are used in connection with mining, and in gassy mines it is essential that the explosives are such as will not give off fire. A company was formed some time ago to manufacture mining explosives in Australia, but it found that it could not sell its goods because they were not on the permissive list. When inquiry was made as to how their explosives could be put on the permissive list, it was found that samples would have to be sent to the Old Country to be tested. There the testing of explosives is under the control of a Board. If an Australian manufacturer sends explosives to the Old Country to be tested, he runs the risk of having them deteriorate on the voyage. On the other hand, imported explosives which have been tested in the Old Country may deteriorate on the voyage out, and there is also the danger that they may not have been tested. The tests at Home may be made periodically, and defective explosives may thus be sent out here. Seeing that human life is at stake, the Commonwealth should establish a testing station to prevent the use of any but safe explosives.",61
494,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Gun s should tested, too.",61
495,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes , but that is another matter. I am assured that it would not cost more than £2,000 to fully equip a testing station.",61
496,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The honourable member for Newcastle brought the matter forward six or seven years ago.,61
497,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Then it is time that something was done.,61
498,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [10.10] - I am sure that the honourable member for Hunter does not suggest that the Government should make itself responsible for the quality of all ammunition now brought into Australia. Unquestionably the testing of imported ammunition should, in the interests of human life, receive consideration, and the Prime Minister permits me to say that it will get it.",61
499,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"We need an Australian test, so that explosives may be made here..",61
500,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"We shall take into consideration the advisability of testing all ammunition, whether imported or locally made. With regard to the question asked by the honourable member for Moreton, where a manceuvre area is so situated that railway connection will facilitate the movement of troops, and* the transport of ammunition and other material, making the working of the area more economical, the Government intend to provide it. It has been found that the working of the Western Australian area referred to will be facilitated by the expenditure of £1,200 on a railway siding.",61

Does the Government hope to make them of service in the event of Naval hostilities, or is it simply jproposed to equip them for the training of our men?",62
509,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [10.15] - Thes e items are towards refitting two of the boats mentioned with guns for the purpose of training portions of our Navy. The advice of our experts is that if these vessels are re-armed, as proposed, their usefulness for the purpose will be considerably in excess of boats used for a similar purpose in the Imperial Navy. In the circumstances we have no hesitation in asking Parliament to spend the money.",62
510,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [10.16]. - Of course, in such matters, the opinions of the experts must have weight, but after the statement of the Honorary Minister one can only say that the vessels used for similar purposes in the Imperial Navy are far inferior to what many of us believed if they are no better than the boats which the Government propose to re-arm. question whether it is worth our while to spend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 on these old "" dugouts.""

512,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes ; Admiral Henderson says they are.,62
513,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We can accept Admiral Henderson's statement, but it seems to me somewhat absurd to put first class guns into boats that are more fit for the museum than for any useful purpose. Would it not be possible to put these up-todate guns into vessels that are not obsolete ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [10.19] - I think this money will be absolutely wasted. The vessels on which it is proposed to expend it - should have been consigned to the scrap-heap twenty years ago. We should endeavour to train our men on vessels more approximating to the type of those on which they will be expected to serve. Year after year we are called upon to sanction votes for tinkering up these vessels, and the money wasted in that way would have gone far to replace them with vessels more suitable for the purpose required.",62
514,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that these vessels are not seaworthy ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They may be, but I should prefer, if I were making a trip to the Old Country, to go by one of the Orient or Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's boats, or by the Powerful.",62
515,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Powerful is being sent Home to be scrapped. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Powerful is certainly an up-to date vessel compared with those upon which this money is to be expended. But even that vessel is considered by the Admiralty to be obsolete, although she has been only fourteen years in commission. I hope that this is the last of such votes that we shall see.",62
516,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.22] - The most experienced, as well as the youngest amongst us, must accept the advice of experts in a matter of this kind.

518,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No ; on the Estimates in Chief.,62
519,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"In view of that statement, I should like to refer the Prime Minister to page 2089 of Hansard. He will find that while these Estimales were under discussion he said I have asked the Minister for External Affairs to make - a statement of policy during this debate.",62
520,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That means the debate on the Estimates in Chief. It is really the same debate.,62
521,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Honourable members on this side were looking forward with interest to the promised statement, in order that they might know where they were when they came to discuss the Budget.  the honourable member for Richmond, I am extremely anxious to know the policy of the Government with regard to the Northern Territory, but I did not expect that it would be stated on these Works Estimates. The Prime Minister has promised us that the Minister of External Affairs will give us the Government policy when we come to deal with items affecting the Northern Territory on the General Estimates. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [JO.25] - The honourable member for Darling Downs drew my attention to the fact that the Prime Minister had made a statement one day last week to the effect that when these votes came up the Government policy with respect to the Northern Territory would be explained. The honourable member for Darling Downs said I wish to know from the right honourable gentleman if a statement of policy is to be made regarding the .development of the Nortliern Territory, where obviously there must be considerable expenditure of public works. We should know what is to be done, what gauge is to be adopted, and whether the line is to be ultimately carried forward to join the Queensland railway system. To that statement, the Prime Minister repliedI have asked the Minister for External AfTairs to make a statement of jjolicy during this debate. That referred to the debate on the Works and Buildings Estimates.",62
522,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I had it in my mind that the debate on the whole of the Estimates and on the Budget was practically the same. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member for Darling Downs then said that he would reserve his remarks until a later stage, being clearly of ihe opinion, like others on this side, that it was the intention of the Prime Minister to have a statement of policy made before this item was passed.",63
523,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member admit that this is practically the same debate as the Budget debate? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Prac tically. If the Prime Minister says he did not mean what the honourable member understood, I am satisfied.",63
524,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Minister of External Affairs could not have made a statement to-night in any case.,63
525,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [10.27]. - I quite understood that the full exposition of the policy and intentions of the Government with regard to the Northern Territory would be made in the debate on the General Estimates), but I take this opportunity of expressing my great disappointment with the official report which has been presented to the House. 1 never before read such a meagre report from any Department. It would be impossible for any one to take up an equal amount of space and say less in it than is said in that report. If toose in charge of expeditions of this character are to furnish such reports, it is time ihat the Government took action. No Government can ignore the fact that the Northern Territory is a real live question, and a heavy burden on the people of Australia. The subject must be taken in hand and dealt with in a thoroughly practical way, in order that at least some return may be got from the Territory for the enormous amount being spent on it. We all exceedingly regret that the Minister of External Affairs is unable to be in the House this evening, and I hope that before the debate on the Budget proceeds very far he will be able to make the promised statement, so that honourable members can debate the question when debating the Government's Budget proposals generally. I want it to be known that some of us feel that there must be no mark-lime policy in connection with the Northern Territory. It is far too serious and costly an item for us to sit down and allow the expenditure to go on as at present. Air. WISE (Gippsland) [10.29] There is a vote of £2,500 in connection with the "" Port Augusta Railway."" We have already passed a vote for the trans-, continental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta.

527,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.36] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I wish to say that the Government intend to give the honourable member for Gwydir tomorrow, and, it necessary, Ihe next day, to discuss the recommendations of the Postal Commission.  to draw the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to an article which appeared in the Melbourne Herald, on Tuesday, 7th November. It is headed"" Australian Meat."" "" Handling in London."" ""Ineffective Methods."" paragraphs which I wish to quote readComplaints have frequently been made as to the haphazard manner in which the meat is dealt with, and Mr Levy is now satisfied that the whole of the trouble arises between the time the meat leaves the steamer and gets into the hands of the consumer. The meat appears to be well looked after in transit from Australia to London; after that, there is ample room for improvement in the methods of its handling. It was somewhat significant, said Mr Levy, that at none of the hotels or restaurants at which he made special inquiries could he obtain an admission that either Australian meat or Australian butter wns used. He thought that something should be done to bring about the recognition of Australian produce. The quality was alright, and the fact that the meat or the butter was Australian should be loudly proclaimed, not concealed. I desire to ask the Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to do anything towards bringing our Australian products before the public of Great Britain? It was with amazement that I heard the statement made at a deputation which waited on the Minister of External Affairs, that 75 per cent, of our Australian butter was sold in London either as Danish butter or as butter from other countries. I maintain that our product is equal to that of any other country in the world, and that our producers, both in the meat and butter industries, are anxious that their products should stand upon their own merits. My anxiety is that the Government should do something in that direction, so that Australian products, when they reach Great Britain, should not lose their identity. Is it the intention of the Government to do anything in respect of Australian meat and other products, and if so, when?",64
528,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade 'and Customs) [10.40] - The honourable member informed me that it was his intention to bring this matter forward upon the motion for adjournment. I may say at once that, at the last Cabinet meeting, it was decided to call for applications for the appointment of an expert in London to advise us as to how our products were treated there. The applications will be made returnable early in the new year.",64

We require an expert who will not only be able to advise us, but who will also be able to advise the High Commissioner, and thus prevent the publication of some of the tales which have been circulated in the press of Great Britain from time to time, to the damage of Australian products. The We desire to get a good man for the position. Speaking from memory, the salary, I think, is to be £600 a year.  anything in regard to butter and other products ?",64
531,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member must know that, although the Commerce Act was passed in 1907, until twelve months ago, the export inspection under that Act was carried on under the supervision of State omcers In other words, we had not a single Commonwealth officer to advise us. Since then, we have had one man in the  work, considering the wide range of subjects with which he had to deal.  to have a man at Home?",64
532,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes . If we can get a man who is familiar with Australian conditions, so much the better. But if we cannot do so, we must get an officer who, after he has seen the conditions which obtain in Great Britain can come here and inform us of those conditions.  ment is to be sure to send an Australian.",64
533,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member is not keener upon sending an Australian than I am, but we want to secure the services of the best man available. It is quite possible that, on account of the increasing cost of the Commerce Department, we shall have to slightly increase our fees. I think that the Department should pay its way; and I know that the exporters of meat have said that they are quite prepared to pay something extra in order to insure that justice shall be done. I asked Professor Stewart, of the Sydney University', while he was in England recently, to make a report on what he saw there on behalf of the Government. I have not yet seen his report. But he was familiar wilh Australian conditions, and he is a man who has worked himself from the bottom rung of the ladder up to his present position. I repeat that the Cabinet, at its last meeting, decided to take steps in the direction int dicated by the honourable member ' for Maranoa.",64

For instance, a person who is an expert in meat, will probably know nothing whatever about butter or fruit.",65
535,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Is it not possible to get a man who understands both those branches of industry? ,65
536,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That may be possible, but it is very difficult. If the Minister proposes to make the producer pay the cost",65
537,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I say that I think we should make the Department pay for itself.,65

539,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That I recognise, but if the honourable member knew as much about the meat industry as I do, he would see the urgent reason.",65
