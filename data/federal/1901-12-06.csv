1,Mr MCCOLL,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,I should like to know whether the Prime Minister proposes to adjourn the House over Tuesday afternoon to permit of honourable members taking part in the reception of the Governor of Victoria on his arrival in Melbourne.,14
2,Mr BARTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"The matter has not engaged my attention particularly, but I think that if we were to adjourn on Monday until Tuesday afternoon at four o'clock we should be doing all that is required to enable honourable members to take part in the reception, and at the same time should not interfere seriously with the conduct of publio business. I do not think we should adjourn beyond half-past four. REFUND S OF DUTY .",14
3,Mr OMALLEY,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF," I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if, in the case of mining machinery which is imported for the purpose of giving employment, the Government will refund any duty which may have been paid in excess of the rate finally decided upon by Parliament ?",14
4,Mr KINGSTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"If Parliament so decides, we shall do so. Our proposal is not in that direction, but we propose to take the sense of the House on the subject. CHRISTMAS ADJOURNMENT .",14
5,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"It would be a great convenience to honourable members if they knew on what date the House would adjourn forfcheChristmas holidays. I am inclined to suggest that Friday, the 13th inst., would be a reasonable date to fix. If we do not adjourn then, we shall have to sit during the week immediately preceding Christmas week, and that would be very inconvenient to a number of honourable members. I can say honestly that I do not see any possible chance of the Tariff being finished before Christmas, even though the utmost expedition be used. If the Tariff cannot be passed before Christmas, there will be no sense in continuing our sittings right into the holidays.",14
6,Mr BARTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"I have intimated on several occasions thatfchetime afc which we should ask the Houses to adjourn would depend very largely on the progress made with the Tariff. I quite join with the leader of the Opposition in the belief that it has been rendered impossible to pass the Tariff by Christmas, but if the Tariff is to be passed later than we thought it would be, the urgency of expediting public business is all the greater. My own impression is that the 13th would be too early a dateon which to adjourn consideringfcheduties. Ave have on both sides offcheHouse, but it might be fair to allow honourable members to leave Melbourne the week before Christmas. After sitting on the Monday and Tuesday preceding the ISth inst., wemight adjourn on the afternoon of that date. That would' give honourable members a full week before Christmas, and it would be reasonable, I think, to ask them to resume their duties about the 7th or Sth January. EXEMPTIONS FROM DUTY .",14
7,Mr HUGHES,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,I desire to ask the' ALinister for Trade and Customs whether the difficulties which have arisen in reference to the exemptions which were saidfcohave been affected by the amendments made in the item relating to the duty on cotton and linen goods have been removed. I understand that it has been asserted that the exemptions which existed prior to the amendment of the duty on cotton and linen goods have been in some mysterious way affectedby the alterations which were made.,14
8,Mr KINGSTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"The position is this r We proposed certain exemptions when we introduced the Tariff. We indicated afterwards that we were going to adopt a different course by throwing all the cottons into one lin<3, and including the exemptions,' and then we had a further debate in the committee, and a certain decision was arrived at. As regards the exemptions we propose to give effect to them, but the precise terms require to be settled, and no doubt they will be settled today. TARIFF ALTERATIONS.  attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to the following telegram from Adelaide, which appears in this morning's papers:Agents at Port Adelaide complain of inconvenience through the tardy way in which alterations in the Tariff are communicated to the Port Adelaide Customs officials. They desire the South Australian Customs to be put on the same footing as the Victorian, and tiiat the officials mude aware of alterations by the time they are to take effect. Several instances have occurred in which official intimation of alterations has been received hours after they haveappeared in the - daily papers. The latest of these was in connection with the decision in respect to some of the items in cottons and linens placed on the free list, which had previously paid duty. I would ask the Minister if he cannot so arrange that the Customs authorities in all the States shall be simultaneously advised of any alterations.",14
9,Mr KINGSTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"I do not think there has been any neglect in this connection. Honourable members know that sometimes alterations are made afc late hours, and therefore it is very natural that the first intimation should appear in the daily press. The practice is, even with regard to alterations made fairly late at night, to hand messages in so as to have them telegraphed at nine o'clock the next morning. I do not - think that shows any laxity on our part, but at the same time probably there will be an attempt mace to insure that even this delay shall not occur before the messages regarding late alterations are placed in the hands of the Telegraph department. Honourable members will see that in the very nature of things greater diligence could hardly have been expected. CUSTOMS ENTRIES. Mr Glynn"" - I should like some infoi'm'ation from the Minister for Trade and Customs with reference to a question I put to him the other day as to facilitating Customs entries-dis pensing with the unusual number of entries and the multiplicity of certificates now required. I have several letters on this point from South Australia, and in one of these it is stated that if the difference in the duty were nedd afc the port of despatch into the interior, ancl the matter then ended as far as the receivers were concerned, it would be an immense help. I should like to know whether the Minister has inquired into the matter.",15
10,Mr KINGSTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"The Government are inquiring intofcheregulations and everything that can be done is being done for the purpose of simplifying the machinery and facilitating trade. At the same time we have clear duties cast upon us, not only by the Customs Act, but by the Constitution Act itself, and it is necessary that' we should do everything that is required of us under be these Acts. However, we are inquiring intofchematter, and if we can simplify and condense, we shall be only too glad fco do it. POSTAL FACILITIES .",15
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"I desire to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that a systematic policy of restricting postal facilities in New South Wales is apparently being carried.out. Office after office is being closed and it is apparently intended to close others, and I would ask the Minister whether he will look into' the matter with a view to checking proceedings which are giving rise to very serious indignation.",15
12,Mr BARTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"I have heard that a number of minor post-offices are being closed, and that one or two post-offices in populous centres have been closed, and that pillar-boxes and offices for the sale of stamps have been substituted. I would ask honourable members to reflect that it is necessary for the postal service to be carried on with due economy under the new conditions, and that the Government is alternately being complained of for extravagance and undue retrenchment. Complaints of both kinds are inevitable in the case of a service which is being placed on a new basis. I shall give attention to the complaint of the honourable member, which is not the only one I have received, and will confer with the Postmaster-General with a view to seeing that any necessary retrenchment is carried out without; causing undue friction. CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATIO N.",15
13,Mr HUME COOK,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"My attention has been directed fco a somewhat important matter, and I should like the Minister for Trade and Customsfcomake inquiry into it . I have been informed by a customs agent who does business both in Sydney and Melbourne, thatfcheTariff is being administered differently in the two places, and that articles upon which duty is paid in Melbourne are admitted free in Sydney, owing tofcheinterpretation placed upon the Tariff there. This is a very serious matter for the merchants of Melbourne, and I would ask the Minister to inquire into it, with a view to securing the uniform administration of the Tariff.",15
14,Mr KINGSTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"I cannot believe that anything of the sort has happened, but, if the honourable member will state a specific case, I shall be only too happy to inquire into it . I realise that unless we can secure uniform administration, - a uniform Tariff will be an absurdity. DUTIE S ON INTER-STATE TRANSFERS.",16
15,Mr BROWN,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"the Right Honourable the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether it is his intention to collect duty upon goods manufactured in one of the States, when passing into another State, the raw material of such manufactured articles having originally been imported free of duty, as for instance[a) Iu the event of linen having been imported free into New South Wales and there made into shirts and other wearing apparel, it is intended to collect Inter-State Customs duties upon such manufactured articles when forwarded to another State for sale and use. (&) In the event of mouldings, &c, for . picture-frames having beeii imported into New South Wales, and there manufactured into picture-frames, it is intended to collect Inter-State duties upon such manufactured articles when forwarded to another State. If so, will he kindly indicate bow it is proppsed to ascertain the exact amount of raw material in such manufactured articles, and on what basis it is proposed to collect such Interstate Customs duties.",16
16,Mr KINGSTON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"j-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:Effect must be given to section 92 of the Constitution Act by the collection on Inter-State transfers of any duty which would be payable on the raw material if then imported into the Commonwealth. The necessary figures are derived from information supplied by the Inter-State transfer, and by consideration of the nature of the goods and all available data. I may add that in this connection there are undoubtedly very considerable difficulties, but they are the creation of the Constitution we have to administer, and we are doing our best to meet them satisfactorily. INSTRUCTION'S TO DEPUTY POSTMASTERS-GENERAL.",16
17,Mr MAHON,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"the Minister representing the Postmaster-Genei'al, not ceWhen a copy of the instructions issued to the Deputy Postmasters-General of the several States will be available for perusal by honourable members?",16
18,Sir PHILIP FYSH,A RRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:A copy of the delegation of the powers of the Postmaster-General under the Post and Telegraph Act of 1901, given as provided by section S of that Act, is now available for perusal by honourable members. NA PAYMENTS. - Mr HUME COOK asked the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. If it is true that members of the Ordnance Branch are again being worked overtime; and that not even tea-money is being paid them. 2. Does the Minister propose to give these men overtime pay or time off for the extra work done.",16
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. In some cases that may have occurred, but if there is much overtime it would be a good cause for temporary leave of absence. 2. It is not intended, nor is it desirable, to encourage a system of paying for casual overtime or giving tea-money. PROPERTY ACQUISITION BILL. Consideration of message from the Senate. In Committee.",16
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I bring the schedule of the amendments, fco which the Senate has disagreed, before the commifctee this morning, because it is urgent that this Bill should become law as soon as possible. At the present time, there are several cases in my own department which are hung up pending the passing of this measure. The amendments to which the Senate have disagreed are unimportant, as is stated in their message. The reason for the action which has been taken by the other Chamber is that, as a result of the insertion of clause 58A, there is no necessity to retain the words, ""or of the Supreme Court of a State,"" which appear in clauses 12 and 22; or the words, "" o r until the establishment of the High Court in the Supreme Court of the State,"" which occur in clause 14. Clause 58A deals with the whole of these matters, and I therefore moveupon That the amendments be not insisted upon.",16
21,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I should, like to know where copies of the proposals of the Senate are to be found - It is not to be expected that honourable members can understand what is proposed unless they have a copy of. the amendments before them.",16
22,Mr GLYNN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I have looked through the amendments made by the Senate as well as I could, having before me only the Bill in the form in which it appeared before it was finally passed by this House. It is a pity that the Ministry did not see that a copy of the measure as finally agreed fco by this House, was placed upon the files of honourable members. By comparing the various copies, however, I can see what is the point of the Senate's proposals. I have no objection to the amendments, because they substitute one clause for several references throughout the Bill. The Senate, however, has not completely done its work. It proposes to omit the words "" or of the Supreme Court of a State "" in some cases, but not in others, where such a course is equally necessary. However, as the retention of these words in the cases to which I refer will make no difference, I support the proposal of the Government.",17
23,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I ask that clause 12 be read, so that the committee may know what the exact effect of it is. No honourable member has a copy of the Bill as it finally passed this House. The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN (Mr. MCDonald) - I understand that this is the Bill which is on the files of honourable members.",17
24,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Lookin g at clause 12, I desire to know whether it means that we are to create a new survey department throughout; the whole of the States The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN - I should like to point out to the honourable and .learned member that the question before the committee is "" that the amendments be not insisted upon.""",17
25,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I think that the difficulty could be overcome by adopting the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, and reading the clause. Honourable members would then be in a position to appreciate the effect of it.",17
26,Mr FISHER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I think there is a good deal in the complaint that the system of distributing Bills is not satisfactory. It would be quite a simple matter for the Government Printer to keep Bills standing in type, and whenever an amendment is made in them to indicate it by the use of a different fount of type. If Victoria is not capable of carrying out such a work, it is high time that some of the small States taught her how to do it . Every information, and exact information should be given to honourable members when dealing with important matters.  if the Bill before honourable members is in the form in which it finally passed this House? My desire is to know exactly where we are.",17
27,Mr GLYNN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," If honourable members will turn to the last 1 copy of the Property Acquisition Bill upon their files, they will find upon it the words "" as brought from the Senate,"" whereas the measure should be headed, ""as read a third time in the House of Representatives."" The latter heading,, however, appeared upon the Bill when it was in an imperfect state.  a different system should be adopted in submitting amendments made by either branch of the Legislature. It is not even necessary to employ different type to indicate such amendments. I ffcheamendments made by one House were enclosed between a certain form of brackets, and those made by the other branch of the Legislature were inserted between'a different sort of parenthesis, honourable members would have the position clearly before them. Even if the same type were used, it would be very much easier for the officers of the House to follow the different stages of Bills. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and adopted. THE TARIFF. In Committee of Ways and Means: (Consideration resumed from 5th December, vide page 8363). Item 61Hats and caps, viz Men's, women's, boys', and children's felt hats, per dozen, 10s. and 15 per cent, ad valorem. Dress hats, per dozen, 48s.' Hats and cups, sewn, per dozen, 3s.  way of amendment:That the words "" 10s."" be omitted.",17
28,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I am in the same state of mind this morning as I was last night. I am utterly bewildered when I come to analyze this item. If I hacl entered the chamber and learned that honourable members were discussing a proposal to vote themselves £5,000 a year by way of salary, I should naturally say that it was a bewildering proposal to fix £375,000 of taxation upon the backs of the people. But I should be told that under the Constitution we had a perfect right to adopt such a proposal, and that we intended to do so no matter what arrangements had been made with the people of the country. There is no difference between the two proposals. I should like to know what honourable member would have dared to say before his constituents that he intended to vote for a proposal to impose a duty ranging from 50 per cent, to 180 per cent, on an article that the people wear. I feel some sympathy with the Prime Minister, because it seems to me that the Minister for Trade and Customs is absolutely callous and indifferent with regard to the personal honour of and to the compact made by the other Ministers with the people of the country. It might have been a good thing if the Tariff could have been proclaimed before the Union. By way of illustration, I may say that in connection with the proposed South African federation it is suggested that there be a uniform tariff before the federation takes place. Of course, in South Africa there are only two States to make a uniform tariff, and a similar step would have been almost impossible with six States. We have been voting duties which I consider high, ranging from 15 to 25 per cent. What is there in the nature of this particular article that the duty should be over 100 per cent. 1 Is there any sense or principle in the proposal ? Is there any essential difference between the manufacture of hats and the manufacture of blankets? It will not have a nice appearance before Australia if this proposal of the Government be passed, because it is essentially making monopolies to an .extent that has not even been imagined in connection with other items. There seems an absolute want of comprehension on the part of the Minister for Trade and Customs when he says this is not a prohibitive duty, seeing that he glories in the fact that it is going to absolutely prohibit this particular class of article. Is that "" revenue without destruction ""1 I do not believe that honourable members, even on the Government side of the House, will be so lost to all sense of honour in dealing with the States, as to give a monopoly to a handful of people, in order to keep going an industry which is probably paying twice as much as an industry could be reasonably expected to pay. 1 do not believe that honourable members will let it be known to the whole world that, while we advocate moderate protection, we pick out this industry in this invidious way, and exceed the wildest dreams of'protectionists in the United States. I should be ashamed to be a member of this House if this item were passed as it now stands. I should like to know what are the forces that have been at work. Why in the name of honesty and common-sense should we pick out this one manufactory-and I believe it is practically brought down to one particular manufactory-and give it assistance so far beyond that given to other industries ? Does it bear an appearance of honesty that Parliament should pick out hat manufacture, which is practically the business of one firm, and make the duty anything ranging from 100 per cent, to 180 per cent. 1 If the committee pass this duty, it will in some respects be all the better for the free-trade propaganda ; but, at the same time, I am not going to allow, if I can possibly help it , the placing on the statute-book of a duty so unjust to the whole population of Australia. I believe the Ministry are as honest and honourable as are public men in any part of the world; but their proposal in this instance is remarkable and invidious. I can understand, from a protectionist point of view, that a little more protection may be required under some circumstances, but I do not think that any circumstances can justify a jump from 25 per cent, on clothing, and 15 per cent, on woollen goods, to such an excessive rate of protection as is now proposed. Of course, if 40 per cent, means prohibition, the Minister can have a joke by making the duty 140 per cent.; but in the sight of the world, which is all one in commerce, such a proceeding would be insensate folly. I throw on the committee the responsibility of passing this duty. I do not say that, from a protectionist point of view, honourable members have hitherto gone beyond. the scope of their own principles ; but such a duty as that now proposed is to be utterly condemned even by protectionists. If I were a protectionist I should hide my head with shame at this proposal, which must, I think, have emanated to a large extent from the brain 'of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Such duties have perhaps been in vogue in Victoria, but they have been condemned by every honest man. The system of composite cluties is resorted to simply in order to what is being done; just as the test was posed in the Alien Restriction Bill, which has, however, received its condemnation in another Chamber. Personally I do not care; but I have some regard for the corporate honour of the House, which ought to be dear to all of us. The free-trade policy would be to let this item go, but we must have regard to the interests of the millions of people as against the thousands. I , therefore, strongly appeal to the committee to weigh most carefully what they are doing, and point ont to protectionists that they are perpetrating a piece of folly which will re-act against their own policy. If free-traders can show, when hereafter fighting the battle of free-trade throughout Australia, that the protectionist system is so evil and so dishonest that its advocates will go to the extent of even 180 per cent., we shall have a powerful argument in favour of moderation. We shall be able to show that protection is a system so invidious and unfair that, once it gets its roots in the community, those who advocate it will stop at nothing in order to effect their purpose, which is prohibition, resulting in the creation of monopolies, and the sweating of the great masses of the people for the sake of the few.",17
29,Mr OMALLEY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," No doubt much can be said on both sides of this question ; but it seems to me that the fact that a majority of Australians are always prepared to bow down to something foreign is an admission that it is worth a duty of 20s. a dozen' to make them wear Australian hats. There is a bonus in the fact that if an article is foreign, the Australians are prepared to accept it ; and it is absolutely necessary, if we want to build up industries, to have protective duties. We are very prone to imitate others, and, unfortunately, we often imitate those beneath us. Fashions were established by the lackeys of the middle ages, and the butlers of great houses, and we bow down and worship them. As regards wages, hatters in the United States earn from $15 fco $25 a week, and men who, like myself, have lived in America, and associated with the business people of the countiy-wh o have visited factories, and taken part in political life-ough t to know at least as much of this question as do honourable members who obtain their information from books. Mr G. B.. EDWARDS - The honourable hide member would not have been here if we pro- had not allowed something to come in from abroad.",19
30,Mr OMALLEY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,My honourable friend came here from abroad. In the United States all the people are educated under their grand free school system; they have the most highly skilled artisans in the world,19
31,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,Who work eleven hours a day.,19
32,Mr OMALLEY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"That is a reason why we should protect our own workers, who are employed for only eight hours a day. Is it reasonable to suppose that our hat manufacturers can, without protection, compete against the manufacturers of America and of England, or against the manufacturers of Japan, where the workers are paid from 6d. to Is. a day? One of our great primary industries is the breeding of rabbits, and, as members of the Opposition are great believers in primary industries, I ask them to support the hat industry, since it uses a large number of rabbit skins. Under modern conditions our distance from England or America does not give us much protection, because when once a monster ocean steam-ship is loaded with hats, it does not cost much more to bring them here than it would cost to bring them from Tasmania, and today they are shipping goods from New York to Liverpool more cheaply than goods can be sent from Boston to New York. In fact, rates are becoming so low that presently a bonus will be offered to shippers.",19
33,Mr GB EDWARDS,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,The honourable member has never hadfcopay freights.,19
34,Mr OMALLEY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Yes , I have. On one occasion, when sending six trucks of sheep to Kansas City, I had to pay the railway company freight before delivery, and the company stolefchesheep. I ask the Opposition to help us to do justice, not to the manufacturers, but to the working men of the Commonwealth, whose wives fill the churches on the. Sabbath and picnic at Flemington, and whose healthy, hopeful children fill our schools. We cannot be happy except by making others happy, and no man who buys goods manufactured by sweated labour can be happy.",19
35,Mr FISHER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," The honour the able member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, is always interesting, if he is not coiivincing, and, no doubt, when the North Pole is dispared covered we shall hear, either that he painted it, or that he knew the man who did so. I agree with the Prime Minister that there should be no destruction of industries, and, although I am a believer in free-trade principles, I am willing to support a fairly well. 30 per cent, ad valorem duty on hats for the protection of the hat industry. I complia ment the honourable member for Yarra upon the excellent speech he made. His arguseems ments were supported by hard dry facts, honourable members will always be pleased to hear a speech of that description. parently, good wages Ure paid in the hat industry, and' while perhaps it is fair to give it a certain amount of protection, not think the committee should agree to such high duties as the Government progood pose.",20
36,Mr KENNEDY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," Althoug h I viously. - iini not willing at any time to do anything that will injure an established industry, while I am anxious to give encouragement to new industries, I cannot see my way clear to support the proposals the Government in regard to the hat trade. gone fco. So fav as I have been able to ascertain, and from what I learnt when the Victorian Tariff was under revision some time ago, chief profits of this trade go intofchepockets of the distributors of Flinders-lane-; but calculation which I havcmade goes to that in regardfcoa certain class of hats duties are absolutely prohibitive, and there is no such thing as competition between the importer and the manufacturer. That is state of things which is not desirable. While I do not wish to see unfair competihave tion, I do not want to put an end to all competition. But on hats of a value of 36s. per dozen the duties are prohibitory, cause,, without taking into account freight charges and importers' and retailers' profits, they raise the price to oos. dozen. I may be told that hats of that class are never imported, and that as cheap and good a hat is manufactured in Victoria. But, in my opinion, we should not prevent competition from outside in that line. industries, W it h regard to hats of the value of 90s. per dozen, I find that the duties increase the price to 114s. per dozen, without taking into account freights, or profits, while the rate of protection diminishes as the value hats increases. Therefore, upon hats of that class there is room for fair competition, and the duties are not too high. I am preto support duties of 30 per cent, us a maximum rate with that amount of protection, and fair conditions as to distribution. I fcliink thatfchehat manufacturers of Australia, considering the large market that will be open to them, will be able to do",20
37,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I have rather warm feeling towards those engaged in the hat industry in Victoria, because it to me that they have not attempted and to take any undue advantage of the duties which have prevailed in this State. Judging Apfrom inquiries which I made before the introduction of the Tariff, prices of hats did not differ materially in Sydney and in MelI do bourne. The other day I bought a hat in Melbourne for 10s-. 6d., which was just as as the one for which I had paid the same price in Sydney three months pre",20
38,Mr SYDYEY SMITH,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,Where did the and honourable member buy the Sydney hat 1,20
39,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,Af c Mountcasfcle's.,20
40,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,About the dearest of place the honourable member could have,20
41,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I say that, quality for quality, the two hats were equal, so far as I the could judge. I do not quite agree with the Government proposals, because I think that a probably a lower duty would be sufficient to show meet the case of the Victorian manuthe facturers, ancl at the same time encourage into existence a number of hat factories in the neighbouring States. It must be borne a in mind that if we place too high a tax on the people of the other States, they will to pay the full amount of that duty for a considerable time, because we cannot expect that local factories will come into beoperation in every one of the States immediately, or that the output of the Victorian factories can be so increased as to per forthwith supply the requirements of all the States. On the other hand, if we adopt a 15 or 20 per cent, duty, such as has been suggested, the reduction will be too great, and may deal too heavy a blow to existing because it will permit of our markets being ilooded with the low-class shoddy 1 goods which come from some parts of the ' Continent. I should prefer a small fixed duty | on the lower class hats in order to shut them of , out, but T do not think that is practicable. and under the circumstances we might compromise matters by levying a 30 per cent, ad valorem duty, and abolish the fixed duty.",20
42,Mr THOMAS,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Does the honourable member call 30 per cent, a compromise 1.",21
43,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I do, in this particular instance. I believe that even a small percentage of duty will make a very considerable difference in regard to the admission of the very low-priced shoddy hats, and in view of the fact that if shoddy hats are excluded, local manufacturers who use 'wool instead of shoddy will be able to sell a medium-priced hat at a price as low as that of the imported article, we should assist them in every way we can.",21
44,Mr A MCLEAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"-This is an industry that requires rather a high duty, because the greater proportion of the cost of hats is represented by wages, and I am prepared to support a duty equivalent to the difference in the cost of labour here and in European countries. At the same time. I cannot go the full length of the Government proposals. When I was before my constitutenfcs I told them that I would support fair protective duties for industries that were suited to our conditions, but that I would not countenance prohibition, because I believed the interests of the public were better conserved when there was healthy competition between importers and local producers. The suggestion of the honourable member for Bland appears to me to be a reasonable one. In most cases I should regard a duty of 30 per cent, as a very high one, but in the special circumstances connected with hat manufacture, I think it will afford only a fair amount of protection. Although an enormous duty has been levied upon hats in times gone by, the people of Victoria have been able to obtain locally-made bats at about the same prices that were ruling in New South Wales under free-trade for the imported article, and therefore it is not to be feared that the consumers will suffer because a comparatively high duty is imposed.",21
45,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," The proposition that we have to consider just now is whether we should abolish the fixed duty of 10s. or not ; and perhaps we had better decide that point first, and afterwards consider whether the imposition of a higher rate of duty than 15 per cent, would be justified.",21
46,Mr VL SOLOMON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"South Australia). - A great deal of information has been given to us with reference to the hat manufacturers of Victoria, but whatever success may have attended them, the hat-making business has not been a great success in South Australia. The duties fixed there in the first place were heavily protective, amounting at one time to 25 per cent, ad valorem, and in some instances to a fixed duty of 15s. per dozen. But the industry did not reach thedimensionsor achieve the success that was expected of it . At present there are hot a dozen men and boys employed in hat making in the whole of the State. The question now appears to be whether the people of the Commonwealth are to be supplied with the bulk of their hats by Victorian manufacturers, and in this connection we have to consider how many men, women, and children are employed in the factories which the whole of the people of the Commonwealth are to be taxed to maintain. The rates of duty proposed by the Government seem to be inordinately high, and I am entirely in accord with the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. . Poynton, in his desire to abolish the fixed duty. Thirty per cent, has been suggested as a moderate ad valorem duty, but that seems to me to be a very high rate.",21
47,Mr SOLMON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I understand that the committee are now about to decide whether the composite duty shall be retained. Ifc has been repeatedly stated that such a duty concealsfcheamount which is being paid by the consumer into revenue. I do not claim to have had a mercantile training, or to possess expert knowledge of commercial affairs, but I should like an explanation of how a fixed duty of 10s. per dozen upon hats concealsfcheamount which is being contributed to the revenue by the consumer. Ifc seems to me that if we have a fixed duty of 10s. per dozen in addition to. an ad valorem rate of 15 per cent., the man who purchases an imported hat must know that he is contributing lOd. towards the revenue.",21
48,Mr THOMSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,But the percentage of duty is concealed.,21
49,Mr SALMON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"It seems perfectly clear to me that if a man buys an imported hat, upon which there is a fixed duty, he knows how much he is paying towards the revenue. But under a 15 per cent, ad valorem, rate I admit that he does not know what he is contributing to the revenue, because he has no knowledge of the initial cost. Surely the argument of concealment can be levelled with a great deal more force against the composite duties on account of the ad valorem than it can be on account the fixed rate.",21
50,Mr KINGSTON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"A good many siderably pleasant things have been said about myself during the course of the Tariff debate, have been passed by me unnoticed. would not now refer to them, but that acting leader of the Opposition stated last night that I had unblushingly declared that cent. more. this duty was intended to be prohibitive. I did not say anything of the sort, and am a little bit surprised at his remark. On number of men. the contrary I pointed out that a matter of £50,000 has hitherto been annually derived from the Victorian Customs duties upon hats, and that, as we proposed to materially reduce those'duties, a larger volume of imsideration. ports might be expected. I do not know that I should have taken particular notice of the honourable member's statement, but when he accused me this morning of callousness to the personal honour of colleagues, I think that he said too much. It is the duty of any person who has the right to be called a man, to be as jealous the honour of his friends as of his personal honour. I defy any man to say that I have ever been callous offchepersonal honour of my colleagues, and no such stateemployment ment ought to be made in this House. Talk about my making unblushing clarations ! I venture fco think that such a statement should raise a red hot burning brand of shame upon the most brazen brow, to say nothing of that of any honourable member of this House. have had considerable discussion upon the point which is now under consideration, and the conclusion afc which the Governwe ment have arrived, is that while there is a desire on the part of a very considerable majority of the committeefcogive good and substantial protection to the hat industry, they are not prepared to adopt the system which is here proposed-the system which has obtained in Victoria, but with which the other States are not yefc familiar. all the circumstances we do not propose quarrel with the wish of the committee in this respect, but we do intend to ask them to give effect to whatever may be necessary for the purpose of affording substantial tection to this particular industry. We think that that protection should not be less than 30 per cent. We propose to move accordingly, and trust to secure the acceptance of our proposal by this committee and by Parliament. It has been pointed out that of in regard to certain industries which compete with imported goods, Victoria conexcels New South Wales, notwithstanding her lesser population. The figures which given by Coghlan show that whilst New I South Wales employs only 22,000 people in the industries which compete with imported goods, Victoria employs 34,000, or 50 per",22
51,Mr THOMSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Thos e figures refer to the I number of people employed, not to the",22
52,Mr KINGSTON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"They are counted similarly in both cases by the New South Wales statistician, Mr Coghlan. This fact must naturally awake our gravest conHere we find an industry typical of those in which Victoria excels, and in regard to which the position may* be put- "" Victoria first, New South Wales nowhere."" The hat industry does not exist my to any practical purpose in New oufch Wales. On the other hand, in Victoria 25 factories have been established, which proof vide employment for nearly 1,000 peopleown men and women. When we reflect; that the Victorian polipy has established an industry which provides practically direct for 1,000 people, I venture to think we are afforded a striking illustradetion of the wisdom of that policy.",22
53,Mr THOMSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,Then the Government are going for the Victorian policy ',22
54,Mr KINGSTON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"We are going for the Victorian policy of maintaining this inWe dustry. We are going for the policy of continuing in our midst an industry which is worth preservation. We intend as fairly as can to prevent the destruction of an industry which is a credit to the State in which it is found. A tfchesame time we are not going for the Victorian policy in the sense in which the honourable member for North Sydney used the term. We do not propose the Victorian rate of duty. The honourable member knows that the Victorian Under duty was 30s. per dozen. Our proposal was to for 10s.per dozen and 15percent. ad valorem. Applying the varying rates to the consideration of a particular case-for example,, to Italian hats which have recently been largely proimported at something approximating 5s. each-the position is that under our Tariff the amountfcobe collected, would be Is. 7d. only, or 33 per cent., whilst under the Vicprotection torian Tariff it would be 2s. 6d., or 50 per cent, a difference of nearly Is. The Victhat torian rate in that case would be 50 per cent, in exeess of that which we proposed. Under these circumstances whilst to encourage a native industry which is deserving of encouragement, we are not going to the length to which Victorians have in this direction, and therefore the jibe the honourable member for North Sydney altogefcher undeserved. I should like to point out that the rates which we proposing - are not nearly so high as those which obtain in America. the rates are to an extent according to the value of the article, but the range of rates is from dollars and 20 per cent, per dozen to 7 dollars and 20 per cent, per dozen. it is very clear that our proposals, though devised for the proper protection of this - industry, fall far short as regards the amount of the duty to be collected, of duties which, previously operated in Vicprofits, toria, and do not approach the rates. We have heard gloomy forebodings from the free-traders concerning the disasby trous results to the consumer, the wageof the people. earner, and everybody else, which would follow the establishment,of an industry by that ? means of protection. Here we have a most striking ^lustration of the fallacy of all these prophecies. As regards the consumer, we find that he gets as good and as cheap goods in Victoria as can be obtained in any part of the world, whilst as regards wage-earner, the wages are as high as those to be found in any industry in Australia, and, at the ""same time, the - happiest relations exist between employers and men. On the other hand, where there might be, and otherwise would be 700 committee people unemployed, we have those people earning the means of subsistence not only for themselves, but for all who happen be dependent upon them, ing other industries, and their wages for the public the various channels of AVe have the further fact that it is necessary for Victoria fco import to any siderable extent, £50,000 branch of trade. But New South Wales has to send something like £220,000 out of - the countiy for the purpose of importing hats and caps to meet the daily wants of the people. The general principles of Mr Kingston. and free-trade are illustrated in this particular case, which eloquently proves protection is good for the consumer, the worker, and the country generally, and that the hat industry is a credit to the we intend State of Victoria.",22
55,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I look far beyond party in this gone matter, and I tender my thanks to those of honourable members who have assisted the is Opposition in bringing about the present also position. Without that assistance there are would have been a great blot on the national Tariff of Australia, and I conThere gratulatefchecoinmittee and the Government graduated that this fearful thing has not been perpetrated by an intelligent body of men.

Where has the honourable member for Maranoa heard working men asking for a cheaper hat than can be got in Victoria? I regret very much that the Government have been compelled to take up their present position, because I feel confident no benefit will result to the consumer. Instead of glorying in the fact of destroying an industry, honourable members ought to rejoice that there is this manufacture in our midst. For every wealthy manufacturer, I can show from ten to twenty wealthy importers.",23

61,Mr MAUGER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,Fro m the free-trade arguments one hears it would appear that manufacturing at a profit and giving employment to hundreds at good wages is an illegitimate business.,24

70,Mr MAUGER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"It is just as well the honourable member should explain, because honourable members on the Government side have had to restrain themselves considerably when they have been called ignorant robbers, possessing no knowledge of economics or commercial life. I really think the honourable member for Wentworth does not know what he says in regard to some of these duties, and it is because he is better than his theory that I respect him as I do. I believe that the alteration which is to be made will result in a reduction of wages, lessen the number of hands employed, and be generally prejudicial to this excellent industry. The items on which the duties were reduced yesterday have already had a detrimental effect. In the item under discussion we have to compete with India and with China, and yet' honourable members advocate low duties in the interests of the workers of those alien countries. I am confident a mistake is being made, but I take the best duty I can get in the interests' of my native country.",24

98,Mr KNOX,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," As one .who believes in the general principles. of free trade, but who is i prepared to support the amended proposal, I think it necessary .to - say ione or two-words. .1. regret that - Tariff they paid 2.4s. per dozen. occasionally! it has been thought necessary by .honourable members from New '.South Wales to import ,into the '.debate pressions which may be construed as more i or less derogatory ,toiindustries'which exist .in - Victoria; but-that, I . a m persuaded, inot:really intentional, .but-merely owing the heat of debate.

The manufac.pay-excellent wages, and the conper ditions under .which the industry is conducted ,are (favourable fco the health - inof the.se employed, while those - who .have embarked their capital get a valued substantial reward. I .am ,not .one who rate believes that either a.manufacturer or, an imper porter,, or. any one engaged in any.industry, is not-entitled to receive just and .adequate the i compensation for his labour or for the class - capital invested.",28
99,Mr THOMAS,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"We are told* that the conBut I sumer gets, his hats cheaper.",28
100,Mr KNOX,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I am not aware that there . is. any very - serious charge laid on the conthe sumer. I was very much impressed with the - straightforward, practical address given by the honourable member for Yarra,, and,it was .my privilege to hear all that-was said by : the the honourable member for Melbourne Ports; . and when honourable members, with such long practical experience, lay before .the comto mittee detailed information, they will always receive .and deserve the attention - which ad - was paid to : those honourable members. I shall always be diffident in speaking I on any subject; of which I have no practical-knowledge; but there has been in the con- siderafcion of this item. Had the Government persevered in their intention to, fix a duty I should have been compelled 61 to vote,against them ; .but I congratulate themon having made a compromise, which I more .sincerely hope honourable members will their unanimously accept. My reasons for exof pressing 'that opinion are based on some figures which have, been prepared for me, .and which show that hats ,invoiced.at 10s. - per dozen would, under the original .proposal of the Government, ,pay l is . 6d. in duty, whereas under the old Victorian Hats invoiced afc 20s. a dozen under the original proposal would pay 13s.; at 30s. . a dozen, ex14s. 6d. ;.and at 403. a dozen, 16s., as .against the Victorian Tariff , of 24s. in-each case. It will thus be seen' that even the is original,proposal of the Government meant a to - considerable reduction on the Victorian Tariff. I - understand that the average value of-.the - hats , which are ,imported in any Comquantity is about 60s. per dozen, the composite duty on which"" would ; have been 19s., as against 30s. under the Victorian Tariff. The composite duty in the last case means 31 per cent.; but now the Government have proposed a compromise which, under all the circumstances, I am prepared to accept in view of the peculiar conditions of this trade. Special attention has been called to the varying fashions in hats.",28
101,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,I thought the protectionist argument was that hats were no dearer in consequence of the duty.,29
102,Mr KNOX,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I do not want to enter into the general question, but merely to explain the action I intend to take. recognise that if the honourable and learned member for Werriwa and others would keep to one uniform pattern of hat, as I have done for someyears,fchediificulfciesoccasioned by the variations in fashion might be overcome.",29
103,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,Is the honourable member's hat locally made ?,29
104,Mr KNOX,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"My hats are always made here. But there is the practical difficulty fco which I have referred ; and as even the composite duty was a substantial reduction, and as this is an industry which deserves well of Victorian representatives, my intention is to vote for the Government proposal, as Ministers are willing to amend it.",29
105,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"We cannot strike out the specific duty here, but must follow the practice which we have observed throughout the discussion. We have hitherto left the duties as they stand, up fco the day on which we deal with them, providing for the change from the following day. If the"" honourable member for South  mitting his amendment in the form in which he moved it , no doubt the committee, will havefcovote on it, but I suggest that I may be allowed to move that on and after to-morrowfcheduty shall be 30 per cent. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir GEORGE TURNER) proposed - That the words ""and on and after the 6th December, 1901, 30 per cent."" be added to the duty ""men's, women's, boys', and children's hats, 10s. and 15 per cent.""",29
106,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I congratulate free-trade members on the position which they have assumed, and which has resulted in the withdrawal on the part of the Government of the excessive duties which were originally proposed - It is. clear that the Government see that the industry will not be prejudiced in any way by the reduction.",29
107,Mr FOWLER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,The Government have not admitted that.,29
108,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Then I will say that the Government see that the public interest will not be endangered byfchereduction of duties. Why, then, were we asked to support such a high duty? So far we have never gone beyond 25 per cent, on manufacturing lines, and it is wrong to single out a special class of industry, and consent, merely as a matter of compromise, to a I higher duty. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has himself pointed out that 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, would prevent imported hats coming into competition with local manufacturers.",29
109,Mr MAUGER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,That is wrong.,29
110,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Eve n supposing the honourable member uttered that statement by mistake, still the committee ought not to be called on to pass this extra duty in view of the assertion that, in New South Wales, hats similar to those manufactured in Victoria cannot be purchased for the same price as in the latter State. I will accept that statement, and believe that the hat company in Victoria is so patriotic that it prefers to sell hats here at a less price than could be got for them in New South Wales. But if that be the case no duty whatever is needed. We are told that this company always pays the best wages and never takes advantage of the duty; but the present directors may disappear at any moment and be succeeded by others who may not be guided by the same scrupulousbusiness habits. What is to prevent them, the moment the dufcyis passed by Parliament, from increasing the price of their hats up to the amount at which other hats can come into competition ' with theirs ? Ifc is perfectly clear that there could be no objection to their taking such an advantage offcheduty as business men. Under these circumstances the hat-makers could easily form themselves into a trust, sell their produce perhaps 5 per cent, below what could be obtained for imported hats, felt and pocket the difference of 25 per cent. There are 16,000 operatives in the clothing. and similar trades throughoutfcheCommonwealth, and the amount of duty we have given them is only 25 per cent. Why, then, should we hand over to an industry which employs only 1,350 hands, 2S0 of whom are in New South Wales, so high a duty as 30 per cent. 1 The Government have already come down from their original proposal, and as we have beaten them so far it would be a mistake give up the fight without endeavoring further reduce the duty. It is said that per cent, is a compromise. It is a comprofacturers mise tis between the prohibitionists protectionists, but it is no compromise between the protectionists of Victoria the free-traders offcherest of the Commonthe wealth. Let us look at the question from revenue point of view. It will bp found a duty which would bring in the maximum of revenue with the minimum of inconsucceeded venience and lessened consumption, would be about 15 per cent, -'on some articles, and not more than 5 to 10 per cent, on others. In this case the duty might run fco 15 per cent, without unduly lessening consumption. But we are now asked to imthey pose a duty of doublefchatamount. Therefore, before the duty is agreed to we afc all events to have some arguments vanced as to why a special exemption should be made in favour of a hat company, thus extorting taxes fromfchepeople.",29
111,Mr MCCOLL,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," The reason why this duty is fixed afc 30 per cent, is that all reductions are a matter of degree. In the past we have made reductions former protectionist duties of from 10 to per cent. In this case we are making reduction of from 50 to 100 per cent, on amount of the previous duty. It would a mistake to lay down a hard and fast rule. Each case should be considered on its merits. Considering that infchecase of hat trade so large a reduction made, the committee might to 30 per cent. Some fears have been expressed about the formation of a trust. I ' hope that with the larger market in every case. that will be opened up, in consequence of the establishment of the Commonwealth, hat factories will be established in all States. If that be done, there will 'danger of a trust. One great drawback at present is that traders cannot go to the factory and purchase hats. The whole not be equitably adjusted. produce of the factory has to pass through one or two firms, which control the article and thus prevent competition. Last night I said I would support a duty of 25 per cent., but the difference of 5 per cent, tween that and what is now proposed, is' not worth quarrelling about. I shall therefore vote for the duty of 30 per cent.",30
112,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Macquarie) While I am pleased at the moderation which has been displayed by the protectionists in to assisting us to bring about this reduction, I to regret that we have not been able to still 30 further reduce the duty. The hat manuof Victoria have had the benefit and the of very heavy protection for many as years, and claim to have established their and industry on a sound basis, and in view of fact that they have the raw material a ready to their hands, they should be in a that position to carry on successfully without high protection. If the Government had in their first proposal, a veryheavy tax would have been inflicted ontthe people of the Commonwealth, and particularly on the poorer classes, because the duty up would have represented an ad valorem impost of about 150 or 160 per cent, on the g<x>ds use, as contrasted with a duty of from -50 to 70 per cent, on the better class of ought goods. I am sorry that the Government adhave not seen their way to place this duty on the same footing as the duty on woollen goods, but I suppose we must be thankful for small mercies. Amendment agreed to.",30
113,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," As we have decided to do away on with composite duties in connection with 20 men's, women's, and children's felfc hats, a think we should adopt an ad valorem infche stead of a fixed duty for dress hats. We be have applied the ad valorem principle to woollens and blankets, which are items of much greater complexity than this, and the we should follow the same course in regard is being fco all articles of clothing. agree Sir GEORGE TURNER - We are not going fco admit the principle that ad valorem duties should be substituted for fixed duties",30
114,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"One of the principal objections to a fixed duty the in connection with the line we have just be no disposed of was that it would apply to fully ten different lines of goods of widely varying values, and that a fixed duty could I quite admit that that objection does not apply with the same force to dress hats, although there are two or three shades of value even in them. There is no necessity, however, to depart befrom the ad valorem principle in this case. I approve of fixed duties only where it is very difficult, to arrive at the-true value of an article, and where an ad valorem duty would probably offer premiums' to amendment fraud. Trie ad-valorem principle is' clearly to thatnow suggested' by the honour the best'to apply"" to'Hats of' all classes; I would therefore ask.'the Governmenb't'o what they-consider'a proper'ad valorem duty for this line, and adopt it as a' matter of' symmetry.",30
115,Mr GLYNN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I there-discussion would suggest that all hatsshould be subitems-in jected-to the same' ad valorem duty'. The' reason why a 10s: duty was-fixed-for' line, and 48s. foranother, wasbecause'it' was recognised that the element of valuesindicated. must be' to some extent considered; and in order to belogically correct; the Government ought to apply the ad valorem ciple' to all hats,- and to adoptthe same rate.",31
116,Sir GEOHGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,Forty-eigh t shiL lings perdozen' on-- dress equivalent to an ad valorem duty of about 33 per cent.,31
117,Mr GLYNN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"If we were to adopt a 30 per cent, ad valorem duty' all round, dress hatswould be taxed-proportionately to their value, ascompared'- wibh other hate:",31
118,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"There is not so much objection to the' 30 per'cent'. duty dress hats, but on sewn hats and caps; duty of 30 per cent, would represent a mere nothing.",31
119,Mr GLYNN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I see no reason why we should not"" adhere to the ad valorem ciple all through.",31
120,Mr CONROY,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I have avery strong feeling that the duty on f e hats which has just been fixed'per cent, advalorem should be reduced to 25 per cent., and I , therefore, propose to insert after' the amendment just agreed to the words "" and on-and 9th December,' 25 per cent."" already given away a great deal; and I feel that I should not be discharging my' duty to the people of New South Wales if I not showfchat it was impossible to fix. duty at alowerrate than that which been adopted.",31
121,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"A ; few days ago; when the salt duty was under'considerathe tion, a misunderstanding arose in'connection with its reduction.

I wish to point out that helmets are fixed on at a rate which I am sure is a mistake, and a I suggest that they should be included in the 30 per cent. list. In regard to dress hats, while I think it' would be a mistake to reduce the duty, I .cannofc-help recognisprining, the feeling of the committee on the matter.",31
124,Mr THOMAS,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I understand l t that miners' hats are exempt, and I should at 30' like to know what kind of hats are included within the exemption 1",31

127,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"There is. just one point I should like the committee to consider in .reference to. sewn hate and, caps, which are made of - material that is imported. These hats and caps, are madeup at a very low prices- I am, told-, that they do not cost more than 3s. 6d. per dozen. An ad valorem duty of 30 per cent, would therefore constitute a very small measure of protection to the local manufacturer of these lines. Sir WILLIAM "" MCMILLAN ' (Wentworth) - I ' think that the feeling of. the committee is against the, imposition, of. a fixed duty.

128,Mr THOMSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"North Sydney) Having abandoned the fixed duty uppn every other line in connection with, hats, it would be much more convenient, both to the Customs authorities, and to. importers,, if we imposed an ad valorem rate upon these articles.

129,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I feel that the desire of, the .committee is to hove an ad valorem duty.

135,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," If c is a question whether these articles ought not to be free. The canvas from which tents and tarpaulins are made has by a previous decision of the committee been put on the free list; and I think that mosfc, if not all, used in New South Wales are made within the State. It would be just as reasonable to call the hemming of a handkerchief an industry as to impose a protective duty under this heading. Why should we pretend that protection is required when it is not ? We have to considerfchepeople in the interior of the country where tents and tarpaulins are necessary for the purpose of covering men and goods. As there is involved no manufacturing process worth talking about, and we have made the raw material free, we should not stultify ourselves by imposing a duty here. I move That the words ""and on. and after 7fch December, l'fJOl . . . free"" be added. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to.

136,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I do not propose to object to this item, but I draw attention to the fact that ordinary ornaments, such as hat pins, have been charged as jewellery. I think a difference ought to be made between jewellery proper and ordinary hat ornamenfcs.",33
137,Mr KINGSTON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I shall be most happy to look into the matter, and although some of these ornaments are jewellery, and some are imitations of it , we shall endeavour to do justice to this mighty question. Item agreed fco. Item 67-Yarns , partly or wholly of wool, ad valorem 15 per cent. Special Exemptions. Yarn, Angora. Note -""Wool, "" or ""woollen, includes all manufactured from wool,, hair, or fur. Sir . GEORGE TURNER - We have reduced the duty on woollen goods by 5 per cent., and as some of these yarns have to be imported for the purpose of being worked up into the finished article, I have no objection to reduce this duty to 10 per cent. I move That the words "" and on and after 7th December, 1901, 10 per cent."" be added. Amendment agreed to.",33
138,Mr HUME COOK,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I m o v e Thatfchewords ""yarns unscoured on cop or cone,"" be inserted after "" Angora."" These yarns are used for making hosiery, and the yarns which are manufactured at Ballarat are not of the variety or quantity to meet the requirements of manufacturers throughout the States.",33
139,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"On e of the reasons which induced me to reduce this duty from 15 to 10 per cent, was a desire to give hosiery-makers a little more assistance. We must not forget, however, that we have given these hosiery-makers 25 percent, protection; and it is not unfair that we should look for a little revenue' from this particular line. Amendment negatived. Item, as amended, agreed to. . Mr WATSON (Bland). There . are certain bags which I should liked placed amongst the special exemptions, such as cotton flour bags of 25 lbs., 50 lbs., and 100 lbs. capacity, some of which are imported, though many are ma.6% in the ad States. I do not want to tax the larger classes of bags which are not made in the States, but only the smaller sorts which are supplied, with names and brands already printed on them, at the following charges: - Calico 7-lb. bags, 7£d. per dozen; 25-lb. bags, Is. 9d. per dozen; and 50-lb. bags, 2s. 6d. per dozen. On these bags I think we might reasonably place a duty of 10 per cent, seeing that in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and other States, a large number of people, amongst whom are women, are employed in making them. My desire is to omit flour bags from the Government exemptions, and to include potato and onion bags. I move:That the words "" Bags and sacks, cotton, of a capacity of not more than 3 bushels, n.e.i., 10 per cent., on and after 7th December, 1901,"" be inserted as Item 67A.",33
140,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"The Government do not object to this amendment in the form in which it has been proposed. The idea of the exemptions was to assist the farmer and the producing industries as much ' as possible, but asfchebags included in the amendment would not be used by that section of the community, and as there are a number of bag-makers in the different States, I cannot see that a duty of 10 per cent, would be unreasonable.",33
141,Mr THOMSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I do not think that the amendment is necessary, because for years past these small bags have been made in the country without any duty. But, apart from that, there is some danger in the form of the amendment. It would interfere with the export of flour. Why do we not put a duty upon ore bags? Simply because it would interfere with the producers of ore, and increase the cost of their product in the markets of the world. The same objection applies to a duty on 50-lb. flour bags. Certainly bags of that description should be exempt. Then, further, "" 3 bushels"" is rather a vague term. It would mean rather a large bag, and would include a number of bags which the honourable member for Bland does not wish, to include. It is likewise a mistake to use the word ""sacks,"" which is always applied to large-sized bags. even if the amendment is to be adopted, the wording should be altered.",34
142,Sir GEORGE TOWER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"We will reconsider the wording of the Tariff when the whole of the items have been discussed. - Mr BROWN (Canobolas) - This matter requires careful consideration. If a certain line of calico bags are made here just as cheaply as they can be imported, and the proposal will not add to the cost of producing the article placed in the bags, I fail to see that there is any heed for theamendmenfc. On the other hand, if it is going to prevent the importation of bags and to add to the producer's expenses, it will be an additional burden upon the farmers. As tofchesmallersized bags, I would point out that there is a general movement amongst the farmers of New South Wales to reduce the size of the bags in which they bag their wheat.",34
143,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,My amendment only includes cotton bags.,34
144,Mr BROWN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"If the amendment includes nothing' but cotton bags, that eliminates a good deal of my objection to it, but taking all considerations into account, I urgefcheGovernment not to accept it.",34
145,Mr RONALD,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Southern Melbourne) The poiufc has been raised as to whether the proposed duty will affect the farmer. I do not think it will. I also think that the amendment should include hessian bags, which are locally manufactured. There are some 500 workers in the industry in Victoria. They have had a measure of protection hitherto, and if it is withdrawn, there is a danger of them ceasing to make bags. To leave out hessian bags would be a blow to the local industry. A duty would not hurt the farmer, but wouldfall upon the milling, sugar-making, and salt industries, which are already protected. W it h the exemption of gunnies struck out, and with protection extended to hessians, the amendment would be'satisfactory. Our workers cannot compete with the 9d. a week labour of India. There is also the point that the imported bags to a large extent come from the plague-stricken districts of the East, and it is highly desirable that we should not have our meat and flour wrapped in materials so produced. Mr .MCCOLL (Echuca) - I trust that the honourable member for Bland will alter his amendment so as to make it read ""100 lbs. and under,"" instead of "" 3 bushels."" That measurement is altogether So that too great.",34
146,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"If c would all depend upon what was put in the ba<;s if we made it read "" 100 lbs.""",34
147,Mr MCCOLL,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"The term "" 3 bushels "" is very vague. W it h regard to including hessians, I would point out that they are largely used as chaff bags by the farmers, and should not be made dutiable. At the same time, I may point out that it is curious that we should propose a duty for the bag-maker, whilst there is no duty for the benefit of the sail-maker and the tent-maker.",34
148,Mr SKENE,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," There is no doubt that a duty on hessians would affect the farmer very much. In both Victoria and New South Wales the question of handling grain at a cheaper rate is engaging a good deal of attention, and the decision afc present lies between the erection of grain elevators and the adoption of the Californian system of using small 100-lb. bags. As far as I have been able to follow the discussion on the matter, I feel very strongly that 100-lb. bags will probably be adopted here. The Americans have been using elevators in the Eastern States for many years, and as they have not adopted them in California, there is no doubt good reason for supposing that where wheat has to be conveyed .long distances-by sea. the use of' small bagshas. distinct advantages.",34
149,Mr WAITSONV,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"The . amendment would' not affect: jute or, otherbagssuch as wouldt be used by the-farmers Mr SKENE.;-Tar n referringto hessian;. which T thinkshould' be-< free from duty; as they. are. very, largely vised by the farmers.  the farmeu-would be very seriously affected' by this-proposal,, because when/we adopt the system of shippingwheat in bulk,.he.'will use very much smaller bagsfon the. purpose of conveying; his grain from the- 1 farm to the-railway station:",35
150,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," The honourable member, quite misunderstands the amendment. It is - not intended to' subject to d any material that is likely to.be used:for making wheat bag?. The proposal, is limited entirely, to cotton bags, such as are used for flour and oatmeal and. similar products. A number of women and. children are engaged in . thisbag-making industry throughout the various States, and I do not think 10 per* cent, would be too much protection to give-theni. It would not lead to any great increase in the price of the article, because 7-lb. cotton bags with the name of the purchaser printed on them and ready for use are sold for. 7^d. per dozen:",35
151,Mr THOMSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,The- - honourable member should exempt-50-lb'. fl'Our-bags from the operation of the duty.,35
152,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Yes ; I recognise the desirability of doing that. As there seeing to be some difficulty inwording the amendment in such a way as to meet with the approval of the - committee, I am prepared to abandon it for'the present.",35
153,Mr MAUGER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I hope the amendment will! not be withdrawn, because the bags used by farmerswill not be affected: No one will be. prejudiced by such a duty, but, on-the-otherrhand, it will operate to the advantage, of the'--women 1 and childrenengaged in the bag-making' industry.",35
154,Mr CROUCH,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I am authorized by the honourable member for Wimmera to say that he now> seesthat the proposed duty will not affect the farmer, and I hop'e the honourable member"" for Bland will persevere with his amendment.

156,Mr HARPER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I agree with<. u t y the honourable member - for North Sydney fchafc-an exemption should be made in. favour offlou r bags, and. the Ministry might consider; this - matter with a view to meeting the wishes of - the committee;",35
157,Mr A MCLEAN,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I think thatflourbagseven smaller than 50-lb.. bags, might be exempted, becausethere is a strong: tendency towards the-use-ofi smallerbags for the shipmentof flour. If we can export flour instead of wheat it will bevery much better for us, because we shall provide additional, employmentfon-our people* Therefore we should, do nothing toadd to the. cost: of exportation.",35
158,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Perhaps it might be well if-the Government had a. further opportunity of' looking into this* matter. My own impression-, is. that', as a, large number of these 'bags are made here, ifcwould be at reasonable thing; to impose a duty such as suggested. If the committee allow the amendment to be withdrawn-, m y colleague the Minister for Trade and Customs and myself will consider the. matter, and, if possible, bring forward some recommendation Amendment; by leave,, withdrawn.",35
159,Mr MCCOLL,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I move That the, words, ""Hosiery, not o£ wool, or silk, for foot-andhand wear, on and after 7th December; 190.1, 10 per cent.,be inserted as. Item. 8-7 A. So far. as my knowledge goes, these articlesare not made here, and as they-are used by the poorer classes, theyshould nob be subject to the heavy duty of25 per. 'cent., provided ' afc present.",35
160,Mr TUDOR,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I trust, the com mittee will not agree to the amendment, because I can assure the honourable member for Echuoathat cotton hosiery is made within the - Commonwealth: shown: the honourable' member for' Bland 1 samples of ""thelocally-manufactured goods, and I think that the industry, should receive the assistanceof the25 per cent, duty.",35
161,Sir GEORGETURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"If thes&goodshad not been made' here we should have proposed a lower rate of duty; but our. information'shows that the manufacture of cotton hosiery is likely, to become avery important' industry. We allow the raw material to come infreefor the purpose of encouraging the industry, which' gives employment to a. largenumber of people; and I ' trust therefore that, the honourable 1 member for Echuca will not persist in hisamendraent.",36
162,Mr MCCOLL,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I occupy a: 'similar position to. the honourable member for Bland' in connection withthismatter I am quite prepared: to allowi t to stand over till.further inquiry has-been made, witha view to eliciting the fullest possible information upon it . Amendment; by leavey withdrawn.",36
163,Mr WATSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," I mentioned a day or two ago that I intended to move that the materials of which waterproof clothing, is made should be placed upon the free list. But I find that it will be extremely difficult to include these materials in the schedule of special exemptions, and so long as the people who import the cloth and those who make it up are placed, upon approximately the same footing, I . shall be quite satisfied. My sole desire is to insure that those who manufacture waterproof clothing from imported cloth shall not be placed at any disadvantage. I am willing that a duty of 10 per cent, upon piece goods used in the manufacture of waterproof clothing shall be imposed with - the view to later oh reducing the duty upon the made-up waterproof cloth to a corresponding degree. I therefore move'Thatfchewords ""Piece goods not containing silk, used in the manufacture of cloth made waterproof with india rubber, on and after the7th December, 1901, JO per cent,""'be inserted as-Itern 67A. If what I ' propose is carried,- or if the material, used in the mamufacfcuiie of waterproof clothing is imported subject to . departmental regulations, it will allow of an all-round duty of some-kind being fixed. Possibly it - might be well fco insert after* ""india rubber"" the words ""subject fco 1 I ' ' Have departmental regulations. "" 1",36
164,Mr KINGSTON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"I ask the honourable member forBland' whether he will agree to put his. amendment in-the following, for m ""Cloth..not. containing - silk, fco be usedforwaterproofing' with india-rubber pursuant to departmental regulations:"" Mr THOMSON*-That wouldconfer too large a. power on the Minister. :",36
165,Mr KINGSTON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"It hasalready been agreedi to in connection with"""" narcotics "" 1 and: "" stimulants-. "" The regulationwould; ofcourse, provide that thecloth must not beused-foiany other purpose. Otherwise. I do not? think-that a sufficient descriptioncan be given to the clothto identify it. If ' the honourable member for. Bland has no objection,, the Government-would prefer to put the amendment in the form I ' have indicated. The result of such'a provision would be that the cloth , would not be admitted upon the 1 terms laid, down in the Tariff;, unless theCustomsauthorities were - placed in a position to see that it was used for the purpose for. which it was imported. Mr WATSON^-I think that on the whole it would bebetter-to usefche-words-"" piece goods notrcontaining silk, fco be used in-the manufacture of cloth, &o.""",36
166,Mr KINGSTON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"If we put it in that form the Customs, authorities will lose comfcrol over the cloth immediately the entry is passed, which is not a desirable thing. . Surely, when, the rate of duty to be paid dependsupon the purpose to whiclifchecloth is to be put; fcheCustoms officials-ought to have some means of-seeing, that it. is used for - the purpose for which it is intended to be used Mr A . C. GROOM- (Hinders) - I think that these articles should be placed upon the freelist. They are the raw materials of water-proof) manufacturers-. They cannot be - manufactured for other purposes -; indeedt they cannot be manufactured., in any ofth e States of the Commonwealth:. If we . impose-a-duby of'10 per cent;, uponfchem,asoi natural corollary therate upontliefinished. 1 article' must also be increased. That mea-ns. 1 that: the price of"" waterproof cloth will be 1 increased to the consumer,, and it must be remembered, that wafcenpi-oof"" coats* are in general use throughout: the community. If we impose a duty? of* 10 per cent, upon the raw; materials used in. themanufacture of waterproof clothing, and follow up our action by levying a 25 per cent, rate upon the manufactured garment, the consumer will have to pay the additional 15 per cent. As these articles cannot be made here-and I have seen a letter from one of the Ballarat mills, stating that they cannot;-why should we tax the raw materials, and thus increase the cost of waterproof goods throughout the Commonwealth ? 1",36
167,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Af c the present time most of these articles at 15 per cent. We did propose to impose a duty of 20 per cent, upon the india rubber cloth. The garments made from that cloth will be dutiable at 25 per cent. This is an industry which provides a certain amount of work, though, perhaps, not a large amount. Probably in time it will become a large industry. After getting further information from the honourable member for Bland and others, - we thought that we had hardly allowed a fair margin between the duty imposed upon the material out of which the article has to be made and the duty upon the article itself. We desire to give a 10 per cent, margin. That means allowing the imported clobh to come in ab 15 per cent, insbead of 20 cent. If we impose a duby of 15 per cenb. upon the raw maberials, we shall be doing an injustice bo the manufacturers of the clobh. Ab the same time there is no reason why we should allow the raw materials to come in free, and give the manufacturers a 15 per cenb. pi-obecbion. The honourable member for Flinders would give 10 per cenb. protection to the makers of the cloth, and 15 per cent,fcothe manufacturers of the garment. If we admit; the raw materials free we shall be throwing away a certain amount; of revenue, because these articles are imported. But if we levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon the raw materials, of 15 per cent, upon the cloth, and of 25 per cent, upon the made-up article, we shall be allowing a fair margin between the three. The honourable member for Bland has suggested that we might admit the raw materials at a lower rate, subject to departmental regulation. I bhink that ib is absolubely necessary for us bo adopt thab course. Certainly we are nob going to allow these goods, to be imported ancl used for purposes obher bhan bhose for which they were intended.",37
168,Mr RONALD,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME,"Southern Melbourne) I bhink that the proposal of the Governare menb is a very fair compromise. This broublesome distinctions blian these We indusbry is a very flourishing one. Already bhei-e is one factory esbablished in our midst which has invested £50,000 in the venture. It employs a large number of hands, and bo my mind a fair margin of probecbion should be extended bo it. One could have wished that the Treasurer had proposed a differential duby of 10 per cent, bub in order to avoid complications I hope that the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland will are dutiable be accepbed.",37
169,Mr THOMSON,ORDNANCE BRANC H OVERTIME," The question of admitting the raw material subjecb bo departmental regulation has been referred bo, bub according bo my recollection we have not yeb passed anything subjecb to such regulations. Honourable members have yeb bo determine bo whab extent they will allow the Tariff bo go bhrough conbaining such large powers as bhose suggesbed. Ib has been said that the exemption conbained ' under the * heading of "" narcotics and stimulants"" is subject bo departmental regulation. It was undersbood that exemptions were to be taken ab the end of each division, bub they have nob been put to the commibtee' until bhis or the previous item. There seems to be no need for the words "" pursuanb to departmental by-laws,"" because if the material is said to be used for the manufacture of waterproofs, the Customs aubhoribies can insisb on any proof they consider necessary.",37

There - should be some less v here only partially legislate in connection with the Tariff, because the Customs authorities come after us. Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN * (Wentworth) - I am not sure that this item ought not to be free. We differentiate simply in order to get raw material as cheaply as. possible for what we consider Australian industries, and there is little good in unearthing this article from the 15 per cent, category unless we make it absolutely free. I am always against these exemptions if they can possibly be avoided, because they offer tremendous inducements to fraud.",37

That was not what we provided f n committee, and, as a matter of fact, all linings may be suitable for other purposes.
