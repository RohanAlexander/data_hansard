4,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIAN OLYMPIC TEAM,"This was the most successful team in the last 30 years. We pay particular tribute to those who won medals. There is, of course, simply no greater achievement in sport. While all Australians shared these triumphs, I am sure they would also like to convey their appreciation of all the competing athletes. The principal honour is to represent Australia and to compete at the greatest sporting event in the world. All those who NA Hansard 1992 (SIXTH PERIOD) Representatives passed on 25 June 1992, the House went and represented Australia brought honour on themselves and their country. On behalf of the House and the people of Australia, I congratulate them and thank them.",10

7,Dr HEWSON,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"On behalf of the Opposition parties, I would like to add our congratulations to our athletes who did so well in the recent Barcelona Olympics. It is very important that we acknowledge the tremendous success that they had and the medals that they won. But, equally, I think it is important that we recognise that they went there and did their best for Australia. We thank them for that. NA",10

10,Mr SPEAKER,SOUND REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM,Order! He will be joined by the honourable member for Gippsland. They will make a dynamic duo. The new system will not work as well if honourable members put speech notes in front of the microphones. If they do not do that they will be heard even better than they were before. NA Budget 1992-93,11
11,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer him to his statement to the Parliament on 31 March this year which states: ... if we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year, the whole lot of us ought to give it away. I ask the Prime Minister: if the Budget tonight forecasts growth of less than 4 per cent, will he be a man of his word and give the game away? After 10 years of getting it wrong, why should anyone believe anything he predicts tonight?",11

16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my left will cease interjecting.,11
17,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I made that claim, which I repeat, in contrast to the sort of Opposition that growth does not matter and that what one should do is keep a pool of unemployment to keep wages restrained and inflation low. They are the miserable policies of those opposite. They do not believe that the Australian economy should grow at 4 per cent or be able to grow at 4 per cent. After nearly 30 years in office, we were growing at 4 per cent and the demand spilled into imports; that is, you were able to build so spare capacity into the economy that after 4 per cent growth it all rushed to imports. You should just hang your heads in shame because after 30 years here, while all the economies around us were growing at sixes and eights and nines, the best we could do in Australia before it spilled into imports was 4 per cent under the hopeless, dumb policies of the present Opposition. I repeat the claim that if Australian economic policy is such that we aim at 2 to 3 per cent growth in the economy or less-if we aim for those sorts of policies over the medium term-if we do not believe that we can go back to 4 per cent plus rates of growth so that we can have the rates of employment growth that actually bring unemployment down, then what is the point of the kinds of economic prescriptions in which Australia will have trafficked in recent years, indeed in the last 20 years? What we are seeing at the moment is the economy coming into recovery. We h a v e seen the economy grow by 1.6 per cent over the course of the last 12 months. This is why the doomsayers of the Opposition were saying it was still negative, in recession and contracting. Of course, they were wrong. It was growing and growing positively by 1.6 per cent. Mr Thckey-You have had 10 years and you have failed.",11
18,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the Budget is released tonight, you will see the Government's forecasts for growth over the course of 1992-93 as the economy continues to gather pace. But the notion that We should restrain it to some low rate of growth so that we maintain a permanent pool of unemployment, in the wickedness of such a policy, in the view of the cynicism of such a policyMr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order and refer to standing order 145 on the matter of relevance. I have heard the Prime Minister referring very broadly to a lot of matters which I do not think are relevant to the question. The fundamental basis of the question was to ask the Prime Minister whether, if tonight's Budget forecast growth is less than 4 per cent, he will be a man of little his word and give the game away. I would like him to answer that question.",11
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. The Prime Minister was asked a question about growth. The Prime Minister was answering the question.,11
20,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is talking about unemployment.,11
21,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This Government in the 1980s committed itself,12
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the honourable member for O'Connor interjects again I will deal with him.,12
23,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This Government in the 1980s explicitly committed itself to employment and we had three times the OECD average rate of employment. As a result, the labour market is 25 per cent larger now than it was in 1983. We did not believe that a pool of unemployment should be there as a brake on wage demands, to hold inflation down. That is what the Opposition believes. That is why it is not committed to employment growth. That is why it is happy with low rates of economic growth. The very essence of economic policy is for economic growth, better living standards and higher incomes. Anyone who believes the contrary should quit the game. The Leader of the Opposition does believe the contrary. Economic Policy",12
24,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of calls to significantly tighten economic policy? Does the Prime Minister see any merit in such propositions? What are the Government's intentions in this regard?,12
25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said a moment ago, the economy is emerging from the recession with growth over the year of 1.6 per cent but it has been emerging more slowly than any of us would have liked. Unemployment is at 11 per cent and causing real hardship for many. So we need growth, as I said a moment ago, at a sufficient pace to create lasting jobs. The combination of a soft world economy and ""a corporate sector hesitant after the excesses of the 1980s mean that left to its own the economy will not deliver growth and jobs early. Government action is needed and that is precisely what the Government has done by relaxing monetary policy on 13 consecutive occasions over the period. The One Nation and Young Australia initiatives will boost activities, while the Government's introduction of far-reaching reforms will make the economy more capable.",12
26,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,One Nation has gone by the board.,12
27,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bendigo!,12
28,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The stimulus we provided together with the measures we will announce tonight are entirely appropriate. Need I remind the House that in the OECD tabulations in 1991 Australia had the lowest ratio of general government debt to GDP of the 18 OECD countries. The fact is we are able to use the gains in fiscal policy of the 1980s as they are unable to use them in the United States and other countries. Mr Sharp-You have changed the figures again.,12
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore will cease interjecting.,12
30,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is in marked contrast to the policies of the Opposition. What we have in the Opposition is a blind faith in ideology. The other day the Opposition Leader said that we should produce a Budget deficit of $6 billion to $7 billion-that is, with a starting point deficit of $13 billion, he wants to cut nearly 2 per cent of GDP out of the Commonwealth Budget at a time of high unemployment. That would absolutely kill the recovery stone-dead. It is a two percentage point of GDP withdrawal of Government support-the cushioning which the Government Budget provides at this time. This call for a $6 billion to $7 billion deficit is motivated by one of two things: the obsessive desire to be seen to be different, no matter how silly the statement, or a blind faith in ideology. At any rate, he does not have the support of almost any thinking Australian person. I know he would have been entirely irritated by a report of the Governor of the Reserve Bank today having said, under the heading 'RBA chief supports use of fiscal pump'",12
31,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting Mr Sharp-He is your appointment.,12
32,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The honourable member for Gilmore will cease interjecting.,12
33,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These are the people he wants to have a totally independent charter; the people he believes should be set in a shrine of independence. But when they speak and they cut across his policy, they are maligned and rebuked. The Governor is reported as having said: ... fiscal policy had a key role to play in stabilising the economy and reawakening economic growth. Imagine taking 2 per cent of GDP out of the Budget at this time. The stupidity! The Governor said that it was better to control inflation with a mix of economic management tools. He mentioned fiscal policy, microeconomic reform and the accord as other key policy arms to use in the inflation fight. In other words, they are the views of an entirely sensible person who has been involved in national budgeting and economic policies for a decade and who makes the obvious point that with the economy slow and unemployment high, the natural stabilisers in the Commonwealth Budget and the fiscal stimulus are entirely appropriate things to be We have this sort of stupid statement that we take 2 per cent of GDP-$6 billion to $7 billion-out of the starting point deficit. To do what? Where would the $6 billion to $7 billion come from? It would come from health. Mr Snowdon-Education.",13
34,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would come from education; it would come from sports, the arts and the environment and it would come from social security. It would come from State government programs-as Dr Hewson beat up on the poor, the elderly and the sick to try to produce a starting point Budget which would be entirely inappropriate for the country and its times. Is it any wonder that in Inside Canberra this week we see this little reference, which I thought was rather jolly: What infuriates much of the manufacturing sectortalking about industryis the apparent arrogance of Messrs Hewson (a professor of economics), Reith and Howard (subueconomic rban solicitors) and MCLachlan (a grazier), in refusing to listen to any criticism at all of their economic rationalist policies. Mr Atkinson-Me Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Parramatta asked a question with regard to the Government's intentions on economic policy. The Prime Minister has been reading from the Australian Financial Review and some other article that suits his purposes. I suggest that you direct him to get back to the specific question he was asked.",13
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister was answering the question. The Prime Minister was in order.,13
36,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjectingMrSPEAKER-Order! Members on both sides will cease interjecting.,13
37,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The real point is that even the people in big business will not cop the Leader of the Opposition these days: the  leader of Ford; Mr Johnston, the leader of Toyota. Dr Hewson is out of step with using. everybody of substance in the Australian community. Mrs Sullivan interjecting Mr Bradford interjecting",13
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Moncrieff! The honourable member for MCPherson!,13
39,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yet what he proposes now is that we should, with 11 per cent unemployment, bring· down a Budget which cuts $7 billion out of the starting point deficit to produce a Budget 2 per cent of GDP lower, which would kill the recovery in its tracks and remove the stimulus which has been provided. Again, much to his constant irritation, that person whom he seeks to enshrine in the central bank with an independent charter comes out and supports the Government's policy of a proper role for fiscal policy in providing a fiscal stimulus. Budget 1992-93",13
40,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that six months ago he produced an statement forecasting 4.75 per cent growth and a return to a Budget surplus in 1995-96. Is it not a fact, Prime Minister, that both predictions are now totally discredited and you have been shown to have cooked the books? After 10 years of getting it wrong why should anyone believe anything you predict tonight?",13
41,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,14
43,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is an amazing twist of events that yesterday we had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition writing to the Secretary of the Treasury requiring him to tell the Deputy Leader that the figures in tonight's forecast of the Budget were not figures simply adopted by the GovemmentMr Tim Fischer-Massaged.,14
44,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'massaged' as you put it-against Treasury wishes. The same officials that you will not even allow or rely upon to draft a tax policy and the same officials of whom you say, 'The coalition's plans do not include the bureaucrats' are the officials to whom we now, in some crazy concoction, have to hand over the Budget forecasts, the Budget policy and the Budget Speech entirely. Dr Bob Woods-That would be a risk.",14
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Lowe.,14
46,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, on the one hand, last week the Treasury officials were not to be trusted. A week ago they could only draft tax Bills improperly, with the major accountancy firms doing the drafting, but today-this week-it is all about the Treasury officials supposed to be in charge of the whole process. But of course in the most outrageous example of cooking the numbers-the rubbery figures forecasts of 1977-who was the economic adviser? Opposition members-Ha, hal",14

53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Higgins!,14
54,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was none other than that nimble-footed, go-getting ministerial adviser, Dr Hewson. He was at the heart of the rubbery figures shemozzle. This is in the days when in the ,last Howard Budget",14
55,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Next you will tell us where Captain Cook went wrong.,14
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Parkes will cease interjecting. Mr KEATING:-This is the sort of thing we had in coalition Budgets. In the 1982-83 Budget, the official text said: There could be some decline in overall gross domestic product in 1982-83. It continued: There is unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83. That is the sort of rubbish that you used to hand up as forecasts.",14
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You said it. This is on record.,14
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bennelong will cease iriterjecting.,14
59,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If I did I was entitled to.,14
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The substance of the Prime Minister's assault on the Opposition is a proposition that Budget figuring ought not be totally a matter of responsibility of public servants. Government members-Sit him down.",14
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,14
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you going to let me finish? Government members-There is no·point of order. ' Mi' SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Bennelong is beginning to debate the matter.,14

64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bennelong will get directly to his point order.,15
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,that the substance of the Prime Minister's assault upon the Opposition is that public servants should not be given responsibility of casting Budget figures.,15
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,15
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is the very thing that he criticised us for allowing 10 years ago.,15
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Bennelong will resume his seat. There is no point of order, and if the honourable member for Bennelong or other honourable members attempt to take points of order such as that again I will deal with them.",15
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,15
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members on my right will cease interjecting.,15
71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it is worth recalling that it was only under this Government that it became the tradition to base the Budget parameters, which underpin the outlay of revenue estimates, on JEFG forecasts. Prior to that the Budget parameters were simply plucked from the air. It is only under this Government that detailed forecasts have been published. Those are the facts, Mr Speaker. The fact is that the Department which the Leader of the Opposition maliciously described as politicised is a department which yesterday his deputy said should have total control of the Budget. He said a week ago that the Opposition would not trust the same bureaucrats to draft tax law but today they are to be entirely in charge of the presentation of the Budget.",15
72,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He said what you had done before.,15
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,15
74,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well of course the Budget Papers are the property of the Government. They have to be the Government's documents. Of course they are professionally prepared. At the end of the day, the Budget forecasts have to be acceptable to the professional forecasters of the Treasury and the of other members of the joint economic forecasting group, but in particular to the Treasury, and they have always been. What we find here is the same blackguarthe ding of the Treasury officers as we have seen of Reserve Bank officials, to the point now that most people in the financial markets regard Dr Hewson's attacks upon the central bank as simply ratbaggery. He has lost the respect, if he had any, of that group as he has lost the respect of every serious bureaucrat in Canberra who knows that it is entirely improper and would border on corrupt to have the private accountancy firms drafting tax law. Youth Unemployment",15
75,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the Minister advise on progress with implementation of the national employment and training plan for young Australians announced by the Prime Minister on 27 July? Have any alternatives to the Government's strategy been put forward? What are the Government's intentions in this matter?",15

77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Gilmore!,15
78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to be able to tell him that a great deal of progress has been made, even though those conclusions were reached only a few weeks ago. On the landcare environment action program consultations are under way with State governments and non-government agencies, and there has been enthusiastic supportMr Ronaldson interjecting",15
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Ballarat will cease interjecting.,15
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"from governments and organisations, including the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Local Government Association, Greening Australia, and Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. We expect first placements in the program within the next two months. On the piloting of the Carmichael report and implementation of Career Start a traineeships, guidelines for pilot projects been developed-endorsed by industry parties and all State governments-and are now chooses to do this. being widely promulgated to employer and union bodies, major employers and State Speaker. education and training authorities. Proposals for the first round of pilots will be called 4 September. We expect significant announby cements on consultations with all major employer groups, State governments and weeks ago. union representatives on the introduction of career start traineeships in the near future. There are additional incentives, of course, for recruitment of apprentices and trainees. The extra incentive payments in place for recruitment of additional trainees are there now for those recruited after 30 June, and him. increased incentive payments for additional apprentices and trainees have been extended until 30 June 1993. The Skillshare youth unit's guidelines have been finalised and applications for funding will be called by end of the month. The Australian youth initiative grants applications and guidelines have been distributed to youth and organisations. With the Jobstart card linked to a guarantee for accredited training places, Jobstart's duration has been improved for maximum impact of Jobstart subsidies and we will be announcing details of that in Budget tonight. The consultations are in with the States and about to commence with private training providers to ensure provision of appropriate places when and where they are needed. The honourable member also asked questions about whether there have been alternatives. Of course during the course of that week we had a struggle from the Leader of the Opposition to try to get hlmself heard above the sensible propositions that were being put to us by various organisations representative of youth or about to employ them, and to get his views across. When he ultimately decided to place his view record, however, in any form of detail, he chose to drop it in Western Australia on a Friday. All of us in Federal politics from Western Australia know this: be very careful of a wise man from the east who turns up on Friday to drop a major policy announcement have· because we in Western Australia know exactly what the Opposition is up to when it Mr ThckeyI raise a point of order, Mr I draw your attention to the fact that this is Question Time prior to Budget night. for The Minister is clearly wasting our time, first making this statement and secondly by raising old news. He ran this story three",15
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. Mr Thckey-He is wasting time.,16
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor that if he continues to take points of order like that I will deal with Mr Thckey-I have a further point of order.,16
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member the for O'Connor on a further point of order. Mr ThckeyWasting time at Question Time is not an irrelevant point of order and community I should not be threatened.,16
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat.,16
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the edification of the the honourable member for O'Connor, who is train obviously having trouble getting the old mouth going on the first day of the new session, an interesting new twist was added by the Leader of the Opposition in his announcements the other day when referring to the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition wanders around talking about us cutting the deficit, on his suggestion, from about $13 billion down to about $7 billion. What did we get from the Leader of the Opposition when in Western Australia? We got what in his terms was an unfunded public announcement that adds at least $500m to the Fightback outlays, without any suggestion as on the to how that is going to be made up. Opposition members-No, no, no!",16
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Opposition members-Wrong! wrong!,17
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,17
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us now take a look at the heroic assumptions that underlie the particular propositions p-t fo-ard by the Opposition. Those opposIte saId that they would trump us with a $945m proposal over our $720m proposal. The only unfortunate thing about that, of course, is that what they included under that is about $1.3 billion worth of Commonwealth expenditure. So in their extreme generosity to TAFE, they are talking about a $300m cut. But they still had $720m to make up. How were they going to do it? They would do it on the savings of Austrain they said. I am afraid that the Austrain savings were already incorporated within their Fightback proposals, so they are out. There are no Austrain savings to be included. The rest, the $720m, according to those opposite, would come off the savings to be gained from young people going off the dole. What does that produce? There is a reasonable estimate around that for every 100 people placed by wage subsidy proposals, 85 people are effectively put off. So there is a net gain of about 15. It is true that in some our labour market programs we do better than that, but if that is the case-and this is so whether the subsidy is provided by the Commonwealth or by the young person going on to the $3 or $3.50 an hour rate-then a combination of these factors means that for every 100,000 young people taken off unemployment benefit and placed in a youth wage job, the net annual saving is about $85m. In May this year there were 170,000 people under 21 on the dole, receiving an average of $100 per week. Even if every single one of these 170,000 suddenly decided to take a youth wage, which in many cases would pay less than their unemployment benefit, the total savings would be no more than about $145m, or $430m over three years. But Dr Hewson needs to find $720m if his new proposal is to be fully funded. So to get that level of savings, over 280,000 unemployed young people would have to go onto a youth wage, but there are only 170,000 of them available. The net total produced is nought. So basically Dr Hewson has to invent effectively another 110,000 young unemployed people and then get all 280,000 of them into subsidised employment in which they provide the wage subsidy. Mr Connolly interjecting",17
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bradfield will cease interjecting.,17
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point about all this, of course, is that the Leader of the Opposition marched into Western Australia, produced a whole set of totally bogus figures concerning the propositions that he puts forward and punched at least a $500m hole in Fightbackat least a $500m hole-and refused to subject himself to any questioning by anybody in the gallery or from anywhere else who knows anything about the sorts of issues that he was dealing with, and has been refusing ever since. He marches in here and has the hide to tell us that we ought to be taking $7 billion off the forward indication of the starting point deficit of some $13 biIIion. Well, bully for him! He has a Western Australian policy in which he ignores his self-imposed task of paying for things, and an eastern States of analysis in which he subjects us to tests that he is not prepared to impose on himself when he is doing his own programming. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On many previous occasions you have ruled and asked Ministers to bring their answers to an end because of the length of those answers. In the interests of fair play and in accordance with the Standing Orders, I ask you to apply that dictum on this occasion.",17
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am always willing to be more than fair with the Leader of the National Party. ..,17
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude with one other interesting figure that might be drawn from this. That package dropped in Western Australia, as I said, by Nicodemus in the nightMr Nehl- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to standing order 145, which states: An answer shall be relevant to the question. None of the information provided by the Minister is relevant to the question that he was asked. He was not asked about Dr Hewson or any Opposition policy; he was asked about the implementation of his own policy. Why does he not tell us what he is doing?",17
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister was asked a question about the implementation of the Government's policy, whether any alternative proposals have been put forward and what the Government's intentions were. The Minister is in order in answering the question and he will continue.",18
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am dealing with what was the sort of alternative proposition that came from your side of the House, the sort of alternative for what we describe as youth and what you describe as couch potatoes. Mr Tim Fischer-Bring it to an end!",18
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party will cease interjecting.,18
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take the final point that the Opposition Leader spoke about in his Nicodemus policy dropped in Western Australia. He said that the Opposition would create 100,000 new jobs in the next two years. At the displacement rate we have been talking about, which is a reasonably well tested figure, to create 100,000 new jobsthat is, net additional jobs-would require in the order of 670,000 youth wage positions. That is nearly 45,000 new MCDonald's outlets at 15 per outlet. Under the Liberal Party policy, if those opposite get an opportunity to implement it, obviously we will get a MCDonald's on every street comer, serviced by people they no longer, at that time, hopefully,' consider to be couch potatoes. Budget 1992-93",18
97,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and follows his last answer. I refer the Prime Minister to serious allegations in the Sydney Morning Herald on 13 August 1992 that, in the 1988 Budget, his office directed Treasury to adopt certain investment forecasts; in the 1989 Budget his staff changed Treasury's forecast for the current account deficit from $21 billion to $18 112 billion-in fact, it came in at $22 billion, to refresh his memory; in the 1990 Budget the economic growth forecasts were raised significantly above the initial official estimate. I ask the Prime Minister: are these serious allegations about political interference in the preparation of Budget forecasts correct and, given his appalling record over 10 years of getting it wrong, why should anyone in his right mind believe any predictions he makes tonight?",18
98,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"' Allegations of substance', he says, from a journalist who, two days earlier, put a $16 billion Budget story on the front page, who was told twice that it was wrong, but he still had it published-a journalist without a shred of creditability and without any integrity. There is no more integrity in this than in the second story. When you put the country's foreign exchange markets at risk with a falsehood that you know to be a falsehood, you know that is a problem. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Did you fudge the figures in 1988, 1989 or 1990?",18
99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Opposition members-Oh!,18
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,18
101,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Never has there been more integrity in the Budget process than under this Government-never! As I said earlier, the Budget parameters were plucked from the air in the days of coalition budgeting. You never even published Forward Estimates of outlays. You would have a starting point which nobody knew anything about. Nobody knew about it; you could never calculate it. Mr Reith-Did you fudge the documents or not?",18

104,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Imagine publishing a reconciliation statement of movements and just outlays between the last Budget and this Budget, then publishing three years of Forward Estimates, and then being accountable for all movements in between years. Then you have the gall to suggest that, on this side of the House, we fudge numbers when, on your side of the House, you would not even publish a Forward Estimate, let alone a reconciliation. Your starting point was some starting point number that had no relevance whatsoever-not some reconciliation between the last Budget and the year's spending, just something adopted by you. It is the same with your Budget forecast. Imagine saying things such as this: 'There can be some decline in overall gross domestic product in 1982-83'; and 'There is unlikely to be any growth in employment'. Those were the sorts of cursory judgments and explanations which were given to what are now the Rolls Royces of Budget documents worldwide-known to be so, said to be so by every OECD assessor and every IMF assessor.",18

133,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Never has the value of these policies been more apparent than is the case now-policies to encourage social harmony and cohesion; policies to increase equity and participation for ethnic groups in the community; policies which encourage the expression of different cultural identities as a democratic right like any other; and policies to increase our ability to call on the skills, talents and ambitions of all Australians. These are the policies of an expanded, humane democracy-a lively democracy, a democracy which is increasingly attracting the interest and admiration of other countries and a democracy which I think Australians should be very proud of. A multicultural Australia is a reality deriving from decades of immigration. But a tolerant, viable, successful multicultural Australia is a reality deriving from hard work, compromise and imagination. I remind honourable members on both sides of the House that a lot of the initiative came from the last Liberal Government, Malcolm Fraser's. I will not have to remind the honourable member for Goldstein because at the time he was an adviser to Mr Fraser, and I probably will not have to remind the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs because he supports multiculturalism as defined in the national agenda. But I do have to remind the Leader of the Opposition that on 9 March 1992 Malcolm Fraser said: I would like to say here that the development of multiculturalism in Australia in recent years has helped us enormously as a community in gaining the wider understanding which the successful management of interdependence will increasingly call for.

141,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Malcolm Fraser also referred to multiculturalism as becoming 'a symbol of a transfonning vision of Australian society'. These are the references of a former Leader of a coalition Government. I now quote the Leader of the Opposition in a speech he made to the Liberal Party of Western Australia in July this year. He referred to multiculturalism as: . . . absolutely a fundamental example of the politics of division ... we should never have multiculturalism. All we do is elevate a few professional ethnics. That is the definition of the current Leader of the coalition. He says that the policies are not working. He says that the policies of managing diversity are dividing the country. He says it is a failure. To everyone else it looks like a considerable success, but to Dr Hewson it is a failure. When I quote him faithfully from the transcript, he says that I am a blatant liar. He has called my speech to FECCA a political stunt. As for the charge that I am a blatant liar, I direct him to his speech, which says: Multiculturalism is another classic example ... the politics of division, not the politics of One Nation . . . absolutely a fundamental mistake in this country. We are a multicultural society, yes, but we should never have multiculturalism. All we do is elevate a few professional ethnics. That is an example of Dr Hewson's megalomania and paranoia. All those organisations and individuals not in his power are his enemies. All those bits of Australia which he did not make or does not control perforce must go. That is his view. These people should make way for the new orderthe same drab, conservative order that people had in vogue at the end of the 1970s. The fact is that, unlike Mr Kennett, I will not sue Dr Hewson for defamation. Mr Kennett, in a display of sensitivity-and having blackguarded the Victorian Government by billboarding across Melbourne-ran to the courts after the first reference to him. Unlike Mr Kennett I will not sue you for the same charge that you have made against me unfairly and baselessly. Dr Bob Woods-Because we can prove it.",21

If you cannot grab the opportunities, there is nothing there for you. That is his view.

155,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to the Treasurer's letter to me yesterday where he states: It is not in the Government's interest to publish forecasts which have no credence, or which are shown in time to have been based on other than sound, professional judgment. On this basis I ask the Prime Minister: why did he let the discredited One Nation statement be published with forecasts which were blatantly unprofessional? Why did he fiddle-I ask this for what is the fourth time, including points of order-the investment figures in 1988, the current account figures in 1989 and the growth forecasts in 1990 and, after 10 years of getting it wrong, why should anyone believe anything he predicts tonight?",22
156,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I made clear in the last answer, there is no basis to those allegations whatsoever. They are simply the arrant prattlings of a journalist without integrity; that is all they are. As to the forecasts, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to blackguard· the Government about the forecasts, he can go and blackguard the OECD and the IMF for their dramatic revisions to the growth forecasts for Western world OECD area economies, the quarterly adjustments, over the last 12 months. I am afraid forecasting shifts. in economies is a very inexact science, obviously, and, while we always like to think that we have the best tools available, they can always at their best be imperfect, as he well knows. But the point, the cynicism, is that the very same bureaucracy that he is urging us to tum the process over to absolutely and entirely he will not even trust to draft a bit of tax law. The same bureaucracy which he says is politicisedMr Reith-Do you want to make them available?",22

160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the same which he says has basically been doing the work of the Government, is the same bureaucracy that he argues cynically, when it suits him, that the Government should hand this process over to. What a sterile proposition-that the Government presents a Budget for the economy and decides the measures but has no role of discussion or cooperation in the forecasts or the writing of the Budget documents. What a stupid view. What a disgracefully silly view. That is exactly the view that you had.",22
161,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Look at what you said in 1982.,22

I would like to know whether 'you' thrown across the table is acceptable.

Last week the Leader of the Opposition, in a speech he gave to an economic forecasting conference, said: There has been little or no structural reform in Australia in the course of the last four to five He then went on to refer to a couple of areas where it has been said there have been some. He said: At best, these improvements have been marginal and compared to the performance of other countries in our region and more generally internationally our performance has been markedly off the pace. It is just an extraordinary, indeed a preposterous, statement for anyone to makeparticularly from one who aspires to be the Prime Minister of this country-that what has been happening in this country in the last few years represents little or no structural change. Where the hell has he been in the last few years?

It has been this Government that has picked up the ball and run hard with it in making the structural change. Let us have a look at some of the things that have happened in the last few years which are important measures of structural change. Mr Riggall-Yes, one million out of work.",23

179,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,23
180,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our wages system, stemming from the accord, has been driving workplace reform for years now-since 1987-with the two-tier system, the structural efficiency principle of 1989, and the efficiency bargaining principle of last year. These are all operating to increase productivity and efficiency in the workplace of the nation. Productivity is improving. The national accounts show that in the last year productivity for all industries increased by 1.6 per cent at a time when GDP increased by 0.4 per cent. In the non-farm market sector, it increased by 2.6 per cent. So we are experiencing strong growth in productivity even when the economy has been at low levels of activity. Industrial disputation is 61 per cent lower than it was under the Fraser Government. In education, retention rates for those in year 12 have gone up, so we are skilling our future work force much more than was ever done before. We have doubled the retention rate to year 12, and there has been a 60 per cent increase in the number of students in univers-ty education. In One Nation and the youth statement we have committed ourselveS to a greatly expanded activity in vocational education and training, including a new system of entry level training based on competency-based training. In research and development, Australia's real growth in business research and development expenditure from 1983 to 1990 was 12.7 per cent per annum, the second highest in the world in that period. The growth in the number of patents issued in that period has also been the second highest in the world. In relation to tariffs, no other government has picked up the ball, except the Whitlam Government, and done something about reducing the tariff levels in this country. We have done that and are pressing on with responsible policy in that area. Our manufactured exports have been growing at a very rapid rate. Over the last six years they have been growing faster than those of any other OECD country. We have twice the OECD average for growth in manufactured exports. Elaborately transfonned manufactured exports have quadrupled in our period of office and have gone from 12 per cent to 18 per cent of exports. The recent EPAC paper demonstrated very substantial progress in productivity in our government business enterprises with an increase in productivity of 46 per cent between 1984-85 and 1990-91. EPAC says that although our GBEs started well behind scratch, by the second half of this decade their productivity will be at world levels. Because of our deregulation of domestic aviation in November 1990, our aviation industry had amazing growth in 1991. While every other country was experiencing downturn, our fares fell by 32 per cent and our passenger traffic went up by 30 per cent. In telecommunications, we have broken the Telecom monopoly and we have put a new operator in place. In 1993 a third mobile operator will come in. Telecom prices are restricted to the CPI minus 5.5 per cent which at present CPI levels means that real prices are falling considerably. In waterfront and shipping, which has been taken as the real sine qua non of the test of structural change, we can see very substantial refonns in place. In container tenninals, the average number of containers per man shift are up 100 per cent over the last two years. Crane handling rates are up by almost 60 per cent since 1989.",23

On our ships we have seen a 40 per cent reduction in the average size of crews since 1983 with three-quarters of that fall since 1989. In the face of all that, in a serious speech to an economic forecasting conference the Opposition Leader said that there had been little or no structural refonn in Australia in the course of the last 45 years.

The Leader of the Opposition asks why the Government should be believed, but the question is why he should be believed when he stands up at a forecasting conference, presumably with people from institutions all around the world, and denigrates this country, for its record on structural change when he knows that in terms of structural reform Australia is one of the most fluid and supple countries in the world, with structural reform still going on apace across the country. Why should anyone take any notice? ' We have had the recent visit by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party to New Zealand and we are being enjoined to do things the way in which they are done in New Zealand. There is the model. The Leader of the Opposition has asked me how we have got it so wrong in 10 years. I tell you one thing that we did not get wrong: we now have a work force 25 per cent larger than 10 years ago, whereas in New Zealand the work force today is smaller than it was in 1983.

199,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Secondly, in the 10 years that the Leader of the Opposition said we got it wrong-I got it wrong-we had more growth in GDP in the Australian economy than there is total product in the New Zealand economy. Where do you get off in the float of the exchange rate and all the other structural ,changes which my colleague just mentioned? I remember some of the quotations by the Leader of the Opposition about the years that he was around with the then Treasurer, John Howard. In the Australian Financial Review of 6 July 1987, he said: We played quite a significant role in opening up the debate. We had success at the margin, but the whole thing was the big decisions were not takenconsumption tax, industry protection levels, fiscal policy restraint measures. It was very frustrating. Howard would get rolled. Cabinet Ministers would sway the debate on the basis of an anecdote in the non-members bar the night before-even if we had four feet of paper on the table. The farmers could produce anecdotes out of thin air. I used to wonder a lot how much many of them understood. Decisions were made when we, the advisers, were kicked out. Having been there through the Fraser years and having been decisively rolled, he knows that if you have a chance to do something, you must do it. So says John Hewson. The decisions that they were rolled on were the float of the Australian dollar; the removal of exchange controls; the reduction of the tariff wall; the shifts in fiscal policy; the change in the factor shares between wages and profits; the reformation of the tax system to give us a decent income tax regime which is not haemorrhaging all over the floor with bottom-of-the-harbour-type schemes and the rest; the absence of capital gains taxation and the double taxation of dividends; the changes in the waterfront, which nobody attempted in 30 years of coalition government; the changes in telecommunications, which nobody attempted in 30 years of coalition government; the shift to exports to elaborately transform manufactures, which this Government has presided over; and the 300 per cent increase in manufactured exports since 1983. Did we get all that wrong or were we just imagining all those things? Tonight when you read in Statement No. 2 the description of structural change in Australia or, in the associated documents, about the changes in the nature of training and employment in this country, ponder for a moment that we have just agreed with the ACTU that nearly 70 per cent of the work force will be adjusted under enterprise bargaining. Yet you say we have got it wrong and you point to a country which has fewer people in jobs than it had 10 years ago. Shame on you! Assistance to Farmers",25

203,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the reports in the paper. They are totally without foundation. They were made by the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Wal Murray, a person who, I think, is known very well by those on the other side of the House. I remind those opposite of what he had to say about three-cornered contests: There is a solution-a very simple solution: that is to get the hell out of Hume and Riverina. I am pleased to see that we are n9t the only ones having difficulty with one Wal Murray. He is the one to whom is attributed this quote that I have reneged on some package that I negotiated with the States. That is interesting because Wal Murray was not even at the meeting, and it is interesting because it directly contrasts with what the Minister for Agriculture, who was at the meeting, said in relation to this agreement. Ian Annstrong actually praised the outcome. Not only did Wal Murray get it wrong again, but also he put in great jeopardy the early payment to drought affected farmers in New South Wales and Queensland. He also put in jeopardy the finalisation of a drought policy which I will be announcing later this week on the back of the Budget. The simple fact of the matter is that I have had the opportunity to visit the two most drought affected areas in this country-the western division of New South Wales, as well as Queensland. I understand the hardship that is being experienced by those people, and it did impact upon me very strongly. But it also provided the opportunity to have genuine discussions with the people involved to identify precisely what we could do to assist them. This is what I announced some four weeks ago as a result of an agreement that I negotiated with the State governments. There are two aspects to the agreement. One goes to alleviating the immediate hardship for which I indicated a preparedness to provide $14m immediately-$14m which is being put in jeopardy by Wal Murray's statements, I might remind the House. Secondly, the other aspect of this was to ensure that we had a component in the drought policy which dealt with circumstances of severe drought. That is crucial to a national drought policy, and I am pleased to say that following the Budget tonight we will be able to announce a good policy direction in terms of a drought policy. As far as the agreement itself is concerned, for the record, I agree to fund-in addition to the 50 per cent interest subsidy-dollar for dollar with the States up to, effectively, 100 per cent interest subsidy, as well as lifting cap on the entitlement to $30,000. But I indicated to the States of New South Wales and Queensland that, because they had made money available through transaction based levies, on this occasion I was prepared to waive their requirement to match that dollar for dollar. In other words, the 75 per cent would be provided by the Commonwealth and it was a matter of judgment as to whether the States of Queensland and New South Wales would take it up to the other 100 per cent. I am a bit disappointed that when the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Fahey, was in the western division recently-where he announced additional support for transactionbased levies-it was clearly within his capacity to allocate that funding to take the interest subsidy to 100 per cent but he did not do that. He persisted with the transaction based approach-the very approach which even members of the National Party on the other side concede we need to get rid of in time. But the point is that that was the agreement. The significance of this agreement can be realised when you combine it with the discussions that we have had with the banks over recent months whereby they have been prepared, in cases where the farm is long term viable and where the farmers demonstrate a commitment to increasing productivity and coming to grips with their terms of trade, to develop packages of finance for up to 30 years with interest only payments for up to 5 years. If we combine that capacity with what we have done in these extreme drought circumstances-a 100 per cent interest subsidy-we are meeting the very needs that the farm sector in the western division of New South Wales and in south-eastern Queensland has been talking about. Yet that very agreement was put in jeopardy by Wal Murray's announcements. I have made it clear to the groups that I have spoken to in these areas that this policy is based on securing the long term viability of the farm sector and not prolonging the inevitable for farms which are not viable in the long term. I must say that even in those drought affected areas that principle is acthe cepted by those with whom I have spoken. In terms of viability, it has to be not only economically viable but also environmentally sustainable. As an indication of this problem, in that drought-affected area of western New South Wales we have circumstances where the livestock numbers are estimated at some 8.7 million dry sheep equivalents, whereas the estimated carrying capacity is 7.7 million, which is well under that. The fact of the matter is that this is good policy. We have come to grips with the development of a national drought policy which, as I say, will be announced, but at the same time we have given much needed relief to those farmers and to those areas that I visited and where I have taken note of it. It is sound policy. It ought to be applauded and you ought to be doing what is necessary to implement it and tell Wal Murray to pull his head in and stop jeopardising it.",26

NA Unparliamentary Language",28
210,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, your interpretation of the words 'parliamentary' and 'unparliamentary'-and by implication the words 'fraud' and 'hypocrite'-is that they are now parliamentary language. Mr MCGauran-Hear, hear!",28
211,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order!,29
212,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Do I take it from that that other expressions such as 'liar', which I would put in the same category as the words 'fraud' and 'hypocrite', are now to be interpreted as parliamentary language as well?",29
213,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"If I were the honourable member for Ballarat, I would not try using that word at all; he might not be here to hear the answer. The point is obvious that the word liar is an absolutely unparliamentary word and is not allowed. On numerous occasions in the past people have used the words 'fraud' and 'hypocrite'. In some instances they have been asked to withdraw; in other instances they have voluntarily withdrawn. Indeed, the honourable member for Ballarat, I am reminded, used such a word today. It is always useful if members of the House do not use evocative words such as that. in Question Time language is used which, in the normal course of debate, would stand out very much and would probably be out of order, and in all debate it tends to be a matter of how the matter is perceived at the time. If any honourable members are interested in running the machines, you can find a whole range of words that from time to time have been deemed to be parliamentary and at other times have not. I think the one consistent one I can recall is 'liar', and I intend to ensure that that stays. . I might also say to some of my friends on the left who sotto voce use that word that they might cease from doing that, as it has been drawn to my attention. For the benefit of honourable members, I mightMr Chaney-What about your friends on your right?",29
214,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Does the honourable member for Pearce wish to disagree with the Chair? Mr Chaney-I simply wish to make a point which I might make from the box rather than the front bench.,29

216,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Pearce will resume his seat. Mr Downer-You asked him a question. Mr Chaney-I would like you to affirm your fairness.,29
217,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Resume your seat. Mr Downer-You ask him to say something and then you tell him to sit down.,29

222,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"An incident at Parliament House on 12 August 1992, in which a fourwheel drive vehicle was driven through the main entrance of the building, has received a great deal of media attention. As honourable members may be aware, a number of agencies are involved in providing security in the parliamentary precincts. The President and I decided that an expert who was not attached to any of these agencies was required to provide an objective assessment of the incident and the Parliament's capacity to respond. We commissioned Mr Richard Dixon of the security division of Price Waterhouse to investigate the incident and make an immediate interim report to us on appropriate means to prevent a recurrence of such incidents. Mr Dixon, who is a retired commander of the AFP, presented his report yesterday. A copy of the report has been made available to the party leaders and to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) on a confidential basis. The two Ministers are the Ministers who are nominated by the Government as the Ministers responsible for liaison with the ministerial wing and with the APS. The report finds that the actions of the security staff in detaining the driver of the vehicle and evacuating the public from the building were proper and effective. The driver has appeared before the ACT Magistrate's Court on four charges relating to the incident and has been remanded in custody pending the receipt of a psychiatric report. Mr Dixon's report contains recommendations for the installation of temporary vehicular barriers at the entrances to the building. As honourable members will be aware, the barriers are now in place. There will not be any overreaction to the incident by the President and me. The measures the President and I have put in place will not inhibit in any way the public's access to Parliament House. We have been very careful to ensure that the balance between open access and effective security is maintained. Mr Dixon's report makes other recommendations in relation to the installation of more permanent barriers, the strengthening of building entrances, the management of security, the powers of attendants and emergency evacuation procedures. The President and I are considering these recommendations. In the light of the report, the President and I propose to commission a wider review of the protective security of Parliament House, which will include an examination of the risks to the building and its occupants, and the effectiveness of current arrangements in protecting against those risks.",29
223,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question arising from that statement. Mr Speaker, would it be fair to say, as a result of the decision of you and the President to go outside government agencies to receive that advice, that you did not have full confidence in the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police to investigate the incident and to come to recommendations that would protect the precincts of the Parliament?",30
224,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"If the honourable member for Higgins had been listening to what I said, he would have heard me say that the President and I believed that it would be better for an expert who was not attached to any of the agencies that were involved to do the investigation. Opposition members-Why?",30
225,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! At present the AFP, the APS and, in some instances, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Parliament's own Security Controller and our attendants provide some of the security arrangements in Parliament House. We thought that it was necessary to have someone who did not have a stake in the outcome do the inquiry into the incident and the response to it. It was a short inquiry; it provided us with some recommendations. I understand that all the agencies involved are happy with the recommendations and, quite frankly, I think that the people who were involved in the response on behalf of our Security Controller and the other agencies acted quite well, as I said in my report and as the party leaders will see in Mr Dixon's report.",30
226,Mr REID,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I wonder whether you are aware of an advertising campaign that is being conducted by the Mitsubishi company regarding this incident and whether you are aware of the publicity surrounding that advertisement. What action do you propose to take?",30
227,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have not seen the advertisement. There is probably not much that we can do about people running advertisements. 'As I say, I have not seen the advertisement. Mr Smith-It is in bad taste.",30
228,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member for Bass tells me it is in bad taste. His taste has always been fairly good, as far as I know, in the past. Mr Smith-That is the last time. I will interject. ,",30
229,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Further to the incident in the Great Hall, there was a report, I think in the Sydney Morning Herald about last Friday, alleging that you, Mr Speaker, had made a special arrangement with one or two television stations to cover you and the President with the vehicle for footage for the evening news, and that when newspaper photographers swarmed around to take photographs of this happy scene of you and the President you asked them to leave, presumably because you had made an arrangement with the two television stations. I ask you whether this report is correct and, if not correct, will you be taking action against that newspaper for such malicious reporting?",31
230,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I am glad to see that the honourable member for Mayo has finally joined my crusade against the malicious reporting of the Sydney Morning Herald. As I have said to the honourable member for Mayo frequently in the past, he and his colleagues should not believe, in many instances, what is written in the Sydney Morning Herald-and on this occasion he should not believe it. Mr Downer-Are they wrong?",31
231,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Dundas has a question. Mr Downer-Are they wrong?,31
232,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have answered your question. Mr Downer-No, you have not.",31
233,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will resume his seat. The honourable member for Dundas has the call.,31
234,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question to you, Mr Speaker, is in relation to a more delicate issue arising from this incident. I understand there were a number of children in the hall at the time the vehicle came through and that the impact was quite alarming and devastating, particularly upon the young people involved. There were some children from a school in my constituency. Some parents spoke to me afterwards about what arrangements would be put in place to assist in trauma counselling for the young people who may have been so adversely affected by the impact. I have spoken to the New South Wales Minister for Education to ascertain what might be done in relation to this, but I wonder whether that matter has been taken up by you or the President and whether any action is being taken to ascertain the schools involved and whether, particularly where programs such as the one that the New South Wales Government has are not available, the Government will assist other schools that may have been here at the time the event occurred.",31
235,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The matter has not been it is brought to my attention but, as it has now been raised by the honourable member for Dundas, I would think that the people who are primarily responsible for the care of school children when they are in the building would be the State education authorities which bring them here. They tend to come on school excursions when they are under the care of the authority which brings them here. Mr Ruddock-Not all are state schools.",31
236,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! I would think the particular education authorities would be primarily responsible, but if some individuals or groups have a problem they should. write to the President and me and we will give consideration to the matter. NA",31
237,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Wentworth-Leader of the Opposition) Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",31
238,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the Leader of the Opposition claim to have been misrepresented?,31
239,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes, I do.",31
240,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The Leader may proceed.,31
241,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"In Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a series·of assertions which could be summarised in one expression that he used, namely, that I have a loathing for ethnic groups in Australia. I totaIly reject that assertion. I think it is a very serious charge. It is as serious a charge as the allegation of racism that was made by the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). I do not think it sits very well with the party that supported the White Australia policy for as long as it did.",31
242,Mr GRIFFITHS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Oh, don't be so thin skinned.",32
243,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I have been misrepresented and I need a chance to explain why.,32
244,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will say where he has been misrepresented.,32
245,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Speaker, I have been a consistent advocate of the benefits and the enrichment processes of a multicultural Australia. I have given dozens of speeches about that. The Prime Minister, who made the allegations today, has been on the platform at the same time those speeches have been made. This is part of a cheap scare campaign on the part of the Labor Party.",32
246,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition is obviously debating the question. It is sufficient for him to remain within Standing Orders, to say that he has been misrepresented and to deny the accusation. He is now making a speech about it from handwritten notes.",32
247,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! The Leader of the Opposition can explain where he was misrepresented. That is it. He cannot debate the matter. Mr Costello interjecting,32
248,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Leader of the Opposition cannot, as his colleague is trying to encourage him, say why he has been misrepresented. I warn the honourable member for Higgins that, if he interjects name him.",32
249,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The assertion vias that I have a loathing for ethnic groups in Australia. I was simply trying to state the evidence to the contrary, which is that I do not and that I have on many occasions publicly argued for support for the role played by ethnic groups to Australia. I wanted to emphasise the fact that this is part of a cheap scare campaign being run by members of the ALP who will say and do anything to get themselves re-elected.",32
250,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition is now debating the point. He will resume his seat. Mr Ruddock-He is absolutely right, though.",32
251,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Order! If the honourable member for Dundas interjects again, I will deal with him as well. NA (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1992",32
252,Mr SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"On 24 June this year, the Senate returned to the House of Representatives the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 with a schedule containing 25 amendments and requesting the House to concur in those amendments. The House reported the message the same day and considered and agreed to the 25 amendments contained in the Senate schedule. On 29 June, after the Bill had been printed for transmission to the Governor General for royal assent, officers of the House were advised by the Australian Taxation Office and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that they believed that four of the amendments contained in the Senate schedule had not in fact been made by the Senate. This advice was subsequently confirmed by officers of the Senate. The result of the inclusion of the four amendments in error in the Senate schedule was that the House of Representatives had been asked to agree, and had agreed, to four amendments which had not been made by the Senate. The Bill had not been passed by both Houses in identical terms and it was not possible for the Clerk to certify, nor for me to transmit, the Bill to the Governor General for again, I will royal assent.",32
253,Mr MELHAM,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Good on you, Harry Evans. Mr Chaney-No, the Manager of Government Business.",32
254,Mr MELHAM,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,It is a disgrace.,32
255,Mr SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Order! It is by no means unknown for errors of a minor formal or clerical nature to occur in Bills or schedules of amendments passing between the Houses. Indeed, standing order 241 provides: Amendments of a verbal or formal nature may be made, and clerical or typographical errors may be corrected, in any part of the bill by the Clerk with the authority of the Chairman of Committees. However, in this case the four amendments included in the Senate schedule in error were amendments of substance which could not be dealt with under this provision. I understand that it is intended to move a motion in the Senate to the effect that a corrected schedule of the amendments made by the Senate on 24 June 1992 be forwarded to the House and that the House be asked to reconsider the Bill with the corrected schedule. If such a message is received, to deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible, it will be necessary for the House, by suspension of Standing Orders, to rescind the resolution of 24 June 1992 and then consider the revised schedule in the Committee of the Whole. I have made this statement at this time so that the House may be apprised of the position of this Bill without any delay. I now suggest that the House should await the receipt of a message from the Senate in relation to the Bill.",32
256,Mr MELHAM,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Shame on Harry Evans. Mr Smith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I was going to seek indulgence, but before doing so I ask you to ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement.",33
257,Mr BEAZLEY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Oh, come on.",33
258,Mr SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Order! There is nothing unparliamentary about a member making an interjection aboutMr Smith-This matter will be debated later in the day. All of a sudden you are going to reflect on and use the Clerk of the Senate as your excuse for this shemozzle, are you?",33
259,Mr SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Order! There is no point of order. Does the honourable member for Bass have a matter which he wishes to raise or not? Mr Smith-No, Mr Speaker.

260,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to address the - onomic well-being of the Nation, including the impact of drought, and its manipulation of various economic forecasts and statistics I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",34
261,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me begin by asking: who has created the large underclass of people suffering so much at this time? Who has boasted that he has had his hands on the levers, manipulated the forecasts and driven the bureaucracy? Who, as a result, has caused Australia to go into recession ahead of the rest of the world, deeper than the rest of the world and with a recovery more fragile than the rest of the world? None other than the ex-Treasurer, soon to be ex-Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Two particular quotes that expose the fragile position of the Prime Minister this day, as correctly highlighted by the Leader of thOpposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), concern cooking the books and fudging the figures. Back in 1982 the then shadow Treasurer, Mr Keating, told the Parliament: I ask the Parliament: Where do we go in this nation when the principal Minister of government, responsible for the Department of the Treasury and responsible for the publication of the only document upon which the Australian nation can base some economic judgment, falsifies that document? It is the habit of this nation to have annual Budgets and Budget statements prepared by the premier department of the Government, the Treasury. That was said in 1982. Let us look at what the ex-Treasurer said in 1992; to be precise, 24 June 1992. Mr Keating, who was speaking as the current and interim Prime Minister of this country, said: Economy One qf the claims by some of the pointy people is that I rewrote parts of Statement No.2. Too right I have. He was caught red-handed. He admitted that he had cooked the books; that he had falsified the Budget statements; that he has massaged the numbers massively in recent times. It is against that background that I think it is time we looked at seven consecutive comments from seven past Budgets of this ex-Treasurer, now Prime Minister and soon to be ex-Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Let us look at his record. In 1984 Keating said: The Government's policies are on track. Some track! In 1985 he said that the Budget: · .. builds upon our very significant successes and puts further behind us the despair and economic failure of the former Government. He was wrong again. In 1986 he said that the Budget: · .. rings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy. He was wrong yet again. In 1987 he said: Our economic strategy is now bearing fruit. They were pivotal words in 1987. It has been downhill ever since. In 1988 the famous statement was made, and I appeal to people in the public gallery who are beyond the cocoon of Canberra to take note of it. In the Budget document of 1988, Mr Keating said: The nation is successfully emerging from the most severe economic crisis in a generation . . . the one that brings home the bacon. Some bacon! Shame on that person who uttered those words and who has failed repeatedly to bring home the bacon. In 1989 he said: Australia will emerge ... without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. He made that comment in 1989, which was three years ago, on the equivalent Budget day. In 1990 he said that the economy will improve: · . . without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. Seven times the Prime Minister has been caught out completely; seven times he has failed to deliver in terms of his own Budget rhetoric-which I accept that he wrote, and he has a right to present his Budgets in those terms. But, boy, did he get it wrong. A consequence has been one million people unemployed. A consequence has been a nation where the foreign debt has gone from $36 billion in gross terms at the start of this Government to over $181 billion. A consequence has been that Australian taxpayers, many of whom are hard pressed and are back to being single income families just above the poverty line, have been hit by bracket creep to a collective tune of some $22 billion. A consequence has been that wholesale sales tax-the existing consumption tax of 30 per cent, 20 per cent, 15 per cent and 10 per cent, which we will abolish-has crept up and up to rest at over $10 billion, a 60 per cent increase under the Labor regime. Then there is the fuel excise tax on poor motorists in decentralised job locations trying to get to their job or hang on to their job in so many areas where there is no public transport and where the only alternative is to use taxis. What has happened? There has been an increase from under $1 billion at the start of the last decade to a $7 billion rip-off of the motorists now-an excessive taxation on the transport industry, adding to the burden of the drought and adding to the burden on decentralised firms still trying to maintain their employment base across Australia. If we are to make a real assessment of how this is our economy is travelling, perhaps we can look just briefly at Japan. It is not an exact comparison, but it is interesting to reflect that Japan has had over three times the productivity increase that Australia has had since 1983. France and Italy have had over double the productivity increase that Australia has had in that period. The truth is that we have been marking time under Labor-and it gets worse. We have one million people unemployed. The official unemployment rate is 11.1 per cent. But in the State of Victoria it is worse. Thank God Victoria is going to the polls, although it is very unfortunate for those of us who are Vietnam veterans that it is on the wrong Saturday, on 3 October. But soon enough Kirner will be gone from the premiership of Victoria. Victoria, under a State Labor government and with a Labor government federally, has a youth unemployment rate of 46 per cent. What shame that a Labor government can deliver that outcome after having its hands on the levers. It is also interesting to pick up on a comment made by the new 'EI Presidente', the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) to wit, the man who came into rescue and take over the presidency from Senator Loosley. Of course, Labor would have us believe that the rich would do far better under our policies. It is very interesting to examine the facts on this score, as 'EI Presidente' has done. He has admitted that the gap between the rich and the poor has got worse under the 10 years of hard labour that we have been subjected to in this country. None other than the honourable member for Lalor has been honest enough to admit that the gap between the rich and the poor has deteriorated, has worsened greatly, under Federal Labor. Since this Government came to power, single income couples on average weekly earnings have had a 4.7 per cent decline in their disposable income. Interestingly enough, single income couples on six times average weekly earnings have had a 6.7 per cent increase in real disposable income since Labor came to power. So much for Labor's rhetoric! We are the ones with the fair dinkum policies that will provide equality. We are the ones that will get the monkey of the huge fuel excise taxes, the rip-off of every motorist in this country, off the backs of people and save them $11.40 every time they fill up an average fuel tank. It is this Government that has maintained secret consumption taxes of record proportions in Budget after Budget yet has the audacity to come in here and argue against our fair dinkum, fairly based and fairly structured policy to abolish seven taxes and replace them with one, fair, GST - a path which, incidentally, 59 other countries have gone down with considerable success. I just add that Australia is one of the few countries persevering with a payroll tax. Here in Australia we have one million unemployed-massive unemployment right across the country-very little change, fragile economic growth and not enough to soak up that unemployment, yet the Government perseveres with a payroll tax. We provide the remedy to abolish totally all payroll tax. So Labor's historians will have to explain the crippling debt, the incentive sapping taxation, the low productivity, of income away from average wage earners, favouring the rich, the chronically· high unemployment and the underclass that the Prime Minister created-the underclass that this country did not have to have--'in the same way as he created the recession that we did not have to have. Ten budgets have greatly failed Australia to the extent that the big swing is on. In Victoria, we could even see a State seat such as Footscray go. Federally, the seat of Gellibrand could go to the coalition. Not one Labor member deserves to keep his or her seat in either the Victorian State Parliament or the Federal Parliament except for one, and I will tell honourable members who. I am prepared to make one exception: the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who had the courage to attack the Prime Minister last week in such a way that I thought we might even send him a National Party membership form. No-one can deny that international factors impact on the Australian economy, but the level of incompetence of the Prime Minister has greatly added to that burden. Those figures are pretty serious. The steel industry in Japan last month reported another savage downturn, and that is going to have huge implications for the Australian economy. But what I will never forgive Labor for is keeping those interest rates so high and for so long. It was so arrogant and so out of touch. The Prime Minister boasted he had his hands on the levers of the economy. tie got it totally wrong, and the one million unemployed are paying the price. The sooner the Prime Minister loses his job so that one million Australians might have a chance of getting their jobs back, the better for all of our sakes. I now turn to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald last week. The article started with a reminder of the four-year scenario contained in the One Nation statement, and stated that the centrepiece of One Nation was the creation of a rapid take-off of 4.75 per cent growth a year and a steady decline in unemployment. It said: In fact, growth would equal the average of the last seven years of the 19808, without the same blowthe distribution out in foreign debt. Even the Government has now walked away from those One Nation predictions. It has seen its One Nation statement go up in smoke. But, more interestingly, I point to the fact that the economic model on which One Nation was based has now been put under wraps and the public have been denied full access. Why? I quote from the same article: It has since been decided that this cannot sources revealed, because it would show where the numbers were massaged. That is, massaged by the Keating prime ministerial office. The article detailed the Prime Minister's disbanding of the national income. forecasting committee when he was Treasurer and its replacement with the joint economic forecasting group. It highlights the politicisation of this group and the way the figures were rewritten and rewritten, Budget after Budget. So what we can expect tonight is the great fudge once again, the great rewrite once again, the great falsification of what ought to be fair dinkum forecasts for the benefit of those who have to deal with the economic circumstances and the horrific drought which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) referred to in Question Time. I say to the Governn1ent and to the Minister that I accept that drought is beyond the direct control of government-clearly, the weather is-but there are ways and means of pursuing those policies which will minimise that effort. The Government has taken steps down that path, and the Federal-State stand-off has to be resolved. But I put it to those opposite and to the House that they are exacerbating the burden of the circumstance by their failure to adopt the fundamental refonns which would greatly ease the burden of taxation on hardpressed, drought stricken fanners, primary producers, exporters, small business operators and the like. ' I go back to that clear-cut example: even in drought, fanners are greatly exposed to the horrific cost of transport to cart fodder in and to cart livestock out to agistment and the like, and there is some specific assistance available to them. But underpinning that huge transport structural cost in this country is a level of taxation unacceptable anywhere else in the world. To quote Bob Hawke, transport taxes in this country are 3112 times greater than in any other industry. What will we do about it? It is very clear-cut. We will abolish all sales tax, including all sales tax on trucks, spare parts, rigs, vehicles, and the like. We will abolish all payroll tax, including the payroll tax most large trucking companies have to be done, pay, whether it is the Wee Waa trucking company, the Wagga Wagga trucking company or whatever. We will also abolish all diesel fuel excise tax and so provide the basis for a substantial lowering of those transport costs to help these people in a very positive way not only in a drought stricken circumstance but for the ultimate economic recovery which will be delivered under a coalition Government. I simply say to the House that this Government has had its chance. Enough is enough. It is time for a change. It is time to give the coalition a chance to deliver a fair go for the fanner, a fair go for the family, and a fair set of policies which will get economic recovery back on the rails and deliver fair dinkum private enterprise jobs and not the mickey mouse approach which has been too often followed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should stand condemned for his fudging and rorting of Budget documents over too many years. We have caught him out, and we are going to remind him of it at each and every opportunity.",34
262,Mr CREAN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I must say that I am somewhat staggered when I look at the matter of public importance that we have on the business sheet for discussion today, with its fleeting reference to the drought and no solutions, from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). It is an absolute disgrace to come in here with a matter of public importance to deal with drought and to suggest that we are going to solve drought by introducing a goods and services tax. If that is the bankruptcy of opinion within the National Party, then it is no wonder that its members are deserting it in hordes. It is no wonder that its leadership is resorting to thuggery to hang onto the few remaining seats that they have. I want first of all to go to what the MPI says in tenns of the Government's alleged failure to deal with drought, and then to deal with the other matters that the Leader of the National Party has raised. Firstly, in relation to drought, the Government will be announcing on Thursday of this week, following some important announcements that will be made tonight, a national drought policy. This comes after a long time of consideration, but I must say that the most difficult circumstances in which to develop a drought policy or to introduce it is in the middle of one. That has been the difficulty faced not only by the national Government but also the· State governments, given that we have to get a consistency of approach across the board. I would also point out that, in the meantime, we have tried to get real assistance to all of the farmers in need, not just those affected by drought. We need to remind ourselves of the fact that, whilst we have a drought and have had one over the course of the last couple of years, it is nowhere near widespread as the drought in 1982-83. But other factors that have impacted upon the farm sector have caused severe hardship and real difficulty. It is against that background that I set about using the existing mechanisms available to government, knowing that there was a reluctance on the part of the State governments to do much else than blame the Commonwealth for not spending enough, and to try to find the flexibility within the rural adjustment scheme which provided substantial resources to assist farmers in hardship for whatever reason, but including drought. There was a substantial injection of funds into the RAS. Substantial new Ilexibilities were introduced into the interpretation. There was the deadlocked agreement broken by me with the States in getting part B activated. I would simply remind the House that, for all the bleatings that the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales goes on with about the amounts of money that it has spent on drought, the fact of the matter is that the South Wales Government has still spent only just over half of its 1991-92 allocation of $8.4m under part B of RAS, which is intended to provide the very means of carry-on assistance that farmers affected by drought require. I would suggest to the House that the reason why this has not been spent is that the New South Wales Government has to match $1 for every $2 of ours expended under part B. We have heard a lot of talk this afternoon about the definition of the word 'hypocritical'. That must go down as one of the most hypocritical statements by the National Party and the New South Wales Government in trying to pass the buck to the Commonwealth but not exercising the opportunity available to it to provide the fullest amount that we have made available, when we have been prepared to double the contribution as against its $1 of contribution. I also point out that we have provided close to $50m in 1991-92 through RAS support for farmers in New South Wales. In addition to that, we introduced the new income support approach for farmers who could not incur any additional debt but who needed to get food on as the table. When I visited the western division of New South Wales, I was applauded by a very large meeting that gathered in Bourke for having introduced that initiative. Despite the press releases that are put out from time to time by the National Party saying that this has not worked, the fact is that it has targeted real need and it is well regarded by those who have been recipients of it. The reason we had to change drought policy is that in 1989, after a report into the then current drought arrangements, there was unanimous agreement that the policy had to change. Why? There are two basic reasons: firstly, the previous system had been rorted and no more had it been rorted than in the State of Queensland under a National Party led by Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Honourable members should remember that most of his Cabinet are now disgraced because of the way in which policy had been run in that State. The policy on drought was rorted. Just to give an instance of this rort, we had the cirNew cumstance in some shires in Queensland where between the years 1964 and 1989-90 areas were drought declared 70 per cent of the time. The focus of those recipients of drought benefits was a very small group compared with the overall farming community. Secondly, the transaction based subsidies which the States still want to continue do not discriminate on the basis of need, nor do they encourage farmers to make provision in the long term, to treat drought as a natural recurring feature and to adopt risk management policies. The policy has to be changed not just because of the rorts but because the policy thrust has been bad. We have to treat drought as a naturally recurring event; we have to convince farmers to prepare for that event; and we have to equip them with the wherewithal to do it. There is no disagreement, from all the farm leaders I have spoken to, about the general direction, although there have been difficulties associated with implementing a policy to reflect those factors. The two sticking points are, firstly, how we deal with the circumstances of extreme drought and, secondly, how we come to grips with the new funding arrangements under the rural adjustment scheme, given that that will be the centrepiece of the delivery of drought and other assistance. I am pleased to advise that, finally, at a meeting recently held with agricultural Ministers we reached an in-principle agreement which is subject to announcements that will be made tonight within the Budget. I undertook to go back to Cabinet and argue for these commitments. I believe that as a consequence of the Budget tonight we will finally be able to announce a drought policy for this country in the immediate future. It will be a drought policy based on sound policy initiatives which have been talked through with the constituency and which complement the thrust of economic and long term viability, better and more sustainable land management practices and the initiative that we recently announced: the landcare and environment action program for the young unemployed in this country. The policy is to put a labour component, together with the capital dimension that is there, to address these landcare and environment related issues to make our rural system more sustainable. We will also announce changes in the not too distant future to RAS to make sure that it goes in that direction. I am disappointed that the Leader of the National Party did 11,0t give us an insight the Opposition's drought policy. Those opposite seem to think that the GST and Fightback are a panacea for everything, but Fightback does not even mention drought. To suggest that to eliminate taxes will solve drought problems is arrant nonsense. I tum now to the assertion that the abolition of seven taxes will be a great boon to the rural sector. I have already abolished one: the coal export duty. Apart from the fact that that reduces the taxes from seven to six, it does not mean terribly much for the rural sector. When have those opposite gone out and told the farmers, 'We have got a great deal for you. We are going to abolish the coal export duty. '? The farmers would just look at those opposite stupidly, and they deserve to be looked at stupidly. Of the remaining six taxes, three predominantly will not apply to the farm sector: payroll tax, superannuation and the training guarantee levy. Why? Because farmers in the vast bulk of cases do not pass the thresholds that require those taxes to be paid. Of the three remaining taxes, we will exempt one almost entirely with the amendments that we have made to the wholesale sales tax. The wholesale sales tax is now only one per cent of the cost of production for the farm sector. The big benefit that is proposed for the farm sector is the fuel excise. But the question still remains: how will the coalition fund its roads program? Abolishing the fuel tax will cost the Budget $6.8 billion. One either has a great gaping fiscal hole-and those opposite have talked this afternoon about the need for fiscal responsibility-or one has to raise the revenue through other road user charges. Yet the Opposition still has not come clean and said which of those options it will exercise. Fightback is quite clear: Fightback says it will be done through a user pays principle. The NFF analysis that has been through the ACIL report assumes kindly, I would suggest, that only 50 per cent would be recouped. What does that mean for users of diesel consuming equipment who do not pay any excise now but who will be slugged with the road user charge to meet the shortfall? Why into have members of the National Party not told their people about that? The last of the remaining so-called seven taxes is the customs tax. The customs tax and the issues that relate to it are causing enormous difficulties for the National Party, as well knows. It has already had a resignation from the front bench. The tax can only be abolished if all tariffs are also abolished. know that the Opposition has been agonising about the difference between negligible and zero. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewston) argue that protection support or support in lieu of the tariff can be given through the exchange rate, and we have seen a good example of how that might happen in recent days. I would be very surprised if farmers really believe, on the Opposition's say so, that industries will be looked after by the exchange rate because, every time the exchange rate is mentioned to me in meetings, farmers say that they do not have faith that it will take account of their concerns. The point remains that we cannot get rid of the customs duty unless tariffs are abolished. The Leader of the National Party needs to contemplate this point very carefully. He is either stuck with his commitment to zero tariffs or he cannot deliver on one of those tax cuts. That is what he is stuck with. I tum now to the impact micro-economic reform has had on the farm sector. We have heard today that nothing has happened. We have had a good response from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on that point. I will mention some specific areas that have had an immediate and lasting impact on the farm sector. In shipping, the average crew size has been reduced from 33 to 21 since the end of the last recession. That has seen a reinvestment in this country of $2 billion in Australian flag vessels. Five years ago that would never have been thought possible, but it has occurred because of our commitment to and delivery in shipping. In waterfront reform, the Australian Wheat Board has estimated a $lOm a year saving from a reduction in stevedoring costs. Australian ports are now regarded by the Wheat Board as amongst the most efficient in the world, yet the Opposition goes around saying that no reform has taken place. In rail transport, Australian National has reduced its call on taxpayers by 70 per cent since 198283. We also have a strategy to reduce costs in it electricity and a number of other government business enterprises. It is nonsense to suggest that no reform has taken place; it has. We We will continue to deliver good policy. Whilst those opposite go round with their heads lopped off not knowing where they are going, the people in the electorate will turn to us. (Time expired)",37
263,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is with considerable pleasure that I speak to the matter of public importance submitted by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I remind the Minister for their Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who has just spoken, that my speech will deal mainly with drought, as the Leader of the National Party requested this morning. This matter has not been neglected by this side of the House. The Minister has just given another one of his extraordinary speeches in which he demonstrates that he knows little about what goes on in the bush. He says that sales tax does not affect farmers at all. He has been running this line for over a year now. We have seen him embarrass himself in Question Time by saying that sales tax does not apply to two-wheel drive petrol utilities, et cetera. Treasury's own figures show that $288m in sales tax is paid by farmers. Surely the Minister cannot deny his own Treasury figures. He also tries to disparage Fightback. The Treasury document, which the Government itself set up to see whether it would benefit farmers, says quite clearly that farmers would be better off by $1,025m. That translates into $160 for the average farmer every week for the rest of his or her life. The Minister has knocked that. I think debate in the House on a matter of public importance whereby the outright tibs the Government has been telling us constantly over the last 10 years are exposed is long overdue. The litany of deception that this Government has fed the Australian people to stay in power is a sad record. The only extraordinary thing about it is that Government members have got away with it for so long. Today in Question Time we heard the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) reeling off supposedly good thing after good thing that they have done for this country. When their answers were finished, those who had listened to them could conclude only that Australia was some sort of nirvana; that we had died and gone to heaven and everything was well. The fact is that Australia is in a very deep recession, and this is especially so in the bush. We have record numbers of bankruptcies in this country, the likes of which we have not seen since the 1930s. We have record shortfalls in investment, and unemployment at the level of one million people. We have an overseas debt that has blown out almost seven-fold, from $23 billion net· to $148 billion. The money that we send out of Australia every year in the interest payments on that is more than we are spending on health, education and defence individually. The tragic thing is that that will continue to go up for some time-such momentum has been generated by this Government's policies. On top of that, we have had record interest rates, and at present we have record real interest rates. All the Government is doing is ignoring the hardship out there. Do Government members know what it is really like? We have just come out of the winter recess, and every day my office receives a constant trickle of people who are distressed about what is happening at the moment. These people are distraught. .They do not know where to tum. Their life savings have been ripped off them by Government policies. Surely Government members know how bad it is. Surely they cannot be that dim. But blithely go on saying, 'We've turned the corner. Recovery is under way'. Does anybody actually believe that? They say, 'We just want a bit more time'. Mr Bruce Scott-It is time.",40
264,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is time, but I suppose what they are really saying is, 'Elect us one more time. We like the power and privilege of office. We do not know how to handle it, but we certainly like the power and privilege of it'. I say to the Government, 'Your time is up. You have ruined a great country. You have poisoned almost everything that you have touched. You have run out of ideas. You are even recycling bereft policies such as using taxpayers' money to create government jobs'. At the next election there will be a cleaning out of the Augean stables in this country, the likes of which we have not seen since we were last put into power, back in 1975. The Government has hurt so many people, and hurt them so badly, that I would think at least it would do something about it. This is supposed to be the party of compassion, but it is totally ignoring the desperate plight these people are in. No area has been hit harder than the western area of New South Wales. As my new electorate will take in 40 per cent of New South Wales, I would like to say something about that. At present, 73 per cent of New South Wales is in a drought. Most of that area is in the second year of drought and some of the area is in the third year of drought. The little bit of rain we had the other day, 50 or 100 points through most of that area, will not do much good at all. It is not just the traditional drought that they are .suffering at the moment of little water, no feed and dying stock; they are also suffering a financial drought, in large part caused by Federal Government policies. The Minister sits there looking at me. There is no better example of what the Government has done than the emasculation of the lED scheme. Had it left that intact back in 198384, people today would have been in a better financial position to get through the drought. The Government removed drought from the national disaster relief scheme in 1989. Despite numerous inquiries, despite a drought they policy review task force reporting over two y-as ago and despite a Senate standing committee being formed to bring out a national"" drought policy, the Government is only now starting to act in this area. The drought will be over if it is not careful and does not act soon. The Minister has allocated $14m for farmers in extreme drought in New South Wales and Queensland. I urge more Government members to get out there and see what it is really like. We just heard a speech by the Minister in which he told us how he went out there and inspected it. I was told that he flew into Bourke, was there for a couple of hours and then received a call saying he had to be back in Canberra because the Prime Minister wanted to talk to him. The reason the Prime Minister wanted to talk to him was that the Prime Minister was launching a CD that night. That was the Minister's trip into the drought=stricken area of New South Wales. He told us that he was applauded for introducing the so-called farmer dole. I do not know too many farmers who have received it yet. There cannot be more than 80 or 100 over the whole of Australia who have received it. The scheme is just not working. The rural councillors will tell Government members it is not working. The Department of Social Security will tell them it is not working. Everybody knows it is not working, except them. If Government members do go out there and look at the drought-stricken areas, they will see that these areas are like the moon. It is the worse drought in Australia's history in many areas. I am talking about areas that normally are dry anyway. Stock losses of 40 and 50 per cent are the norm. Some farmers are down to 10 to 20 per cent of their normal stock numbers. Imagine the trauma those people have been through over the last couple of years, seeing their average flock of 6,000 sheep dwindle, through death and starvation, to 500 or 600 today. This is the pressure that is put on families who have no income and cannot pay their bills, yet are still producing something for Australia. These are the sorts of people who may contribute $100,000 to Australia in export income, yet in years like this they themselves are earning an income of about minus $30,000. These people have no money to start over again. The banks are perpetually screaming at them for repayments; they are falling further and further behind. Some of these people cannot even buy diesel for their generators. There are hundreds of people out there who still do not have electricity connected. In these days when we can put men on the moon, they still do not have electricity connected to their houses, even though they are making this magnificent contribution to Australia. At the very least, I think the Government should be able to give household support in the fo- of a grant, as the coalition proposes. That would be much better than this farmer dole, which is nothing more than a cruel hoax. These people are now pulling their kids out of secondary school. They are suffering heartbreak. They turn on the radio to hear a bit of good news, to hear what the Government is doing for them, and what do they hear? The Reserve Bank is propping up the dollar, keeping the exchange rate artificially high so that, if they do finally get a bit of wool to sell, they will get less for it than they really should be getting; I can understand the great distress they are going through as a result of that. The Government needs to bring in good policies, such as restocking finance, so that when it eventually rains again these people will be able to start again and make a great contribution to this country asJhey have done in the past. It is time for the Government to tell the Australian people the truth about what is happening, to face reality where things have gone wrong, and to have the courage to make the necessary changes. It should stop misleading the Australian people and wallowing in self-delusion and do something for Australia. (TIme expired)",41
265,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"page) (4.10 p.m.)There is no doubt that difficulties do come about because of drought and there is no doubt that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is well aware of those through his visits to the western areas of New South Wales and Queensland. I also recently visited Walgett, Lightning Ridge and other such areas. The people out there are certainly going through a very difficult time. Like the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), I have been receiving constant reports on that area from Barry Brebner, who happens to be the Labor Party candidate for the area in the next election. He also has great concern for the farmers in that electorate. The honourable member for Parkes mentioned a Treasury document from which he cited a $1,025m increase in farm income because of the GST. In fact, if we look at the farm sector we see that the total is $797m because, in the $1,025m figure, agriculture as well as forestry, logging, fishing and hunting are included. The real point is that it is incomes only; it does not take into account the expenditure of farm incomes and, of course, expenditure affects people's living standards just as much as their incomes. When that is taken into account in that document-the same document that the honourable member quoted from-we find that 60 per cent of farm households will be worse off. That is really the bottom line. I find it quite amazing when members of the National Party get up and start talking about mismanagement, especially in relation to drought. The Minister has already alluded to the history of drought in Queensland, which is the State experiencing the most severe drought at present. Between 1964 and 1989-the Minister has spoken about this, but I think it is worth repeating-some Queensland shires were drought declared 70 per cent of the time. That is mismanagement; it is about putting resources where they should not go. The announcements at that time were triggered by the State of Queensland under Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Honourable members should understand that three-quarters of the drought assistance went to only 16 per cent of propertieS. That is a problem. It was mismanagement for two reasons: firstly, that assistance was going to the bigger farms; and, secondly, because it was going to the wrong places and because those decisions had been made wrongly, those people who deserved and warranted the assistance were unable to get it at the right time because it had already gone to the wrong people. That is what inefficiency and mismanagement are all about. So when members of the National Party get up and start talking about mismanagement, especially in relation to drought, they leave themselves open to enormous criticism because of what they have done in the past. Honourable members should think about the structural changes that have taken place in the last 10 years, the economic direction of this country in the larger scene and the potential that this has given Australia to be on the path to prosperity. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Me Tim Fischer) talked about Japan, but he has started talking about Japan only in recent times. He should go back and look at Japan and other countries which have prospered since the postwar period. They prospered because their manufacturing industries went out and competed with the rest of the world. They produced goods and exported them. Australia missed the bus in those postwar years. Our secondary industry was protected by high tariff walls which produced enormous inefficiencies. Our mentality was closed: we supplied only the Australian market and, because of that, we were unable to compete on either price or quality with what the rest of the world was producing. That is the situation in which we found ourselves in 1974, 1980 and 1982. The policies which had been pursued for a couple of decades were holding Australia back and making us unable to gain the prosperity that we should have had. But changes have taken place in Australian industry. If we look at the export figures of manufacturers we see that industry leaders are taking the initiative and are taking up the challenge. We are starting to compete in a whole range of areas. This issue has to be looked at in a wider context. In the postwar decades, people would come along to see Black Jack MCEwen and say, 'Hey, we've just given the workers a rise. We can't afford to keep selling at the price that the imports are coming in at', and Black Jack would say, 'Righto, we'll give you a bit more protection'. That was passed on and the people who paid for it-apart from the ordinary consumers of Australia-were, by and large, the primary producers. This is where we have changed things. If we look at the average effective rates of assistance to the manufacturing and agricultural industries between 1973 and 1991, we see that the gap has narrowed markedly from about 12 or 13 per cent to in the vicinity of 2, 3 or 4 per cent. That is real progress for the agricultural sector. The agreement on the national drought policy is a real step forward. It says, 'We are going to take a new direction; we are going to talk about planning and management on farms', rather than just give one-off handouts as the National Party would like to do. It has initiatives including funding a communications strategy for the national drought policy, funding education and training, supporting additional measures under Landcare, funding research and development, ensuring better coordination of research and development, restructuring the rural assistance scheme, implementing a revamped IEDS, phasing out State transaction-based drought assistance, and additional finance under the RAS for farmers in severe or extreme drought. That includes the $14m which is to be split between New South Wales and Queensland and which the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales has put at risk through his statements which really show a lack of knowledge of the issues involved. In his speech the Leader of the National Party also spoke at length about an underclass and unemployment. It is interesting that the National Party is jumping on the unemployment wagon now because most National Party electorates-and .my electorate is a former National Party electorate-have been suffering fromMr Bruce Scott-And it will be again soon.",42
266,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Now listen, I have heard stories about people doing this before. Charles Blunt who was here before used to stand up and point at honourable members on this side and say, 'Hey, you won't be here'. Look where he is now. So anybody who gets into prediction in this thing is nothing more than a fool. The Leader of the National Party got onto unemployment. My electorate, which is a former National Party electorate, along with most National Party electorates, suffers from very high unemployment. But that is not new. It has not come around with the recession. It has been there for 10 years. Were members of the National Party standing up 10 years ago and saying, 'We've got high unemployment and we want something done for our electorates. '? No, they were not. They are jumping on the bandwagon with the Leader of the Liberal Party, (Dr Hewson), getting dragged along by the ear by that missionary, and they are doing it to the detriment of rural people.

NORFOLK ISLAND (ELECTORAL AND JUDICIAL) AMENDMENT BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion by Ms Fatin: That the Bill be now read a second time. (Quorum formed)",44
269,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LANGUAGE,"It is with great pleasure that I rise this afternoon to address the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill. Although I have never been to Norfolk Island, I know that long ago when Captain Cook first discovered Norfolk Island he described it as a paradise. If honourable members look at the records of Captain Cook, they will find that on his travels he did not call any other place which he discovered a paradise, so it must indeed be a paradise. It is a pity that some hearings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works were not held on Norfolk Island on occasions, because perhaps I would have been there then. One day I certainly will make it my business to go there. My parliamentary duties have prevented me from making it to Norfolk Island, such are the more pressing issues in my electorate like drought and Government mismanagement. The Bill will enable certain residents of Norfolk Island to vote in parliamentary eJections and for other purposes. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in the repOrt Islands in the Sun: The Legal Regimes of s Australia External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory of March 1991, repOrted that Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island remain the only resident Australians not entitled, as a right, to representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. The Committee received representations indicating that Norfolk Islanders themselves had mixed views regarding representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. However, it concluded: . . . the right to vote is an absolute right which should not be denied to those people of Norfolk Island who wish to exercise their right. However, the Committee recognises that the constitutional history of the Territory is complex and that Norfolk Island warrants special consideration in this regard. In addition, the Committee is cognisant of the strongly held views of the elements of the Norfolk Island population, most likely a majority, for whom 1992 Commonwealth parliamentary representation is an anathema. It went on to say: The Committee is aware that proVIsIons exist within the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 for optional voting for the following categories: an Antarctic elector; an eligible overseas elector; or an itinerant elector. The Committee is mindful of the strongly held views and the historical reasons which make Norfolk Island a unique case. The Committee is therefore prepared to accept, contrary to the important principles which apply anywhere else in Australia,. that the residents of Norfolk Island who are. Australian citizens should have the right of optional enrolment. Once a citizen exercises this right, voting would be compulsory and normal provisions under the Commonwealth Electoral Act would apply. The report recommended: . . . the Commonwealth Parliament amend the Commonwealth Electoml Act 1918 to give optional enrolment rights to the people of Norfolk Island; the electorate to which the voters would be attached to be determined on the advice of the Australian Electoral Commission. The Government response to the report tabled on 10 September 1991 agreed that optional enrolment recognises the unique circumstances of Norfolk Island and provides those Australian citizens who wish to exercise this basic democratic right the opportunity to vote in elections for the Federal Parliament. As a result of the Norfolk Island plebiscite on voting rights for Australian citizens, the then Minister for Territories, Mr Simmons, suggested that· for the purpose of Australian Federal elections Norfolk Island voters would be aligned with a single electorate, namely Canberra. ,The Norfolk Island Government has lobbied against the single electorate proposal and for compulsory voting for all Norfolk Island residents. The current Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), who is at the table, has backed down and has now introduced legislati(;>n which enables Australian citizens to enrol in an electorate of their choice. In this case she has accepted the strongly held view of the Norfolk Islanders. The purpose of this Bill is to extend to Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island the opportunity to vote in Federal elections and referendums. This is consistent with the coalition's repeated views. The Bill will amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to provide a form of optional enrolment to eligible Norfolk Island residents to enable them to enrol in mainland-Australian Federal or State-electoral divisions with which they can establish a connection. Where such a connection cannot be established the option of enrolling in particular Territory divisions will be available. The Bill will also amend the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to allow those Norfolk Islanders enrolling in this way to participate in referendums, as required by section 128 of the Constitution. The electoral provisions of the Bill will have negligible impact on the Commonwealth revenues and expenditure. There will also be a minor amendment to section 56 of the Norfolk Islander Act 1979 in relation to the travelling expenses of judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court to encompass travelling allowances and to place beyond doubt the legality of past payments of travelling expenses purportedly made under that section. The Norfolk Island Government meets and will meet the travel-related cost of judges visiting the island from its own Budget. The amendments to the Norfolk Island Act will therefore have no impact on Commonwealth revenue and expenditure. The coalition supports this legislation. It has been a fairly long time coming, but it is sensible and it has certainly taken into consideration the wishes of the people of Norfolk Island in its drafting.",46
270,Mr KERR,TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LANGUAGE,"I welcome the general thrust of the remarks made by the honourable member for Maranoa (Me Bruce Scott) in responding to the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill. I should at the outset say that there element of a retreat of the kind that the honourable member suggested from the proposition that was advanced for compulsory voting. The Government has never endorsed such a proposal. It was not part of the recommendations in the report, Islands in the Sun: The Legal Regimes of Australia:SExternal Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory, presented by the relevant subcommittee, which I chaired, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; nor at any stage was it an element of the Government's response to that report. There is a degree of modification from the recommendations which were unanimously put to the Parliament by the Committee, that is, that optional enrolment rights would be provided to the people of Norfolk Island, the electorate to which voters would be attached to be determined on the advice of the Australian Electoral Commission. The basis for that was constitutional advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the effect that it would be not possible under the Australian Constitution to provide for the right of residents of Norfolk Island to vote as electors of a State. Since the time of the publication of our report the Government of Norfolk Island, anxious to avoid the consequence whereby electors on Norfolk Island would of necessity have to vote in an ACT division, which would have been the likely outcome of the Electoral Commission's determination, sought further constitutional advice and provided that to both the Government and to members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The thrust of that advice was that measures of the kind which the Government has now adopted were compatible with the Constitution. I must say that I remain somewhat sceptical of that legal advice as a matter of principle, but of course there is unlikely to be any plaintiff willing to litigate the issue. It now is a measure which commands the support of both sides of politics. The Government of Norfolk Island, which has been very sensitive is no about this issue, is now content with the measure. No doubt any potential litigant, other than those parties, would find it difficult to establish standing to bring the matter before a court. So in a sense we have a happy solution to a very hotly contested issue. It is difficult now, as we debate this matter before parliament, hearing the gentle remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa and the remarks that will be made in the debate later by members on both sides of this chamber, to recall some of the heat that previously existed in relation to this issue. I now refer to the Committee's report, Islands in the Sun. The heat in the report is reflected at paragraph 7.10.2 where the Society of Pitcairn Descendants expressed in evidence the view that ' ... we do not want to be part of Australia ... we are not Australians'. As a consequence of that assertion there were very strong representations to us that it was entirely inappropriate to facilitate in the least degree the possibility Pitcairners or any other residents of Norfolk Island participating in Federal elections. That required the Committee and this Parliament to reflect upon a very fundamental divergence between the wishes of probably a majority of the people of Pitcairn Island and this Parliament in terms of its responsibility to those who are not part of that majority. I will turn later to the question of the degree of strength of that asserted majority opinion, but let us concede, from the point of view of this debate today, that there still possibly remains a majority of residents of Pitcairn Island who would prefer that no person resident on that island be given the right to vote in an election for the Australian Parliament. That is a view with which the Committee could not agree, and it said so plainly and bluntly in terms that were referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa. It is a point that I reiterate as Chairman of the subcommittee that took evidence. It seems to me that it is entirely unacceptable that any citizen of this country, no matter how remotely he be resident, no matter in what circumstance he lives, be disenfranchised from the right to participation, democratically, in the electoral processes of this country. It seemed to me an enormous blot on our democratic traditions that we had for so long facilitated a situation where the residents of Norfolk Island were not enabled to undertake their democratic rights of participation in elections to this Parliament. That the particular circumstances of the island are very different from the rest of the country is reflected in a unique compromise which permits a voluntary enrolment rather than a compulsory enrolment, as is the case for the majority of Australian electors. The reasons for that are provided in the report. But it is very important to make the point that even if there had been only one Australian citizen on that island and not the many that were seeking to vote-even if there had been only one-it would have been entirely improper for the Committee to have reported otherwise than in the terms in which it did. The next point I want to deal with is a little of more broad. This debate today is of a somewhat narrow compass, but it leaves open the opportunity to respond to some of the other issues which were raised in the report, Islands in the Sun. This particular legislation deals creatively and successfully with the issue of representation of the people of Norfolk Island in the Commonwealth Parliament. I certainly look forward to the participation in the forthcoming Federal election of such of those members of that community who seek to participate. But there are other elements of the report which have not been implemented and which the Government has chosen to reject. One I want to reflect on today is the recommendation of the report which would have changed the arrangement on Norfolk Island so that it would have required Australian citizenship to be a voter in or a member of the Norfolk Island Assembly. Because of obvious existing interests, our recommendation was that those who had already acquired the right of voting but did not currently have Australian citizenship would not have that stripped from them, but in future it would be a precondition of participation in Assembly elections on Norfolk Island that electors be Australian citizens. To put this in context, there are approximately 2,000 residents of Norfolk Island on the island at the present time. Of those 2,000, approximately 1,500 are permanent residents under the very special arrangements that exist under the Norfolk Island legislation. Approximately 550 are temporary residents. The Islands in the Sun report summarises the population as follows: The Island has a population of some 2,000 people-the majority of whom are pennanent residents. Approximately 550 are temporary residents. Forty-six percent of the pennanently resident population are of Pitcairn Island descent. Australians and New Zealanders make up the bulk of the balance of population. Tourism, the major economic activity of the island, attracts an estimated 26,000 tourists each year. As well as those currently resident on the island, there are at least as many off the island entitled to residence on the island. Estimates of those numbers are difficult to be confident of, but it was suggested to us in discussions on the island that there may be as many as 3,000 people off Norfolk Islandthat is, more than twice the current number presently residing as permanent residentswho are entitled to return to Norfolk Island should they so desire. In other words, they have the right of permanent residence but they currently reside outside Norfolk Island, principally in Australia. Taking the population groups that have been mentioned, those who are of Pitcairn Island descent are automatically Australian citizens by virtue of their birth and their ancestry; those who are Australian living on the island are self-evidently Australian citizens; but there are about 500 or so pertions manent residents of the island who are neither Pitcairners by descent nor Australian citizens. wealth. Principally, those people are New Zealanders. Currently the laws relating to entitlement to participation in the Assembly elections allow for any person who has lived on the island for, I think, 31f2 years, and who evidences intention to remain on the island permanently, to have the right to vote in that Assembly election. This means that approximately oneliament. third of the effective franchise is held by Australian voters, principally New Zealanders. This is not part of any campaign of required denigration of New Zealanders that may be part of a broader agenda for some; it simply reflects the reality of the social composition of the island. There are some others who are of nonelector Australian descent who are from States and other parts of the world. Indeed, one of the most prominent advocates of the extreme anti-Australian sentiment that was evidenced on some occasions is the editor of the local newsletter who is a citizen of the United States. So the comments I make are not directed in any way against New Zealanders. But it is incompatible, in my view, with the developing constitutional framework that we have everywhere else in Australia to allow non-Australian citizens to participate in the election of government authorities. We have had to deal with very hard choices in other parts of Australia, in other Territories of Australia, where there are substantial populations of non-Australian citizens who reside in those Territories; they have the rights of permanent residents but they have chosen not to take out Australian citizenship. One example is Christmas Island-and I think the same applies to Cocos (Keeling) Islandswhere many people have lived for a considerable period and, because they have property in some other country which they might forfeit title to if they take out Australian citizenship, or for reasons personal to themselves, they have chosen not to take out Australian citizenship and thereby forfeit the right to participate in the assembly elecin those Territories in which they reside. It is the same now throughout the CommonWhen I was a young lad growing up, it was sufficient for my parents to demonstrate that my father was a Scot; it was sufficient to an demonstrate that he came from the British Empire, or from Britain, to entitle him to participate in a vote for the Federal ParThat changed some little while ago. nonMore lately it changed in respect of local government elections. Before, all that was was residency and now, of course, Australian citizenship is required as well. So there are common roles, and we now accept as a basic principle of democratic franchise right throughout this country that the rights and responsibilities of participating as an are conditional upon acceptance of the United Australian citizenship. As our report said, the consequence of that is a very narrow one. Had our report been accepted, the consequence would have been a very narrow one. That is because we recommended in respect of those who already exercise the right to vote be grandfathered that their franchise be maintained. We felt it would be improper for the Australian Parliament to take away a right that has been conferred already, and that those persons who have exercised a right to vote should lose that vote. We were not suggesting that. But we were saying that any new residents going to the island should not gain the right to participate in the Assembly elections unless they took out Australian citizenship. So people who come from New Zealand, the United States, or wherever, should they choose to settle in an Australian Territory, do not acquire a right to determine the policies of that Territory simply by reason of their residence; they acquire that right only by adopting Australia as their new home and taking out Australian citizenship. Notwithstanding my great pleasure in the very creditable, and I think skilled, negotiations that went on in relation to settling this question of ensuring that all Norfolk Island residents who are Australian citizens have the right to vote in Australian elections, I am still extremely disquieted by what seems to me to be an anomaly-something which is out of touch with the entire framework of our constitutional representation throughout the rest of this country, including in other Territories where similar difficulties emerge. It is now unique, and I think sadly unique, to Norfolk Island, where we still allow people to come in from other countries, to live on Norfolk Island for a relatively short period and to thereby acquire a right of participation in Assembly elections. I will finish by indicating the distortions that are inherent in this kind of representation. In the course of our work it was put to us that our recommendations were entirely without the support of the Norfolk Island people. A referendum was held on 13 February 1991 to ask the electors of Norfolk Island the following question: With respect to matters discussed by the Legal Regimes Inquiry, including the question of representation, should the constitutional position of Norfolk Island be changed? There is a great tradition throughout Australia of voting no in referendums. There was a great tradition established in Norfolk Island of voting no also. Some 82.3 per cent voted no and 16.9 per cent voted yes. If we exclude from those voters the 25 per cent who are citizens of other countries and who, therefore, would be offended by the recommendations we were putting-that is, that the enfranchisement of their fellows from overseas be no longer possible-we see that essentially there was a very mixed opinion. There would still be a.substantial majority in favour of leaving things exactly as they were-a majority with whose opinions I would profoundly disagree-but it would be a very much smaller majority. That 25 per cent of the island's population from New Zealand, the United States and other countries were able to vote in that referendum. Naturally, they voted in that referendum to support their existing interests. Their interests are often not necessarily those of the Nuffkas people who came to us privately and said that they felt that there were real concerns about their economic future, that they wanted to have a continuing sound relationship with Australia and that they were not persuaded by the kind of overheated rhetoric that was common to some of the propagandists for the anti-Australian cause. They felt that, whatever the future for Norfolk Island, it was in the interests of the people that it continue to have a healthy and sound relationship with the Australian mainland. I conclude by commending the Government for an elegant solution to a difficult problem, but also reminding it that in my view, whilst the Bill solves one problem, another problem remains yet to be addressed.",47
271,Mr SINCLAIR,TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LANGUAGE,"I want to add a few words in the debate on the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill 1992, which I welcome. There is no doubt that, given the nature and extent of feelings in Norfolk Island, it would be wrong to suggest that a Federal measure such as this could have been introduced without significant consultation, and I want to refer to that in a moment. Above all, it seems to me that the legislation has really been a product of compromise. The circumstances of allowing the people of Norfolk Island a voice in the Australian Parliament has been achieved in a way which I think is both suitable from the point of view of us in Australia and satisfacParliament tory not just to the Pitcairners but to everybody on Norfolk Island. I do not want to canvass this matter as did my colleague on the external territories subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which produced the report Islands in the Sun-the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr)although there is one area which I want to pursue. I refer to the last point which the honourable member referred to, which he suggested we needed to look at further-the question of future Australian citizenship. We need to remember that Norfolk Island is a very independent community. Happily for Australia and, I suspect, even more happily for the people of Norfolk Island, Norfolk Islanders have chosen to continue their association with Australia. I think we should start a discussion on an island of this nature by remembering that in Australia we believe that people should have the right to govern themselves. It is therefore very much a matter for the people of Norfolk Island to determine the extent to which they want to maintain their association with Australia. Of course, this legislation takes that association a further. Over the years, the Pitcairners have felt somewhat different from other members of the island Territories of Australia-with understandable reasons. They trace their origins and situation from their transfer from Pitcairn Island. 'They have an entirely different right to their citizenship of Norfolk Island from other people. Indeed, one of the matters not addressed in the legislation, and which certainly generated some sympathy on my part, related to the fact that they would rather like on their Australian passports-they have no others-to be identified as coming from Norfolk Island. That might well generate difficulties, but as an individual I have considerable sympathy for the concept of Australian citizens who are residents of Norfolk Island being in some way identified as such on their passports. Frankly, I do not think that that would in any way prejudice their status. Australian citizenship is an issue which this needs to consider in a wider debate. I am not happy about the degree to which in my view it is not elevated to a debate on what I see as the most important of all the rights that we as individual Australians enjoy. I believe, therefore, that if we are going to create a separate status for residents of Norfolk Island we will in a way be reducing that status. That would concern me. So there are two sides of the debate as far as Norfolk Island is concerned. Certainly in my view, as far as Australians are concerned, being an Australian is a pre-eminent right and privilege. I do not want anything done that would in any way introduce different classes of Australian citizenship. I guess that is one of my reasons for questioning the degree to which we could give the residents of Norfolk Island that status on their passports. Equally, I do not know that we should impose Australian citizenship on Norfolk Island residents. It is appropriate to acceptand the honourable member for Denison has identified something of the population breakdown within Norfolk Island-that Norfolk Island is a Pacific Ocean domain. It is in a part of the South Pacific in which many other step independent countries-some of which are even smaller than Norfolk Island-operate as independent nations. If Norfolk Islanders have decided to retain their association with us, so be it, but I do not believe that we should impose on them any obligation to Australian citizenship. Although I am a member of the committee which made those recommendations to which the honourable member for Denison referred, having heard the arguments of the people of Norfolk Island, I accept their point of view. I want in particular to speak of correspondence that I have received from Mr John Brown, the Minister for Health and Education in the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island, who, I understand, has recently been elected as the Chief Minister of the Legislative Assembly. I have had several concerns. I intend to quote from his letter to me. I understand that he has sent a copy to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), so I believe that it is not inappropriate that I read it into the record. Because of its relevance, I think it deserves wider understanding and, consequently, circulation. Without my having contacted Mr Brown, I trust that he will forgive my using his letter in this debate. The letter is dated 17 August 1992. I want to quote two parts of it. Firstly, it states: . . . please be assured that the electoral Bill full support of the Norfolk Island Government and, I believe, community. As you may know, the Island's position on this issue followed an overwhelming vote in two local referendums against electoral integration with Canberra. Instead, after intensive negotiations with the Federal Government, a scheme was devised to allow Norfolk Island residents to vote in electorates with which they have affinity as individuals. I believe that this solution meets both Commonwealth and Island concerns about the involvement of Islanders in Federal elections. The next paragraph is perhaps even more significant. Mr Brown says: The Bill has been commented upon in detail by the Norfolk Island Government, and we have expressed our agreement with its terms. I think, therefore, that the Bill does indeed accommodate to the maximum the views of the people of Norfolk Island. I think that is to be commended. I thank Mr Brown for having me advised of that. Part of my worry has been that, for all that there is this relationship with Australia, there was obviously a very strongly held opinion amongst Pitcairners, and I suspect others on Norfolk Island, about the degree to which they should retain that separate status. As the Minister's second reading speech identifies, Norfolk Islanders are, after all, now managing their own finances. As a result, to the maximum, we need to register the fact that they have a capacity to operate independently of us. Fortunately, through this compromise, they will be able to have a direct say in this place through those' members who will represent them according to the way in which this legislation is structured. The Minister's second reading speech explains that in that it provides that those Norfolk Islanders who can establish a relevant connection with a State electoral subdivision can enrol in that subdivision; those who cannot establish such a connection may enrol in a particular Territory division, currently the division of Canberra. Therefore, there is an option for them to enrol. The other part of the letter by Mr Brownand I am particularly grateful to him for sending me this advice-related to a concern that I have canvassed in this place before. My worry was that, whereas under our Constitution there is a requirement that we do not has the hold two offices of profit under the Crown, that apparently was not the practice in Norfolk Island. I have spoken of the unique character of Norfolk Island. I think it is quite appropriate, therefore, that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly is developing its own answer to this problem. I would prefer it to be done in that way rather than having it imposed by this legislation. I commend Mr Brown for having advised me of this prior to this debate. I shall quote from his letter to identify the arrangement. My point, as some honourable members may recall, was not that I wanted to preclude any resident of Norfolk Island being eligible to vote or standing for office. My concern was rather that such a person, already having one office, should not be in a position of conflict. Apparently, some were employees of the body that was their employer and of which they, as elected members of the Legislative Assembly, had a different responsibility to the people of Norfolk Island. I can see a conflict between their elected position and their official responsibilities as paid employees of the Legislative Assembly. I am delighted to hear that under section 43, to which I will refer, of a draft of the Norfolk Island Government's Charter of Aims, Goals and Objectives there is consideration of a specific amendment which will preclude this in future. I refer to that, if I may, by quoting from the letter from Minister John Brown: The question of public servants' ability to be members of the Legislative Assembly is, of course, a separate issue, and the Norfolk Island Government is very keen to ensure that the issue does not delay the progress of the the form in which it was introduced. Nevertheless, you may be - nterest- to know that, following the general e1ectl';ln here m M-y of t-IS year I as Minister responsIble for pubhc servIce matte-, have placed before the Legislative Assembly a proposal on page 4 of the encl.osed paper entitled ""The Norfolk Island PublIc SectorProposals for Change"", and also at clause 43 of the draft Bill included in the paper. While no decisions have yet been made on this proposal, it is certainly under consideration. It would, therefore, be fair to say that the problem raised in your speechwhich is the problem about a conflict of interest that I raised in my speechis under review by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. I commend Mr Brown for that, and I trust that the proposals are adopted. I believe that it would be very much in the interests of the community of Norfolk Island to adopt that principle which avoids any suggestion of a person in any way having a conflict of interest. I quote from the document titled Norfolk Island Public Sector-Proposals for Change. Under the title' Assembly members' on page 4, it states: The paper proposes that the ability of Assembly members to retain employment in the public sector be removed after a transitional period. However, regulations may be made exempting. certai- classes of public sector employees from thIS reqUIrement. If one turns to the draft legislation, which the Minister has also forwarded to me, the heading of clause 43 reads 'Certain Legislative Assembly members not to be employees'. It states: 43.(1) Subject to subsection (3), a public sector employee who(a) is elected after the commencen:tent. of this section to be a member of the LegIslatIve Assembly-is to be taken to have resigned from the person's employment under section 42 with effect from the date of the election; or (b) on the commencement of this section holds office as a member of the Legislative Assembly-is to be taken to have resigned from the person's employment under section 42 with effect from the end of the period of 3 months beginning on the commencement, unless the person has, before the end of that period, ceased to be a member of the Assembly. electoral Bill in Section 43 continues: (2) ... a person who is a member of the Legislative Assembly must not, after the end of the period ?f 3 months beginning on the commencement of thIS section, be employed under this Act. (3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to public sector employees included in a prescribed class of such employees. (4) If a person elected to be a member of the Legislative Assembly is, on the date - f the peCS?n's election, a public sector employee mcluded In a class prescribed under subsection (3), the subsequent amendment or repeal of the regulations does not apply to the person until the date of the next succeeding general election. Provided those are put into place, I think it will go a long way to meeting the problem. Indeed, it is a challenge for the Legislative Assembly. I know the difficulties of a small community. What I have said on earlier occasions does not reflect against any individual. One individual inevitably was in this position and, hence, that was the reason for my raising the issue. The point is that this does not go as far as the Australian constitutional requirement. That really is not so much at issue. I think it is more a matter of the people of Norfolk Island being quite confident that, if they elect a member to the Legislative Assembly, that person is able to act in a totally dispassionate way without any prejudice on his or her behalf. In other words, I do not believe that being an employee and a member of the Legislative Assembly is irreconcilable. It was on that basis that I felt it necessary that a revision be made. Even though I understand that it is the responsibility of the Legislative Assembly and I feel that perhaps this does not go as far as I would prefer, I still accep! that it is ultimately for the Assembly to decide. I think it is important that we understand that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly is considering the problem along with other matters. I commend Mr Brown for setting down this Norfolk Island Charter of Aims, Goals and Objectives. As he said, it is to preserve and foster the cultural integrity and environmental quality of Norfolk Island, which I think every honourable member would endorse. There has been significant progress towards ensuring that there is not a conflict of interest. The fact that perhaps it does not go as far as I would wish is really for the Norfolk Islanders ultimately to determine. I am glad to see that there has been progress, and I commend Mr Brown for letting me know about it. The significance of this legislation is .that has been reached by compromise between the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and the Australian Government. I think that is essential. The other matters within the legislation are not of great consequence. However, I notice that the travelling allowance that is henceforth to be paid to the Federal Court judges who travel there as judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court is being regularised. There has apparently been some problem in the past. As the Minister said, payments which were technically unauthorised were made and received in good faith. I endorse the fact that they have been paid in this way. One final sidenote to this legislation is that members of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs responsible for the Islands in the Sun report know that Jon Stanhope, who was. the principal officer of the Committee, is now representing the Australian Government on Norfolk Island. I think it is quite appropriate that he should do so, and I wish him well in his endeavours. Norfolklsland is a wonderful spot, and one which I am sure all of us who have visited it regard as one of those delightful areas of the Pacific which, remote and isolated though they might be, have a quality of life which I suspect few others on the Australian mainland can enjoy.",50
272,Mr KERR,TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LANGUAGE,What about Tasmania?,54
273,Mr SINCLAIR,TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LANGUAGE,"I think it would be better if we forgot about some of the problems south of the Victorian border and across Bass Strait. They really canvass quite different issues from those that are currently before the House. I suspect that even Tasmanians would enjoy a sojourn in Norfolk Island, as I know my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has on more than one occasion. This legislation is to be commended. It is a welcome addition to the evolving relationship between Norfolk Island and Australia. It is one which I trust will foster our future together as citizens of the South Pacific, sharing as we do a common concern that it there should be an opportunity for individuals wherever they might live, in Australia or its Territories, to have some say in electing the Government of our choice and ensuring that the members of that Government are answerable to those who are the voters and the electors.",54
274,Mr LAVARCH,TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LANGUAGE,"I join my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in speaking on the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill. The Bill is in essence quite simple; it amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act to implement the recommendation of the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee entitled Islands in the Sun which canvassed the legal regimes of Australia's various external Territories. Essentially, what the Committee recommended, which is incorporated in this Bill, is that Australians resident on Norfolk Island should be given the opportunity to vote in a Federal election. This therefore puts Norfolk Island on the same footing as the other Australian external Territories, notably Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and puts its residents on the same footing as all Australians in having the right to vote. The situation was one that the Australian Parliament could not tolerate in that a group of Australians-albeit a small group; I think the permanent population of NoIfolk Island is about 2,OOO-was unable to vote. Even though this is a simple measure, its path in getting here has not been terribly simple. There have been two issues, the first of which was the question of whether the residents of Norfolk Island should have this right conferred upon them. There was certainly a strong feeling among people on the island that they did not want this favour, that they did not want to vote. Secondly, there was a constitutional issue as to the mechanism by which the scheme would be put into place. That has been the subject of a period of detailed consultation between the Government and the Government of Norfolk Island. In addition, a number of legal opinions, which I have had the opportunity to peruse, have been prepared by quite eminent Australian lawyers on this question of whether the scheme incorporated in the Bill is constitutional. As the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) indicated, there may be some debate on the point, and I will canvass it briefly in a few minutes; but I do not suppose that it will ever really come to be determined because, if the Parliament and Norfolk Island are happy about it, one wonders whether anyone would ever take it to the High Court for a final determination. It is in a sense, I suppose, a moot point, but an interesting point nonetheless. As previous speakers have indicated, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee visited Norfolk Island on, I think, two occasions-I was able to go on the second of those occasions-to speak to the residents of the island and particularly to the Government of Norfolk Island. It was an extremely enjoyable experience, and I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) that the island can be described as a paradise. Nonetheless, the reception that the Committee members received was not one that one would normally expect from the inhabitants of a paradise; I think it is fair to say that there was a feeling of suspicion, and maybe a degree of cynicism, towards the Committee, and more broadly towards the Australian Government. Norfolk Island is unique; there is no question about that. It is, I suppose, an accident history more than anything else that the island forms part of the Australian Territories. When the island was discovered by Cook in 1774 it was uninhabited. It was not until a prison colony was incorporated on the island in 1825 that there was permanent occupation of the island. That occupation continued for 30 years and then the first permanent-in the true sense-population arrived in 1856 with the relocation of the descendants of the Bounty who had found themselves on Pitcairn Island and who were offered, and accepted the offer, to move from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. From that point in 1856 until today, I think it is fair to say that there has remained a very strong feeling amongst those descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders that they really have no direct connection with Australia; it was only through the British Government at the time, the British Crown, placing the administration of Norfolk Island in, firstly, Van Diemen's Land, then the colony of New South Wales and finally, with Federation, Australia that they have a connection with Australia. I suppose I have some sympathy with that view; I can understand why people feel that way. But I do not know whether those feelings in the sense of independence are related purely to the historical significance and history of Norfolk Island. Slightly less than 50 per cent of the population are the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders; the other 50 per cent are made up roughly in proportion of half from the Australian mainland and half from places abroad, significantly New Zealand but a whole range of countries, as I understand it. Norfolk Island is quite an affluent place; it rates quite high in a table of millionaires per head of population. There are a number of very affluent people on the island. One of the major concerns with what the Committee was doing was the sort of converse of the great catch cry of the American Revolution, which was no taxation without representation. The Norfolk Islanders tended to fear that if they got representation taxation would follow. At the time, we tried to stress to the Islanders that that was not at any stage the intention of of the Committee or of any individual Committee members; we were quite satisfied, bro-dly speaking at least, with the level of sflfgovernment that had been attained on the island. The whole thrust of the Committee's inquiries, not only in Norfolk Island but in the other Territories, was to support the concept of self-government, to allow self-determination. Norfolk Island, unlike the other island Territories, does have a relatively strong economic base; it can survive, to a certain extent if not a large extent, on its own two feet. It receives well in excess of 25,000 tourists per year; tourism would be the core of its economy. It is a relatively buoyant economy and it has a great deal of self-determination and a high degree of self government. It has its own tax systems and does not rely on the Australian social security system. There is a range of basic pieces of legislation that are run purely from the island's own government and from its own resources. However, there is still a bit of a misconcepbackdoor tion on the island as to the amount of assistance that it receives from the Australian Government. There is a somewhat jaundiced view amongst at least some islanders, and to an extent the Norfolk Island Government, that it is really completely freestanding from Australia and does not need Australia. I do not think that is an entirely valid view; certainly a whole range of services is still provided from Australia. One of the Committee's recommendations encouraged the process of cost recovery to continue. That is in both our interests and the interests of the Norfolk Island Government, which I think would support this. There are three basic things for which the island is reliant on Australia. The first is defence, and it is obviously also in Australia's interests to continue our relationship with Norfolk Island. The economy of Norfolk Island is quite strong, but to an extent that is also very much bolstered by Australia. For instance, if someone in one of the tourist facilities on the island were to lose a job, I am sure that person would end up here looking for work. The employment opportunities on the island are not as great as we would like or as those on the island would like. If a person were to be made unemployed, I am not saying that the person would be encouraged to leave or anything like that, but there is a social security system in place here and I think there would be a tendency to move away from the island back to Australia or perhaps to New Zealand. That is a factor that is often not given due recognition by the island Government in its claims that it is able to stand on its own two feet. Largely speaking, I think it can do so. I think it should be encouraged to do so and Australia should be pulling back in tenns of its administration on the island. We should be safeguarding our own interests but at the same time encouraging the process of self-government. While this Parliament is empowered to make laws which affect Norfolk Island, Islanders have the fundamental right, I believe, to vote to detennine the representatives in this chamber; that is what motivated the Committee. It was not some sort of attempt to get taxation or to change the island way of life. We are not interested in doing that. We are interested in enhancing the island way of life. We think basic rights should be common to all Australians, whether those Australians live on Norfolk Island or not. That then brings me to the second matter. Having agreed upon the basic premise that the right to vote should be extended, the debate then turned to how that should be put into place. The Committee did not take a great deal of advice on this point, but the advice that it had at that stage was that it would be necessary for the island to be incorporated into one of the Territory electorates on the Australian mainland. We have, for instance, territorians on Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island voting in the Federal electorate of the Northern Territory. At that stage, on the basis of the advice the Committee had as to the constitutional choices available to it, it seemed to it logical that the island would have to be attached to one of the two ACT electorates and, at least in the early stages, it was detennined that Canberra would be the electorate. This caused great consternation amongst the Islanders. They believed they had no community of interest with Canberra, and I would not pretend they had. Obviously they would have no particular community of interest with any particular one Australian Federal electorate, and I accept that. They devised this scheme where, if an individual elector could establish a· connection with a particular Australian Federal electorate, then that e1ec.tor should be entitled to seek enrolment in that particular electorate. The initial advice from the Attorney General's Department was that that scheme was not going to be constitutional. At that stage the Islanders sought opinions. The first advice was obtained from Mr Bob Ellicott, who would be well· known to honourable members in this House. He advised that the advice of the Attorney-General's Department was not correct, that the same sorts of provisions which allowed itinerant voting under the Commonwealth Electoral Act could allow a similar sort of scheme to apply for Norfolk Island. A second advice was then obtained from Professor Leslie Zines, who would be well known to students of constitutional law in Australia. He is, I think, well known and is well regarded in terms of his expertise in the area of the Australian Constitution. He gave an opinion also that the scheme finally incorporated in this legislation was constitutional. Certainly there was some'dispute about that to some degree amongst· officers within the Attorney-General's Department and I have seen opinions written by the Chief General Counsel from the Attorney-General's Department, Dennis Rose, QC, who was doubtful whether the scheme first proposed by the Island Government would have allowed all island residents who may have wished to seek enrolment the opportunity to do· so. But in the end it has been resolved. If one looks at the Bill, one sees that if a voter cannot establish a connection with any particular mainland electorate through having previously lived there, been enrolled there or having next of kin there, then he can enrol in the division of Canberra. That covers the entire field. Under the existing provisions applying to itinerant electors, some people can attach themselves to a particular electorate. A Pitcairn Islander who was born on the island and who had never had any particular link with mainland Australia would be unable to do that, but if he wished to exercise a right to vote in an Australian Federal electorate I think he would probably end up having. to enrol in the division of Canberra under the scheme. The end result is that any person on the island who wants to vote will be given now the right to do so in a particular electorate or within the electorate of Canberra. I take particular note of the advice of Professor Zines who, I thought, prepared a very thoughtful opinion on it. I certainly am not going to hold myself up as a person to argue the toss with such an eminent Australian academic lawyer. But, given that I doubt it will come before the High Court anyway, and everyone involyed in the scheme is happy with it, so be it: I think it is a good outcome. Finally, I hope that the whole process has been a fruitful one. I think it has shown a reasonable level of maturity both on behalf of the Norfolk Island Government and also the Minister and the Australian Government to be able to negotiate these things through and come to a suitable solution to a difficult question. In the end I think it is a good result for the Islanders in that it recognises their particular circumstances. It also is a good result for the Australian Parliament in that we have maintained our legitimate interest in making sure that the right to vote is extended but in a way which the Norfolk Island Government can live with. It is a very worthwhile Bill and I commend it to the House.",54

276,Mr CARLTON,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,"Mackellar) (5.28 p.m.)We are discussing this afternoon the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1992 which was introduced by the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) before the winter recess. Before I mention the Bill itself, I would like to say how delighted I am to be making my first speech as the shadow Minister for sustainable development and the environment. I regard this as a very exciting appointment. me to carry out professionally a whole lot of the things I would ordinarily do as a private citizen. When I was camping in the Bungle Bungles about three or four weeks ago, little did I think that within a very short time. I would actually have Opposition responsibility for such things as the preservation of the Bungle Bungles and other national treasures of that kind. Mr Hilney-May you be long in the job.",58
277,Mr CARLTON,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,"Thank you very much. Up to the next election, I am sure I will remain in it.",58
278,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,Mr Nehl)With no 'bungle bungles'.,58
279,Mr CARLTON,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,"There will not be any 'bungle bungles'. After that, with all due respect to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) and his good wishes, I would rather be on the other side of the House. May I also, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, pay tribute to my predecessor in this job, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who has indicated that he does not wish to serve in the Parliament after the next election. It was interesting: I got the news at 3 o'clock in the morning in Johannesburg during a one-week visit to look at South African matters. The three colleagues who were with me in South Africa wondered why it was that somebody would want to give up a job like that and leave the Parliament. I said that I had been around in politics for almost as long as the former Senator Chaney, now the honourable member for Pearce, and I could fully understand how somebody would like to have a successful and fulfilling private life. I would like to pay tribute to Fred Chaney'S contribution to the Senate, to the House and to Australian life generally. He is one of the most civilised people to have entered this Parliament. He made a major contribution as a Minister in the Fraser Government and he has been a wonderful colleague in Opposition. I certainly understand and respect his wish at the young age of 50 to begin afresh a fulfilIt enables ling private life. Mr Johns-How old are you, Jim?",58
280,Mr CARLTON,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,"I am 57. There is no age discrimination in the Opposition and I am full of beans and ready to get stuck into this wonderful portfolio. You will be pleased to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I now intend to turn to the Bill. I will stay within the Standing Orders so that you do not have to exercise some kind of discipline over me before the major event that is supposed to occur tonight. This Bill transfers the management of marine reptiles and mammals from fisheries to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. I say at the beginning that the Opposition is pleased to support this proposal. Sea snakes, seals and birds of the sea are already· protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations. Turtles, crocodiles and dugong will soon be added to that list a,ld whales and dolphins are already protected under the Whale Protection Act 1980 by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Thus under these measures all marine reptiles, birds and mammals will receive protection in Commonwealth waters under legislation administered by one body, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Much of the enforcement of these regulations is delegated to State fisheries or conservation agencies. We note that the powers of enforcement are consistent with those applying under the Whale Protection Act and there is the same level of stringency in this protection as under the old Fisheries Act which was used to protect these species. Reference to the Whale Protection Act leads me to remind the House that this was one of the many significant environmental advances made by the Fraser coalition Government, of which I was a member. I say to those who might have noted that I have taken a very strong interest in economic affairs over the last few years, because of the circumstances that have faced Australia, that I would like all those interested in this portfolio to know that I was a very strong supporter of the environmental measures taken by the Fraser Government. I think all those who were connected with them can be proud of their achievements. I have had a very long standing interest in environmental issues concerning not only the natural environment but also the man-made environment. Those bodies and groups that wish to put forward proposals within this area will certainly find an open door with me. Like my predecessor, the honourable member for Pearce, I will be absolutely straight with all parties-that is, whether they be developers, miners, conservation foundations or any of the various groups with a legitimate interest in development and environment, they will all get the same message from me. They will not get selective messages at different times. On the question of the Whale Protection Act, from which the actual policing arrangements are drawn for this measure, I remind honourable members of the introduction on 23 April 1980 by my then colleague the Hon. David Thomson, Minister for Science and the Environment, of the Whale Protection Bill 1980. I quote from his second reading speech: ... the Governmentthat is, the Fraser Governmentcommissioned an independent inquiry into whales and whaling headed by Sir Sydney Frost. The report of the inquiry was tabled in Parliament 20 February 1979. On 4 April 1979, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that the Government had accepted all recommendations made in that report. The central conclusion accepted by the Government was that the Whaling Act 1960 be repealed and that we pursue a vigorous and active policy for the protection of whales. This Bill introduces such a policy for all cetaceans, that is, whales, porpoises and dolphins. It was a matter of some amusement in the party room at that time, as I recall, because there were some members who did not know what a cetacean was. They thought it was something pinned on a jacket, but there were some of us who had been to school and knew about those things from way back. I quote again from Me Thomson's speech: . The Bill prohibits the killing,capturing, injuring or interference with cetaceans in the 200-mile Australian fishing zone and by Australians domiciled in Australia and Australian vessels and aircraft and their crews beyond the 200-mile Australian fishIng zone, with penalties up to $100,000. Support for a total worldwide ban on whaling will be sought through international forums, such as the International Whaling Commission. It has been quite interesting in recent weeks to see a resurgence in some quarters of attempts to begin whaling again. It is interesting to remember the struggles that went on at that time, which were successful, and the very strong actions taken by the Fraser Government for the protection of whales. The protection of these other species of the sea fits into that category. The enforcement mechanisms that were put in place by Me Thomson at that time, using the National Parks and Wildlife Service as the protective instrument, have been adopted for this measure. So it is with particular pleasure that . on behalf of the Opposition I give my full support to this Bill.",58
281,Mr JOHNS,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (5.37 p.m.)-I welcome the shadow Minister for sustainable development and the environment, the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Carlton), to the portfolio area. It is one in which I have had an interest for a while, on although my interest has now been taken elsewhere-to health, housing and community services. I too would like to thank the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) for his contribution because I always thought that he added considerably to debate in the place, although I am sure that the new shadow Minister will also add considerably to a most important area of debate. I would like to thank the Opposition for supporting the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1992. It is a simple amendment mainly to ensure that marine reptiles, birds and mammals will now be protected under a new Act. The Government found, after the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) had discussed the matter, that it was not sensible for the management of mammals and marine reptiles to be controlled under commercial fisheries legislation and that responsibility for those animals should be transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Of course, the range of offences and penalties and so on are set out in that Act. One of the main purposes of the amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act is to extend the application of the existing powers to the waters of the continental shelf and the Australian fishing zone. I thought I might spend a little bit of time on a matter. that really arises from this because we can have specific legislation which seeks to protect valuable and perhaps endangered species but we are finding that one of the greatest threats to these sorts of species is, in fact, introduced species such as feral animals. There has been a great deal of concentration on the eradication of feral animals. The Brisbane Courier-Mail featured an action in which the Army partook recently in the Diamantina River in far western Queensland where the State Minister for conservation, Pat Comben, had arranged with his officers and the Army to undertake the eradication of some feral cats. It might be worth showing some of the illustrations of how we need to tackle the problem of the eradication of introduced species. They have become a direct threat to native species of animals because they may be predators of those animals, or they may ruin the habitation of the local environment and indirectly threaten the native species, not to mention their threat to native plant species when they dig them up or root them out. There are some quite extraordinary numbers. I will run through some of the species of animals that are of concern to us and are being destroyed under Commonwealth programs and in conjunction with State programs. In the Courier-Mail of 13 August this year, Brian Williams, a journalist who travelled to the Diamantina River, said: Anny sharpshooters have killed 420 feral cats in just three days in Queensland's far west. He reported that they are undertaking this activity on the open Mitchell grass plains along the Diamantina River. He said that this was done in conjunction with Queensland National Parks and Wildlife researchers who themselves were out shooting cats. I would not have thought that what we think of as the domestic cat could possibly survive in that sort of environment, but some of the cats have been weighed by National Parks officers at over eight kilograms. They are certainly doing very nicely out of either attacking and devouring native species or at least denying those native species other sources of food. As I said, that Army exercise was done in conjunction with the departmental staff of the State environment Minister, Pat Comben. At the same time, there was this coincidence of a rat plague. The cats had built up their numbers on the backs, almost literally, of the rat plague. The concern now is that, as the rat numbers are weakened and they are destroyed through drought in the western districts, the cats will turn their attention more directly to the native species. This article lists some of the species that will be further threatened by feral cats: the bilby; the kowari, which is a marsupial mouse; the plains wanderer, which is a grasslands bird; and possibly the yellow chat, which is a small ground-feeding bird. These feral cats are known to hunt each of those animals. That is of great concern. A further interesting statistic quoted here is that people from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service have indicated in their research that one domestic cat left uncontrolled might kill an average of 25 animals each year. Let loose, the humble cat gone feral can have a very widespread and devastating impact on any number of endangered species. It is important that the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States, improve, as it has in the last few years and will continue to do, its intervention in this area such that we can kill off some of these animals. Recently I looked at a report by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on the culling of large feral animals in the Northern Territory, where different species of introduced animals are having a very large and devastating impact. This report of June 1991 referred to a number. of Commonwealth programs which were aimed at eradicating some of the larger feral animals in this area, mainly water buffalo and pigs. I will refer to some advances in this area as well. The report includes an example of control taking place in Kakadu National Park through the Commonwealth brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. Through that campaign, the Commonwealth has funded the removal of approximately 100,000 buffalo and cattle from Kakadu National Park since 1979 and about four and a half thousand in the last year. We have now reached a point at which the density of these beasts is about one beast per 100 square kilometres. We are approaching a point at which it is not so much hard to find them; rather, we are receiving diminished returns to scale for our effort. We have got through these animals in very large numbers. The report says: We are suggesting that there are now very low buffalo numbers in Kakadu National Park-around about SOO to 1,000. There has been a considerable reduction of those introduced species. The report also mentions feral pigs, to which I have a couple of references. There have also been some great gains. The major infestations of feral pigs have been greatly reduced. I understand there is no separate strategy for the control of pigs unless there have been infestations detected in areas of high public use or where there is good access. We have to be very careful about the methods we use to cull these animals. Recently I read a report which said that we might set traps for, or poison, feral pigs just out of Canberra, where there is quite a large pig population. That works well there, but in the Northern Territory-certainly in the Kakadu region-we have to be extremely careful because the Aboriginal population hunts feral pigs as a source of protein. We simply cannot be using poisons as a means of eradicating those animals. We have to be selective about the means of destroying them. The buffalo and the feral pig are probably the major destroyers of land, certainly in the northern areas. The Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, which reported in June last year, gives us an indication of this destruction. The report contains a quote by an officer of the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries who evaluated the environmental threat in the following terms: Buffalo and pigs are the most environmentally dangerous. Pigs probably will have to rate above buffaloes now and this is likely to be the case for the next 10 to IS years. In central Australia, rabbits are the most dangerous, followed by horses. It would be fair to say that rabbits would be far and away the biggest problem... Foxes are also signi Ikant. There has been considerable debate over Fraser Island, which is in my neck of the woods, up from Brisbane, where a very small number of brumbies have been running wild for some years. Inevitably debate pops onto the TV screens from time to time whereby animal welfare rightists want to save those brumbies. But those brumbies can be very destructive to growth around fairly unstable sand-dunes. If they are not. destroyed, there will be some destruction on the sand-dunes. We have to make choices. I would find the choice fairly easy. We would have to destroy the brumbies in this instance. I would not like to be the one to have to do it. I am a bit squeamish when it comes to the destruction of any life. The way in which animals can destroy habitat is also worth looking at. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service gave evidence to the Senate Committee that the water buffalo, in particular, presented an unacceptable environmental threat in Kakadu National Park. It described the potential of the impact as devastating. The Service then listed the environmental impacts of the buffalo. It is worthwhile using this illustration. They included: vegetation damage through grazing and trampling; soil compaction; saltwater intrusion into low-lying freshwater swamps through breaching of natural levee banks by swim channels; wa\1owing and erosion; siltation and po\1ution of water bodies; noxious weed dispersal; and impact on other animals through modification habitat. Those are the ways in which these animals are destroying habitat. The number of threatened native species in this area is very significant and this presents us with manpower and funding problems. We have to have sufficient programs, sufficient people and the right means of destroying these animals before they have such an impact on this area that we may in fact lose for all time certain species of animals that are reliant on the same environment. An article from the Northern Territory Conservation Commission which appeared in the Northern Territory News of 20 June this year indicated that 'Wild pigs first came to notice in the Territory in 1827'. So these animals have been with us for a considerable time and, as far as we can tell, their numbers have not been threatened until the last few years when officers have informed governments of their enormous impact. Many animals of the Australian arid and semi-arid zone in the north are threatened by these larger animals. These include: the inland western quoll, the long tailed dunnart, the numbat, the western barred bandicoot, the banded hare-wallaby, the pebble-mound mouse, the sandhill dunnart and so on. As far as I am aware, each of those animals is a very small and fragile animal which can be destroyed very easily by larger animals. They will certainly be affected in as great a number as there is by any destruction of their habitats, and these native animals are subject to destruction. We then tum to the debate that we often have across the chamber-perhaps more with National Party members-as to whether a government ought to declare wilderness areas where, if unchecked, feral animals can run amuck. The farmers - ay say, 'Look, isn't it better that farmers might be able to assist in the destruction of feral animals by running cattle or whatever into an area?'. There is also a debate about competition for food between cattle and sheep and feral and native animals. We have had that debate in this chamber from time to time. But the officers of the Northern Territory Government made an interesting of point about the question of how many animals were being stocked in an area. Mr Davis of the Northern Territory Government-I do not know which department - explained the point and said: At the moment, there are properties that are running large numbers of ferals and trying to ignore the fact that there are those numbers of ferals. They are saying, 'This property can run 40,000 head of cattle', and they are running 40,000 head of cattle when in fact the total stocking [with feral cattle or cattle equivalents] is probably 120,000. We need to look at the impact of all the animals grazing and living in a particular area. We might be looking at the true impact of the domestically husbanded animals which are being carried on an area-in this case, 40,000 head of cattle-but they are in addition to other animals which are being carried there, both native and feral. I can understand the sensitivities about who is best placed to keep feral numbers low. By and large, we have worked very closely with the National Farmers Federation, as have the conservation groups. This will not come as a surprise to the honourable member for Mackellar because he will know of the considerable liaison and discussion that have gone on between the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation on all of these sorts of issues. A lot of joint work is going on which will satisfy the aims of both groups. They seem to me to be some of the critical issues when it comes to making sure that we save native species. Although this debate started out on the question of reptiles, birds and mammals, I have chosen to concentrate on the question of land animals: feral pigs, cats and so on. I will now introduce one or two other elements from the same debate. At least one other animal is of major concern to us. (TIme expired) .",59

283,Mr WEBSTER,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,"Macquarie) (5.57 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, you took the words right out of my mouth. I was going to say that I am participating in what appears to me to be one of the widest ranging debates on a very specific topic that I have encountered in many years in this House. I reiterate the comments made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) with regard to the retiring shadow Minister responsible for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), whom I had the privilege of having in my electorate on Tuesday of last week. As is always the case with him, it was a very entertaining and interesting day which was very profitable not only to myself, but also the many community groups throughout Macquarie and the Hawkesbury. For example, we visited a wonderful orthose ganisation which is one of the environmental protection techniques in Australia today and, indeed, in the world-the Memtec company. It is developing some wonderful ways whereby we can keep our marine waters pure. It is using twenty-first century technology to purify the water which goes into the areas which we about today in terms of protecting the wildlife there. I appreciated the words of the honourable member for Mackellar as to what has been done over the years and is well and truly recorded in the history books.

First Reading Bill presented by Mr Dawkins, and read a first time. Second Reading",63
285,Mr DAWKINS,CONSERVATION AMENDMENT HILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Budget has three fundamental objectives. The first two are about jobs: jobs now, and more jobs in the years ahead. When, as is the situation now, there are not enough jobs, it is up to the Government to take action; to do everything in its power to provide jobs for those Australians without work. We have already taken initiatives to boost the economy and rebuild and modernise the nation's transport system. to We have vastly expanded opportunities for young Australians. And tonight, as our first priority, I announce further measures to boost employment in communities and regions hardest hit in bright stars or"" recent years. Many of our fellow Australians have, for the first time, found themselves out of work. For them we cannot simply wait and hope, or engage in some economic experiment. We must act now, and act in ways which we are so concerned know will work. These employment measures will include projects conceived at the local level, providing real work and, at the same time, enhancing facilities for many deprived comThe total cost will be $1.2 billion over two years. This attack on unemployment is part of our second objective-the implementation of a comprehensive and continuing strategy which is designed to achieve around 800,000 new jobs over the next four years. Crucial to this strategy is the maintenance a resolve to create a dynamic and successful trading nation: a nation based on and innovation, with its industry employing skilled workers producing goods and services to sell here and abroad. This resolve will be fortified by measures announced tonight to entrench an already impressive growth in research ment and in exports. There are new initiatives in vocational training, and there is increased effort to cut the costs of Government services and to improve competition. Our objective is to have new industries alongside the old, striving to secure a larger slice of the world market. But this Budget-as its third confirms this Government as a caring Government, intent on pursuing its program of social refonn. Tonight I announce a major enhancement of Medicare, increased support for the aged for those who care for them, and increased support for the unemployed. There are new measures to improve access to more secure housing, and there is more assistance for families. NA NA Mr Speaker, as a small nation our future community. depends on taking advantage of developments abroad. And in our case we straddle two very different parts of the world. First there is the industrialised world Europe and North America. These countries have also been struggling with unemployment. But they have higher inflation than we have. And many have lower growth prospects. Australia's inflation rate is around 2 per cent, about half that of Europe. This year the Government expects the Australian economy to grow by around a third faster than Europe. Australia is also part of Asia. Growth rates and productivity in many Asian countries are short tenn. of impressive. But some have inflation close to 10 per cent. Most have inflation more than talent, ideas double that of Australia. With a foot in each hemisphere we can benefit from opportunities in both. We can enjoy higher growth than is forecast for Europe and the USA, with inflation and developcertainly no higher. Our growth rate will be closer to Asia's, but it will come without Asia's higher inflation. And as we commit ourselves to best practice at home, and embrace competition abroad, neither hemisphere will constrain our growth. But these opportunities will not be handed to us on a plate. objective-also We must seize them. NA NA Last year was difficult for many countries. It and was particularly difficult for Australia. Recovery started during the year, but failed to gather strength in the way expected. We all deeply regret that the growth achieved was not sufficient to prevent rising unemployment. We all deeply regret the cost of unemployment to individuals, to families and to the But regret, without action, has a very hollow ring to it. Nearly 50 years ago, the Labor Government of of John Curtin, in its famous White Paper, committed the Commonwealth to a policy of high levels of full employment. This Government affinns that full employment must and will be our continuing goal. Tonight I present a statement entitled Working for the Future which sets out this Government's plans for the years ahead. 3 per cent, or Budgetary Stimulus The Budget has a finn and unequivocal role to play in boosting economic activity in the It does so by providing a strong but temporary stimulus, and by ensuring that Australia emerges into sustained growth, with an enhanced economic infrastructure, better able to underpin the opportunities of the 1990s. Overall, the outlays cost of new and previousIy announced measures to boost the economy will be around $4 112 billion in the next two years. In addition, we will allow the impact of the recession on the Budget to run its course. As a result, the Budget deficit in 1992-93 is estimated to be $13.4 billion. 'Nearly 10 years ago this Government acted in the 1983 Budget to boost the economy and to reduce unemployment. One and a half million new jobs were created and within four years the Budget recorded a surplus-the first in nearly four decades. The present recovery will deliver jobs. But the Government is acting now to reduce unemployment more quickly, to ease the pain and burden on Australians and their families. Employment Package Tonight I announce the expenditure of a further $742m this year, and another $467m next year, to attack unemployment at its roots-in the communities where the despair is deepest and where the pain hurts most. . The package builds on the offer from local government-the sphere of government closest to the community-to move rapidly to expand local employment opportunities. This package for local government involves job placement, road building and repair, and a new local capital works program, together with the Landcare projects recently announced. Its centrepiece will be the local capital program which will inject $345m into 411 local government councils, where about 70 per cent of all unemployed people live. The program will involve grants of between $4m and $20m for each of 23 regions hardest hit by unemployment. There will be $60m for roads, and $154m to be spent on government and non-government schools and universities. $188m planned for expenditure on urban development and public housing will be brought forward and spent this year and next. Expenditures on Defence purchases and on Defence housing of $87m will similarly be advanced to this year. These measures will also be focused in regions with high unemployment. Labour market and training programs will be expanded, particularly to assist long-term unemployed adults and to improve workforc;e skills and labour market flexibility. Places under the JOBSTART program this year will almost double, to 104,000. Work experience and training under the JOBSKILLS program will be available for an additional 12,000 people over the next two years. An extra $92m will be provided over three years for adult training places to help people back into jobs. Over the next four years, we will provide English language training to 38,000 job seekers. In all, we will nearly double expenditure on these programs this year, to $1.1 billion, and we will assist over 420,000 people. The combined effects of these measures will see unemployment decline from 11 per cent last June to below 10 per cent 12 months from now, and keep on declining in the years ahead. NA NA Clearly, reducing unemployment is our most pressing objective. works But we must also continue our confident resolve to build a more export-oriented nation. The Australian economy is part way through a momentous period of transition. We have derived enormous benefits from our abundant natural resources and will continue to do so. But in a highly competitive world, we must increasingly turn to the even more potent talents of our people. We are creating new strengths and new skills as we respond to changes in the world around us. In five years, our manufactured exports have more than doubled, while exports of services have increased by 82 per cent. This has been an outstanding achievement. Our record on manufactured exports surpasses that of the major developed countries and even the Asian tigers. But we need to increase our total share of the world market, if our growth is not to be constrained by the subdued international outlook. This Budget adds to new measures announced in February, to enhance the capacity of our industries to export. $75m will be provided over three years from 1993-94 to those established and successful exporters. entering new markets. And a new working capital guarantee facility will support approximately $300m of new exports for firms short of working capital. The Government is also to assist further the rural sector which has been badly affected by reduced world prices and severe drought. We are reducing the costs facing all exporters-our farmers, our miners, our manufacturers. And we are working with the States to improve the interstate rail freight and electricity industries. With the States, we are reviewing their vital water supply industry and their shipping ports, and there is more to come. We have given the Industry Commission a new role to identify impediments restricting the growth of promising export industries. I am announcing the first group of 10 references tonight. Mr Speaker, the capacity of our industries to compete depends on our ability to develop innovative products and more efficient production methods. We have decided to extend indefinitely the 150 per cent research and development tax concession, so that Australia can continue to grow as one of the world's research and development centres. We have also decided to tighten up the scheme to ensure that research benefiting from tax concessions has an appropriate commercial focus. And our great scientific institutions, such as CSIRO, will receive $31m over two years to continue building the research capacity so necessary for the challenge ahead. Innovation springs from the arts as well as science. The Budget continues support of the film industry and increases support to the performing arts. Economic Growth and the Environment While the Government is actively encouraging the development of industry, this will be consistent with the preservation of the Australian and global environment. We are allocating $107m over the next four years to industry and environment programs to foster sustainable development and to help address climate change issues. The Government's initiatives will integrate economic and environmental decision-making. We will improve the taxation treatment of investment for, and spending on, pollution control. Training and Workforce Skills Our capacity to compete in the world, and to enjoy challenging jobs, depends greatly on the skills of our workforce. The creation of a new Australian National Training Authority and the injection of $72Om by the Commonwealth will see, in three years, over 100,000 more young Australians involved in vocational training. And by the year 2000, we will have another 200,000 young Australians aged between 15 and 19 years at school, in college and at university. To meet these increasing demands, the employment package I am announcing includes $60m to help the States refurbish up to 600 of their older high schools. Access to Education In higher education, the Government will establish the Open Learning Program at a cost of $53m over the next three years. For Australians in remote communities, for those with family or work commitments, and indeed for any Australian who may not have enjoyed access to traditional higher education, this initiative will be a historic milestone removing barriers to participation. In short, every Australian with access to a television and a letter box can now have access to a university education. Existing AUSTUDY arrangements will be improved, and the system of grants will remain intact. Tertiary AUSTUDY students will have the option to supplement their benefits through a voluntary loans scheme Through all the improvements to AUSTUDY, about 43,000 additional students will be eligible for AUSTUDY assistance. Wages Policy Mr Speaker, the co-operative development of a flexible wages policy is a key element in this Government's economic strategy. Through its close relationship with the trade union movement, this Government has funprogram damentaIIy altered Australia's wage setting Medicare arrangements. Workplace bargaining, which links wage increases to skills formation and productivity improvement, will become the primary They mechanism for wage adjustments. Agreements between managers and workers on matters such as hours of work, penalty rates, work practices and wage rates have improved flexibility while maintaining basic conditions. Building on this approach, the Government has proposed an alternative to a National Wage Case. Our proposal is that minimum award rates be adjusted through supplementary payments, by an amount of $10 a week, and that workplace bargaining be the principal vehicle for wage increases in the future. This will protect low paid workers while encouraging employers and employees to accelerate productivity gains. This will occur in a framework of maintaining Australia's inflation rate at or below that of our major trading partners and matching international best practice. In the 1990s, as in the 1980s, the Accord in between the Government and the trade union movement will ensure that we achieve significant improvements in this economy. NA This Budget is a budget of action on jobs. It is a budget of confident resolve to continue the transition to a modem, vibrant economy. But it remains a budget of care; care for the aged, care for the frail, and care for the disadvantaged. In this Budget the Government is building on its proud record of social reform. Mr Costello interjecting",63
286,Mr SPEAKER,SOCIAL REFORM,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,67
287,Mr DAWKINS,SOCIAL REFORM,"The cost of the initiatives to which I now refer have been offset, over this and the forward estimates years, by savings and by revenue measures. Important among the changes are the Medicare reforms which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) will announce tonight. will guarantee that every Australian will have access to the full range of hospital and medical services on a fair basis. An additional $1.6 biIIion will be provided over six years for public hospitals, subject to the. States and Territories agreeing to the Government's proposals for the strengthening of Medicare. These proposals ensure that Australians will have hospital services provided on the basis of clinical need and not on the basis of private health cover. No longer will private patients be able to jump the queue ahead of public patients in equal need of treatment. A program, costing $71m over two years, will ensure that waiting times for elective surgery are brought down to acceptable levels. Strategies to achieve this will include, where necessary, buying in services from the private sector. The Government's reforms will ensure that Medicare can meet the 29 per cent increase in public hospital admissions expected over the next decade. To fund these substantial improvements in health services, the Medicare levy will increase by 0.15 per cent from 1 July 1993. Australians on average weekly earnings will pay about 80 cents extra a week in their Medicare levy. For this they will receive the benefits of-and improvements to-one of the best health care services in the world. This achievement is one of which this Government and indeed all Australians can be justly proud. Support for Pensioners and Allowees Last year the Government gave a commitment to provide a real increase in pensions during the life of this Parliament. I am now announcing an increase in the single rate of pension of $6 a fortnight, and $10 a fortnight for pensioner couples, from late January 1993. This increase incorporates the adjustment otherwise due in March 1993 and includes an additional amount. This additional amount will be provided to the older, long-term unemployed, and to most of the unemployed with dependants. From April next year, all full and part pensioners and older long-term beneficiaries will be eligible to receive the range of fringe benefits provided by the Commonwealth, including hearing aids and a telephone allowance. $44m will be provided for nursing homes over the next four years and a home equity loan scheme will be established for pensioners. Housing Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister will also be announcing tonight a new long-term housing strategy. One of the first steps in the strategy will be to provide an extra $24m in this year, rising to $40m in three years time, for rental housing managed by community organisations and local government. $48m will be provided over three years to help 20,000 lower income earners buy equity in the public housing in which they live. This will also release capital to fund new homes for those in need. . And a new structure of rent assistance, to cost $71m next year, will benefit 440,000 lowincome private renters, including about 300,000 pensioners. Children The Government will introduce a package to improve the affordability and efficiency of child care services. The package includes an increase in the existing fee relief ceiling of $4 a week for each child in care. And it will provide for continued operational subsidies to communitybased child care centres and family day care services. These measures will assist 135,000 families and will cost $68m over the next four years. In a new initiative, up to $136.50 in family allowance will be available on request as a lump-sum advance to help meet unforeseen expenses. Disabilities/Carers Two years ago, the Government initiated measures to assist people with disabilities to enter the workforce and to participate fully in the community. Tonight we are announcing further measures at a cost of $68m over four years which build on those reforms. Additional funding of $41m over four years will be provided for respite services to reduce the burden on carers of frail aged and disabled people. And the domiciliary nursing care benefit is to be increased to $26 a week from January next year and indexed thereafter. Aboriginal Australians The Budget provides for the policies and programs to assist Aboriginal people which the Prime Minister recently announced. It also provides a total of $19m over four years for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Remote Areas Australians living in remote areas are often disadvantaged. The Government has thus decided to increase the income tax remote area zone rebates by 25 per cent from January next year. For people in the remotest areas of Australia, the base component will be $235 higher in a full year. Remote Area Allowances will be increased accordingly. NA I now turn to revenue measures. The major revenue initiatives include the increase in the Medicare levy and an increase of $5 a kilogram in tobacco excise. This increase will raise the price of a packet of 30 cigarettes by up to 20 cents and reinforces our policies to reduce the health costs of smoking. It will raise $80m this year. As part of the continuing task of making the tax system fairer, from April next year, Fringe Benefits Tax will be applied to valuable car parking facilities-mainly in central business districts-that are provided by employers to their employees. Also, the tax benefits of limited partnerships will be restricted by taxing them on the same basis as companies. NA The Budget has been framed with a realistic appreciation of the difficulties before us. While net borrowing by the public sector is expected to be the same as last year, the Budget deficit will represent an estimated 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product. The Government will eliminate the deficit as soon as possible. We shall introduce our announced personal income tax cuts. And the Budget deficit will fall as economic recovery strengthens. Outlays will fall over the period to 1995-96. But in the absence of new measures, revenues are also likely to decline. If the fiscal position nearer to the time is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. These changes-referred to in the Budget Statements-would allow for .the 1995-96 deficit to be between 1/2 per cent and 1 per cent of gross domestic product. Australia will grow more quickly this year than last. Australia is once again on the move. Output is forecast to increase by $22 billion this year, creating around 160,000 jobs. Mr Costello interjecting",67
288,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMIC PROSPECTS,I warn the honourable member for Higgins.,69
289,Mr DAWKINS,ECONOMIC PROSPECTS,"Recovery this year will continue to be aided by growth in private consumption, in housing and in public sector investment. And business investment in plant and equipment, which is crucial to long-term job growth, is expected to turn around this year, making a modest contribution to the recovery. Low inflation will continue to be the top priority of monetary policy. Low inflation will take pressure off interest rates and keep low the cost of borrowing to firms and families. Low inflation will fortify our competitive position and so spur economic and employment growth. The current account deficit is forecast to widen to 33/4 per cent of groS$ domestic product, in part owing to investment growth. This is below the levels experienced in earlier years, due in no small part to our impressive export performance. NA Over the past decade, this Government has progressively· reformed the Australian economy. We are working to see our manufacturing and service sectors emulate the great reCord of our mining and rural industries by I becoming . dynamic and outward looking. This Government also saw that our education system had to be refonned: from high schools through to universities. With that refonn, young Australians can acquire the skills necessary for the challenging jobs of the future. The Government has refonned the capacity of the public sector to support the process of economic and social transition. Much has already been achieved. Australia, our companies and all working men and women are now better able to seize the opportunities offered by a changing world. We need only the resolve to seize those opportunities. This Budget shows that resolve. But that resolve must continue to be matched by our care for those in the community who cannot immediately benefit from those economic opportunities. This Budget demonstrates that care. And while Australia is better placed for future growth as the world economy recovers, we are detennined to take action to provide jobs, by using all the means at our disposal. This Budget takes that action. Mr Speaker and honourable members, I commend the Budget to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Hewson) adjourned. BUDGET PAPERS 1992-93",69

This Bill seeks interim appropriations for the were ongoing services of the Government up to the 30 November 1992, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills, which part of the Budget for 1992-93, will have been enacted. The interim appropriations sought in this Supply Bill, together with its Bill Supply Bill (No.4) 1992-93, are additional to the amounts already provided the Parliament as interim appropriations the Supply Act (No.1) 1992-93 and the Supply Act (No.2) 1992-93, and are in respect of items for which appropriation is being sought in the 1992-93 Budget Appropriation Bills. These Supply Bills are being introduced concurrently with the Budget Appropriation Bills, with the expectation that the Parliament will agree to earlier availability of these appropriations. Accordingly, I request that the House accord these Supply Bills speedy passage. Issues of substance concerning the purpose of the expenditures facilitated by these appropriations can be examined, in the normal way, by the Parliament's examination of the Budget Appropriation Bills. In Supply Bill (No.3) the Government is seeking funds to expand existing programs to further address the adverse effects arising from the current economic situation. The Government desires the measures to be implemented as quickly as possible, and believes that this is in the nation. Reliance on the Advance to the Minister for Finance for these purposes would run the very real risk that there would be insufficient funds available to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements. My Department has taken advice from the responsible departments on the level of funds that would be required in the period up to 30 November this year in order that the benefits of these programs can be made available in the speediest practicable way. These are the funds that are being sought in this Supply Bill. The measures concerned are an expansion of those contemplated when Supply Bill (No.1) 1992-93 was presented to the Parliament. Supply Bill (No.3) seeks: For the Employment, Education and Training portfolio $5Om for labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry to enable more people to be assisted than is possible with the funds provided under Supply Act (No. 1) 1992-93 for this purpose; and For the Department of Transport and Communications $15m for payment to the Australian Land Transport Development Trust Fund to facilitate further work to improve the safety of roads. These works are needed and will assist in maintaining employment. The Budget Appropriation Bills are seeking funding for 1992-93 to facilitate a 'black spots' road works program some $60m higher than was in contemplation when Supply Act (No.1) 1992-93 was passed. I commend the Bill, and its speedy passage, to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. SUPPLY BILL (No.4) 1992-93 Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. First Reading Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a best interests of this first time. Second Reading",71
300,Mr WILLIS,AUSTRALIANS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks interim appropriations, totalling some $105m, for expenditure on capital works .and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and certain other services up to 30 November 1992, by which date it is expected that the Budget Appropriation Bills will have been enacted. These interim appropriations are intended to be subsumed within appropriations for the same purposes that are being sought concurrently in the Appropriation Bills for 1992-93. In Supply Bill (No.4) the Government is seeking funds to implement new programs to further address the adverse effects arising from the current economic situation. The Government wishes to implement these initiatives as soon as possible and believes that this action is in Australia's best interests. My Department has sought advice from the departments responsible for these initiatives on the level of funds that would be requ:'ed for them in the period to 30 November this year in order that the benefits of them can be delivered in the most expeditious and practicable manner. These are the amounts that are being sought in Supply Bill (No.4). Reliance on the Advance to the Minister for Finance for these purposes would run the very real risk that there would be insufficient funds available to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements. In accordance with long standing convention, each of the new provisions has been separately itemised in the Bill. They are: For the Employment, Education and Training portfolio $IOm for expenditure under the Landcare and environment action program. $47.3m is being sought in the Budget Appropriation Bills for this program, which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the July 1992 package of measures to address youth unemployment. For the Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs portfolio $68m for grants to local councils for social and economic infrastructure; and $2m for grants to local government associations to assist the development of economic activity. At present, local communities have limited financial resources to undertake additional capital works. Yet in many regions such capital works are needed, would provide much needed job opportunities and be a boost to local economies. This is especially true of regions experiencing high and protracted levels of unemployment. In recognition of the scope that minor capital works can play in bolstering economic activity and providing economic and social benefit for local communities into the future, the Government has decided to seek funds for a $345m program of local capital works over the next two years of which $250m is being sought in the Budget Appropriation Bills. The funds sought in this Bill are mainly for the purpose of facilitating an advance of moneys to local cout:lcils on approval of specific projects. For the Treasury portfolio $25m as general purpose capital assistance to the States and Territories to facilitate works under the building better 'cities program. To assist employment the Government has decided to fund' the acceleration of work under this program. I commend the Bill and its speedy passage to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. LOAN BILL (No.2) 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",72
301,Mr WILLIS,AUSTRALIANS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys (available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Successive local governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective 1992-93 Budget deficit. The Budget deficit in prospect for 1992-93 gives rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund some $6 billion greater than the Budget deficit. This situation arises because appropriations from the Fund include various items that are classified as financing transactions rather than Budget outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. The Bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that otherwise would have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to' supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the Loan Fund. The Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated, or currently before the Parliament, apart from loan raising expenses, which will be small. I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge upon the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate public moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. I com-end the Bill to the House and I present th- explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Baldwin, and read a first time. Second Reading",73
302,Mr BALDWIN,SWIMMING POOLS TAX REFUND,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.18 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, this Bill deals with one of the measures relating to sales tax on swimming pools announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) this evening. It will ensure that refunds of amounts paid as sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ since 1986 are passed through to pool purchasers. In February of this year the High Court of Australia found amendments made by the Parliament in 1986 in relation to these pools to be of no effect. The Court ruled that the amendments do not conform with a requirement in section 55 of the Constitution that laws imposing duties of excise deal with duties of excise only. The purpose of the amendments was to overcome an anomaly in the sales tax law that some pools were subject to tax while others were exempt. An unfortunate effect of the decision, however, is that pool builders, who were able to pass on to purchasers any amounts payable to the Commissioner of Taxation as sales tax on in situ swimming pools, may have been able to get the benefit of refunds payable by the Commonwealth as windfall gains. This Bin will ensure, in line with the refund code in the sales tax law, that there are no windfall gains and any refunds paid by the Commonwealth as a result of the Court's decision go to the person who actually bore the 'tax'. The effect of this Bill is not to deny the Commonwealth's liability to refund amounts paid as sales tax on in situ swimming pools, but rather to place a condition on the eligibility of a pool builder to a refund by requiring that, if the amount paid as sales tax was passed on to the purchaser, the refund must also be passed on. Importantly, Mr Speaker, the Bill will also provide for the payment of interest to pool . builders as compensation for any period that they are out of pocket as a result of the decision and these amendments. The proposed changes are not expected to have any direct impaCt on revenue because an estimate of the refunds has already been included in the base line estimates. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA",74
303,Mr BEDDALL,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 7 and 8 (1992); and Excise Tariff Proposal No.2 (1992). The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 7 (1992) formally places before parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette during the recent recess of Parliament. This proposal, which is operative on and from 1 July 1992, puts in place initiatives to assist footwear manufacturers announced by my colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, on 16 July. This change abolishes quota restrictions on parts of footwear covered by item 23 of schedule 5 to the Customs Tariff Act and imposes a reduced general rate of duty of 10 per cent on these goods. It also accelerates the phasing out of the developing country concession accorded to Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan province in respect of these goods. In delivering his Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced that duty on tobacco products would be increased by $5 per kilogram of tobacco content. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 8 (1992) and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1992) formally introduce that increase on both imported and locally manufactured tobacco, cigars and cigarettes. The increase will take effect from midnight tonight. The Government has previously undertaken to phase out the component of aviation gasoline duty attributed to recovering the costs of aerodromes as progress is made in transferring Commonwealth aerodromes to local ownership and negotiating the withdrawal of these facilities from the aerodrome local ownership plan. In addition, reductions in Civil Aviation Authority costs of providing rescue and firefighting services have allowed a corresponding reduction in the duty rate on aviation gasoline. Accordingly, Customs Tariff Proposal No. 8 and Excise Tariff Proposal No.2, which will operate from 19 August 1992, reduce the customs and excise duties by a total of 1.1 c per litre. Summaries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. House adjourned at 8.23 p.m. NA NA Woollen Products Used in Parliament House Mr Cobb asked Mr Speaker upon notice, on 29 April 1992: (1) What woollen products are used in Parliament House. (2) What is the country where the raw woollen products used in Parliament House (a) originated and (b) were processed and manufactured. (3) What was the cost of woollen products used in Parliament House when they were paid for. (4) What is the total area of Parliament House which is carpeted. (5) Did the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House receive written advice which led to the Parliament House Construction Authority electing to use New Zealand woollen products in the new Parliament House; if so, (a) what was the advice and (b) will he make a copy of the advice available.",74
304,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,"The following answer is as comprehensive as the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House and Joint House Department records allow. The Department of Administrative Services now has residual responsibility for Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA) matters, including PHCA records and files. The answer to the honourable member's request is as follows: (1) Woollen products used include carpets, drapes, wall panels, furnishing materials. (2) The carpets in the Main Committee Room and .the Cabinet Suite are of 100% Australian origin. Other carpets in Parliament House were supplied by 3 different Australian carpet companies. The tenders for the 'carpet did not specify Australian carpet wools. With few exceptions the carpets supplied are 80% wool and 20% nylon blend. Under the conditions of tender, companies were required to indicate the source of the materials. As the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement with New Zealand treats New Zealand products as though they were Australian, no information on Australian wool content is available. The Joint House Department does not have adequate information available about drapes, wall panels and furnishing materials which contain wool. (3) The total cost to supply and lay carpets in Parliament House was approximately $4.2 million. The Joint House Department does not have adequate information available from which to determine the cost of other woollen products used in Parliament House. (4) The total area of Parliament }Jouse, which is presently carpeted, is approximately 71 000 square metres. (5) No. In July 1986 the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA) provided advice to the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House that tenders had been let for carpets in Parliament House. Following the tender assessment process it became apparent that no Australian carpet wool would be used in the building. PHCA advised the Joint Standing Committee of this situation and the decision was subsequently made by the Committee that two areas of the building should be fitted with pure wool carpets of 100% Australian origin. The areas fitted are, as stated in answer to part (2) of the request, the Main Committee Room and the Cabinet Suite. A copy of the PHC advice follows. BACKGROUND PAPER: NEW PARLIAMENT NA NA Contracts for the manufacture and installation of carpet in the new Parliament House were let by the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA) earlier this year. Three separate contracts were let for carpet requirements for the building. Details of each contract package are as follows: 1. United Carpet Mills of Preston Victoria won the contract to the value of approximately $1 million for the manufacture and installation of carpet in the House of Representatives office wings (18,657m2). The carpet is the be manufactured in Victoria using an international blend for the wool component (60% NZ, 20% British and 20% East Indian). 2. Corporate Carpet Installation Services (Joint Venture of Solomons Carpets of Adelaide and Feltex Carpets of NZ) won the contract of approximately $3 million for the manufacture and installation of carpet in the public and ceremonial areas of the building, the Ministerial wing and the Senate office wings (50,421m2). Manufacture of these carpets will be split between Australia and New Zealand. Approximately 40% of the total contract value will be Australian involvement. These carpets were tendered on the basis of 100% NZ wool, however, the contractor has undertaken to maximise the use of Australian wool within the contract price. 3. Sexton Low Trading Co Pty Ltd of Brisbane won the contract of approximately $0.2 million for the manufacture and installation of carpet for selected areas including the Senate and House of Representatives Chambers. These are hand tufted 100% wool carpets which will be manufactured overseas as there are no looms of sufficient size in Australia. NA The specifications for the carpets were developed in conjunction with the Australian Wool Corporation and drew heavily on the Parliament's own experience with carpets in the provisional building. With few exceptions the carpets are of an 80% wool and 20% nylon blend. The tender specifications dealt with fibre, blend and perfonnance and not the origin of the materials. Tenderers were required' to nominate the origin/source, of the materials in their tender bids. There was therefore no restriction on the tendering of Australian wool for the wool content of the carpets. The tender documents did not specify the origin of the wool component of the carpets. Tenders proposing Australian wool content were submitted. In general the prices submitted for such bids were 50% higher than the lowest tendered prices. CER-TRADE AGREEMENT PROVISIONS As with the other contracts for the project, the CER provisions relating to trade between Australia and New Zealand applied to the carpet tenders. This has the effect of treating NZ products' on an equal basis with Australian. DECISION TO USE 100% AUSTRALIAN CARNA It became apparent following the tender assessment process that no Australian carpet wool would be used in the building. The PHCA advised the Joint Standing Committee of this situation and the decision was subsequently made by the Committee that two areas of the building should be fitted with pure wool carpets of 100% Australian origin. The JSC directed that the Cabinet Suite (673m2) and the main Committee Room (298m2) should feature all woollen carpets of 100% Australian origin. These are both prestigious areas of the building, and in the case of the Main Committee Room will be accessible to the public. The Authority has finalised arrangements with Corporate Carpet Installation Services, the contractor for the area concerned, for the provision of 100% Australian woollen carpets in these spaces. Parliament House Construction Authority July 1986 NA The following notices were given: Mr Beddall to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of RAAF Base Scherger, Peppan, Cape York Peninsula, Qld.

(5) Will entry for permanent residency be (a) available under the streamlined procedures and (b) conditional; if such entry is to be conditional, will the AVCC ce able to ensure that anyone later deemed to be unsuitable returns to his or her country of origin in such a manner as to maintain the integrity of the migration process; if so, and (ii) will the necessary procedures be any.more successful than the Government's previous attempts to locate and remove illegal entrants to Australia. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Last year my department held discussions with the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) to explore ways of more readily facilitating the temporary and permanent entry and stay of people to take up academic appointments at Australian universities. The discussions clarified aspects of existing regulatory arrangements which are designed inter alia to meet the objectives of academic institutions as employers to have access to the overseas pool of specialist skills while protecting the rights of appropriately skilled Australian citizens and residents. Further consultations with the AVCC, individual employing institutions and other interested parties are yet to take place before implementation of any changes which NA facilitate the entry of people to Australia to take up academic appointments. (2) No. An announcement will be made about any new arrangements after agreement is reached between relevant parties. (3), (4) and (5) Criteria, and appropriate safeguards, governing streamlined procedures for the entry and stay of academics referred to in part (1) are yet to be determined. Child Support Agency (Question No. 1009) Mr Harry Woods asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 August 1991: (1) How many orders for the payment of child and/or spousal maintenance have been made against liable (a) fathers and (b) mothers by the Child Support Agency (CSA) since it began operating. (2) What total sum is levied for child and/or spousal maintenance each week by the CSA on liable (a) fathers and (b) mothers. (3) What steps are taken to determine (a) which parent has actual custody and (b) when changes in (i) how custody are made subsequent to the original arrangements. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Child Support Registrar advised that from 1 October 1989, the Child Support Agency issues assessments for child support under Stage 2 of the child support legislation. Assessments issue only in the absence of suitable private agreements reached by parties. Spousal maintenance orders remain the province of the courts. The Agency has issued stage 2 assessments in 65,807 cases to 30 June 1992. The Agency does not retain information as to the gender of the custodian and a dissection according to the gender of the liable parent cannot be provided. (2) The Agency generated liabilities for 79,742 cases for May 1992 for payment by 7 June 1992. Total liabilities (including spousal maintenance arising under court orders) generated for the month of June 1992 amounted to $23.5 million. This includes liabilities for both court orders and court registered agreements (Stage 1) and assessments (Stage 2) under the Child Support Scheme. As the collection system is monthly, the Registrar is unable to readily identify a meaningful weekly amount, as requested in the honourable member's question. (3) Custody arrangements are not determined by the Agency in either Stage 1 or Stage 2 cases. When contested, custody is determined by the Family Court of Australia under the Family Law Act 1975. For Stage 1 cases, generally a variation to the court order or ratification of any private agreement must be sought from the courts if custody changes. Under Stage 2, the Agency may terminate the liability upon notification that a person is no longer an eligible custodian of the child. ABC Program Packaging (Question No. 1190) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 7 November 1991: (1) Did the ABC make arrangements to package outside the Corporation with external funding several top-rating ABC feature programs including The Investigato-, Everybody, Holiday and Hypotheticals. (2) Did ABC management intend that the programs referred to in part (1) would be packaged by Loredart Pty Ltd. (3) Is Loredart a private company. (4) Are the Directors of. Loredart ABC staff members. (5) Were any financial arrangements made between Loredart and the ABC; if so, (a) what were they and (b) what benefit did (i) the ABC and (ii) Loredart expect from them. (6) Was the outside packaging of the programs put out to tender. (7) Was the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited (MBF) to provide financial support for the outside packaging of the Everybody program; if so, did MBF withdraw when it realised it would not be dealing with the ABC. (8) Are there any safeguards to protect the ABC's interest in its programs and creative and intellectual property; if so, what are they. (9) Did the Board of the ABC know about any proposal for outside packaging of top-rating ABC features. (10) Will he call for a full report from the Board of the ABC on any arrangements with Loredart and make the report available to the House.",81
306,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) The ABC buys 50% of the programs it puts to air and either co-produces or produces itself the other 50%. In determining its internal Budget priorities for 1991-92 the ABC did not have sufficient funds to make Everybody, Holiday or Hypotheticals. Funds however were set aside for the ABC to make The Investigators. The absence of Everybody and Holiday from the production plan was a disappointment to the ABC and it believed this would prove disappointing to the audience. The ABC therefore pursued methods whereby it could purchase Everybody and Holiday from the independent production industry in 199293. Hypotheticals is not on the production plan and no arrangements have been made for it to be produced outside the ABC. (2) Loredart Pty Ltd, was a company which entered into detailed discussions with the ABC concerning the production of Everybody and Holiday. (3) Yes, Loredart is a private company. (4) One of the Directors is employed by the ABC under a personal contract, the other Director is employed through his private company which has a contract with the ABC. (5) No financial arrangements have been entered into between Loredart and the ABC. (6) Outside packaging of the programs was not put out to tender. (7) As the Loredart proposal was not proceeded with, the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia did not make a final decision on investment in the Everybody program. (8) The laws of copyright and 'passing-off', as well as the ABC's contractual rights, fonn the safe guard to protect the ABC's interests in its own products and the co-productions in which it has broadcast rights and/or an interest in copyright. There are no legal rights in ideas, titles or fonnats. The only constraint is if the public is likely to perceive that a similar program is the ABC's program (ie passing-oft). (9) Arrangements with Loredart required ABC Board approval. The ABC Board was made aware of the discussions with Loredart and in the final event, the Board gave approval for the two programs concerned, namely Holiday and Everybody, to .be produced by another outside company with the ABC purchasing the program from it. (10) The Minister has advised that he will not calling for a report from the ABC Board in regard to Loredart and that he is satisfied that the Board was aware of discussion with Loredart and made decisions appropriate to its role within the Corporation. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (Question No. 1248) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 19 December 1991: (1) What was the annual capital support provided by the Commonwealth to the CSIRO, in 1990-91 dollars, in each year from 1983-84 to 1991-92.

(3) In 1990-91 dollars, how does the average capital support provided by the Commonwealth to the CSIRO in the period 1978-83 compare with that provided in the period 1984-89. (4) What was the annual direct appropriation for the CSIRO, in 1990-91 dollars, in each year from 1983-84 to 1991-92. (5) What percentage variation occurred in the sums referred to in part (4) between (a) each year and the next since 1983-84, (b) 1983-84 and 1986-87, (c) 1983-84 and 1987-88, (d) 1983-84 and 1988-89, (e) 1983-84 and 1989-90, (t) 1983-84 and 1990-91 and (g) 1983-84 and 1991-92. (6) What percentage variation would have been necessary in each of the periods referred to in part (5) for appropriations to have maintained their real value. (7) By what (a) percentage and (b) sum in 1990-91 dollars did each of the sums referred to in part (4) vary from the sum which would have maintained the appropriation's real value. (8) What sum in 1990-91 dollars has the CSIRO earned in each year and retained since the Government introduced the 30 percent external earnings requirement. (9) With respect to each sum referred to in part be (8), what sum was derived from (a) fonnal public sector grants and other public sector sources such as contracted work from Commonwealth departments, (b) public sector grants programs alone, (c) other public sector sources and (d) private sector sources. (10) With respect to each sum referred to in part (8), what percentage of total external earnings was derived from (a) public sector grants, (b) other public sector sources and (c) private sector sources. (11) What Government decisions have affected the terms of and other conditions relating to the requirements of the CSIRO to attract 30 percent of its expenditure from external sources. (12) Has the CSIRO ever not retained external earnings for its own expenditure; if so, on each occasion (a) during which period, (b) what was the sum in 1990-91 dollars and (c) where was the sum remitted. (13) What was the (a) total and (b) breakdown by source of all funds, including capital support and private donations, in 1990-91 dollars, obtained by the CSIRO in each year from 1983-84 to 1991-92. (14) What is the current level of external earnings of each CSIRO Division. (15) What are the projected external earnings of each Division for each year for which projections are available. (16) What are the CSIRO's capital requirements in 1990-91 dollars. . (17) Have CSIRO officials assessed the Organisation's capital requirements; if so, (a) have the requirements been quantified and if so what are the quantified assessments and (b) does he endorse the assessments. (18) What are the priority areas with respect to the CSIRO's capital requirements. (19) What are the projected total levels of capital support for the CSIRO in (a) 1992-93, (b) 1993-94 and (c) 1994-9S. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since 1983-84, capital funds have been regarded as part of CS.IRO's global budget. Some projects, including National Facilities, have been specifically provided for by Government. The table at Attachment A shows expenditure of appropriation funds on capital in 1990-91 dollars for each year from 1983-84 to 1991-92. (2) Meaningful calculation of variations between years is extremely difficult. This is due to such factors as the allocation of additional capital funds to CSIRO for specific projects and changes in the threshold which defines capital as opposed to annual expenditure. Nevertheless, the figUres at Attachment A enable percentage variations· between various years to be calculated. (3) The table at Attachment A enables any averages required to be calculated. (4) The table at Attachment B sets out CSIRO's appropriations for the periods 1983-84 to 1991-92. The figures for 1991-92 are estimates and do not include additional funds requested in the Additional Estimates process. (S) The table at Attachment B enables any percentage variations between various years to be calculated. (6) and (7) Total appropriations in any year include funding for specific projects, the construction of National Facilities, as well as new responsibilities. Meaningful comparisons are therefore difficult. Notable new responsibilities reflected in CSIRO's direct appropriation figures in recent years include the Ultrasonics Institute, the Austmlian Fish Health Reference Laboratory and the National Building Technology Centre. It would be extremely difficult to take account of all such instances in the data sought, and the issue of real value maintenance is therefore complex. The table at Attachment B enables any percentage variations to be calculated. (8) CSIRO's expenditure of external earnings, including earned revenue (e.g. royalties, sale of assets), for the financial years 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91 was $138.0M, $136.lM and $IS6.7M respectively. All external earnings are retained by CSIRO. (9) and (10) The table at Attachment C sets out the information required. However, the categories requested in this part vary slightly from the method of categorisation usually used within CSIRO. Included in (a) are Rural Industry Research Funds, NERDDC, other competitive funding schemes and other funding from Commonwealth and State Departments. Category (b) excludes other funding from Commonwealth and State Departments. Category (d) comprises funding from Australian Industry, Overseas Bodies and Donations. (11) A target for external funding as a percentage of total budget was introduced for CSIRO in 1988; the Government's expectation was that, by 1991, the Organisation would be meeting 30% of its total expenditure from non-appropriation sources. The policy was reconfirmed for the 1991-92 to 1993-94 triennium, acknowledging that there should be flexibility to allow the quality and relevance of the research output and general community benefit to be recognised. (12) No. (13) The table at Attachment D sets out CSIRO's expenditure by source of funds (in 1990-91 dollars) for the period from 1983-84 to 1991-92. (14) and. (1S) The table at Attachment E sets out estimates of expenditure against sponsored research funds and earned revenue .for each division for 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94. (16) CSIRO estimates its ongoing requirements to be $21.S million per annum for replacement and refurbishment and $13.S million per annum for repairs and maintenance of existing building assets (in 1990-91 dollars). In addition, some $2 million per annum is being spent on major items of equipment which are categorised as capital. (17) CSIRO has assessed its capital requirements on an individual divisional basis and quantified them on a technical and financial project by projeCt basis. The quantified assessments are reflected in CSIRO's Capital Investment Plan which amounts to approximately $114 million over the triennium, including repairs and maintenance and major items of equipment. It is not necessary for me to endorse the assessments. I do approve CSIRO's annual budget which is designed by the Organisation to achieve a balance between its capital infrastructure and research priorities. (18) CSIRO has developed a Capital Investment Plan for the current triennium based on these quantified requirements which reflect the Organisation's priority areas. Attachment F lists fourteen major projects included in this plan. (19) As outlined in answers to parts (16), (17) and (18) above, CSIRO is planning to allocate $114 million during the current triennium ($45 million in 1991-92, $43 million in 1992-93 and $26 million in 1993-94) in support of its capital infrastructure. In addition, the Government has provided a $10 million loan to CSIRO to accelerate the self-funded redevelopment of its North Ryde site. Specific projects and funding arrangements beyond 1993-94 have not yet been decided.

Home Thtors: Tax Deductibility (Question No. 1261) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: In the interests of promoting equality of educational opportunity will the Government consider allowing the wages of a governess or home tutor employed by farming families in remote areas as a tax deductible expense. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the ltonourable member's question is as follows: In general, the fairest way of providing assistance is through the expenditure side of the budget rather than through the taxation .system. A tax deduction for the wages of a governess or home tutor would be of most benefit to those most able to afford private tutors and, therefore, may not be the best means of promoting equality of educational opportunity. The Commonwealth provides direct assistance at for remote area education in the form of the Country Areas Program and the Good Schools Strategy. In addition, the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) allowance is provided in recognition of the disadvantages confronted by families in remote areas. The Government has also broadened the eligibility requirements for various income support measures, including AIC, in response to the problems currently faced by rural communities. The minimum AIC payment per year has been increased substantially for 1991-92 from $1,500 to $2,500. Where rural families qualify for Social Security benefits due to hardship provisions, the assets test will no longer apply in assessing eligibility for maximum AIC allowance. (Question No. 1306) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: Is comfrey an approved medicinal product; if so, what are its uses; if not, why not. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Comfrey is currently scheduled as a poison and is not approved for any medicinal use. Comfrey contains significant concentrations of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are toxic to the liver. The medical literature contains' numerous accounts of liver disease and even deaths that are attributable to the consumption of comfrey and comfrey-containing products. The World Health Organization recently published a major public health review of pyrrolizidine alkaloids as contained in plants such as comfrey, including their use for medicinal purposes. It recommended that sale of such herbs, including comfrey, be restricted. Notwithstanding, the National Health and Medical Research Council is currently proposing relaxation of the current restrictions on sale of ointments a-d creams containing comfrey for dermal use because of its assessment that they present little hazard, unlike products for human ingestion. Meat Inspection Services (Question No. 1331) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 26 February 1992: Further to his answer to question No. 333 (Hansard, 5 March 1991, page 1342), what progress has been made in transferring Queensland's and Western Australia's meat inspection services to the Commonwealth in accordance with the policy of achieving a single inspection service for all meat, both export and domestic.",82
307,Mr GRIFFITHS,REPLACEMENT AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Whilst this issue has not advanced significantly during the past 12 months the Australian Quaranthe tine and Inspection Service' (AQIS) will continue to keep the matter under review in consultation with the Queensland and Western Australian Comfrey governments. Audit Requirements (Question No. 1468) Mr Scholes asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 31 March 1992: (l) Under existing audit standards is it possible that an audited balance sheet can legally show either a profit or a loss depending on the criteria determined by the directors for treating assets; if so, (a) has this allowed a number of companies to show profits whIm in fact they are not profitable and (b) are the public thereby denied information necessary to make a proper judgment on investments. . (2) Will he alter the existing audit requirements to ensure that an audited balance sheet reflects the financial situation of an organisation and not just the intentions of the directors. Mr DutTy-The answer to the honourable member's question is: (1) The methodology for determining the quantum of items that have to be disclosed in a company's financial statements and the recommended manner of disclosure are set out in accounting standards which are made by the Australian Accounting Standards Board rather than in auditing standards. Under the Corporations Law a company's directors are required to prepare financial statements that present a true and fair view of both the profit or loss of the company for the financial year to which the financial statements relate and the state of the company's affairs as at the end of that financial year. When preparing their company's financial statements, directors are required to comply with the requirements of Schedule 5 to the Corporations Regulations and the requirements of all applicable accounting standards. It is not possible for accounting standards to address every conceivable situation, and the application of an accounting standard in a particular case will often be a matter of judgement. What is important is that mechanisms are in place to ensure that directors are not able to use loose interpretations of standards to provide a misleading impression of the financial position of their company. It is in this area that the Government and its agencies have moved on a number of fronts since the national scheme for corporate regulation commenced operation on 1 January 1991. First, the Government has brought forward legislation to make the use of accounting standards mandatory. The effect of the amendment is that the financial statements of a company must be prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and, where the use of those accounting standards would result in the financial statements not presenting a true and fair view of the matters required to be dealt with in the financial statements, the additional information needed to present a true and fair view must also be disclosed. Prior to this amendment being made, the directors of a company did not have to comply with an applicable accounting standard if, in the directors' opinion, such compliance would result in the financial statements not giving a true and fair view -,a situation that, in effect, allowed selective application of accounting standards and thus facilitated the use of misleading ""creative accounting"". Secondly, the Australian Accounting Standards Board has set itself a heavy work program involving the revision of older accounting standards and the development and making of new standards in respect of matters that are not currently covered by standards (for example, disclosure of employee benefits and accounting for financial instruments). An example of a recently revised standard is the standard on valuations, which was strengthened for financial years ending on or after 31 December 1991. It is understood that the commencement of this revised standard, together with the new rules on compulsory application of standards (which also apply to financial years ending on or after 31 December 1991), caused the recent large write-downs by some companies, a development which can only be expected to provide those companies with sounder balance sheets for the future. Thirdly, there is a need to check that the new rules are being applied. The Australian Securities Commission's compliance program, upon which there is an increasing emphasis, should help ensure this. (2) As the Australian Accounting Standards Board is an independent body established under section 224 of the A ustraHan Securities Commission Act 1989, it would be improper for me to seek to direct the Board to take a particular course of action in respect of any matter coming within its statutory responsibilities. There is, however, an ongoing dialogue between the Board and the Attorney-General's Department on policy issues and, since 1 April 1992, a representative of the Department has attended Board meetings as an observer. The presence of the Departmental observer at Board meetings has already proved to be of considerable value to both the Board and the Government in coordinating action on accounting policy, so as to ensure that the accounts of Australian companies acquire an enhanced reputation for completeness and accuracy. Telecom: Roma Office (Question No. 1478) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 31 March 1992: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a petition signed by 1691 residents of the town and district of Roma, Qld, expressing concern at the withdrawal of Telecom staff and services from rural areas which was presented to the House on 26 March 1992. (2) Have over 100 jobs been lost from the Roma office of Telecom. (3) Has the Minster's attention been drawn to the impact on small rural communities of losses of jobs on the scale referred to in part (2). (4) How many jobs in Telecom or the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation in rural areas (a) have been lost since March 1991 and (b) are proposed to be eliminated between March 1992 and March 1993.",89
308,Mr BEAZLEY,REPLACEMENT AND,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from AOTC: (1) Yes. (2) AOTC has advised that the restructuring of the Telecom District Office at Roma in 1988 resulted in the progressive transfer of functions from this office to the Toowoomba office. The only function remaining at Roma is a phone in service for sales enquiries. The staff reductions in Roma since 1988 are as follows: , Office based staff - voluntary redundancies: 59 Office based staff - transfers: External Plant (Lines) and Internal Plant (Technicians) staff - voluntary redundancies33 External Plant (Lines) and Internal Plant (Technicians) staff - transfers: On the other hand, the number of Operator Assisted Services staff has increased from 35 in 1988 to 47 at present. (3) Yes. (4) (a) The number of staff employed in AOTC's Country Division was reduced by 927 in the period from March 1991 to February 1992. (b) The Telecom Country Division does not exist in its previous form. Under AOTC's Business Unit restructure, the former Telecom Country Division has been divided, with responsibility for residential customers in rural areas going to its Consumer Business Unit while business customers in rural areas become the responsibility of its Commercial Business Unit. On 4 June 1992, AOTC announced key elements of its national restructure of the Consumer Business Unit to be implemented over the ensuing twelve months which will involve a reduction of about 1,700 positions (including Operator Assisted Services positions) in rural areas by the end of the 1992/93 financial year. The restructure is designed to: remove the duplication of functions; create service units of efficient and sustainable size; improve and simplify processes for customers; and allow the benefits of modern communications technologies to be more fully realised. The structure requires the relocation or closure of some customer service functions in some areas. In a small number of areas staff will increase as some functions are consolidated. Treasury: Employment Goals (Question No. 1495) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Minister's 13 Department giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any 8 departmental activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Treasury's function is to advise and assist the Treasurer, and through him the Government, in the discharge of responsibilities for the broad range of economic responsibilities. The Department's program objectives directly address the overall goal of economic recovery. I do not believe there are any departmental activities which are inconsistent with the Government's policies to ensure a sustained economic recovery and the creation of more and better jobs over the years immediately ahead. Attorney-General's Department: Employment Goals (Question No. 1497) Mr Langmore asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Minister's Department giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any departmental activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth.",90
309,Mr DUFFY,REPLACEMENT AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b) and (c) Economic recovery and employment growth have been a high priority for the Government during the year. While the Attorney-General's Department has no policy responsibility in this area, it has provided legal advice to relevant departments and agencies to assist in their consideration of strategies to accelerate and sustain economic recovery and foster the creation of new jobs. Statutory Authorities: Employment Goals (Question No. 1517) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the National Population Council giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any organisation activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b) and (c) As an independent part-time advisory body to me, the National Population Council's terms of reference do not include a corporate planning or policy development function. Through its committees and working parties, the Council has investigated and reported on specific issues which have been referred to it. Statutory Authorities: Employment Goals (Question No. 1527) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Local Government, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Albury Wodonga Development Corporation giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any organisational activities which are inconsistent withI maximising employment growth. Mr Simmons-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: For the last 18 years the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation has successfully worked to bring employment and industry to Albmy-Wodonga (a) In 1992, the Corporation continues to make an important contribution to the economic development of the Albury-Wodonga region in partnership with State and Local Governments and the community. (b) The Corporation does this by encouraging investment, attracting industry, survey and research dissemination and providing a pool' of serviced industrial estates, nursery factories and housing for the battle key personnel moving to the area. (c) The Corporation reduced its staff numbers following a review by the Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council in 1989. The review made recommendations to streamline Corporation administration and improve its effectiveness in a range of activities, including those contributing to maximising employment growth in the area. Human Rights (Question No. 1554) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: Further to the answer to question No. 981 (Hansard, 16 October 1991, page 2095), did consultation conclude with the States and Territories in the forum of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Melbourne on 25 October 1991 concerning declarations under (a) Article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and (b) Article 41 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Mr DutTy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The declaration under Article 14. of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was raised in the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I have since written to the State and Territory Attorneys-General concerning this matter. From the Commonwealth's perspective, I can see no reason in principle for not proceeding to make the declaration under Article 14. As to the declaration under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, I have advised the State and Territory Attorneys-General that, as that declaration gives rise to different considerations including matters of foreign policy, it will be considered separately. I will be giving further consideration to the bilateral aspects of that declaration before further consultations with the States and Territories. Australian Quarantine and Inspection (Question No. 1565) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 30 April 1992: (1) Does the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) corporate policy plan for 1987-92 state that AQIS will address situations where inadequate performance is likely to have a significant effect on Australia's economic position, reputation or the profits achieved by Australian exporters and producers; if so, when will AQIS implement and complete its corporate policy plan. (2) Has he or the Department employed a consultant to report on ways to improve the efficiency of the meat inspection system; if so, (a) what are the terms of reference, (b) how long will the consultant be employed, (c) what sum will the consultant be paid and (d) will the consultant's report be made pUblic. (3) What action is the Government taking to implement the recommendations of the Australian Meat Industry Tripartite Overseas Mission. (4) How many (a) quality control and (b) quality assurance programs have been implemented in Australian meat works with the support of AQIS in (i) total and (ii) each State. (5) Has there been any reduction in the number of AQIS inspectors employed and a consequent lower cost of meat inspection services for operators where quality control and quality assurance programs have been implemented; if so, (a) what were the reductions at an enterprise level, (b) are the redundant inspectors still employed by AQIS and (c) how many inspectors have taken redundancy packages. (6) How many meat inspectors are employed by AQIS. . (7) How many meat inspectors employed by AQIS are surplus to the actual requirements of operators. (8) How many surplus inspectors are being made redundant in (a) total and (b) each State. (9) How many ancillary inspectors are stationed in abattoirs throughout Australia in (a) total and each State. (10) What is the cost of rental for regional and district offices of AQIS (a) in total, (b) in each State and (c) at each office. (11) How many staff employed at (a) regional Service and (b) district offices (i) in total and (ii) at each office. (12) How many staff are employed at the AQIS head office. (13) When will AQIS implement uniformity of work practices in all States in respect of overtime. (14) Do senior meat inspectors (a) in Victoria and (b) elsewhere earn additional overtime by early starts. (15) Will he ensure that a sufficient number of meat inspectors is made available to guarantee that operators do not suffer financial loss as a result of having to reduce production levels or selJ offal on the domestic market because of a shortage of inspection staff. (16) What is AQIS' policy concerning manning levels on calf slaughtering lines. (17) Are ancillary inspection staff used to assist on calf slaughtering lines; if not, why not.",91
310,Mr GRIFFITHS,REPLACEMENT AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Planning is an essential component of AQIS' successful move to commercialisation and making its inspection and quarantine operations more effective and efficient. AQIS' Strategic Plan for 1992-96 acknowledges AQIS' role as including continual review and revision of inspection and quarantine approaches to meet and anticipate contemporary and future marketing and trading needs, and developing and applying sound business practices in relation to planning, organisation structure, management practice and service delivery. The introduction of a Trust Account environment, scheduled for 1 July 1993, puts AQIS in a position in which a commercial approach is being established requiring the introduction of sound commercial practice at every level of the organisation and in the States which carry out functions on behalf of AQIS. To progress the commercial approach, AQIS is developing a Business Plan for 1992-93 which will involve the development of key output-oriented (b) financial and operational performance measures and develop policies and practices aimed at staff management and placement based on better financial and reporting systems. It will focus the organisation even more intently on its service delivery on behalf of the industry. (2) Last year I commissioned a consultant to review AQIS. The consultancy was not specifically directed at the efficiency of the meat inspeCtion system, but this was addressed as part of the overall review of AQIS. (a) The terms of reference were as follows: to review submissions lodged and other relevant material further to my call of December 1990 for public comment on the matter of AQIS' organisational form and related issues; to consider the views of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy including AQIS; to consult other interested parties as appropriate; and to submit a report to me containing options and recommendations on the organisational form and arrangements which would best allow AQIS NA Approved 13 13 (b) I have assumed Quality Assurance programs arrangements (as of 1 May 1992) NA Full 5 IAP* 3 TOTAL 8 * lAP - Interim Approval Period (5) With the implementation of AQAs and PQAs at individual establishments, the number of inspection staff required and subsequently charged for under Fee-for-Service has been reduced. The charges to companies will therefore be reduced pro rata by the number of inspection staff no longer required. to meet the challenges of delivering cost effective and responsive quarantine and foo4 inspection services which meet the needs of industry, consumers and the Australian Government, as well as Australia 's international obligations and treaty requirements. (b) The consultant was employed for a period of 6 weeks. (c) The sum paid to the consultant was $28,518.70. (e) The consultant's report was made public last year. (3) I understand the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Industrial Relations will be making an announcement in the near future which will encompass the recommendations of the Australian Meat Industry Tripartite Overseas Mission.

(11)(a) Staff employed at Regional Offices are 306. (b) 54 staff are employed at district offices. (i) Total staff employed at offices are 360. (ii) By office staff numbers are: Sydney 62, Melbourne 86, Brisbane 63, Adelaide 46, Perth 39, Hobart 10, Darwin 2, Annidale 3, Dubbo 3, Wagga Wagga 3, Grafton I, Gunnedah I, Newcastle I, Wollongong I, Ballarat 3, Black Rock 3, Pakenham 3, Shepparton 4, Geelong I, Mildura 4, Bundaberg I, Cairns 6, Gold Coast I, Bulimba 2, Berri I, Mount Gambier 1, Port Lincoln 1, Carnarvon 1, Geraldton 2, Launceston 5. The Footscray office has not yet been set up. Karumba is a seasonal office which operates during the prawn season. (12) At 30 April there were 308 staff at AQIS head office. (13) AQIS has a policy of uniform overtime practices and is endeavouring to achieve this aim. However it must be remembered that the overtime worked by AQIS staff is to a large extent governed by the hours of operation of the industry which those staff service and overseas market requirements. (14)(a) Senior meat inspectors do earn additional overtime by early starts. Again, as stated in the answer to question 13, the overtime hours worked by senior inspectors are largely determined by the hours of operation of the meat industry and the requirements of overseas markets. (b) The answer is the same as for 14a. (15) AQIS has a policy of maintaining enough staff to meet the operational needs of the industries it services. However, it must be remembered that AQIS is expected to cut costs and cannot afford to carry a large number of surplus inspectors just in case an abattoir opens or requires extra staff on short notice. (16) Manning levels on calf slaughtering lines under fee for service are agreed between AQIS and the works management, taking into consideration the rate of throughput and the agreed meat inspection staffmg standards. Management of a works make an application for inspection staff to be provided for the slaughter floor on an hourly, weekly, monthly or annual basis. Management may similarly make an application for provision of ancillary inspection staff. (17) Ancillary services are defined under the Export Control (Fees) Orders as meat inspection services other than slaughter floor inspection services. However, if a plant is operating at a rate of throughput that is within the terms of the fee service agreement and particular conditions exist such that additional slaughter floor inspection are required, the officer in charge of inspection staff at the plant, may, having due regard to all circumstances, make a decision to allocate ancillary inspection staff to slaughter floor duties. Attorney-General's Department: Publication of Marriage Brochure (Question No. 1566) Mr Andrews asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 May 1992: Did his Department publish, pursuant to the Marriage Act 1961, a brochure entitled Happily ever before and after which is required to be provided to persons intending to marry in Australia: if so, (a) how many copies were (i) published and (ii) distributed to marriage celebrants and other persons or organisations, (b) has the brochure been withdrawn from circulation; if so, why and (c) what was the cost of publishing and distributing the brochure.",93
311,Mr DUFFY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department did publish, in November 1991, pursuant to the Marriage Act 1961, a brochure entitled Happily ever before and after which is required to be provided to persons intending to marry in Australia. (a) (i) 392,500 copies of the brochure were printed. An equivalent amount was printed of an accompanying brochure, which details where persons may obtain marriage counselling, marriage education and family mediation services from agencies which are approved and funded under the Family Services Program. (ii) 391,000 copies of each brochure were distributed to the State[ferritory Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages for distribution to authorised marriage celebrants. 1\venty copies of each pamphlet were distributed to all marriage counselling, marriage education and family mediation organisations funded under the Family Services Program. The remainder of the pamphlets were retained within the Department for supplementary distribution as required. (b) The brochure was withdrawn after it was for discovered that the pamphlet contained an incorrect statement of law in some States. The information staff was corrected and the revised pamphlet was reprinted in February and released in March 1992. As there was no defect with the list of service providers, there was no cause to withdraw this document. (c) The cost of publishing and distributing the original document and list was $26,379. The cost of replacing and distribution of the 391,000 brochures was $16,355. It must be noted that this document was a new edition and therefore all stocks held by celebrants in Australia were no longer valid and required replacement. In an average year, the Department would print a number of these documents consistent with the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on Marriages registered. The average yearly cost of printing these documents would therefore be around $5,000. (Question No. 1572) Mr Walker asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 May 1992: (1) How many (a) fees for visitors' visas were paid and (b) visitors' visas were issued in (i) Manila, (ii) Tokyo, (iii) Beijing and (iv) Singapore in the last 12-month reporting period. (2) What total sum was paid for unsuccessful applications for visitors' visas at the places referred to in part (1) in the last 12-month reporting period. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Prior to 1 February 1992 there was no fee in respect of visitor visa applications. From 1 February 1992 a fee of $30 applies only where applicants seek a stay in Australia of more than 3 months or extended visa validity. No fees were, therefore, collected in the last 12 month reporting period (1/7/90 - 30/6/91). I have provided, instead, details of fees collected in respect of visitor visa applications for the period from 1 February 1992 to 31 May 1992. Figures on visitor visa issues do, however, relate to the 90/91 period.

(2) How many of the women referred to in part (1) have died. (3) How many of the women referred to in part (2) died of Creutzfe1dt-Jakob (CJ) disease. (4) Have any of the women referred to in part (1) been contacted by Commonwealth health authorities and given (a) information and (b) counselling on the connection between HPG and CJ disease; if so, (i) how many women, (ii) when was the contact made, (iii) what information was given and (iv) what counselling was made available. (5) Has his or his Department's attention been drawn to a reportin the Lancet describing a DNA test for susceptibility to CJ disease. (6) Is a DNA test for susceptibility to CJ disease available in Australia; if not, will arrangements be made for women who may be at risk of contracting CJ disease from HPG treatment to send samples overseas for testing; if not why not. (7) Will he release the protocols of manufacture used by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories for No. of the manufacture of HPG; if not why not. fees paid Visas issued (2/92-5/92) (90/91) Mr HOWE - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 12,636 (1) Departmental records indicate there were 263,533 some 1500 women treated under the program. The 6,368 numbers treated from 1964 to 1985 when the 63,711 program ceased are listed below. Please note that some women received mUltiple treatments. 1964-1 1975-130 1965-1 1976-142 1966-1 1977-137 1967-2 1978-129 1968-31 1979-146 1969-68 1980-175 1970-84 1981-177 1971-93 1982-188 1972-102 1983-159 1973-123 1984-63 1974-134 1985-17 The above figures refer to treatments with Follicle Stimulating Honnone (FSH), which is a derivative of HPG. (2) Not known - this information is not collected by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. (3) The Department is aware of two cases where women treated under the program have died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). (4) Commonwealth health authorities have not contacted any of the women direct, but when the program was suspended in 1985 the Department wrote to medical practitioners who participated under the Australian Human Pituitary Honnone Program requesting them to contact and counsel patients about the risk of CJD and of the possibility of secondary transmission. The Department wrote again in November 1990 and again in January and February of this year. (i) Responses received from participating medical practitioners indicate that as at 26 June 1992, some 352 women have been contacted. (ii) The date of contact varies between medical practitioners. (iii) The advice given was that each practitioner should exercise hisfher clinical judgement in contacting the person. (iv) Medical practitioners provided counselling as appropriate according to their clinical judgement in each case. (5)-(6) Yes. The article described evidence for hypothesis that susceptibility to CJD is linked to variations in a certain gene and described a technique for testing samples from CJD cases for the variations. The Department is seeking further information on the research to assess its value and to detennine if the technique could be carried out in Australia should this prove to be appropriate. (7) During the period 1969 to 1983 the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) conducted the manufacture of FSH for the Commonwealth program using a method of manufacture devised by CSIRO and approved by the Human Pituitary Advisory Committee. The protocols contain certain know-how which is the intellectual property of CSL and/or third parties. Should the honourable member so wish, arrangements can be made for him to visit CSL and peruse the protocols, but I do not intend that they be made public for reasons of commercial confidentiality. CES Office: Sunbury (Question No. 1591) Mrs Bailey asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 26 May 1992: (1) Will a full-time CES office be established in Sunbury, Vic., in the near future; is so, when; if not, why not. (2) Did the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations promise the Bulla Shire a full-time CES office in 1984; if so, where is the promise recorded. (3) What requirements need to be met before a full-time CES office is established.",96
312,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are no plans to open a CES office in Sunbury at this time. Any decision to open an office in a new location has to be taken in the context of funding being available, and the claim of the location being stronger than that of competing locations. My Department is presently considering its presence in the Bulla Shire as an ongoing commitment to ensuring that all of its clients continue to enjoy a satisfactory service. (2) On 13 June 1984, Victoria State Office was advised by telex that the Minister had given fonnal approval for the establishment of an office in Sunbury.. Advice to the Shire Council indicated an that this was dependent on the availability of funds. (3) When considering the appropriate level of CES presence in an area factors such as anticipated business levels, proximity to other CES offices, forecast demographic changes, proximity to public transport, need for co-location with other Government agencies and assessment of competing demands for limited funds are taken into account. Army: Surplus Fabric and Clothing (Question No. 1593) Mrs Bailey asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 26 May 1992: Are Army surplus rolls of new pure cotton khaki fabric and Army surplus clothing being auctioned at sales in Melbourne; if so, (a) why: (i) has the material become surplus and or (ii) is it being auctioned, (b) will the Army make a profit auction, (c) how many other auctions of this kind have occurred since 1990 and (d) what happens to the items not sold at auction. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) (i) The items are not surplus but obsolete. They were used in garments replaced by new uniforms. (ii) To obtain best value for money and maximise returns to the Commonwealth as required by Finance Direction 26. (b) As the stocks of material have been held by the Army for some time it would be difficult to determine what the total through life cost of the rolls of material would be. The calculation of profit would have to be based on this cost. It is, however, estimated that the sale of the material would not cover the purchase and storage costs already incurred. (c) Fiv;e sales of material and one of clothing. (d) None have failed to sell. However, should this occur the item would be re-offered at the next auction. Australian Airlines (Question No. 1594) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 26 May 1992: (1) Did the Government give any guarantees to Australian Airlines in October 1991 in relation to any debt incurred by the company as a result of the deregulation of domestic aviation; if so (a) what guarantees were given, (b) what was the extent of the guarantees and (c) were the losses of fares offered by Australian Airlines at below cost price covered by any guarantees. (2) Were guarantees given to any other airline.",98
313,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government did not give any guarantees to Australian Airlines in October 1991 in relation to any debt incurred by the company as a result of from the the deregulation of domestic aviation. However the Government has provided an assurance to Australian Airlines in the context of the sales process. On 13 September 1991 the Government provided Australian Airlines with a letter which could be presented to rating agencies to address any concerns they might have over the airline's credit worthiness arising from uncertainty over the airlines post sale ownership and capital structure. The Government set a minimum period of 95 days between the date of any trade sale contract to sell majority ownership and the date of final settlement. That was in recognition of concerns that were expressed in relation to the airline's short term commercial paper. The Government also agreed to undertake, at the time of any contract for majority sale, to take over at settlement date the obligations for any commercial paper issued by the airline after the date of contract that matures after the settlement date. Sale proceeds would be adjusted accordingly. (2) Guarantees were not given to any other airline. However the Government has provided an assurance to Qantas in the context of the sales process. On 11 September 1991 the Government provided Qantas with a letter, that could be presented to lenders, explaining the Government's position in relation to the recapitalisation of Qantas during the sales process. The letter explained that the Government is committed to ensuring that recapitalisation of the airline will occur as a result of the sales process. Army: Reserve (Question No. 1605) Mr Aldred asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel upon notice, on 27 May 1992: (1) Is the Army's general reserve (a) largely tasked and trained for the defence of nominated vital assets in the north of mainland Australia and (b) not potentially available for deployment and manoeuvre. (2) Does the defence plan for Australia provide for the effective strength of little more than one brigade group of regular ground forces to be deployed in immediate defence tasks; if so, in light of the response to part (1), why. (3) What fully manned trained and equipped regular signals, engineer and armoured elements remain available for urgent defence tasks when the regular Army is depleted by commitments overseas such as those in the Middle East and Cambodia. (4) What contingency plan exists for dealing infiltration or concentration of hostile elements directed at any area of Australia south of the Tropic of Capricorn where the greater proportion of Australia's land mass, population and capital infrastructure lie. Mr Bilney - The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) All of the Army's seven general reserve brigades are potentially available for deployment and manoeuvre. Four of these brigades (4, 9, 11 and 13 Brigades) have also been given the specific training task of preparing for vital asset protection in Northern Australia. The employment of these brigades in any future conflict would be detennined by the Government and the Chief of the Defence Force at the time. (2) Two regular, one Ready Reserve and seven general reserve brigades are currently available for the Defence of Australia. Should a threat to Australia arise the Chief of the Defence Force would task the brigades in the most effective and appropriate way. These ten brigades could be augmented by the raising of additional forces if required. (3) Defence preparedness is structured to be able to respond to warning. Force Elements are required to mobilise within a stipulated readiness notice to conduct peacetime tasks or operations associated \with contingencies credible in the shorter term. J\rmy Force Elements on very short notice are generally able to meet all assigned roles and tasks. Preparedness shortfalls that occur occasionally for these Force Elements are manageable. The specific preparedness of Force Elements is classified information. (4) Present contingency plans for the defence of Australia address the nature and scope of potential threats in the light of the enduring features of Australia's geo-strategic situation. The Defence of Australia includes all parts of Australia, both south and north of the Tropic of Capricorn. In response to the strategic guidance contained in the 198White Paper and subsequent ministerial statements, the Australian Army will progressively move a regular brigade to Darwin between 1993 and 2000. Like the Ready Deployment Force Brigade based in Townsville, the Darwin Brigade will enjoy the advantages of acclimatisation and access to training areas in northern Australia. The majority of Army's with combat formations, however, the Ready Reserve brigade and six of the seven General Reserve brigades will remain based south of the Tropic of Capricorn. This balance of regular forces in the north and reserve forces in the south is consistent with strategic guidance and the readiness posture that follows from it. Western Australian Relational Ports: Waterside Workers (Question No. 1610) I Mr Thckey asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 27 May 1992: (1) Has the Western Australian Government directed regional port authorities at Esperance, Albany and Geraldton to continue the employment of surplus A register waterside workers. (2) Does best practice require that the employees referred to in part (1) be employed on a casual basis to accommodate the operations of ports where ships are not regularly loading or unloading. (3) Has the Minister received representations from the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) concerning its legislated responsibility in the area of the cost of freight and handling. (4) Have other State Governments taken the action referred to in part (1). (5) What steps will the Minister take to ensure that the AWB can properly meet its legislated obligations.",99
314,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am infonned that the Western Australian Government has not given directions to regional ports in that State concerning new labour arrangements being introduced under the waterfront refonn process. Further, I am infonned that the labour requirements at the ports of Esperance, Albany and Geraldton will be based solely on operational needs. In those circumstances, there should be no idle time and no surplus employees under the new arrangements. (2) See (1) above. (3) No. The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) has not written to myself or the former Minister' for Shipping and Aviation specifically drawing attention to its legislated responsibilities the cost of freight and handling. I am advised, however, that the AWB has written on a number of occasions to my predecessor on a range of matters which could be regarded as broadly consistent with the general object of furthering its legislated responsibility for minimising costs· for storage, handling and carriage of wheat and the provision of port services in connection with the carriage of wheat. (4) I am not aware of any State Governments directing regional port authorities to continue the employment of surplus 'A Register' waterside workers. (5) As indicated in the answer to (3) above, I am unaware of any statement by the AWB that it is not in a position to ""properly meet its legislated obligations"" by actions which fall within my portfolio responsibilities. The AWB, and through it the Australian wheat industry, have been major beneficiaries of improved efficiency and cost savings under the Government's waterfront refonn program. Revised bulk grain tenninal manning arrangements based on real operating requirements, providing labour reductions of between 50 and 80 per cent, have been implemented under the waterfront In-Principle Agreement in all bulk grain loading ports. In a press statement released on 4 November 1991, the AWB indicated that Australian ports are now among the most efficient grain loading ports in the world. The AWB has also indicated that the total savings to the grains industry resulting from waterfront reforms could be in the order of $10 million per annum. This saving has been achieved through a 50 per cent reduction in the cost of stevedoring in bulk grain tenninals and a significant reduction in grain ship turnaround times since 1988-89 from 4.52 days to 2.4 days. Feral Animal Control (Question No. 1611) Mr Snow asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 27 May 1992: (1) What has the Commonwealth Government done in feral animal control since 1983. . (2) What feral animal control programs, in particular in connection with rabbits, have been in the area of funded through the States. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Constitutionally, major responsibility for control of feral animals lies with the state and territory governments. Under their legislation, the landholder/occupier, whether government or nongovernment, is required to control declared feral animals. The Commonwealth has and continues to have a major input into feral animal research including development of control techniques. My colleague, the honourable Senator Cook, recently detailed Commonwealth expenditure on rabbit research in an answer to a question on notice from Senator Lees. Concerning feral animal control, the Commonwealth's primary input is through its responsibility for the land it manages, national parks, Commonwealth acquired land and external territories. Some feral animals have also been controlled as part of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC), as demonstration projects funded under the Decade of Landcare initiative, under the past Community Employment Program and the current Aboriginal Employment Development Policy and the Contract Employment Program for Aboriginals in Natural and Cultural Resource Management. The following is a summary of information on Commonwealth input into feral animal control since 1983 (Rabbit control projects are denoted by an *): Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) ANPWS is responsible for managing Kakadu, Uluru, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island National Parks, and parts of some external territories. As part of the ANPWS wildlife management strategy, feral animal control is carried out in all parks. It also provides extensive funds for research into major pests of Australia's endangered native plants and animals through the Endangered Species Program. Specific control programs include: Kakadu National Park Approximately 80,000 buffalo and feral cattle have been removed since 1983, primarily for conservation but also as part of BTEC. There are now less than 1000 buffalo in the Park. There are localised infestations of feral pigs. Control is limited to areas of high public use and where there is easy access. Uluru National Park *There has been an extensive rabbit control program since 1986. A pilot bounty system for control of feral cats has recently been introduced. Christmas Island Introduced wolf snakes, cats and dogs are controlled on the island. Norfolk Island Crimson rosellas (which are not native to Norfolk Island) and cats and rats are continuously controlled in high priority areas, such as the breeding the endangered Green Parrot. *With the assistance of Norfolk Island residents, rabbits were eradicated from Phillip Island in the Territory of Norfolk Island during the period 19791986. Other areas Rats were eradicated from West Island in Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve. A similar program is underway in the Coringa-Herald National Nature Reserve. Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC) BTEC has operated since 1970 and aims to eradicate tuberculosis and brucellosis from stock. Feral buffalo and uncontrolled cattle have been removed under the program. Community Employment Program (CEP) and the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy (AEDP) A number of feral animal control programs were funded in 1986 under CEP. These included: maintenance of the dingo barrier fence near Charleville with the Queensland Rural Lands Protection Board, *rabbit-control in the southern central Northern Territory, maintenance of wild dog fencing in Kosciusko National Park. Aboriginal Employment Development Policy (AEDP) Since 1988 the following feral animal control has been funded under AEDP. *soil conservation including rabbit-control in the Lake Albert Catchment near Wagga Wagga, *pest animal (primarily rabbit) and pest plant control on the foreshores of G1enbawn Dam, NSW, and at Noonkanbah Station, Western Australia, feral pig control on Sir Graeme Moore Island, Western Australia, training of aboriginal pest animal and weed control officers in Moulamein and Dubbo, NSW. Contract Employment Program for Aboriginals in National and Cultural Resource Management Feral animal control projects funded under this program since 1988 include; feral pig control in the Cadell River area of Amhem Land, feral horse control, Hermannsburg, Northern Territory and the areas of following rabbit control programs: * Western Australia - Brookton, Gibson Desert and Narrogin regions. * South Australia - Murraylands, and Port Lincoln National Parks. * Victoria - Aboriginal burial sites, Mildura. National Soil Conservation Program *Demonstration projects on rabbit control have been funded since the program commenced in 1989 in the following localities: NSW - Ivanhoe Rangecare Group; Victoria - North Harcourt-Sedgwick, Sutton Grange, Amphitheatre, Kingoonya and Yaapeet groups; South Australia - South Australian Department of Agriculture; Northern Territory - Central Australian Management Association. Department of Defence The Department of Defence controls 3.8 million hectares of land with range of feral animals including pigs, rabbits, buffalo, donkeys, goats and horses. Their control is undertaken consistent with relevant state, territory or local government legislaapplications tion. On a more general level, $480,000 over four years (1990/91-1993/94) has been allocated to the Bureau of Rural Resources within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to develop national strategies for the coordinated management of both the environmental and economic impact of major pests including rabbits. A draft feral horse strategy is soon to be circulated for comment while a draft rabbit strategy, which will identify major information deficiencies and establish priorities for research, is expected to be circulated later in 1992. FM Licences: Albury and Lismore (Question No. 1614) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister representing .the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 28 May 1992: (1) What is the chronology of events associated with the consideration of an independent FM licence and supplementary licences at (a) Albury, NSW, and (b) Lismore, NSW, since 1984. (2) Has the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal reversed its initial assessment of the commercial viability of PM licences at (a) Albury and (b) Lismore in recent months. (3) Have supplementary licence applications been lOdged by local AM operators in (a) Albury and (b) Lismore; if so, were the applications lOdged within the correct time frame.",101
315,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer .to the honourable member's question: (1) The chronology of events associated with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's Albury and Lismore licence grant inquiries is: (a) Albury 20 September 1984-A supplementary FM licence application was received from Malcorp Pty Ltd, the then licensee company for 2AY Albury; 23 August 1989-Minister Willis dismissed 2AY's supplementary licence application. The Minister made a prima facie finding that the Albury market could support an additional commercial FM radio service; 14 February 1990-Minister Willis called for an independent licence and published a service area and draft technical conditions for the Albury market. One independent applicant, Albury-WOdonga Broadcasters Pty Ltd, responded. Submissions were also received from Radio Albury-Wodonga Pty Ltd, which is the licensee company for 2AY and is a subsidiary company of Wesgo Communications Pty Ltd, and North East Broadcasters Pty Ltd, licensee of 3NE, whose service area partly overlaps that of 2AY; 2 May 1990-The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) commenced its inquiry into the grant of a new commercial FM radio licence to serve Albury; 3 January 1992-Amendments to the Broadcasting Act came into effect which oblige the ABT to prefer independent applications to supplementary licence applications, when considering both simultaneously, and which limit the ABT's consideration of the commercial viability of incumbent licensees to the periOd up to the expiration of that licence; 5 February 1992-The ABT convened a conference of parties to examine the impact of the changed provision relating to commercial viability as it affects 2AY and 3NE; 31 March 1992-Wesgo Communications Pty Ltd lodged a supplementary licence application on behalf of Radio Albury-Wodonga Pty Ltd with the Department of Transport and Communications. On 8 April 1992 Departmental advice recommending that Radio Albury-Wodonga Pty Ltd's supplementary licence application should be referred to the ABT was forwarded to the Minister for Transport and Communications; . 6-7 April-The ABT held its licence grant Inquiry hearings in Albury. The hearings remains part-heard and are scheduled to recommence on 22 June 1992; 14 May 1992-Radio Albury-Wodonga Pty Ltd's supplementary licence application was lOdged with the ABT; 21 May 1992-The ABT commenced an Inquiry into the grant of a supplementary licence for Albury-Wodonga Pty Ltd which is being conducted simultaneously with the Inquiry into the grant of a new licence for Albury. The closing date for submissions is 15 July, 1992. (b) Lismore 18 September 1984-The Department of Transport and Communications received a supplementary licence application from Richmond River Broadcasters Pty Ltd, the licensee company for 2LM Lismore; 13 April 1988-Minister Evans found a prima facie case that the Lismore market could support a new independent commercial FM radio service and dismissed Richmond River Broadcasters' supplementary licence application; 8 May 1988-Minister Evans called for applications for an independent FM licence to serve Lismore and published a draft service area and technical conditions; 28 July 1988-The ABT commenced its Inquiry into the grant of a new commercial radio licence serve Lismore; 18 December 1989-ABT published the report on its decision to grant a licence to Northern NSW FM Pty Ltd. This decision was appealed by Richmond River Broadcasters and Northern Rivers FM Pty Ltd; 12 February 1990-Justice'Morling in the Federal Court ordered that the ABT's decision be set aside and remitted back to the Tribunal on the grounds that natural justice was denied to the parties by the ABT's failure to make available to them a report detailing the financial performance of a group of comparative services before this analysis was published in the report on the ABT's decision in December 1989; 12 July 1990-Justice Einfield in the Federal Court ordered that Mr Bruce Allen not sit as the Division for the reconstituted authority; 24 January 1991-Following an unsuccessful appeal by Northern NSW FM Pty Ltd against Justice Einfield's decision, Mr Tim O'Keefe was appointed to sit as the ABT's Division for its reconstituted Lismore Inquiry; 17 December 1991-The ABT published a preliminary view that neither the commercial viability of 2LM nor that of the adjacent service provided by 2MW Murwillumbah would be prejuRadio diced by the grant of a new commercial radio licence to serve Lismore; 20 February 1992-The Minister for Transport and Communications wrote to the Chairman of the ABT seeking his views on the practicability of joining an inquiry into the grant of a supplementary licence for Richmond River Broadcasters with its Inquiry into the grant of a new commercial radio licence to serve Lismore; 21 February 1992-The Chairman of the ABT wrote to the Minister stating that he saw no impediment to the referral of a supplementary licence application from Richmond River Broadcasters. The Chairman also stated that, although any decision to join a supplementary licence Inquiry with the current Lismore Inquiry rested with the Lismore Division, the ABT ""has in the past chosen to join commercial grant inquiries with related supplementary licence inquiries""; 6 March 1992-The Minister wrote to the Chairman of the ABT advising him that Richmond River Broadcasters had indicated that a supplemento tary licence application would be lodged with the Minister in the near future; 9-10 March 1992-The ABT held hearings in Lismore. Richmond River Broadcasters indicated during that hearing that they would be in a position to lodge a supplementary licence application by 1 April; 31 March 1992-Richmond River Broadcasters Pty Ltd lodged a supplementary licence application with the Department of Transport and Communications; 8 April 1992-Departmental advice recommending that Richmond River Broadcasters Pty Ltd's supplementary licence application should be referred to the ABT was forwarded to the Minister for Transport and Communications; 12 May 1992-The Minister referred Riehm. md River Broadcasters' supplementary licence application to the ABT; 13 May 1992-The ABT announced its decision not to grant a new independent radio licence to serve Lismore; 22 May 1992-The ABT commenced an Inquiry into the grant of a supplementary licence to Richmond River Broadcasters. (2) (a) and (b) During the Lismore Inquiry, the ABT was obliged under Section 80B of the Broadcasting Act to consider the effect on the commercial viability of an existing licence of granting an additional licence, but only for the period up to incumbent licence's expiration. (On the 18th of June 1992, the Senate passed the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, which included an amendment to Section 80B requiring the ABT to consider the commercial viability of an incumbent licence for a period of 5 years from the date of its decision to grant a new licence). Under Section 83A of the Act, the ABT is obliged to refuse to grant a licence to a person if the Tribunal is not satisfied that the person has financial and management capacities necessary to provide an adequate and comprehensive service pursuant to the licence. The ABT's preliminary view of the commercial viability of 2LM Lismore and 2MW Murwillumbah, published in December 1991, concluded that neither service would be prejudiced by the grant of a new licence to serve Lismore. The ABT's decision not to grant a new licence in Lismore was based on its analysis of more recent financial data from the 1990-91 Financial Year, which showed a continuing decline in the revenue generated in the Lismore radio market; the ABT's projections of an irreversible loss of revenue from radio to television following the commencement of Television Equalisation in northern NSW and the projected increases in 2LM's expenditure in response to Equalisation; and 2LM's reduced capacity to further cut staffing costs. The ABT did not base its decision not to grant a new licence on Section 83A of the Act. The ABT has not published any preliminary view of the commercial viability of 2AY given the introduction of a new competitive se,rvice, and, as it has not yet concluded the Albury Inquiry, has not made any determination under Section 83A in relation to this Inquiry. (3) (a) and (b) As indicated in the chronology of the Albury and Lismore inquiries, both 2AY Albury and 2LM Lismore have lodged supplementary licence applications, and these have been referred to the ABT for its consideration. Section 82A of the Broadcasting Act, which provides for supplementary licence applications, does not set any limitations on the times at which incumbent licensees may submit supplementary licence applications. Richmond River Broadcasters Pty Ltd indicated to the ABT at the Lismore hearing on 9-10 March the that they would endeavour to lodge a supplementary licence application with the Department of Transport and Communications before 1 April. Richmond River Broadcasters' supplementary licence application was lodged on 31 March. As noted in my answer to question 1, the ABT can, and has in the past, joined supplementary licence and new commercial licence grant inquiries. However, Richmond River Broadcasters' referred application was not received by the ABT until after the Lismore new licence grant Inquiry was concludthe ed. The ABT has therefore commenced a separate Inquiry into the grant of a supplementary licence to Richmond River Broadcasters. The ABT's Inquiry into the grant of a supplementary licence to Radio Albury-Wodonga Pty Ltd is being conducted simultaneously with its continuing Inquiry into the grant of a new commercial radio licence in Albury. Medicare: Radiology Services (Question No. 1618) Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 1 June 1992: (1) Following the report on proposed radiology regulations by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, will the Government investigate further opti-ns to restructure Medicare payments for radiology services; if so, when will the investigation be complete. (2) Has the Government considered an item by item evaluation of the Medicare schedule items relating to the provision of radiology services taking into account the costs and skill involved in the delivery of each service. (3) Have other options for restructuring been considered; if so, what options. (4) Will any further options investigated not be limited to solutions based on a differential pricing for the same service.",103
316,Mr HOWE,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2), (3) and (4) The Government will assess options for the restructure of radiology services under the M-icare Benefits Schedule. One such option is a review of radiology items on an item-by-item basis taking into account costs and skill. Consideration of options will take place following completion of consultations and research as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. World Environment Day School Kit (Question No. 1622)",105
317,Mr MCARTHUR,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 2 June 1992: (1) What advice in respect of the World Environment Day 1992 school kit came to the consultants, Social Change Media, from (a) the Australian Conservation Foundation, (b) Animal Liberation, (c) Community Aid Abroad, (d) Greenpeace Australia Ltd, (e) the Rainforest Information Centre, (f) the Wilderness Society, in relation to sections on (i) car culture, (ii) land management and (iii) ways of life: logging debate role play. (2) If written advice was provided, in each case (a) what were the source documents and (b) from which organisation was it obtained. (3) If oral advice was provided, which officers in each of the organisations referred to in part (1) gave the advice.",106
318,Mrs KELLY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am informed that the consultants have provided the following information in response to this question: (a) (i), (ii) and (iii) Nil (b) (i), (ii) and (iii) Nil (c) (i), (ii) and (iii) Nil (d) (i), (ii) and (iii) Nil (e) (i), (ii) and (iii) Nil (f) (i), (ii) and (iii) Nil (2) Not applicable. (3) Not applicable. Meat Exports (Question No. 1624) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 3 June 1992: (1) Has his attention been drawn to complaints that bureaucratic red tape is preventing the development of value-added meat exports. (2) Is it a fact that the health certificate cannot be prepared until the ""intention to export"" form is signed and the truck of meat sealed by an Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) inspector at the meat plant; if so, must the health certificate be prepared after the truck has already left to go to the airport and has the export company then to drive to an AQIS office in the town to get the health certificate completed and then deliver it to the airfreight agent ill time for the meat to be shipped. (3) Is it also a fact that if there is a simple typing error the health certificate is rejected and must be retyped; if so, will he have the procedures changed anel the practice adopted of allowing both parties to initial the error. (4) Does unnecessary bureaucracy force comthe panies to look at establishing businesses offshore.",106
319,Mr GRIFFITHS,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I do not accept that bureaucratic red tape is preventing the development of value added meat exports. There are very specific requirements that have to be met by exporters of meat and meat products. These requirements are imposed by overseas countries and are often more stringent than those operating within Australia. AQIS is responsible for ensuring that they are met. (2) The preparation of the health certificate can be commenced at any time but, by necessity, it cannot be completed until all details of the consignment are known eg container numbers and seal numbers. The exporter must deliver the completed health certificate to an AQIS regional office for checking of format and importing country requirements and endorsements before the certificate is signed and sealed. These offices are located in close proximity to the majority of meat exporters. The health certificate can only be issued on sighting the pink copy of the ""export permit"" which contains all the details. The exporter is then responsible for delivering the signed health c:ertificate to his forwarding agent. AQIS regional offices have and are willing to make arrangements for out of hours issuing for special airfreights. (3) Australian Meat Health Certificates are government to government documents that have been negotiated with importing country authorities. It is a long standing policy that is internationally recognised and accepted that such certificates are not issued with corrections. To do so could bring into question the standing of cation system. A system of initialling minor corrections would not be acceptable to the majority of Australia's meat trading partners. The main reason for this is that there are problems associated with the recognition of initials and overseas authorities have no of knowing whether the correction was done in Australia by AQIS or elsewhere. Any wrongful alteration could place the whole of Australia's export meat trade to that destination at risk. In some cases the error is not detected until it has reached its destination and it is the overseas authorities who reject the certificate and insist on a replacement. Where errors are detected more stringent import examinations are often imposed on Australian meat. Under the circumstances I could not agree to changing the existing procedures. (4) I am not aware of any such instances in the meat industry. However if the honourable member has evidence to the contrary I would welcome his passing that information on to me and I will certainly look into the matter. Cocos (Keeling) Islands: Animal .Quarantine Station (Question No. 1634) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 4 June 1992: (1) What does the Government propose for the Cocos Islands animal quarantine station. (2) What cost recovery percentage is required for the quarantine station to remain viable. (3) Is this level of cost recovery being achieved; if not, what is the level of cost recovery. (4) Does the cost recovery policy include the cost of maintaining the Perth office; if so, what is the cost of the Perth office. (5) Is the Perth office a necessary element of the Cocos Island facility; if so, why. (6) What action has been taken to increase the operating efficiency of the station. (7) Has action taken included (a) a longer rotation of officers, (b) multi-skilling and (c) greater use of local staff. (8) What percentage of the annual maximum capacity of the station (a) was used in 1991-1992 and is estimated to be used in (b) 1991-92 and (c) the Australian certifi1992-93. (9) What species of animal are anticipated to be the major users of the station over the next five years. (to) What are the criteria for the use of the station over one of the mainland quarantine faciliway ties in relation to (a) diseases and (b) animals' countries of origin. (11) What restrictions are placed on the use of the station by overseas principals for the transfer of animals to (a) Australia and (b) other countries. (12) What action is being taken to increase the usage of the station, including by (a) marketing the facility internationally and (b) offering time slot or other packages for the total station to private sector contractors. .",106
320,Mr GRIFFITHS,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government proposes to maintain the presence of a high security quarantine on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands for the immediate future to enable Australian importers to gain access to genetic material from high risk countries. The longer term future of the station may well be influenced by developments in fields such as embryo technology where developments may well lead to the ability to implant with a high level of safety on the mainland. (2) Under the policy for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to be fully cost recoverable, desirably the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Animal Quarantine Station (CIAQS) should recover 100% of costs. In practice this is unlikely due to quarantine problems of maintaining continuity of usage of CIAQS for imports from high risk countries. No specific recovery % has been determined in terms of CIAQS' viability. (3) The level of 100% cost recovery is not being achieved. The level of cost recovery for 1991-1992 is estimated to be $358,300 or 40%. (4) The cost base for CIAQS includes a proportion of the costs of running the Perth office based on the proportion of services undertaken by the Perth office on behalf of CIAQS. It also includes the cost of the Perth office services for barrier operations (quarantine clearance of planes and boats). This latter cost has been removed from the 92/93 cost base. The cost of the Perth office is $63,193 being the salary and administrative costs to support the animal quarantine operations at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. (5) The Perth office is a necessary element of CIAQS under the current regionalised management system. The Perth office handles personnel and financial matters for CIAQS and provides a general administrative oversight. (6) The major operating efficiencies that have been undertaken are: (a) the removal of sentinel animals during periods when no quarantine program is in progress; (b) a reduction in staff numbers from eleven (9 x AQIS officers and 2 x Cocos Malays) to six (4 x AQIS officers and 2 x Cocos Malays). This will be further reduced to five (3 x AQIS officers and 2 x Cocos Malays) in July 1992; (c) a requirement for importers to provide additional labour during periods when a quarantine program is in progress; and (d) a move to have a veterinary officer stationed at CIAQS only during the period of a quarantine program. (7) (a) Action has been taken to extend the rotation of some officers. (b) Officers have been trained to undertake multi-skilling in regard to quarantine station duties and barrier control duties. (c) Limited use has been made of local personnel and this is an additional option that may be considered to reduce costs if and when suitable local personnel are available. (8) CIAQS operates on single quarantines on an all-in, all-out basis and revenue is based on a monthly or part there-of charge regardless of the size of the consignment. (a) During 1991-92 the percentage usage of the annual maxUnum capacity was 41.6%. (b) Based on approved priorities, the usage of CIAQS for 1991-92 was estimated to be in the order of 70%. (c) 50% excluding cleaning and disinfection down time and slippage which is a normal part of importations from high risk countries. (9) The species of animals likely to use CIAQS over the next five years are: zoo animals from high risk countries camelids from high risk countries ostriches from high risk and low to medium risk countries zoo avian species bovine embryos from high risk countries. (10) (a) CIAQS is used in lieu of mainland quarantine stations when importations present an increased risk of introduction of major animal diseases and pests such as foot and mouth disease, Rift Valley fever and major avian diseases ego Newcastle disease. It is particularly important for eliminating the risks associated with vector borne diseases. ' (b) CIAQS is used for importations from high risk countries. High risk countries are those where major animals diseases and pests of concern to Australia are present. , (11) (a) No restrictions have been placed on overseas principals to use CIAQS for transfer of animals into Australia. Overseas principals would only be given a lower priority for use if their applications are of equal merit with Australian applicants. The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has been advised that applications for use of CIAQS from that country would be considered along with applications from Australia. (b) AQIS has not sought applications from other countries for use of CIAQS nor has AQIS received any formal applications from countries other than New Zealand. AQIS hits however, received one enquiry for possible use of the facility by an overseas country other than New Zealand. (12) AQIS has sought to increase the usage of the station by seeking to have the Animal Import Priorities Committee which consists of government and industry representatives and, which allocates priorities for use of CIAQS, to approve mUltiple usage for approved importers if required. The Committee has supported this approach on the one occasion it was requested. (a) CIAQS has not been marketed internationally although it may be a possible avenue for increasing its usage and as such will be given further consideration. (b) Time slot or other packages have not been offered to private sector contractors but this is an option that could be considered for the future and the legality of such a proposal will be investigated. There are other aspects of such a proposal that would require investigation to ensure access can be assured for all genuine applicants. Aviation: Communications Systems (Question No. 1636) Mr JuIl asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 June 1992: (1) Was the Corporate Employee Relations Division of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) excluded from participation in the tendering process for the Advanced Australian Air Transport System (TAAATS). (2) Will CAAnet provide some services required for TAAATS; if not, why not. (3) Have either the primary or secondary tenderers for TAAATS built a system that exclusively uses satellite communications services.",107
321,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Shippmg and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. (2) The tenderers were free to propose either satellite or ground based communications systems or a mix of both to service their solution. The provision of bearers to meet the successful tenderers needs will be the responsibility of the CAA. The CAA is currently reviewing its. total communications infrastructure in order to accommodate not only TAAATS but. initiatives such as the Review of Resources and changes to Airways Management. These initiatives may impact on CAAnet. The role to be played by sate!lite and terrestrial communications tecluiologies respectively, incl-d­ ing CAAnet, will not be decided until the TAAATS contract and the communications review are finalised. (3) Neither Thomson CSF nor Hughes has built a system which exclusively uses satellite communications services. Civil Aviation Authority (Question No. 1637) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 June 1992: (1) Is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) planning to migrate the national voice/data network, CAAnet, to disguise the overleasing of Optus; if so, what will this migration cost. (2) Has the CAA involved its own Corporate Employee Relations Divisio- and some external consulting expertise in its review of. corporate communications; if not, why not. (3) Are interPABX links using satellite technology untried in Australia.",109
322,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support haS supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There are no plans to migrate the national voice/data network to satellite. However, as part of the CANs current review of its communications infrastructure, all options are being considered including the viability of transferring some CAAnet traffic to satellite channels. (2) The review covers the CANs total communications infrastructure, including non-operational corporate communications. All parts of the CAA involved in the provision and support of communications facilities, including the CANs Corporate Employee Relations Division, have been involved and consulted during the review process. (3) InterPABX links using satellite technology are not untried in Australia. Optus/Aussat Citylink caters for PABX connections. The PABXs at Chrh;;tmas and Cocos Islands are linked to the mainland via satellite. Civil Aviation Authority (Question No. 1638) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 June 1992: Has the Civil Aviation Authority leased satellite capacity from Aussat or its successor, Optus; if so, (a) what are the duration and terms of the leases, (b) what proportion of the leased capacity is currently used and (c) has the CAA made any attempt to dispose of any excess capacity.",109
323,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honournble member's question: (a) The Civil Aviation Authority has a 15 year lease for satellite capacity from Optus/Aussat. The lease commenced in 1986 and under the terms of the lease, is to be re-negotiated in good faith by both parties prior to the commissioning of the new ""B"" series satellites. The lease specifies that the CAA will lease bulk transponder capacity on two satellites and will have priority restoration rights in keeping with the for safe and efficient Air Traffic Control. (b) Currently, 1,150 circuits are used out of the 1,600 available on the"" A"" series satellite. (c) Under the terms of its contract with Aussat and of the previous Telecommunications legislation, the CAA was severely restricted in the measures that could be taken to dispose of surplus capacity. The situation has now changed and the CAA is seeking to accurately determine its capacity to re-use, sell or sub-lease any surplus. Civil Aviation Authority (Question No. 1639) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister' for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 June 1992: (1) Is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) paying for home telephones, telecards and mobile phones of former employees. (2) Has the CAA personnel section supplied a list of retrenched or redundant staff who have left the CAA to the Corporate Employee Relations Division to permit the termination of the payment of some telephone accounts. (3) What sum has been spent on redundancy packages in respect of positions which were subsequently filled from outside the CAA.",109
324,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) It is not CAA policy to pay for telephone expenses incurred by former employees. CAA reimburses certain current employees for costs incurred in the use of telephones on CAA business. This arrangement ceases on the termination of employment. (2) No. (3) In line with Government policy, all senior management positions within the CAA were recently advertised and subsequently re-staffed under personal contract arrangements. A total of $826,000 was spent on redundancy packages in respect of senior management staff who occupied positions filled from outside the CAA. The CAA's policy is for a redundancy only to be agreed where the work for the position ceases, there is a fundamental change to the nature or needs conditions of the work, or the person can be suitably replaced by a surplus person from within CAA. There has only been one case where redundancy has been agreed and outside recruitment to an unchanged position was subsequently required. In this particular case the employment was temporary. Efforts to staff the position from within CAA continue. The redundancy payment involved was $39,000. International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Question No. 1675) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) Are there more than 104 states party to the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. (2) Has anyone state other than Australia made declarations or reservations with respect to Article 4(a) of the Convention; if so, what is the text of the reservation or declaration in each case. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Currently there are 132 states parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. (2) The following states parties have made declarations or reservations with respect to Article 4(a) of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Fiji, France, Italy, Malta, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The texts of each reservation or declaration in each case is as follows: Antigua and Barbuda The Government of Antigua and Barbuda interprets article 4 of the Convention as requiring a Party to enact measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that article only where it is considered that the need arises to enact such legislation. Australia The Government of Australia ... declares that AuStralia is not at present in a position specifically to treat as offences all the matters covered by article 4(a) of the Convention. Acts of the kind there mentioned are punishable only to the extent provided by the existing criminal law dealing with such matters as the· maintenance of public order, public mischief, assault, riot, criminal libel, conspiracy and attempts. It is the intention of the Australian Government, at the first suitable moment, to seek from Parliament legislation specifically implementing the terms of article 4(a). Austria Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination provides that the measures specifically described in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) shall be undertaken with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention. The Republic of Austria therefore considers that through such measures the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association may not be jeopardized. These rights are laid down in articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; they were reafftnned by the General Assembly of the United Nations when it adopted articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and are referred to in article 5 (d) (viii) and (ix) of the present Convention. Bahamas . Firstly, the Government of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas wishes to state its understanding of article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It interprets article 4 as requiring a party to the Convention to adopt further legislative measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that article only in so far as it may consider with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration set out in article 5 of the Convention (in particular to freedom of opinion and expression and the right of freedom of peaceful assembly and association) that some legislative addition to, or variation of existing law and practice in these fields is necessary for the attainment of the ends specified in article 4. Lastly, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas entrenches and guarantees to every person in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual irrespective of his race or place of origin. The Constitution prescribes judicial process to be observed in the event of the violation of any of these rights whether by the State or by a private individual. Acceptance of this Convention by the Commonwealth of the Bahamas does not imply the acceptance of obligations going beyond the constitutional limits nor the acceptance of any obligations to introduce judicial process beyond these prescribed under the Constitution. Barbados The Constitution of Barbados entrenches and guarantees to every person in Barbados the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual irrespective of his race or place of origin. The Constitution prescribes judicial processes to be observed in the event of the violation of any of these rights whether by the State or by a private individual. Accession to the Convention does not imply the acceptance of obligations going beyond the constitutional limits nor the acceptance of any obligations to introduce judicial processes beyond those provided in the Constitution. The Government of Barbados interprets article 4 of the said Convention as requiring a Party to the Convention to enact measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that article only where it is considered that the need arises to enact such legislation. Belgium In order to meet the requirements or article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Kingdom of Belgium will take care to adapt its legislation to the obligations it has assumed in becoming a party to the said Convention. The Kingdom of Belgium nevertheless wishes to emphasize the importance which it attaches to the fact that article 4 of the Convention provides that the measures laid down in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) should be adopted with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention. The Kingdom of Belgium therefore considers that the obligations imposed by article 4 must be reconciled with the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the. right to peaceful assembly and association. Those rights are proclaimed in articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and have been reaffIrmed in articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They have also been stated in article 5, sub-paragraph (d) (viii) and (ix) of the said Convention. Fiji The Government of Fiji wishes to state its understanding of certain articles in the Convention. It interprets article 4 as requiring a party to the Convention to adopt further legislative measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that article only in so far as it may consider with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention (in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association) that some legislative addition to or variation of existing law and practice in those fields is necessary for the attainment of the end specified in the earlier part of article 4. France With regard to article 4, France wishes to make it clear that it interprets the reference made therein to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the rights set forth in article 5 of the Convention as releasing the States Parties from the obligation to enact anti-discrimination legislation which is incompatible with the freedoms of opinion and expression and of peaceful assembly and association guaranteed by those texts. Italy Declaration made upon signature and confirmed upon ratification The positive measures, provided for in article 4 of the Convention and specifically described in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of that article, designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, discriminashall tion, are to be interpreted, as that article provides, ""with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5"" of the Convention. Consequently, the obligations deriving from the aforementioned article 4 are not to jeopardize the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association which are laid down in articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, were reaffirmed by the General Assembly of the United Nations when it adopted articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and are referred to in articles 5(d)(viii) and (ix) of the Convention. In fact, the Italian Government, in conformity with the obligations resulting from Articles 55(c) and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, remains faithful to the principle laid down in article 29(2) of the Universal Declaration, which provides that ""in the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society."" Malta Declaration made upon signature .and confirmed upon ratification: The Government of Malta wishes to state its understanding of certain articles in the Convention. It interprets article 4 as requiring a party to the Convention to adopt further measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that article should it consider, with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights set forth in article 5 of the Convention, that the need arises to enact 'ad hoc' legislation, in addition to or variation of existing law and practice to bring to an end any act of racial discrimination. Nepal The Constitution of Nepal contains provisions for the Protection of individual rights, including the right to freedom of speech and expression, the right to form unions and associations not motivated by party politics and the right to freedom of professing his/her own religion; and nothing in the Convention be deemed to require or to authorize legislation or other action by Nepal incompatible with the provisions of the Constitution of Nepal. His Majesty's Government interprets article 4 of the said Convention as requiring a Party to the Convention to adopt further legislative measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and of that article only insofar as His Majesty's Government may consider, with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that some legislative addition to, or variation of, existing law and practice in those fields is necessary for the attainment of the end specified in the earlier part of article 4. His Majesty's Government interprets the requirement in article 6 concerning 'reparation or satisfaction' as being fulfilled if one or other of these forms of redress is made available; and further interprets 'satisfaction' as including any form of redress effective to bring the discriminatory conduct to an end. Papua New Guinea Reservation The Government of Papua New Guinea interprets article 4 of the Convention as requiring a party to the Convention to adopt further legislative measures in the areas covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that article only in so far as it may consider with due regard to the principles contained in the Universal Declaration set out in Article 5 of the Convention that some legislative addition to, or variation of existing law and practice, is necessary to give effect to the provisions of Article 4. In addition, the Constitution of Papua New Guinea guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms to all persons irrespective of their race or place of origin. The Constitution also provides for judicial protection of these rights and freedoms. Acceptance of this Convention does not therefore indicate the acceptance of obligations by the Government of Papua New Guinea which go beyond those provided by the Constitution, nor does it indicafe the acceptance of any obligation to introduce judicial process beyond that provided by the Constitution. (The reservation was circulated by the Secretary-General on 22 February 1982.) Tonga Declaration: The Kingdom of Tonga wishes to state its understanding of certain articles in the Convention. It interprets article 4 as requiring a party to the Convention to adopt further legislative measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and of that article only in so far as it may consider with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the (c) rights expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention (in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association) that some legislative addition to or variation of existing law and practice in those fields is necessary for the attainment of the end specified in the earlier part of article 4. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Upon signature Subject to the following reservation and interpretative statements: The United Kingdom wishes to state its understanding of certain articles in the Convention. It interprets article 4 as requiring a party to the Convention to adopt further legislative measures in the fields covered by sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that article only in so far as it may consider with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention (in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association) that some legislative addition to or variation of existing law and practice in those fields is necessary for the attainrhent of the end specified in the earlier part of article 4. Army: Reserve (Question No. 1681) Mrs Bailey asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) What are the Army's (a) short and (b) long term plans for the Army Reserve (ARes). (2) Does the second corporate plan of the Australian Defence Force refer to the ARes; if so, what reference is made. (3) If no significant reference is made to the ARes, why not. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) The 1991 Force Structure Review (c) acknowledged that the Army Reserve's limited availability for training precluded it from being ready for deployment at full operational effectiveness in less than six months. This was considered unacceptable and action has been taken to ensure that the Reserve makes an increased contribution to both mobile and static defence. Army's plan reflects the introduction of the Ready Reserve Scheme, which is designed to increase the skill level and readiness of some reserve. units, and the maintenance of the conventional General Reserve force at existing levels but with increased equipment levels. (2) Yes. This reference is perhaps best reflected in Army's program statement where both the Regular and Reserve components are referred to in meeting the program objective. The ARes is also referred to in the outline of major activities which sees Army maintaining an Australian Army Individual Emergency Reserve and enhancing integration of the Regular and Reserve components within the 'Total Army' concept, and introducing the Ready Reserve concept. (3) The above references are considered significant. Research and Development Projects (Question No. 1683) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) What research or research and development projects have (a) public sector research organisations and (b) university research groups undertaken for the Minister's Department since 1983. (2) What was the (a) dollar value and (b) tenn of each project identified in part (1). (3) Was each project identified in part (1) satisfactorily completed against the criteria initially established for evaluating outcomes. (4) What, in summary, were the objectives of each project. (5) Was each project put to open tender; if not, was the prospect of the project being undertaken by private bodies evaluated; if so, how. (6) Have any projects been undertaken through the private sector since 1983; if so, what was the dollar value of each project. (7) Will further projects be undertaken through the public sector; if so, in each case (a) what, in summary, is its objective and (b) will an open tender be sought.",110
325,Mr HOWE,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Much of the information sought by the honourable member will be found in the Annual Reports of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services since 1982-83. I am not prepared to authorise the considerable time and resources which would be entailed in the Department's collation of all the information. If the honourable member requires information on specific projects I would be happy to provide it. Research and Development Projects (Question No. 1685) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for - mployment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) What research or research and development projects have (a) public sector research organisations and (b) university research groups undertaken for the Minister's Department since 1983. (2) What was the (a) dollar value and (b) tenn of each project identified in part (1). (3) Was each project identified in part (1) satisfactorily completed against the criteria initially established for evaluating outcomes. (4) What, in summary, were the objectives of each project. (5) Was each project put to open tender; if not, was the prospect of the project being undertaken by private bodies evaluated; if so, how. (6) Have any projects been undertaken through the private sector since 1983; if so, what was the dollar value of each project. (7) Will further projects be undertaken through the public sector; if so, in each case (a) what, in summary, is its objective and (b) will an open tender be sought.",114
326,Mr BEAZLEY,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as. follows: (1) The information is availa-le through the consultancies appendices of the Department's Annual Reports for the years from 1987-88. Prior to 1987 the Department did not exist in its present fonn and the resources required to answer· the honourable member's question are not justified. (2) (a) This information is available in the Departmental Annual Reports since 1987-88. (2) (b), (3) and (4) This information is not kept centrally and the resources necessary to assemble it are not justified. (5) This information is not kept centrally by the Department and the resources necessary to assemble it are not justified. Current Departmental instructions require that projects which have a value in excess of $20,000 be put to public tender. The instructions further require that where the value is between $500 and $1000 three representative quotations be sought either orally or in writing. Where the value is between $1000 and $20,000 three representative written quotations are to be sought. Criteria for choosing the successful applicant are based on value for money; the extent to which the proposal reveals a proper understanding of the matters involved and outlines a sound approach; experience and'demonstrated capabilities of the organisation; the quality of the personnel nominated by the organisation; the proposed timescale; and the adequacy of arrangements for and the level of detail in reports and other documents to be produced. (6) This information is available via the Departmental Annual Reports for the years since 1987-88. (7) It is not possible to forecast what research and development projects the Department will commission in the future. Research and Development Projects (Question No. 1686) , Mr MCGauran asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) What research or research and development projects have (a) public sector research organisations and (b) university research groups undertaken for the Minister's Department since 1983. (2) What was the (a) dollar value and (b) tenn of each project identified in part (1). (3) Was each project identified in part (1) satisfactorily completed against the criteria initially established for evaluating outcomes. (4) What, in summary, were the objectives of each project. (5) Was each project put to open tender; if not, was the prospect of the project being undertaken by private bodies evaluated; if so, how. (6) Have any projects been undertaken through the private sector since 1983; if so, what was the dollar value of each project. (7) Will further projects be undertaken through the public sector; if so, in each case (a) what, in summary, is its objective and (b) will an open tender be sought. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1 to 7) The Defence organisation undertakes a wide range of research and research and development tasks each year to enhance Australian defence capabilities. The main vehicle for this work is the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), which comprises: the AeronautiCal Research' Laboratory, the Electronics Research Laboratory, the Materials Research Laboratory, and the Surveillance Research Laboratory. Further details of DSTO's activities are contained in the annual Defence Report. Details of all consultancy services entered into by Defence-whether with public sector or, private sector organisations are also listed in the Defence Report. The total cost of consultancy services engaged by Defence in 1990/91 was approximately $32 million, DSTO accounting for about $0.86 million of this. To identify and report on every research or research and development project undertaken in Defence since 1983 in the manner requested would be an enonnous task. I am not willing to authorise the diversion of resources from existing priorities within the Department or the Defence Force that would be needed to supply a detailed response to the question. It may be possible, however, to provide more information in response to more focused questions. Honours and Awards (Question No. 1700) Mr Scholes asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 873 (Hansard, 3 September 1991, page 569) concerning the general rule which restricts the awarding of honours to incumbent members of parliament, was a sitting conservative member of parliament listed in the recent Queen's Birthday honours list; if so, why. (2) In the case referred to in part (1), was a higher level of membership accorded to a member of a State parliament than is normally accorded to a holder of office in the national parliament; if so, (a) on what basis and (b) will judges of the High Court and other federal judges be accorded a lower priority than members of State courts.",114
327,Mr KEATING,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Honourable Alan John Hunt AM MLC received the award of Member of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday 1992 Honours for service to the Victorian Parliament. (2) Awards have been made in the Order of Australia to former members of the national Parliament at each of the available levels, and to some sitting members. All awards in the Order will continue to be recommended by the Council for the Order of Australia on the basis of the criteria set down in the Constitution of the Order. Employment: Wages and Superannuation (Question No. 1701) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to claims that employers cannot afford wage increases or superannuation for award workers. (2) Has Mr Ian Spicer and other employers' representatives led major campaigns on the issue referred to in part (1); if so, is the Minister able say if the represented employers cannot afford to pay increased wages or superannuation. (3) Did the employers referred to in part (2) increase their own incomes by an average of 300 per cent more than that experienced by wage earners. (4) Do employers contribute to a large superannuation scheme for Mr Spicer; if so, can they afford to do so.",116
328,Mr WILLIS,VIC SA WA TAS NT TOTAL,"The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. The introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) must be viewed in the context of a prolonged period of wage restraint on the part of wage and salary earners. The SGC will be more than funded by the substantial improvements in productivity which are anticipated to flow from the progression of workplace and labour market reform initiatives and the Government's other structural reforms. In fact, expected productivity gains during the scheduled period cover aggregate contributions several times over. As noted in the Treasurer's press release of 16 May 1992, the impact of the SGC will also be taken into account in any national wage rise in 1992-93, so that it will in no way jeopardise the Accord commitment to achieving wage outcomes which are consistent with maintaining an inflation rate which is comparable with those of our major trading partners. (3) The discipline shown by wage and salary earners is in stark contrast to the excessive increases in executive remuneration during the same period. A recent survey by Noble Lowndes Cullen Egan Dell reveals that total remuneration for managers increased by an average of 5.3 per cent over the year to March 1992. The corresponding figure for senior managers is 7.1 per cent. In comparison, average weekly earnings for wage and salary earners increased by just 2.2 per cent over the year to February 1992. The continued failure of executives to demonstrate restraint similar to that shown by wage and salary earners could have serious implications for the stability of the wages system as the economy moves more strongly into recovery. (4) Details of Mr Ian Spicer's superannuation to scheme are not contained in the Confederation of Australian Industry's 1990-91 Annual Report,so it is only possible to speculate as to the source and magnitude of any such contributions, and whether or not employers can afford them. UNIDO Membership (Question No. 1704) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: Which states (a) denounced, (b) resumed or (c) sought membership of UNIDO during Australia's three years' absence. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: During Australia's three year absence from UNIDO: (a) NIL states denounced membership . (b) NIL states resumed membership (c) NIL states sought membership. 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the (Question No. 1706) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: Further to the answer to question No. 994 (Hansard, 8 October 1991, page 1491), what progress has been made in persuading the USA to support the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As stated in the answer to question No. 994 (Hansard, 8 October 1991, page 1491), Australia has been in direct and regular contact with the United States Government on law of the sea i-ues since 1981 when the House of Representatives conveyed its unanimous resolution on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to the United States Government. That contact has continued since the last time a question was asked on this topic in August 1991. In particular, Australia, the United States and other countries have been participating in consultations chaired by the UN Secretary-General to explore the concerns which certain countries, particularly the United States, have with the deep seabed mining provisions embodied in Part XI of the Law of the Sea Convention. Recently consultations were held in October 1991, December 1991 and June 1992. During the course of these consultations it was acknowledged by all participants, whether from industrialised or developing countries, that global political and economic changes since the adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention in 1982 had raised questions as to the appropriateness of certain aspects of Part This view was embodied in last year's United Nations General Assembly resolution 46/78 on the Law of the Sea. A milestone was achieved in December 1991 when, for the first time, the United States moved from a negative vote to an abstention on this annual resolution. Australia played an active role in the consultations which led to this result. The Australian Government considers that it will be possible to reach an accommodation on Part XI Sea which would enable the United States and others to accede to or ratify the Law of the Sea Convention. This would allow universal participation in the creation of a uniform and binding international legal order for the oceans. Freight (Question No. 1711) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) What was the volume of freight between Melbourne and (a) Perth and (b) Brisbane, in each direction, in (i) tonnes and (ii) number of containers by (A) rail, (B) sea and (C) road in (n 1989, (II) 1990, (III) 1991 and (IV) 1992. (2) Has the method of measuring the weight of container freight by rail changed since 1989. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Estimates provided by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics of the volumes of freight between Melbourne and (a) Perth and (b) Brisbane, in each direction, for 1989 to 1991 are shown in Table 1. Data for 1992 were not available. It appears that there are no estimates available of the numbers of containers transported by sea, road or rail. (2) From information provided by the National Freight Group, Western Australia is the only instant where measurement of interstate freight to/from Perth has changed. Prior to 1 April 1989 freight to/from Western Australia was measured in net mass. (Le. weighed according to contents only). XI. After 1 April 1989 freight was measured in gross mass (Le. weighs both the contents and the container). . Measurement of Melbourne-Brisbane container freight was and still is based on gross mass.
