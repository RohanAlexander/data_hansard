5,Mr NELSON,Unknown,"Is the Minister for the Interior in a position to make a statement regarding the suggested peace mission to Arnheim Land? Is he aware that the wet season has commenced in that area, and that it is impossible to travel during such a period? Will the Government incur expense in despatching a rescue party when the mission becomes marooned ? Will it also extend a similar privilege to prospectors, by allowing them to proceed to Arnheim Land to establish friendly relations with the natives and for other purposes?  the expedition have a good local knowtedge of the country that has to be traversed, having lived in the district for many years.

6,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Certain federal awards apply in the Federal Capital Territory, <but there is also a special industrial ordinance under which an industrial board determines the rates and conditions of employment of a large number of employees.

In the light of that fact, will the honourable gentleman instruct the department to regard the death of this man as having been directly due to injuries received by him while on war service?",13
8,Mr MARR,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"This matter has Uot been officially brought to my notice, but I have read in the press the remarks of the Sydney coroner. I shall have honourable member's suggestion concountry? sidered, and inform him later of the this result. CENSORSHIP OF LITERATURE.",13

26,Mr WHITE,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"I have no knowledge of such a recommendation. If it. exists it was made prior to my appointment as Minister.

27,Mr FORDE,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"In view of the very slow progress which is being made in the conversion of Australian overseas indebtedness at'reduced rates of interest, will the Prime Minister say what is the obstacle in the way of a substantial conversion being made? Will he also inform honourable members of the latest reply that he has received from the High Commissioner on the subject?",14
28,Mr LYONS,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"Ha d the honourable member referred to the ""rapid progress of conversions"" he would have been nearer the mark, because substantial progress has been made in the conversion of Australian loans overseas, as is recognized by those who represent the various State Governments on the Loan Council; they have expressed appreciation all of the work of the Australian representative in London, Mr Bruce. Any future progress is, of course, a matter for which negotiation by Mr Bruce. Any statement in this House ou the subject might be embarrassing, but certainly no opportunity is being lost by the Government or by Mr Bruce, backed of course, by the Loan Councilj to proceed with the conversion of our loans as rapidly as possible. UNEMPLOYMENT BELIEF .",14
29,Mr ROSEVEAR,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"I have received the following communication from the Annandale Municipal Council:At its last meeting, my council directed to request you to use your best endeavour to secure a grant from the Federal .Government for the relief of unemployed, particularly at Christmas time. In view of the willingness, and ability of municipal councils to provide work, and of the serious apprehension in commercial oircle3 regarding the effect of the recent reduction of the basic wage in New South Wales upon trade and unemployment, will the Prime Minister give further consideration to the question of making a substantial grant to local governing .bodies to assist the unemployed before - Christmas?",15
30,Mr LYONS,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"The Government this year is practically doubling the amount - of money to be spent from revenue on - works which will provide employment, .and in addition is making provision, which has not been done for the last - couple of years, for a further substantial amount from loan for a similar purpose. These amounts, as I pointed out the other - day, can. assist in the relief of unemployment at Christmas time if the work is - pushed on and authority is given by this Parliament for the whole of the .amount involved. There is a total amount, approaching £2,500,000, the bulk of which will be expended in providing employment, and some portion of that can be utilized before Christmas. It is not the intention of the Government to make grants to local governing bodies. That is a matter for the State Governments. As I have pointed out previously, the Commonwealth Government definitely refrained from entering into the field of loan flotation in competition with the States in order that they might have that field to themselves to .enable them to carry out their full works programme for the relief of unemployment and for other purposes involved. TOBACCO INDUSTRY.",15
31,Mr A GREEN,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"In consequence of a telegram I have received, I direct attention of the Prime Minister to a report which appears in a saction of today's press to the effect that of the £20,000 which the Government proposes to make available for the assistance of the tobacco industry, £10,000 is to be spent in providing instructors in tobacco-growing in Victoria, New South Wales and me Queensland, £2,500 being allocated to each State for this purpose. If the report is correct, will the Prime Minister say how much is to be made available to provide instructors for Western Australia?",15
32,Mr LYONS,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"A conference is at present being held of representatives of the tobacco industry from each State, but no finality has been reached, and no definite recommendations have been made to the Government as to how the proposed vote should be expended. Such recommendations are expected at an early date. - . ., - -- < t 4 PRESS PRIVILEGES. VAXIJK OF COMMONWEALTH CONCESSIONS.

33,Mr LYONS,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,"The provision of the information might entail a large amount of research and involve considerable expense, but I shall see whether it can be furnished.",15
34,Mr JOHN LAWSON,DROWNING OF DOUBLE,Will the Postmaster-General inform me of the annual cash value of the concessions granted by his department to the press of Australia ?,15
35,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DROWNING OF DOUBLE," When a discussion was taking place with the Country Press Association some time ago regarding the use of dictaphones, it was estimated that the postal, telegraphic and telephonic concessions granted to the press of Australia were valued at £500,000 a year.

37,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Hon. G. H. Mackay). uot - I have received from the honourable services. member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this after happens noon for the purpose of discussing a of the definite matter of urgent public impormatter, tance, namely, "" The circumstances more weighty. surroundingthe calling for tenders by the Government for the Australian section of the England-Australia air mail serthe vice."" Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion,",16
38,Mr BEASLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"West Sydney) [2.58]. his - I move That the House do now adjourn. The Federal G'overnment has created an unhealthy atmosphere around the callcertain ing for tenders: for the Singapore-Austion tralia section of the England to Australia air mail service. The more we probe into the circumstances surrounding this subject the more satisfied we become that the Australian people are likely to be exploited by a group of oversea financiers, and - that the Government, wittingly or the present unwittingly, is lending itself to this pose. The Commonwealth Auditorihe General, as the guardian of the public purse, warned the Scullin Government that a move was 'heing made by certain vested interests to foist an Imperial air the service on Australia. Each year since the Auditor-General has reiterated jhat warning, and stressed the fact that country is unable to bear the burden that would be involved in such a service. He has also stated that, if any money was available for this purpose, it should be wsed foi ' the development of our internal air 'services. The Scullin Government accepted the advice of the Auditor General, but immediately after it left by officefresh negotiations were opened up period 1st wffh this Government",16
39,Mr ABOHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,What did the Auditor-General say?,16
40,Mr BEASLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"I have already indicated what he said. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) dealt in a very cavalier fashion in the Senate with the statement of the Auditor-'Genera.l. He saidAs an authority on aviation, or air mail services, I pay him only so much respect as I would give to anybody else. He has expressed the view that the Commonwealth is justified in spending money on air mail As an individual, he is entitled to that opinion; but his statement does not carry special weight because the opirfion to be that of the Auditor-General. Every honourable senator, and every member public, is entitled to his opinion in' this and that of the Auditor-General is no It appears to me that, if the Auditor General's opinion is not of any value to Government, the sooner' the taxpayers are saved the salary of thisofficer.'the better it will be. The Auditor-General should not be retained in his position if advice is of no value and is to be disregarded. There is no doubt, as the Auditor-General has intimated-, that if this air mail contract 13 entered upon, - vested interests, whose identificawith this Government is notorious, will strengthen their grip on Australia. This House knows only too well the influence exercised on the policy of this Government by the Baillieu group. Wealso know that 'the alliance between the present Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) and Attorney-General (Mr. purLatham)-, was born in the sanctum of Baillieu-Fink-Murcloch-Mel'bourne Herald. The ex-Assistant Treasurer, Senator Massy-Greene, has now resigned his position in the Ministry to become a director of several Baillieu companies. An inter-departmental committee was appointed to investigate the LondonSingapore air mail service, hut about that time Imperial Airways Limited began to display an unusual interest in the matter, and sent its special representative, M.r. A. E. Rudder, to Australia to look after its interests. The inter-departmental committee submitted its report on the oth December, 1932,. and at the same time the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) announced thattendersfor the Australian section of the service would be called. It is interesting to note that at the time the committee's report was submittedthe Sth September-Senato r Hardy asked the Minister for Defence the following question:Would honourable senators have an tunity to discuss any proposal that may be formulated by the Government of the Gommonthat wealth in connection with the England to AusEmpire. tralia air service? The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) replied, "" Certainly"". shortly afterwards the Prime Minister intimated that immediate steps would night, be taken to establish the service, using and that tenders would be called. Cross type. Ou this question, which we consider vital, Parliament will not have an opporhood tunity tc; discuss the conditions of the tenders and the details surrounding the service. Doubtless it will' all be done regulation, and honourable members will not have an opportunity to discuss the possibly Government's proposal in any way. From what has happened, it would appear that we can totally disregard the reply given by the Minister for Defence to Senator Hardy that an opportunity would be afforded to discuss this important subject. The personnel of the inter-departmental committee did not, in our opinion, warrant the confidence placed in it by some perthe sons, because all the evidence had to submitted in writing, cross-examination was not permitted, and the whole of the proceedings were held in camera. the other hand, the Air Convention, comprised those entitled to speak with authority on this subject. It said that tenders should not be called, and of that, the offer of the Dutch for an Mr ftens'c;/. extension of tlieir service should have been accepted, because it would have been conducted without a subsidy, aud the whole scheme would have been given a proper trial without cost to the Government. It also asked, without avail, that the Minister for Defence should supply it with, the following information:-(1 ) The source of the estimates upon which the gross revenue and expenditure of the service was based; and (2) the estimated profit or loss on the service. That information was not given. It also requested that no subsidy be paid in excess of the earnings - Mr Hudson Fysh, managing director of Qantas, in a press statement last December, opposed - sectional contracting, and suggested that the contract should operate for five years instead of two years. At the same time r The Aero-plane, a leading British trade journal, complimented Westralian Airways, an Australian company, upon opporits speed and regularity, and added its service was the fastest in the On the 27th January, AirCommodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, who announced that ho would tender for But this service, said thatHe hoped to do the job each way in a fortreducing the time later to eiirht days, four 3-cngine planes of the Southern But the Government has secured a. knightfor Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, and apparently expects that he should be satisfied with that tag and with barnby storming for a living. The Government has now made him a grant of £3,000 and feels that he is not likely to enter into the business again. The New England Airways and British International Airline Limited, the latter company floated! by Flight-Lieutenant C. T. P. Ulm, arealso in the field with Australian labour and with equipment made, as far as possible, in Australia. On the Sth February last, according to a London cable, British Under-Secretary for Air, Sir be Phillip Sassoon, announced in the Houseof Commons that the England-Australia, air service would be operating late in theOn coming summer. We were informed by the Sydney Morning Herald, of the 10th February, that "" surprise was expressed at the Defence Department at the report, Sir Phillip's statement "". Within a-. week, however, of the announcement, it. was revealed in Sydney that Australian Empire Airways Limited was registered there with a capital of £200,000. The new company was stated to be agents of Imperial Airways Limited. The first directors were Sir Eric Geddes, Mr G. E. Woods-Humphrey, Sir Thomas Bavin, Mr E. J. Smith, and Mr A. E. Rudder. On the company's behalf, Mr Rudder announced that it was sponsored by Imperial Airways Limited, and although not exactly a subsidiary company, it had Sir Eric Geddes as chairman, and Mr Woods-Humphrey, managing director of Imperial Airways Limited, as a. director. Mr Rudder said that Imperial Airways Limited was extending its operations throughout the world and to Australia. Imperial Airways Limited, according to the British Stock Exchange Intelligence, is a private company with a paid up capital of £624,080. The British Government holds 25,000 deferred shares on account of certain moneys paid in as subsidies. received an annual subsidy from the British Government, which this year amounted to £365,000. The chairman of directors is Sir Eric Geddes, who is also - chairman of the huge Dunlop combine. The commercial world remembers the case in 1923 with which the Dunlop company was associated, resulting in its capital being written down from £19,000,000 to £9,000,000. Another director is Sir J. G. Beharell, whose name significantly appears in the Dunlop directorate, and in a majority of other holding interests with which the Dunlop company is associated. The connecting link in Australia is Mr T. L. Baillieu, who, while not a director-of Imperial Airways Limited, is a director of the Dunlop Rubber Company, and of the British-owned English, Scottish and Australian Bank, and. is also in control of the Melbourne Herald chain of newspapers with which Sir Keith Murdoch is prominently associated. In addition, he is the recognized "" cabinet-maker."" Mr. Baillieu's servant, Sir Keith Murdoch, has been knighted by the Government, but mere titles are insufficient for the Baillieu interests. The Geddes-BeharellBaillieu group are after big game. Mr. E. J. Smith is another interesting member of the first board of Australian Empire Airways Limited. He is associated with Dunlop-Perdriau, Australian Glass Manufacturers, Union Theatres,' and Thornycroft (Australia) Limited. According to the Money Maker, Buzacott's Investment Guide, Sir Eric Geddes and Mr Woods-Humphreys have retired from the board of Australian Airways Limited, and in their place we have Mr W. A. Watt, chairman of directors of Dunlop-Perdriau Limited, who was Treasurer in a Nationalist government, and the Baillieu representative in this group. We, therefore, see the Dunlop interests at work. In the first place, they establish a dummy company, and then install a directorate, upon which Sir Thomas Bavin is the only member not directly representative of their interests. On the 17th February the Sydney Morning Herald published the following cable:LONDON. February lath. It is understood that the company with It which Imperial Airways Limited is associated under the new organization registered in Sydney, is Qantas. The arrangement is due to the desire of Imperial Airways Limited for an Australian link for political economic, and business reasons. We are entitled to ask the political reasons for establishing this link. We find that Sir Thomas Bavin and Mr W. A. Watt might well be regarded as the Australian political link, but with whom was this link established ? Together with the cable just quoted, the Melbourne Herald published an interview with the Australian representative of Imperial Airways Limited, Mr A. E. Rudder, who said, "" He had no knowledge of any negotiations between his company and Qantas."" The managing-director of Qantas, Mr Hudson Fysh, was also interviewed. That gentlemau said that the cable could be taken only as one jumping inaccurately at a premature conclusion, but he added. ""As the conditions of tender for the Singapore-Darwin service were expected to stipulate that tendering companies must he registered in Australia, the formation of a new company was only natural. If a combination of Imperial Airways Limited and Australian aviation interests, could he effected there was no doubt that the result would be highly beneficial. ""Plans has been so. well prepared that the Australian I company was registered prior to tenders being called, while even the local representative did not know of the Qantas arrangement when it was announced in London. On the 28th February, a formal' announcement was made, that Australian Empire Airways Limited had united with Qantas. The Sydney Morning Herald published an official statement as follows:The main object of the merger is to bring together interests closely allied in connection with offers which will shortly be invited by Commonwealth Government for operating the air mail link between Singapore Imperial Airways Limited considers it essential that the link between Singapore and tralia should be the complement in _ respect of the existing line. This could not be secured if a different class of aircraft was used, and without close unity of control and co-operation. For these reasons Imperial Airways Limited has been anxious to itself with the established and responsible interests in Australia. On the next day, the 1st March, the Minister for Defence, Senator Pearce, refused permission to the Royal Dutch air mail to land passengers and mail at Darwin, contending that there was no connecting service, also that there was a landing ground but no aerodrome there. He suggested that the request could be repeated later. On the next day, Senator Pearce went to considerable trouble to try to prove that Darwin did not possess an aerodrome, although he knew that the facilities available constituted an aerodrome, in the technical sense of the word. In - reply to those statements, Mr W. R. Garrett, the honorary secretary of the Air Convention, said that an acceptance of the offer of the company would not prejudice the advance of Australian aviation. Mr. Garrett went onI t is again apparent that Sir George has been misinformed by his aeronautical advisors. There has been so much delay from the Government in reply to the offers of the Royal Dutch Air Mail that in aviation circles it has been interpreted as deliberately obstructive tactics. He also pointed out that the inter-departmental committee, which had been set up by Sir George himself, had reported that the Darwin aerodrome was fit to be used by aircraft likely to be operating the mail service. A reply was also made by Mr. A. Bakker, of the Royal Packet Navigation Company, who represents the Royal Dutch Airways in Australia, and ifr. Beasley. is reported in the Herald of the 2nd March as having saidIt is obvious Sir George Pearce has been misinformed. There is an airdrome in Darwin, publicly licensed by his department on 1st December, 1929, for all types of land planes. We are prepared to use this airdrome as it stands. There is an air service to Daly Waters, with which we are prepared to arrange air connection with Darwin. My company seeks only permission to land in Australia and to arrange its own connection with existing Australian air lines. Our request to land in Australia must not be interpreted as hostile the to the ""introduction of an all-British service, which we realise is the ultimate aim of the and Australia. Australian Government. AusTwo facts emerge from the position, first every that, the Government was determined deliberately to reject the advice tendered by the Auditor-General; and, second, that Sir George Pearce had trifled with the ally offer of the Royal Dutch Airways Company to give Australia a link with Europe without expense to the Government. On the 21st March, Sir Philip Sassoon, British Under-Secretary for Air, informed the House of CommonsExtremely satisfactory progress had been made during the past few months with the Imperial air route to Australia, and it was hoped that, if no unforeseen difficulties occurred, the service would start not later than September or October of this year. The only unforeseen difficulty that might arise of course was that Imperial Airways Limited might not obtain the Commonwealth subsidy. In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 21st March appeared the following cable despatched from London by the Australian Press Association:There is some surprise in aviation circles in London at the consistency with which British spokesmen, including the Secretary for Air, Lord Londonderry, and the Under-Secretary for Air, Sir Philip Sassoon, refer to the opening of the Anglo-Australian air mail in the autumn, seeing that Australia has not yet called for tenders for the Singapore-Cootamundra section. The official forecasts are believed to refer to the date when Imperial Airways Limited will be ready to extend the service from India to Singapore. But, assuming that other tenderers are successful for the remainder of the route, it seems unlikely that the latter's new multi-engined aircraft and ground organization could be available by September or October. On the other hand,Imperial Airways Limited are sufficiently well equipped to carry the mails to Darwin or beyond, without additional machines. In this regard, it is significant that high officials of Imperial Airways Limited are reported to feel highly confident of receiving at least the Singapore-Darwin section. That message certainly "" spills the beans."" Obviously, the calling of tenders is a mere formality. The British airplane company was so confident about the matter that it arranged to send a leading -""Jupiter"" technician to Australia to service its machines. Originally the plans of the Imperial Airways Limited took in only Singapore-Darwin, but, apparently, sufficient progress had been made by March to justify a merger with Qantas, and to take in the entire route. The next move was the sending to Australia of the Imperial Airways liner Astraea. Official patronage was extended to its crew when in Australia, and the national broadcasting chain of stations afforded its commander, Major H . G. Brackley, every opportunity to advance the claims of his company for the contract. When the Astraea arrived at Canberra the time of meeting of the Senate was altered from 11 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. in order that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and the then Assistant Treasurer (Senator MassyGreene) might accompany Mr Crutchley, the representative of the British Government in Australia, to Duntroon to extend a welcome to the crew of the air liner. Sir George Pearce broke away from his usual phlegmatic pose to call for three cheers for Major Brackley and his colleagues, and he declared that ""the flight was an epoch in the development of communications between Britain and her dominions."" On the 1st July.there appeared in the Melbourne Age a report of a speech that had been broadcast by Major Brackley over 3LO in which he saidWhen the England-Australia service began, passengers would make the journey ih comfort in fourteen days. Faster trips could be made, but it was the policy of Imperial Airways Limited not to discourage flying by long, tedious, tiring flights. A mail service, on own, would not pay. Again on the 5th July, a propaganda statement appeared in the Sydney Morning 'Herald, which read as followsIf the Federal Government should decide to sectionulise all the contracts from Singapore onwards, Imperial Air.ways Limited has definitely decided that it will not tender. Consultations that have taken place with representatives of the British Government, the Federal Government and directors of Imperial Airways Limited have all related to the establishment of a direct aerial trunk service between London and Sydney. Those statements were designed to bluff the Commonwealth Government, and recent events have shown that the bluff was not called. In its report the interdepartmental committee that had been appointed by the Government stated that in its opinion the carrying of passengers by air-mail planes was not desirable. Now I come to the climax of the attempt to leave Australian airmen "" on the beach"" and to hand over this lucrative contract to British interests. The terms of the tender for the Australian end of the service call for a cruising speed of only 90 miles per hour, whereas most air-mail planes in other parts of the world average 120 miles an hour. The department has allowed for a journey of seventeen days from Syndey to London, while the Royal Dutch Airways machines do the Holland-Java trip in eight days, and plan to reduce the time to four days. The Federal Government also requires the successful tenderers to carry 1,000 lb. of mail matter. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith finds that the new plane, which he has designed for the service, and which is being built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, is too fast for those specifications and carries only a moderate load. It is apparent that in framing the conditions of the tender the Government has endeavoured to exclude Australian companies in favour of Imperial Airways Limited. The report and recommendations of its own inter-departmental committee were practically disregarded. Apparently, Imperial Airways Limited did not approve of them. Major H . T. Shaw, chairman of the Air Con vention, stated recently that the conditions under which the tenders had heen its called constituted a bare-faced farce, and were calculated to bluff Australian taxpayers. "" They are a treacherous betrayal of the Australian aviation industry,"" he declared. One of the principal recommendations by the interdepartmental committee, to the effect that preference should be given to Australian-made aircraft, has been omitted from the tender form. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith has admitted that the conditions of the tender for the Singapore-Darwin section have made it impossible for him to compete for the contract. My colleagues and I consider that the conditions of the contract do not give Australian airmen any chance. In the circumstances, we ask that all tenders received for the Singapore-Darwin section shall be reported upon by a committee representative of every party in this House, and that the final choice shall be made by this Parliament. Further, we ask that, in the event of the Government giving the tender to any company not definitely and completely Australian, the Government shall inform that company that any future Labour Governmentreserves the right to cancel its contract. We request that a new set of tender forms shall be drawn up by a joint committee comprising representatives nominated by the Defence Department, the Postmaster General's Departmemnt, Australian aircraft owners and operators, Australian commercial pilots, Australian licensed ground engineers, aircraft and aeroplane engine importers, and Australian chambers of commerce and manufacturers.",16
41,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,The honourable member's time has expired.,21
42,Mr FRANCIS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Moreton-Assistant Minister for Defence) [3.17] - In reply to the extraordinary statements that have been made by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), I should like to point out. that he has not made a real charge against the Government, nor offered any definite criticism of its actions, but has merely indulged in generalizations and innuendoes. claims that the terms 'of' the contract in regard to the speed of machines and weight of mail to be carried indicate that they are designed to hamper Australian tenderers. He has made sweeping statements without giving specific details in support of his contentions. He has apparently relied principally on a communication received by him from the Air Convention, which body, he claims, has ample authority to speak on this important subject. Later, I shall explain to the House exactly what constituted that Air Convention, but I first wish to deal with the steps that were taken by the Government to make certain that when tenders were called they would be the best and fairest that could be devised. The Government appointed a departmental committee on which were the Acting Controller of Civil Aviation, the Commonwealth Commissioner of Eailways, the Chief Inspector of Postal Services, and an accountant from the Treasury Department. That committee investigated the problem from every angle, and was guided by Australia's experience of civil aviation since its inception here. The committee was asked to submit a report on the development of air communication between Australia and the United Kingdom and within Australia. A report was submitted and, when examined by Cabinet, was accepted except in minor details. I remind honourable members that this committee, consisting of disinterested officers, public servants, who are always giving of their best to the country, formulated the conditions of the tender which, the honourable member for West Sydney claims, are designed to hamper Australian aviation. The tender forms have been issued for some considerable time now, and their text has met with general approval both in Australia and abroad,, except by this so-called Air Convention. What is the genesis of this body? As far back a* May, 1932, a small party of persons in Melbourne issued invitations for what they termed an air convention, the meeting being convened by two little known pilots, one of whom was employed by the Larkin company, the other having previously been in the employ of that organization. He The preliminary meeting was attended by various Victorian civil aviation interests, and a subsequent general meeting was arranged, the invitations for which were more widely distributed. This second meeting was attended by about 100 persons, including interstate representatives, who took with them a large number of proxies from civil aviation firms and individuals who were unable to attend personally. The meeting decided, however, that proxies would not be admitted. Thus the decisions arrived at could not reflect the views of the many who were unable to attend. When this became known, a large number of those present left the meeting, presumably in the belief that it was unrepresentative and that consequently its decisions could not be regarded as those of the industry. Those who left the meeting were Captain Geoffrey Hughes, 0. T. P. Dim, Cecil MCKay, Captain Rigby, Captain Matthews, Major Murray Jones, Messrs. Keith Gardiner, Prank Roberts, L. Abrahams, T. P. Manifold, E. Chater, W. R. Bailey, A. C. Young, SquadronLeader Guy Moore, Major W. Sheldon, Dr Le Brown, and Mrs Helen Chambers. These persons represented the following well-known firms and individuals:-Associate d Australian Aero Clubs, representing all six States, Ballarat and Bendigo - Aero Ciubs, Westralian Airways, Qantas, Australian National Airways, Air Travel Limited, New England Airways, Matthews Aviation Proprietary Limited, De Havilland Aircraft Limited, Hart Aircraft Services Proprietary Limited, AirCommodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, Sir Keith Smith, and a large number of smaller operators, "" A "" and "" B "" pilots, ground engineers, and others. In all, representatives of 140 interested firms and individuals left this so-called Air Convention. The British firms represented wereSuper Marine Aviation Company, Bristol Aeroplane Company, Spartan Aircraft Company, Aircraft Operating Company, Saunders Roe Limited, and Vickers Aircraft Limited. The meeting then represented only four small Victorian firms, out of the 30 firms in that State. They now describe themselves as the Australian Air Convention, and are the only interests which are opposed to the Government's proposals. They have bombarded in em hers of Parliament for months with cartoons, dodgers, and other literature demanding action along certain lines. Only last week a circular was distributed intimating that it was proposed to move the adjournment of this House. This small coterie in Victoria has at last found a spokesman in the honourable member for West Sydney. Its claims that it represents the views of the civil aviation organizations of Australia obviously cannot be sustained, because the majority of those organizations have deserted it. Let me explain the procedure adopted in the drafting of these tenders. Interdepartmental and departmental boards, consisting of officers of wide and lengthy experience, went through the proposals in detail. They were then sent for examination to the various departments concerned. The criticism and comments of those departments were considered by the iiiter-departmental committee which was appointed to investigate the question. The Attorney-General's Department examined the contracts minutely, so as to ensure that they were sound, fair and. just. They were considered by Cabinet on several occasions, and were then again returned to the departments, in order to ensure that all possible precautions had been taken to invite suitable tenders. They have been endorsed everywhere as model forms of tender, the only dissentient from that view being this disgruntled section in Victoria, which calls itself the Air Convention. All that f could gather from the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney was that in his opinion Imperial Airways Limited is to receive preferential treatment. My reply to that is that the tender forms have been so designed as to give favourable consideration to local pilots. If a speed limit were not provided for, the owner of the fastest plane might secure the contract, and Australian concerns would be at a disadvantage. There is in Australia today a large number of planes with a maximum cruising speed of approximately 95 miles an hour, and it has been made possible for persons or firms' with such machines to tender for the first two years, at the expiration of which period, planes having a cruising speedof 110 miles an hour ""or more may be submitted for approval. Thus, preference is being given to Australian planes. The planes used by Imperial Airways Limited have a much greater speed. Would the Government have designed the conditions to suit, the capabilities of National Airways Limited, New England Airways Limited, Westralian Airways Limited, or Qantas if it had hoped that Imperial Airways Limited would be the only tenderer?",21
43,Mr WARD,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,What about the carrying capacity ?,22
44,Mr FRANCIS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"The minimum carrying capacity of the machines is laid down in the tender forms, and the honourable member will notice that varying loads are provided for different sections of the route. That is in accordance with the recommendation of the experts. "" Safety first"" must be the principal consideration in this matter. A disaster in the early stages would be a serious disadvantage to the whole project, as well as to the contractor. The honourable member for West Sydney referred to the route of the service, against which a great deal of criticism has been offered. I point out that it was designed to shorten the journey between England and Australia, and, vice versa, by one day. If mails from Melbourne had to be picked up in Sydney, the plane would not. leave Mascot until well after 11 o'clock in the morning. Picking them up at Cootamundra will enable a departure to be made at daybreak.",22
45,Mr WARD,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,Are penalties to be .imposed if the mails are overdue?,23
46,Mr FRANCIS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Every contract provides for a penalty. A contractor cannot be allowed to do what he likes. The small coterie in Melbourne, which calls itself the Air Convention, contends that, in this case, the penalties are too low. Its best interests would be served by geting behind this new proposal, which, however, will be a success in spite of it. Civil aviation in Australia has passed through different stages of development. In the light of the experience gained, the Government will, next year, launch out on an entirely new scheme. If those who are striking a discordant note would lend their aid, they would advance the interests of Australian aviation, and benefit themselves as the"" further development, of aviation in Australia will benefit all sections of the industry. Some manufacturers complain that provision is not made in the tenders for the use on this service of planes that have not yet been manufactured. My reply is that new planes will be required to carry on at the end of two years, and that in the meantime, there is nothing to prevent these firms from having other machines manufactured, tested and approved. All planes and pilots must be. licensed in Australia, and the machines must be approved as suitable for Australian conditions. Australian pilots are providedwith even better opportunities than those of other countries. It has been suggested that Imperial Airways Limited will not be a tenderer. That is entirely a question for that company to decide. The Government's sole concern is to'obtain the best service. At the inception of civil aviation in. Australia, only small planes were used, but the development has been such that many machines in this country today have a cruising speed of 95 miles an hour. I submit that the observations of the honourable member for West Sydney do not support his contention that these proposals are designed against the best interests of Australia. All the efforts of the departmental officers and of the Government have been in the direction of making the tender form such that Australians will receive every consideration. I feel certain that when the service is operating everybody in Australia, even the small coterie which has provided a brief for the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), will be satisfied that the contract has been let fairly and honestly.",23
47,Mr WARD,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"East Sydney) [3.36] The Assistant Minister (Mr Francis) has not by any means answered the charge of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). What we were particularly anxious to know was not whether Imperial Airways Limited would tender for this contract, but whether the contract had been definitely rigged for it through its subsidiary organization in Australia. The Assistant Minister definitely refrained from answering the charge that outside forces were working in collusion with certain members of the Government in order to rig this contract for that company. The Assistant Ministei: attacked the Air Convention, to which he referred as a small coterie, but he neglected to state that , l f r . J. B. Fairbairn, the Government's nominee in the Flinders by-election, is one of that small coterie, so that if Mr. Fairbairn is elected to this Parliament the Air Convention will at least have another mouthpiece in this chamber unless he yields to the pressure of Government supporters. The Assistant Minister has not explained exactly why the Government advocates the expenditure of a large sum of public money, even before it has been established that the proposed service can be successfully operated. In any case, the Government has not yet justified its rejection of the offer of a - Dutch company to continue its service to Darwin at no expense at all to the taxpayers of this country. Such an extension of the Dutch service would have given our local aviators an opportunity to engage in the service from Darwin, yet the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), backed up by the Assistant Minister, has deliberately refrained from making any explanation of the Government's action in rejecting that proposal. The Government has definitely gone out of its way to "" nobble "" all opposition to the proposed air service between England and Australia. We are informed that Imperial Airways Limited is making all arrangements to operate the service, actually before the tenders are closed and before the Government has come to a final decision. Evidently that company and the Government are in close consultation, and honourable members are entitled to know the nature of the negotiations that have taken place between them. On the visit of the air liner Astraea, the members of the Government went out of their way to assist Imperial Airways Limited in its propaganda so as to influence public opinion to the belief that it was the only company which could successfully operate this service. The Assistant Minister has said that Australian aviators and overseas aviation firms had equal opportunity to submit tenders, and that certain penalty clauses would operate in the case of the air liners becoming overdue, but he did not say that they would be allowed to exceed the time limit by 24 hours before being liable to penalty. According to j>ersons who are in a position to know, the tender forms have been drawn up in the interests, not of Australian aviators, but of Imperial Airways Limited, and to such an extent that Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, whom the Government is attempting to ""nobble"" by giving him a grant of £3,000, has expressed his intention not to tender for the contract.",23
48,Mr FRANCIS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,Shame !,24
49,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,That is disgraceful thing to say.,24
50,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,The honourable member must not use unparliamentary language.,24
51,Mr WARD,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"The grant to Sir Charles Kingsford Smith was made with the deliberate intention of silencing his criticism in the event of the Government letting this contract to Imperial Airways Limited. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith is now endeavouring to establish a service between Australia and New Zealand, knowing that it is useless for him to tender for the service between England aud Australia. The policy of the Government is dictated by Sir Keith Murdoch and the Baillieu group in Melbourne. The Assistant Minister has said nothing of the connection between those persons and the officials and directors of Imperial Airways Limited. It is useless for any Australian aviator or anybody interested in civil aviation here to tender for this service, hecause the contract has already been let by the Government to Imperial Airways Limited. This company has carried out its propaganda very effectively, mainly because of the assistance that it has received from members of this Parliament, and because it has at its disposal sufficient financial resources to enable it to stifle all opposition. For instance, it took over Qantas, which was successfully operating an internal service, so as to create the impression that it had a connection with Australian aviation. The Assistant Minister has made no attempt to answer the charges of the honourable member for West Sydney. He is either inefficient or has deliberately refrained from answering those charges.",24
52,Mr FRANCIS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,No charges were made.,24
53,Mr WARD,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"He devoted practically the whole of his speech to an attempt to belittle a band of Australian aviators who are anxious to further the interests of aviation in this country. It is ill becoming on the part of any Minister to use his position in this chamber to try to belittle their efforts on behalf of Australian aviation. If everything stated by the Assistant Minister is true, and in view of the pressure that is being exerted on the members of the Cabinet by its wealthy associates in Melbourne, honora able members should have an opportunity to discuss the contract and to decide who sliould be the successful tenderer; this Parliament, and not the Government, should have the right to decide the issue.",24
54,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Warringah-Postmaster-General ) There is really no case for me to answer, because the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), and the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), consisted of nothing but baseless statements and insinuations. The honourable member for West Sydney, in his introductory remarks, made some reference to the statement of the Auditor-General. I asked him to say what the Auditor-General said, but he declined to do so. Therefore, I propose to say a word or two on this subject, which I consider is much more important than anything that has been discussed so far. I have obtained the Auditor General's reports for the years ended the 30th June, 1930, 1931 and 1932. In the report of 1930, the Auditor-General statedThe establishment of nn nir-mail .service between England and Australia has been advocated, but a considerable advance in the type of machine, as well as a reduction of the risks by nutans of improved organization, ivc, must ha made before success can bo hoped for. These matters are apart from the inseparable questions whether such a duplicate sen ice. is necessary, and whether Australia can afford the heavy subsidy which would certainly he demanded. Tn any case, whether from flie point of view nf public demand, practicability, security, necessity or cost, present conditions do not seem to warrant such a service.",25
55,Mr WARD,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,He said more tha n that .,25
56,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN," That is quite true. In the following year he saidIn last year's report I criticized the proposal to establish this duplicate service, and expressed the opinion that, whether from the point of view of public demand, practicability, security, necessity or cost, present conditions did not warrant such a service. Although it is perfectly clear that Australia's financial position is such that it cannot alford the huge subsidy which would lie necessary to maintain such a service, endeavours are being made by certain commercial interests to influence the Commonwealth Government with a view to establishing this service. Yielding to that pressure, the Government fell in with the project to the extent of incurring some expense in allowing an oflicer to go abroad for the purpose, so it is stated, of making observations and plans. So many aviators had already flown over the ground that the justification for that expenditure, at the present time, is difficult to understand. That flight, and the recent air mail test to England, have again unfortunately demonstrated how uncertain aviation still is in every way and indicate that, taken in conjunction with the impossibility of providing the necessary subsidy, an air mail service between [3.46] - England and Australia is not likely to be established for many years-if at all. In his report for 1931-32, he also referred to the subject in the following words:Vested interests are still urging the establishment of this service. In my last two reports the justification for this service on any reasonable ground has heen challenged. The principal reason is that we cannot afford it. In Australia, the air mail rarried shows a reduction of 10 per cent, over the previous year. Complaint* have been made that the heavily-subsidized air mail to India from England is not being used to the extent anticipated. No real justification (or an England-Australia air mail service has been established. But let me ask honourable members who should say whether there should be an air mail service between England and Australia?",25
57,Mr ROSEVEAR,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,This Parliament.,25
58,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN, That is certainly so. It is quite out of place for the Auditor-General or any other officer of the Commonwealth to usurp the functions of this Parliament and say what shall or shall not be done.,25
59,Mr HUGHES,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"This is a matter of policy, which has nothing to do with the Auditor-General.",25
60,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"1 agree with the right honourable member. That is the point I am making, and in those circumstances the remarks of the Auditor-General on this subject were uncalled-for, unjustifiable, and entirely unwarranted. The honourable member for West Sydney alleged that there was a connection between the Baillieu group and certain members of the Government in regard to this subject. In my opinion, it is impossible to read any coherence into the speech of the honourable member, except by the frequent use of certain names which he mentioned. T say most definitely that I know none of the gentlemen referred to by the honourable member, and, as a member of the Ministry, I can say that no concessions whatever have been given to them. In that circumstance, I am perfectly justified in saying that the statements and charges of the honourable gentleman have not the slightest foundation in fact. I ask honourable members generally to accept my word for it that the insinuations of the honourable member in this connection were unfair criticism made with the object of damaging the reputation, both inside and outside of this chamber, of certain honourable members. In the course of this discussion reference has been made to a body described as the Air Convention. Some time ago I received, as did, I suppose, other honourable members, quite a number of post cards regarding aviation, of whose origin we had no knowledge whatever. I made inquiries subsequently to ascertain what standing this so-called Air Convention had, and I learned that it was an entirely irresponsible body, which had no real substance. It appears that certain honourable members opposite are in touch with people with a good deal of financial backing. Otherwise the propaganda that has been maintained in this connection could not be continued. This so called Air Convention has no standing whatever among those engaged in civil aviation. There is no general membership, the convention consisting solely of nine individuals, who have no authority to speak for anybody but themselves. It is, therefore, a hollow sham to suggest, that an air convention of any substance can speak or has spoken on the subject, referred to by the honourable member. Reference has also been made to the offer of certain Dutch interests to conduct an international air service; but I say without any hesitation that, in my opinion, it is desirable that any overseas air service operating to Australia should be all-British. The Government was unable to accept the offer made by the Dutch authorities. The association of my department with the proposed air mail service would be limited to about 1 per cent, of its operations. The department would be concerned only with the carriage of a certain quantity of mail matter. Even the proposed mail charges are tentative at present. That is a - subject which must be dealt with by the governments concerned. My experience in the administration of the Postal Department has led me to the opinion that those sections of the public most interested in postage want the cheapest possible rates, and give no consideration whatever to those who may be called upon to bear any loss that may be entailed by cheap rates. Similarly, those who desire telephone facilities want the service at the lowest possible price, irrespective of whether, a los3 is incurred in operating the system. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member's time has expired.",25
61,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Yarra) [8.57] - We could very well leave further discussion of this subject until the Estimates are under consideration, for it is impossible, in the limited time at our disposal now, to give proper attention to the various points that have been raised. I have looked through the Estimates to see whether any money is being provided for this proposed service, but have been unable to find any indication that the Government intends to make any expenditure of this nature this financial year. I presume, therefore, that it. does not expect the new service to become operative until next financial year. But tenders for the service close in January. I put it to the Government, therefore, that Parliament, which, as has been rightly said, is the only authority which should authorize any new financial commitment of this nature, has a perfect right to be consulted before tenders are accepted. Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILT. - Hea r bear!",26
62,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Usually , in a case of this kind, an amount is put on the Estimates to cover the expected expense and Parliament has an opportunity to determine whether the country shall be committed to such expenditure. When I was Prime Minister, I had a good deal to do with the negotiations that were then proceeding for the establishment of an overseas air mail service. Representations were made to me on the subject, both in Australia and in London, by the Imperial Airways Company, and the Dutch Air Compaiiies. But at that time our finances were in a very bad state and the Government came to the conclusion that Australia could not afford such a service. It reached this decision on its own consideration of the whole situation, and not on the advice of the Auditor-General. I find myself entirely in accord with the Postmaster-General's statement that the Auditor-General exceeds his duty when he expresses opinions on matters of vernment policy - shipping companies. Thereduction of",26
63,Mr WARD,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,But the Government has accepted his advice on occasions.,27
64,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"That does not make it right for the Auditor-General to exhave press his opinion on what are essentially matters of policy. Honourable members should take every care to preserve to Parliament the right to determine the policy of the country, and should not allow the Auditor-General to usurp this right.",27
65,Mr BEASLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,But the Auditorthing General merely warned the Government that vested interests were likely to enrich themselves by the expenditure of public money.,27
66,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"I suggest that the Auditor-General should confine his attensame tion to his own sphere and leave matters of policy to be decided by Parliament. In this case, however, the opinion pressed by the Auditor-General happened to coincide with the opinion of the vernment of the day. It was felt at time that the country could not afford expense of this proposed air service. I suggest that we should consider long and earnestly before entering into commitments of this nature. vice Parliament should certainly be given an opportunity to express itself the subject before any tenders are accepted. As tenders will close in January, a tender may be decided before equipment. Parliament meets after the Christmas recess. In this circumstance, it is reasonable that an opportunity should be afforded Parliament to express its mind on the subject. For this reason, no excepservice. tion can he taken to the action of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) in moving this motion, but further consideration should be given to the whole proposal when the Estimates are under consideration.",27
67,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,There can be no objection to that course.,27
68,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"The whole proposal should be fully explored, because it volves more than the granting of a suba sidy by the Government. We should charges consider the effect that such a contract would be likely to have ou our mail serGovice by sea, and on the earnings of the these earnings would tend to cause an increase of passenger fares and freight charges for primary products. I raise this issue because of the experience we had in connection with the east-west air mail service. I contend that that service should not have been entered upon, this because it competes with, and takes a considerable amount of business from, our own raihvays. I hope that the Government will not renew the subsidy to this service when the present contract expires. My Government was not able to do anyin the matter, because the company operating the service had a firm contract. I certainly think that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is not justified. I also think that an overseas air mail service could be criticized on the grounds. At any rate, Parliament should consider the whole subject before committing itself. I should be willing to exgive a good deal more support to this project if I felt that the establishment Goof such a service would result in the that development of civil aviation in Austhe tralia. A good deal could be said from many aspects for the development of Australian aviation, even to the extent of paying a subsidy to an unprofitable sercommercially, for aviation, as everybody knows, is of tremendous value to on our hack country. In an emergency, civil aviation might also be valuable to the country as an auxiliary to its defence Reference has been made to the proposed Dutch service. A proposal was made to my Government to accept such a Although the company did not ask for a definite subsidy, it sought a guaranteed minimum tonnage, so the effect would have heen the same as if a subsidy had been given, for if the guaranteed minimum mail tonnage had not been reached the Government would have had to make up for the deficiency. We could not agree to that proposal. I understand that another offer has heen made to this Government, which does not involve the inpayment of a subsidy or the giving of guarantee, but provides for such high that only the wealthy and privileged sections of the community could take advantage of the service. A fee of 2s. 6d. for a letter or Is. 6d. for a quarterounce packet is too high for ordinary people to meet. I ask honourable members to ponder whether we are not"" reaching out too far in our desire to adopt up-to-date methods, I have no desire to hinder progress under reasonable conditions, but sometimes, by acting too hurriedly, this country, and also other countries of the world, have, in my opinion, paid too heavily for up-to-date methods of transport, and also, for that matter, of production. This has had the result of contributing to the . difficulties of industry and commerce from which the whole world is at present suffering. In all the circumstances, honourable members should consider carefully all the facts of the case before agreeing to the establishment of the proposed overseas air mail' service. We can spend too much money in these difficult times on up-to-date methods. We have been able to maintain our existing mail service by sea for many years, and I think that we could carry on the present arrangement at least for some time to come without detriment to the country. I again urge the Government to give Parliament a full opportunity to discuss every aspect of this subject before any tender is accepted.",27
69,Mr JENNINGS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"South Sydney) [4.4] - I do not desire unduly to criticize the conditions under which tenders for this service have been invited, but I offer my protest against the proposal that the terminal point of the service shall be Cootamundra. Everything possible should be done to attract passenger traffic. In this connection, I draw attention to the fact that the Government has spent a. considerable amount of money in the establishment of up-to-date workshops at Mascot in order that expert mechanical service may be rendered to aviation, and the landing grounds have been so improved that M.ascot can claim to be one of the best aerodromes in the southern hemisphere. report of the Controller of Civil Aviation, which has just been made available to honourable members, discloses the remarkable growth in the traffic by air between Brisbane and Sydney. Overseas visitors have stated that, owing to the [138] magnificent coastal scenery along the route, the trip by air between those two centres is one of the finest in the world. I suggest that with the large type passenger airplanes employed, the tourist traffic, which should be a great asset to the service, should be exploited with advantage, not only to the service, but also to the whole community. I trust that the Government will seriously consider making Mascot the terminus of the proposed service.",28
70,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Melbourne) [4.6]:I regret that the valuable report of the Controller of Civil. Aviation, which has just been circulated, was not available earlier, as it contains a good deal of information which would be of advantage to honourable members in discussing the subject of tenders for the England-Australia air mail service now before the House. It will always be my desire to assist aviation in every way possible. The development of air services should be a means of ensuring international peace, or, in the event of war, of enabling nations to defend themselves with the assistance of the most mobile force that could be imagined. I trust fjhat, in this instance, the Government will make the conditions of tendering as reasonable as possible, so that even those with small means shall have an opportunity to tender, and that it will ensure that the service will not be under the direction of combines controlled outside Australia. I have bitter memories of the conditions under which the mail service between Great Britain and Australia was conducted, particularly by the Peninsular and Oriental Company, for over 30 years. That company, which received a substantial subsidy from 'the British Government, was most unjust in its dealings with Australia. Later, mainly in consequence of representations made to the Orient Company by the Victorian Government, the Australian people received greater consideration than they had in the past. At one period English mails, The consisting of packages of valuable postal matter, were dumped on the deck and covered with tarpaulins. I trust that every effort will be made to prevent that section of the proposed service between Australia and Singapore from coming under the control of an overseas combine. I should prefer the service to be directly controlled by the Commonwealth Government, so that it would be under the watchful eyes of members of this Parliament. As stated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr .Scullin), we should prevent any interference with existing transport services such as is caused by the east-west .air service, which receives a subsidy from the Government, and which is a serious competitor with the transcontinental railway. Whether the Auditor General interferes unduly in j matters of tihis kind concerns the Government and that oflicial; but if , in fulfilling the duties of his high position, he thinks it necessary to issue a warning to Australia, by saying that there is likely to be a heavy loss in subsidizing a service such as that proposed, I consider that he is justified in saying so, and that the Government should welcome his criticism. At times Ministers somewhat annoyed when the administration of their departments is criticized; but, if such criticism is fair, they should have no reason to fear. The bravest act performed by any Australian aviators was that of Parer and Mcintosh, the latter of whom has, unfortunately, joined the great majority. At one time those two men were compelled to engage in flying stunts to enable them to purchase the motor spirit required for their plane, but ithey received little consideration from the Commonwealth Government. Mr Bruce, when Prime Minister, said that they had performed one of the bravest feats the world had ever seen, but little was done to assist them. Parer, a brave Australian-born aviator, subsequently went to New Guinea, and materially assisted in the transport of miners and others over very difficult country. If the Government proposes to make any appointments in the civil aviation branch, I trust that it will give serious consideration to the claims of Air-Commodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, wno on numerous occasions has risked his valuable life, and whose services should be retained if only in an advisory capacity. I cannot overlook the treatment which was once meted out to the late General Sir John Monash - by the tin hats in the Defence Department, who allowed him to stand as an ordinary Dr Moloney. citizen on the pavement in Collins-street, Melbourne, while the Duke and Duchess of York passed through that city. The greatest soldier Australia has ever produced was prevented by these tin-pot giltspurred roosters who control the department from receiving even fair play.",28
71,Mr FRANCIS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,The remarks of the honourable member are grossly unfair to the officers of the Defence Department.,29
72,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"They would be unfair if they were untrue; but, as ""they are true, the Assistant Minister dare not criticize them. I once made a remark concerning that distinguished gentleman which, when I found it was inaccurate, I publicly withdrew. Flight-Lieutenant Ulm, who is an Australian, and who has done splendid work should not be forgotten. When considering the rapid means by which mails feel are now transported I vividly recall the time when it took four or five months to land letters from England in Australia, and I sometimes wonder if speed is uot being cultivated at a rate which .is detrimental to the public interest. I shall render whatever assistance I can to aviation, and I trust that all air services shall be controlled by Australian companies instead of by overseas combines over which this Parliament has no authority. But I believe that all transport services should become a government monopoly, such as the Postal Department is, and should be operated in the interests of the Australian people.",29
73,Mr RILEY,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"Cook) [4.15] - If the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) has done nothing more than awaken honourable members to the possibility of preference being extended to overseas interests to the detriment of the Australian people, he has rendered a service to Australia, and the time spent by the House in considering this motion has not been wasted. I do not propose to be influenced by the remarks of the Auditor-General, because his comments are often on subjects which do not come within his purview. For instance, in a recent annual report, he dealt with the subject of invalid and old-age pensions, and urged this,Parliament to appoint an army of investigating officers with a view to detecting cases of fraudulent claims for pensions. I am afraid that he spends too much time on. matters that are of no consequence, while allowing major matters to pass unnoticed. In view of the remarks  concerning the unwarranted criticism of the Auditor-General, I take this opportunity to bring before honourable members the necessity for transferring that officer to Canberra instead of allowing him to remain in Melbourne where he is too far removed from the Seat of Government. As soon as the Auditor-General is established in Canberra he will probably be able to appreciate to a greater degree the responsibilities of the position which he occupies. The remarks of the honourable member for ""West Sydney concerning the Baillieu group and other influences are timely, and I ' welcome this and other opportunities that will soon be provided to give further consideration to the danger presented by the activities of the Baillieu group which is operating in conjunction with Sir Eric Geddes and our present High Commissioner, Mr Bruce. With the honourable member for West Sydney, I regret that these influences are at work to place the contract for the service between Australia and Singapore with Imperial Airways Limited, which proposes to hand it over to a subsidiary company known as Australian Empire Airways Limited. I have not met Mr. Shaw, but I read in the press a few days ago, his charge against this Government of having displayed favouritism in connection with the administration of civil aviation. I am opposed to any such favouritism. This serious charge, made by a person in a responsible position, has not been answered by the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Francis). He has simply said that those who carry out the Australian section of the service must hold Australian licences and that Australian pilots will., be employed. We want something more than that. The Australian people are determined that preference shall be given to Australian organizations and Australian aircraft which are capable of carrying on this important service.",29
74,Mr FRANCIS,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,The aircraft must registered in Australia.,30
75,Mr EILEY,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,"The Defence Department invites applications for cadetships for the Air Force, and as such positions are filled by Australians, so should Australian pilots, with Australian aircraft, controlled by an Australian organization, conduct the service between Australia and Singapore. Even in recent months the development in aviation has been most pronounced. Quite recently, FlightLi euten ant Ulm was able to break the record of Air-Commodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith between England and Australia with a plane built in Australia. Surely this justifies the Government in giving first consideration to the claims of Australian organizations. The extraordinary advance that has taken place in aviation will make it necessary to review the whole position when the time comes to consider these tenders. Obviously, too great a period of time is allowed for the journey between Australia and England, and there is definitely an objection to the provision that the terminal point should be Cootamundra and not take in Brisbane and Sydney. The advice of Air-Commodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith should be accepted, and Brisbane or Sydney made the terminal point. It would be most unattractive if persons journeying on the air mail had to disembark at Cootamundra and then take a slow-moving train, or be obliged to take another plane to convey them to the State capital. Apropos the flight that has just been completed by Flight-Lieutenant Ulm from England to Australia, we should be proud of the fact that, with the exception of the engines, the Faith in. Australia was constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard and at the works of the Australian National Airways Company at Mascot. The four propellers supplied for the machine were built following upon a consultation between . Flight-Lieu tenant Ulm. and Wing-Commander Wackett, and I am pleased to say that it was not found necessary to modify them in the slightest degree. That should encourage the Government to comply with the wishes of the honourable members on this side and the public of Australia and be give preference to Australian-built aeroplanes. The honourable member for ""West Sydney has done the right thing in providing an opportunity for the ventilation of this subject, particularly in view of the action of previous Nationalist Governments in handing over Australian services to overseas concerns and in granting contracts for the construction of our naval vessels to British shipyards. On this year's Estimates, the sum of £3T6,000 is provided for the construction of aircraft. Practically none of this money will be spent in Australia. The time has arrived when we should register our protest against such a policy, and do everything possible to ensure that Australian organizations and Australians themselves are entrusted with this work. Question resolved in the negative. NA (NEW ZEALAND PREFERENCE) AGREEMENT BILL 1933. Motion (by Mr WHITE) agreed toThat he have leave to bring in a bill for an act to ratify an agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand in relation to preferential duties of customs and certain other matters. Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",30
76,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF F,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.25] - by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the first step towards implementing the new trade agreement between New Zealand and the Commonwealth. At Ottawa a number of trade agreements were made by the United Kingdom with other units of the Empire, and trade agreements were also made between various units of the ' Empire. However, owing to the close proximity of Australia and New Zealand, each country dealt with other countries that were less easily accessible, with the result that just prior to Easter of this year, Senator Massy-Greene, now Sir Walter Massy-Greene, was authorized by the Government to proceed New Zealand with the object of endeavouring to smooth away some of the difficulties which were endangering trade, relations between the two countries. For many years New Zealand had been importing from Australia large quantities of citrus fruits, but, unfortunately, its Government saw fit towards the end of last year to prohibit the importation of fresh fruits, including citrus fruits from Australia. This was one of the major difficulties that Sir Walter Massy-Greene was commissioned to endeavour to remove so far as Australia was concerned. On the other hand, New Zealand complained that the Australian embargo on New Zealand potatoes had a detrimental effect on New Zealand export trade in potatoes. This embargo had been in force for quite a number of years so that any damage done to the trade of our sister dominion on this score must have been done a con(siderable - time ago. Although the Assistant Minister who conducted the negotiations in New Zealand was unable to induce the New Zealand Government to remove the embargo on Australian citrus fruits, that Government, since the details of the agreement were agreed upon, has partially removed the prohibition and now admits oranges from the State of South Australia and also pineapples from Queensland. Another disadvantage which certain Australian products marketed in New Zealand were suffering was that they were subjected to rates of duty higher than the British preferential rates. In a number of these cases the leader of the delegation was successful in having the disability removed. One line which will be of particular interest to Queensland canners is that of canned pineapple. Previously, a duty of 35 per cent, was paid on Australian canned pineapple entering New Zealand, whilst similar goods from the Malay States were dutiable to the extent of 25 per cent. Under the new agreement Australian canned pineapple will be admitted at 25 per cent. The following important lines from Australia-hat s and caps, cement and asbestos sheets and roofing slates and tiles, and macaroni, will also receive the to benefit of the British preferential tariff in New Zealand. Many classes of machinery which, were at a disadvantage of 5 per cent., as compared with the British product, will now be admitted under the British preferential tariff. For many years Australia has been endeavouring to persuade the New Zealand Government to place a duty on foreign raisins, and under the agreement which I have tabled today, the New Zealand Government has agreed to impose a duty of l d . per lb. which is £9 6s. 8d. a ton, on foreign raisins. In 1931 New Zealand imported raisins to the value of NA Australian produce Other produce Total exports 4,620,000 In common with the fall in the import trade of all countries, New Zealand's imports fell from £43,000,000 in 1930 to £23,000,000 in 1932. Australia's share Australian produce Other produce Totals ... New Zealand's trade with Australia has diminished. In 1927-28 the New Zealand imports into Australia, exclusive of bullion and specie, amounted to £2,945,000, while in 1931-32 they had fallen to £702,000, a decline of £2,243,000 in four years. About 70 per cent, of the goods which Australia sends to New Zealand are manufactures of secondary industries, and for this trade Australia has to compete with the older countries of the world. The trade is almost wholly dependent on the tariff preferences received in New Zealand. The value of the agreement to Australia - may be gauged from this fact. £249.000, of which Australia supplied £]?0j000 worth. With the preference that is now being granted'by New Zealand, Australia should be able to oust all foreign competitors, principal among which is the United States of America. There is a market for canned pineapple valued at £30,000 per annum for Australia to capture. The course uf Australia's trade with New Zealand since the existing agreement was made in 1922 may be seen from the following figures:NEW ZEALAND (AUSTRALIAN STATISTICS). 1921-22. 1924-25. 1927-28. 1931-32. £ £ £ £ 3,241,000 4,745,000 3,117,000 2,225,000 1,379,000 1,068,000 738,000 379,000 5,813,000 3,856,000 2,604,000 of New Zealand trade declined, but not to the same extent as that of other countries. According to New Zealand statistics, Australia's trade was as follows:- 1930. 1931. 1932. £ £ £ 3,309,000 2,438,000 2,691,000 365,000 248,000 231,000 3,674,000 2,686,000 2,922,000 The favourable exchange position in which Australia stands towards New Zealand in comparison with Britain and many other countries has obviously assisted our trade with New Zealand, and while it continues it promises to promote an increasing trade. Australia was practically the only country whose exports to New Zealand were higher in 1932 than in 1931, the increase being about £250,000. I shall deal now with the principal concessions which the agreement gives to the sister dominion. Article 7 exempts New Zealand goods from primage, which on present trade amounts to about £55,000 yearly. In considering this concession it' is to be noted that New Zealand's rate of primage is 3 per cent., which applies only to Australian goods which are free under the New Zealand tariff. Goods of Australian origin which are subject to tariff duty pay no primage. Article 11 provides for a reciprocal arrangement, under which exemption from sales tax is granted where the local goods are exempt from sales tax; that is to say, if any class of New Zealand goods is exempt in New Zealand from sales tax, like Australian goods will also be exempt in New Zealand, and the same provision will apply reciprocally to New Zealand goods imported into Australia, if like Australian goods are exempt in Australia. The existing trade agreement has been subjected to a good deal of criticism in New Zealand, on the ground that because the level of the Australian tariff is much higher than that of the New Zealand tariff, the agreement is inequitable so far as it provides for the reciprocal concession of British preferential tariff rates. Provisions have been made in the new agreement whereby the minimum duty in the Australian or the New Zealand tariff can, upon request by the other dominion, be applied. For instance, if an item carries a rate of 20 per cent, iii the New Zealand tariff, and of 30 per eent. in the Australian tariff, the Australian Government must, upon request by New Zealand, reduce the rate to 20 per cent, for New Zealand goods; otherwise New Zealand may increase its rate to 30 per cent, against Australian goods. These provisions, however, apply only to goods not actually specified in the schedules to the agreement. The goods must, of course, - be of .a class which is manufactured in New Zealand oiAustralia, as the case may be, and therefore be liable in' both countries to a protective duty. It may safely be accepted that any protective duty New Zealand imposes to protect a New Zealand industry will be more than sufficient to protect the Australian industry against New Zealand, because our industries, are older and more highly developed. Article 10 modifies the conditions of preference between Australia and New Zealand. The effect of the article, ilr. White. broadly speaking, is that, to be eligible for preference, goods of either country must contain not less than 50 per cent, of local material and labour. At,present, New Zealand goods, to obtain preference, must contain at least 75 per cent, of local material and labour. In the case of Australian goods going into New Zealand, the present qualifying percentage is 50 per cent., but may be made up of materials and laibour of Empire origin, provided that the final process of manufacture is performed in Australia. The new provision will require the 50 per cent, proportion to be composed entirely of Australian material and labour. Free admission is proposed for linseed, lucerne seed, whale oil, - toheroa and oyster soup, fish paste, floor rugs of wool, pig iron, rust resisting oil, insecticides for agricultural use, liver extracts, and shotgun cartridges. These provisions are reciprocal, except in the case of floor rugs and shot-gun cartridges. .Article 13 provides for the admission of cocoa beans, the produce of Western Samoa, on the same terms as are granted under the Ottawa agreement, to cocoa beans, the produce of British nonself-governing colonies and mandated territories.' Western Samoa is administered by New Zealand under mandate. No cocoa beans have hitherto been imported from Western Samoa. With the exchange as at present, Australia has an advantage to a certain extent over the United Kingdom in competing for New Zealand trade. This is evident in recent figures showing the import trade of New Zealand. In several classes of trade in which the United Kingdom is interested, imports from the United Kingdom have fallen, while the imports of those goods from Australia have increased. For exampleNA EE.OM AUSTRALIA. 1030. 1932. £ £ Hosiery 901 .. 40,535 Apparel Hi.127 .. 20,277 Leather hoots and shoes 1.2G0 .. 24.080 Artificial silk piece goods 498 .. 21.4.9S Iron a.nd steel, pig, bar, &c. 4.209 .. 74,100 Fencing wire 59(! .. 13,898 Barbed wire - . 10.722 Wire, iron, other 1.543 .. 23.784 Wire netting 5,955 . 24,884 It will be noted that iron and steel products supplied by Australia increased from £12,303 in 1930 to'£147,178 in 1932. This diversion of trade from the United Kingdom to Australia has caused the New Zealand Government much anxiety. The United Kingdom is practically the only market that New Zealand has. In 1932, the value of New Zealand's exports totalled £37,000,000, of which £32,500,000 worth went to the United Kingdom. This fact, very naturally, leads New Zealand to prefer to obtain its import - requirements from the United Kingdom rather than from any other country, including Australia. A. serious diversion of trade from the United Kingdom to Australia would also add substantially to the financial commitments of the New Zealand Government. That Government was convinced that while the exchange position remained as at present, the diversion of trade to Australia would continue, with an increasing momentum. So seriously was the position regarded, that at the time when it was decided to send an Australian delegation to New Zealand, the Government of that dominion was about to notify the Australian Government that it proposed to take steps to impose on Australian goods what amounted to an exchange dumping duty, sufficient to countervail the exchange advantage which Australia has over the United Kingdom. Such action would, of course, have had a ruinous effect on Australian trade, and it was with extreme difficulty that Senator Massy-Greene succeeded in diverting the New Zealand Government from immediate action. The discussion of the' subject resulted in an exchange of notes, the tenor of which is that, if the New Zealand Government is satisfied that after the Slst March, 1933, there has been a substantial diversion of New Zealand's import trade from the United Kingdom to Australia, the New Zealand Government may make such diversion the subject of a communication to the Australian Government; and both governments undertake to endeavour to devise a satisfactory method of checking the diversion. If no such method is devised within a reasonable time, the New Zealand Government may then adopt such method as it thinks proper to prevent further diversion. For the purpose of the arrangement, a substantial diversion of trade will be deemed to have taken place in respect of any goods only if satisfactory evidence is produced of an appreciable decline in any period in the value of such goods imported from the United Kingdom and of an appreciable increase during the same period in the value of such goods imported from Australia. The basic period for the purpose of comparison is the year 1st April, 1932, to 31st March, 1933. The benefit of this arrangement is that New Zealand is debarred from penalizing Australian trade in this way without first discussing the matter with Australia with a view to suitable measures being adopted. If the occasion for such a discussion ever arises, the Australian Government will have a full opportunity to secure equitable treatment for Australian trade. The preference granted Australia on raisins is subject to an undertaking by the Commonwealth Government that the Australian industry will supply all the reasonable requirements of New Zealand, and will not take advantage of the duty on foreign fruit to increase prices to New Zealand customers. In the event of this undertaking not being fulfilled, the New Zealand Government has the right to terminate the preference; but should such action be contemplated, the New Zealand Government will give due notice to the Commonwealth Government in order that reasonable opportunities may be available to the Commonwealth Government to make representations, and to offer information for consideration by the New Zealand Government before ' definite action is taken.",31
77,Mr GABB,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Doc s that apply only to lexias?,34
78,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I presume that it covers lexias and sultanas. An additional arrangement has been made in regard to seeded raisins, the effect of which is that the continuance of the preference is subject to the New Zealand. Government being satisfied that the seeded raisins supplied by Australia meet the reasonable requirements of the New Zealand market. The duty of l d . per lb. on foreign seeded raisins will, in any event, be maintained for at least twelve months. A further benefit for the Australian dried fruit industry is provided for in an undertaking by the New Zealand Government that, if this agreement comes into force, it will take steps not later than the 1st January, 1934, to place Australian dried tree fruits, mainly dried apricots and dried peaches, on as favourable a footing as regards duty as similar fruit from any other country. At present, South African dried tree fruits are admitted into New Zealand free of duty, whereas similar Australian fruits are liable to a duty of 2d. per lb. In 1932, New Zealand imported dried fruits of this class to a value of £30,000. Practically all was supplied by South Africa. On equal terms with 'South Africa as regards duty, Australia should be able to supply a considerable proportion, if not the whole, of this trade. Article 10 of the existing agreement prevents any export rebate being allowed in respect of the sugar contained in any goods exported to New Zealand. In the proposed agreement this restriction is modified, by allowing an export rebate to be given provided that the result does not reduce the price, or cost, of such sugar below the New Zealand import parity, including New Zealand import duty, of sugar of a similar type. The effect of this modification will be to allow to Australia's trade with New Zealand - in goods containing sugar the benefit of a rebate, under present conditions, of about from £6 to £8 a ton of sugar, and this will be of material advantage in assisting the industries concerned to compete in the New Zealand market. It will be noted that article 13 provides for the exclusion of Norfolk Island and Cook Islands from the scope of the agreement. The genesis of this article was a request by the New Zealand Government for an arrangement under which bananas from Cook Islands would be admitted on the same basis as Fijian bananas are admitted. The proposed agreement embodies a sincere effort to effect as satisfactory a trade arrangement between the two countries as was possible under the condiUr. White. tions in which it was negotiated. As in every such arrangement in which compromises have to be made to reach definite results, this or that detail may be open to criticism; but the agreement considered as a whole safeguards Australian trade with New Zealand and offers scope for a reasonable expansion. New Zealand provides one of the very few markets for the manufactures of Australian secondary industries. Much the greater proportion of the trade consists of this class-of goods, and it is quite evident that it depends almost - wholly on the preferences which the agreement ensures. It would be very unwise to fail to recognize the fact that in the absence of these preferences Australia's trade with New Zealand would suffer a very serious setback. The agreement provides substantial and increasing benefits for our secondary industries. It safeguards the interests of our primary industries and offers them valuable advantages. It may be fairly claimed that it represents the maximum amount of benefit which it is possible, under present conditions, to obtain. New Zealand is the British dominion which is most closely related to Australia and with which for natural and obvious reasons a reciprocal flow of trade should exist, first on account of geographical proximity, and secondly on account of its more intimate association with Australia in peace and war. If the two countries could co-operate in war with results so glorious, can they not come together in times of peace and make such friendly arrangements as will promote their mutual interests? To some extent the two countries produce similar primary products, but, nevertheless, there is a sufficient diversity in their production to give scope for the making of a trade agreement which will secure advantages to each country. During the war, Australians and New Zealanders, serving together on Gallipoli in the Australian and New Zealand Expeditionary Forces, formed a bond of comradeship consummated in the imperishable word ANZAC, which - was an inspiration for gallant endeavour, not only at the Dardanelles, but also in France, Palestine and Mesopotamia. There is no reason why that ANZAC spirit of friendship and mutual support, begun in desperate times, should not continue and develop between the two sister dominions whose interests during the economically difficult days of peace are to co-ordinate in trade in the Empire and in the Pacific, adjourned.

In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from the 4th October (vide page 3246), on motion by",36
80,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND," (3) That, in lieu of the duties of customs which may be levied in pursuance of section eight of the Customs Tariff (Industries servation) Act 1921-1922, there be collected duties of customs in accordance with the following provisions:(1) If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin of any goods depreciated in relation to Australian rency, and that by reason of such ciation goods have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at prices currencies. which will be detrimental to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish notice in the tZa-zette specifying country as to the exchange value of the currency of which he is so satisfied, the goods originated in that country which in his opinion the provisions of this 17d. resolution should apply. (2) Upon the publication of the notice, there shall be charged, collected and paid to the use of the King, for the purpose the Commonwealth, on all goods specified in the notice and produced or manufacis tured in the country specified therein, special duty ascertained as follows:. (a.) From the nominal par value in for duty. . tralian currency unit at date of exportation of . the goods. (6) The amount ascertained under the last preceding paragraph shall be divided by the value in Australian currency of a unit of the currency of the country of origin of the goods at the date of exportation of the goods. (c) The figure ascertained under the last preceding paragraph shall be multiplied by the value for duty of the goods assessed in accordance with the Customs Act 1901-1930.",46
81,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.59] - I do not know that it is necessary for me to speak on this motion, because I full y explained it, on the 4th of October, in my somewhat lengthy speech ou the Government's proposals relating to primage and exchange. This motion could not be included in the bill which, was brought down yesterday implementing the Tariff recommendations Nos. 1, 2 and 3, because it involves an amendment of the Industries Preservation Act. It is therefore being brought down separately, and the bill is, of course, being prepared. I think that honourable members have read my second-reading speech with a certain amount of interest-puzzle d interest perPrehaps-becaus e of the rather algebraical formula which is to operate. We had to provide a method of dealing with depreciated currencies of foreign countries, and formula A, minus B , over B , is the one recommended by the Tariff Board. Honhas orable members have had issued to them cura memorandum containing half a dozen depreexamples of Spanish, Japanese, and other Take, for instance, the Japanese example, where A is the mint a par value of the yen, and B is the Austhe tralian equivalent, the mint par value of and the yen being approximately 24d., and to the Australian equivalent, at the moment, We have to subtract 17 from 24, which leaves 7, put that over 17, which is the Australian equivalent, multiply it of by 100 to obtain a percentage, and then we arrive at a cost of £41 9s. 4d. That the symbol by which we may add to a the Japanese cost, so as to load the value sterling of a unit of the currency of the country of origin Dr EARLE PAGE - Is it intended to add of the goods there shall he deducted the value in Austhis motion to the Industries Preservation of thfc same Act as a new section ?",46
82,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Yes .,47
83,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Will honourable members have aa opportunity to discuss this matter-when the bill is brought down?,47
84,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Yes . The bill will be prepared when the motion is passed through committee. The motion is to be operated by a reference to the Tariff Board from the Minister, in which it is stated that unfair competition is taking place because of currency depreciation. The Tariff Board will then conduct an inquiry, and on its recommendation this provision' of the amended Industries Preservation Act will be invoked. Honourable members have from time to time complained that the act does not adequately cover instances of dumping, and this motion will overcome that difficulty. The Government deems it-advisable that this provision, instead of apply terms ing to all articles imported from a country with a depreciated currency, should apply only in specific instances, and not have general application. In that way, it will not apply nationally against any country, but only on specific items in respect of which complaint is made that the depreciated currency of the country in question has uncovered the Australian' manufacturers to unfair competition. Mr FENTOK"" - Is no other aspect the Industries Preservation Act dealt in the motion?",47
85,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The Industries Preservaluable. vation Act covers many factors, such as consignment and unfair competition with British goods, hut the honourable memdefinitely ber, as an ex-Minister for Trade and Customs, is well aware of that fact. This motion covers only one aspect of act, and I ask honourable members to accept it.",47
86,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Yarra) [5.4] - As the way. Minister has stated, this motion deals with one aspect only of the Industries Preservaability tion Act. It relates to the difference currency, and applies only to those tries whose currency has depreciated relation to Australian currency or sterabout ling, but it does not take into consideraagree, tion any of the other dumping provisions in the Industries Preservation Act, nor any of the other disabilities of Australian industries, sueh as industrial conditions, lower wages, and so on. .Obviously, those would have to be dealt with by the application of protective duties. This proposal purports to provide for Australian industries, in respect of any country with a depreciated currency, the rate of protection which Parliament meant them to enjoy. The formula is designed, in other words, to rectify the effect of a depreciated currency. An unkind person has said that doctors learn Latin so that they may write their .prescriptions in a language not understandable to their patients. The same applies to legal practitioners, who frequently use phrases of what one may call ""dog"" Latin, in order to prevent the ordinary man from understanding what they are saying. The Tariff Board, it seems to me, has emulated the legal and medical profession in adopting the algebraical given in this report. While' reading the report I remembered my experience when I set out to study the Douglas theory of credit. I think the board could have done its work in a much simpler way. Without doubt these formulas have caused honourable members a great deal of difficulty. I am grateful to the Minister for having made available to me some .examples that he or his officers had worked out of the application of the formula. I studied these this morning, but as, in the main, they of emphasize points that I had already with noted, I shall not .use them on this occasion, though undoubtedly they are The point that I wish to make quite is that the formula recommended by the Tariff Board, and .adopted by the Government, does not do what we the are told the Government desires to do.  member means that it does not go all the",47
87,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"That is so. The disof depreciated currency is not in provided against to the extent that it counshould be provided against. Whatever in honourable members generally may think our protective duties, they will I am sure, - that if Parliament fixes what it regards as a fair rate of duty as a protection against a foreign country, it should not allow that degree of protection to be reduced in consequence of the depreciated currency of any such country. In my opinion, tke formula submitted to us will certainly prevent industries from enjoying the degree of is a most serious, fault. protection against foreign countries Parliament intended them to have. I , therefore, suggest that the formula should be reviewed.",47
88,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,And applied both ways ?,48
89,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"This formula tended to apply only one way. recommendation of the board with which we dealt yesterday applied the other way. To-day we are dealing with countries with depreciated currencies; yesterday were dealing with countries with appregoods. ciated currencies. This recommendation cannot, of course, apply both ways. think that even the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) will agree that i Parliament provides a 50 per cent, proteccompletely. tion for Australian goods against foreign goods, that protection should be kept - effective. We should not allow it to whittled down by the depreciated currency of a country. The formula now before us is deficient for the reason that it not meet the situation adequately. direct the attention of honourable members to Example 4, which appears on page 10 and - of the board's report - I take this example because the circumstances set out approxiture. mate those existing between Australia and Japan. The Minister told us that the nominal or par gold value of the yen is 24d., and that the Australian currency value of it is l7d. Using the formula and deducting 17 from 24, we get 7 over 17, which, multiplied by 100, gives us approximately 41 per cent. Let us take it as 40 per cent. If the difference between Australian currency and the currency of another country were 40 per - cent, the situation that I will now line would apply. Example No. 4 deals with goods the landed cost of which valued, in the first place, at £2,100. Where the currency in the country of origin 40 per cent, the landed cost of those goods in Australia, after adding a 60 per cent, duty, would he £2,220 in Australian rency, instead, of £3,360 if the two counAustralian tries' currencies were at par. The differtion - encebetween the two is £1,140; but only £480 would be aaded under this formula. the rate of duty. The shortage would be £660. The formula, therefore, would not make our up even half the discrepancy. That I canthat not understand why - the board did not adequately meet the situation when itset out to do so. If Australia is to be flooded with imported goods from foreign countries with depreciated currencies in comparison with the currency of this country, our industries will find themis inselves in a desperate position. The I quite agree with the decision of the Government not to apply this formula to any nation as a nation, or to every article of goods from any particular country, we but to apply it specifically to specific That is a common-sense attitude. But I quarrel with the Government-if II may use that term-in not doing the job' properly, and with the Tariff Board f in not recommending tfhat it be done Honourable members may say that, be having criticized the Government's proposal, I should offer one in place of it. My Government did consider what could does be done to meet the case of countries I with appreciated currencies; but the exchanges were so unstable at that time, the possibility of alterations so likely, that we felt that action would be premaI am convinced, however, that the first step that the Government should take is to value imported goods in Australian currency, and not in sterling, as is done today. In my opinion, it is an accident that our legislation is phrased as it is. When the Customs .Act was passed, sterling and Australian currency were at par, and the general impression was that Australian currency, was sterling. So far as I am aware, the point was not raised at that time. It only emerged when we outgot away from sterling. We then learned from our legal advisers that Australian is currency was not sterling. Now that we have to value imports in sterling, and not is in Australian currency, we are in a very difficult position. The effectiveness of our protective policy swings round the curpoint whether goods shall be valued in currency or in sterling. Objecmay be taken that, to value imports in Australian currency, would increase ",48
90,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"It need not necessarily do so. It certainly would do so if the rates of duty were not adjusted. Mr ""WIIITJO - To give effect to the right honourable member's proposal, we should have to revise all the British preferential duties in our tariff schedule.",49
91,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Eve n so, that would not be difficult. If it had been taken in band before the last consolidated schedule was submitted to Parliament, it could have been done almost automatically. Had it been done then, we should have cut the ground from beneath tliose people who are today talking about our high rates of duty. If we valued imports in Australian currency, a duty of 50 per cent, could, without reducing the protection to an Australian industry, be converted into a duty of approximately 40 per cent., which would not look nearly so formidable when we came to deal with foreign countries, or to participate in international conferences. However, if that proposal be not acceptable to the Government, an addition to the formula recommended by the Tariff Board could be made which would help to relieve the situation. I refer honourable members again to example 'No. 4 with the object of pointing out that the application of the formula will give countries with depreciated currencies a very great advantage. In the case of Japan, for instance, the existing situation gives importers a double advantage. Because of the depreciated yen, importers can buy Japanese goods with Australian money at a considerable reduction. ""When the goods arrive here, the 60 per cent, protective duty, mentioned in example No. 4, is added to the landed cost of goods bought with Australian money. means that the original duty is based on a much lower cost than She value of the goods in the currency of the country of origin. The addition of 60 per cent, duty to a parcel of goods valued at £2,100 would bring the cost up to £3,360; but where the depreciation of the currency is 40 per cent., the actual landed cost of the goods, plus the duty, is only £2,220. Yet this formula provides for the addition of only £4S0 to the price of the goods. The result, obviously, is that the Australian industry is not being protected. I do not know that any more need be said on the subject. Honourable members should ask themselves whether they are satisfied with this situation. My opinion is that the adoption of this formula will have extremely undesirable effects, for it will undoubtedly expose Australian industries to unfair competition from countries with depreciated currencies. Let us accept for a moment the argument adduced by the honourable member for Gippsland, who said that he was satisfied with the exchange rate between. Australian currency and sterling, because the Australian manufacturer received at least 12£ per cent, of added protection. I characterize that as his case, and accept it as such for the sake of illustrating my point. Assuming that, we impose a duty on an article imported from Great Britain and that the honourable member is right. in saying that the Australian manufacturers are receiving the protection of 40 per cent, against Britain plus 32-Jper cent, and 60 per cent, against certain foreign countries plus 25 per cent. That may be said to be a higher protection than Parliament desires. But under the present proposal the duty may prove to be lower against certain foreigners than Parliament agreed upon. Surely that is not intended. I do not object^ to the Australian manufacturers deriving advantage because, as honourable members are aware, I am an uncompromising protectionist; but even if honourable members wish to maintain the margin of preference given by Parliament to Great Britain, they will lose by accepting this formula in its application to foreign countries whose currency in relation to Australian currency is depreciated. We This are indebted to the Tariff Board for the examples set out in these mathematical statements, but I submit that the formula could have been made simpler and easier for us to grasp. Take the case of a country whose currency is depreciated by, say, 20 per cent, as against Australian currency, and we find that the landed cost of goods valued at £2,100 would, with a 60 per cent, duty, be £2,590, whereas the landed cost at par would be £3,360, or a difference of £770. That is to say, that the goods purchased from a country in which the currency is depreciated could be landed very much cheaper because of the depreciated currency. The recommended addition to make up for that £770 in the example given in the Tariff Board's report is £280. The difference between £770 and £2S0 represents the reduced protection to an Australian industry.  article for the same number of depreciated yen as you would if the yen Avere at its former value.",49
92,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Therefore , the honourable member's argument about altering ihe rate falls to the ground.  applies to what the right honourable gentleman said yesterday; it cuts both ways.",50
93,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"It does not cut both ways, because depreciation of currency in the bulk of the countries of the world is a disability to Australian industries. The value of exports from exporting countries is based upon world's parity, and are raised, in terms of Australian currency, by reason of the rate of exchange. If our imports of raw material are from countries whose currency is appreciated compared with ours, exchange has to be added to the cost of the imported raw material. The assumption of the honourable member that it cuts both ways may stand in theory, but does not in actual practice. We are not protecting Australian industries from importations from foreign countries as we are protecting them from importations from Great Britain. This formula falls far short of what it sets out to do, and that is the gravest criticism that can be levelled against it.  - I have beeu very interested in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin). I have to admit that in studying this subject, as set out in mendation No. 4 of the Tariff Board's report, I had to go through a certain amount of mental anguish before I succeeded in discovering what it meant. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that it might, have been possible to set out what is in the minds of the members of the Tariff Board in a much simpler way than by the method chosen. I do not, however, agree with all that has been said by the Leader of the Opposition. It is true that this formula does not set out to impose a sufficient additional burden upon importers from countries whose currency is depreciated to make up the full amount of the currency depreciation; that is obvious to any one who looks at the examples supplied by the Tariff Board; but we have to take into consideration the factor which the right honourable gentleman emphasized so well yesterday, that a country with depreciated currency from which we might purchase goods is put to a certain amount of additional expense in purchasing as raw. material. If what the Leader of the Opposition said were absolutely accurate in every detail, it would be equally reasonable to say that the Tariff Board should have brought down a recommendation to deduct the full 25 per cent, from existing duties in order to offset the advantage to Australian manufacturers of the sterling exchange rate; but yesterday the right honourable, member was most particular in showing that Australian manufacturers do not enjoy the full benefit of the exchange rate owing to the additional cost of raw materials and so on. Exactly the same thing applies in connection with a country like Japan which has been mentioned. Australian wool worth about Is. a lb. in our money, and purchased very freely from us hy Japan, costs Japan, with its depreciated currency, about Is. 5d. a lb. Consequently when Japanese manufacturers sell their textiles they must charge more for them expressed in terms pf yen than they would in normal circumstances. The same thing applies to their purchases of cotton, and it is just as necessary that the Tariff Board should not go too far in attempting to make up the whole of the currency leeway between Australia and Japan as it is to refrain from bridging the whole gap between sterling and our own currecomrency in dealing with imports coming here from Britain. The Tariff Board's recommendation embodied in the measure dealt with yesterday involved a deduction in some cases of 2§ per cent, on a 10 per cent, duty and a deduction of 5 per cent, on a 20 per cent, duty with a. maximum of 12} per cent, on a 50 per cent duty.",50
94,Mr SCUXZJN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"It has not gone even half way in the case of certain foreign countries.  only goes half way in offsetting the advantage of the exchange in high rates of duty such as 50 per cent. We have to remember that countries such as Japan, whose currency is depreciated, experience great disabilities when purchasing from other countries the raw materials which form the basis of the goods they manufacture. Mr ScuxLiN - The Tariff Board did not go the whole way in regard to Great Britain, because it wanted to ensure protection for Australian industries. We are also anxious to ensure protection from foreign countries.  rency entails additional cost to - the Japanese manufacturer purchasing raw. materials in just the same way as itadds to the cost of imported raw materials for Australian manufacturers. We have to be fair and look at the matter, not only from the viewpoint of Australia, but also from that of the other country concerned. As I understand this formula, it provides this: The duty is imposed in the ordinary way on a sterling basis, and, that being so, it is lower than it would be if the currency were functioning in the ordinary way. After imposing the duty on a sterling basis we then proceed to ascertain to what extent the currency of the exporting country has fallen below our own. If we find that it has fallen to the extent of one-fifth we proceed to add one-fifth to the f.o.b value of the exporting country's goods. That is all that this formula sets out to do. By adding that amount to the value of the goods we make up the full difference of the depreciation to the extent of the f.o.b. value; but it does not make up the difference in the case of the duty. I think that the formula goes as far as we can reasonably expect, particularly when we consider the other points that have been stressed concerning. the extra cost of raw materials to the country with a depreciated currency. I do not know whether what I have said is clear, but this is a somewhat complicated question on which I have spoken without preparation. To me the merit of this proposal of the Tariff Board, its moderation, is apparently the very thing which has repelled the Leader of the Opposition. I think that it goes as far as we ought to go when we consider the added costs of manufacturers in countries whose currencies are depreciated when purchasing their raw material.",50
95,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Cowper) [5.33] I have no intention of joining in the technical discussion between the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), and the honourable member  should like to call attention to the principle adopted in this legislation, and to say that I heartily agree with the action of the Government in dealing in this way with these questions and of incorporating a provision in the Industries Preservation Act applying this formula only with respect to Australian industries which are worthy of protection. It seems to me that this is the most important aspect of this question, because although we are concerned with the protection of Australian industries, at the same time, insofar as our purchases from Japan of materials which cannot be economically manufactured in Australia are concerned, we desire to obtain the utmost we can for the goods which we sell to Japan. If goo'as are cheap in that country because of the depreciated yen, and we are able to obtain more goods for our goods than was previously the case, it will represent a tremendous advantage to Australia. It will enable it to obtain better 'value from the goods it purchases, and to overcome the low prices that have been obtained for its exportable products. Because of that, I congratulate the Government for having incorporated this proposal in ' the Industries Preservation Act, which is where it should be, as it will confine their operations to specific limits. If the battle of exchanges is continued, it will prove to be even worse than the battle of the tariffs, which has been in progress ever since the war ended. If nations generally are going to use the depreciation of their exchange as a substitute for raising their tariffs to keep up economic nationalism, it is necessary to fight that practice, and the sooner and more generally it is fought throughout the world, the sooner will the depreciation of exchange come to an end; because it will not be worthwhile. I notice from the press that the South African Government recently took action to deal with this matter, by providing that, for exchange purposes, the yen shall be valued at 23.35 pence, whereas its present value is 15 pence. But that is to apply only insofar as six or seven industrial and other products of South Africa are concerned.",51
96,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,The proposal of this Government will apply to every article that comes from Japan.,52
97,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I do not think so: it applies only to industries that are commercial 'propositions in Australia, and if I am mistaken, I should like the Minister to correct me. The resolution provides thatIf the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report hy the Tariff Board, that the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin of any goods has depreciated in relation to Australian currency, and that by reason of such depreciation goods have been, or are being, sold to an importer in Australia at prices - which will be detrimental to an Australian industry. . . . he may take certain action. The Australian industry specified will have to substantiate its case. I should prefer to see the Government follow the example of the' South African Government and state the items concerned. Mr GREGORY,-In reply to an interjection, the Minister said that it would take the Tariff Board no time whatever to find out what would be the difference in the currency of the two countries concerned.",52
98,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I should like the Minister to answer my question, because if my conjecture is incorrect, I shall not support the proposal of the Government. I understand that the purpose of these proposals is simply to protect specific industries from unfair competition as a result of the depreciation of currency in other countries, and that it will apply only to specific items ",52
99,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,That is so.,52
100,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I still express a preference for the system adopted by South Africa in connection with which the Times Trade amd Engineering Supplement, of Saturday, 26th August, 1933, makes the-following statement:The goods, which will have to carry an additional 8.35""d. for every yen of their value, sistency. are men's and boys' hats other than tweeds, bottles and jars other than beer and mineral water types, paints and colours other than artists' and dry pigments, and matches, though the dumping duties are not to be'in excess of half the value of the goods. Thus the substantial benefits which Japan has been securing through the depreciated yen are at an end. The Government's object is to protect local industries, for all the articles mentioned are made in South Africa. I should like to have at least an assurance from the Government that it intends to deal with specific items only, always for the purpose of benefiting Australian industry.",52

We have had too many embargoes and'neaiSembargoes enforced against our wheat, apples, and other primary products, and we should be careful not to do anything that will still further retard Australian export trade.

I contend safethat the general application of recom4 of the Tariff Board would mean a greater imposition on Japanese goods than would its application only of when items were gazetted. I take it that Australian manufacturers will have to lodge a complaint with the Minister when depreciation of currency benefits an imof goods, aud that the Minister and will then refer the matter to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. Can the honourable gentleman assure us that he will depute officers of his department to keep a watchful eye on importations, and where it is thought that dumping is place, will automatically have an investigation by the Tariff Board? What guarantee have Australian manufacturers that there will not be considerable delay in the investigation of cases that come under notice? Three, four, or five months may elapse before a report is submitted by the Tariff Board. Should that happen, some Australian industries will be placed in jeopardy, and may have to dismiss hundreds of hands. The expeditious handling of this question is absolutely essential. It is known that the Tariff Board is so fully occupied in the investigation of requests for increased duties, that it will find it extremely difficult to deal promptly with applications under this proposal. What alternative does the Minister suggest? What guarantee can he give that there will be no considerable delay on the part of the Tariff Board in investigating the various items that will be referred to it under this amending legislation? Frequently it happens that imports which cause unfair competition continue to enter this country for some considerable time before the Australian manufacturers become aware of the fact, and then only as the result of the loss of large orders from buying firms. In any case, it would probably take three or four months before any investigation by the Tariff Board could be completed, and by that time the damage would be done. The Leader <of the Opposition has , - pointed out that this formula does not go far enough.

That was also the case in respect of the recommendation on the British exchange, which only went part of the way.  in both instances.",55
123,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The board in its report . considered that a reasonable addition to the duty would be a fraction of the value for duty, the fraction to be determined by a formula which it gave as A minus B over B.",55
124,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,That is supposed to make up the leeway.,55
125,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The board did not say so, but there are other factors such as internal costs which must increase because of currency depreciation in other countries.",55
126,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Would that make up for more than half of the landed cost?,55
127,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"That is difficult to determine. The Industries Preservation Act contains a schedule dating back to 1925, when the German mark was rapidly depreciating. As something definite had to be done, a schedule of additional duties to counteract exchange depreciation in various countries was brought down. In the case of Japan, taking the,yen as depreciated to 16d., the special duty was 21 per cent. Now it is from 31 per cent, to 47-J per cent., representing an increase of nearly 50 per cent. During the regime of the Scullin Government, although the currency of certain countries depreciated, no steps were taken to counteract it.",55

131,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The Scullin Government took no action to relieve Great Britain, through our own depreciation. Take for instance, Japanese toys which were referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway) last night. On those goods, there is a foreign duty of 60 per cent., and a special duty of 30 per cent. Now, on account of depreciation, an additional duty of 40 per cent, may be imposed. Although the Government is taking steps to provide increased duties which will definitely assist the local manufacturer, it does not pretend that they will completely offset the depreciation of currency in other countries. It is a little illogical that we should still use sterling for calculating duties whether they are Customs Tariff [25 OCTOBER, paid on British or foreign goods. Although the last Government did give consideration to a proposal to base duties on Australian currency, it took no definite action.",55

138,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Who used it today?,56
139,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"It was used last night, by one honourable member. We should value our friendship and trade with nation that is buying so much from us, and should not antagonize it by making ill-considered statements.",56
140,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,The Minister has no right to imply that any honourable member on this side of the chamber has aroused antagonism against any other country.,56
141,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The reference of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) last night to ""the suggestion Japanese menace"" could be interdisallowance preted to be, at any rate, unfriendly to a nation that is friendly with us. Under section 4 of the Industries Prea servation Act, any goods sold for export at a price less than the domestic value are subject to a dumping duty. Under section 5, any goods sold below cost may 1933.] (Industries Preservation) Bill. 3943 be subject to a dumping duty. Under section 6, any goods sold on consignment may be subject to a dumping duty. Under section 7, a dumping freight duty may be applied. Under section S, with which we are now dealing, a dumping duty may be applied in respect of depreciated currencies. Under section 9, a dumping preference duty may be applied. What more is necessary to protect Australian industries ? I have already admitted that this provision does not make up the complete leeway after the depreciated currency has been converted into sterling, ? but after all, this is an experimental provision. We have made a great concession to Great Britain, and we shall be able, under this provision, to restrict the imports of any nation which, by reason of its depreciated currency, may be unnot dermining our own manufactures. I am certain that, as a result of the Government's action, which is based on the recommendation of the Tariff Board relating to the incidence of primage and exchange, Australia will have the benefit all, of a largely increased trade. suspended from 6.15 lo 8 p.m.",56
142,Sir LITTLETON GEOOM,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Darling Downs) [8.0] - If the motion is amended as suggested by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) a new principle will be embodied in our legislation. The object of the motion in its original form is to enable the Minister, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, to take certain action in regard to goods ima ported from countries with depreciated currencies. It is provided that upon the publication of a notice in the Gazette, duties shall be charged on a certain basis. The object of the amendment is to empower either House of the Parliament by resolution to disallow the imposition of such duties. We are, therefore, asked to allow a customs matter to be dealt with as if it were a regulation. The is that the procedure for the of a Gazette notice dealing with this subject shall be exactly similar to that followed for the disallowance of regulation. It may happen, therefore, ' that at some time when 'Parliament is in recess the Minister may publish a notice in the Gazette that will have theimmediate effect of increasing a rate of duty. ' But, subsequently, when Parliament re-assembles, either House may, by resolution, disallow the imposition of the duty. I u the meantime, duties will have been collected and the goods will have passed into general use. The making of any refund of duty would, in such circumstances, be very difficult.",56
143,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,If the duty were disallowed a refund would have to made.,57
144,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I am seeking to indicate the alteration in procedure that we are now asked to endorse. I must say that I prefer the original proposal of the Government. At present duties can be repealed only by the action of both Houses of Parliament. It would be wise to adhere to the Government's original intention. 'Dr EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [8.5] If the amendment is agreed to the new procedure would not differ materially from that now in vogue. At present increases of duty provided for in schedules tabled by the Government take immediate effect - without parliamentary approval. If the amendment is agreed to the new duties proclaimed would also become operative at once. It'is true that Parliament would have no say in that matter, but it has no say at present.",57

148,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I cannot see any substantial difference between the procedure now proposed and that which we already follow. Mr.'FENTON (Maribyrnong) [8.8} The honourable member for Darling Downs has raised an important point. The Tariff Board will be called upon to submit a report, and the Minister will act upon it ; but either House of the Parliament may subsequently disapprove of the Minister's action. I have no desire to speak disrespectfully of the Senate, but I suggest that it would be entirely contrary to our procedure in tariff matters to allow the Senate, by its own resolution, to disallow a duty. I can conceive of the most objectionable situations arising if duties are disallowed on the resolution of either House. If one House is to be placed in a more authoritative position than the other in this respect,' I say, unhesitatingly, that this chamber should take precedence. It is unthinkable surely that the Senate should be allowed to ride roughshod over this House. If the amendment of the honourable member for Swan is retained, extraordinary difficulties will arise for the Parliament, the Government, the Tariff Board, and the customs officers. I hope the Government will revert to its original proposal.",57
149,Mr FORDE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Capricornia) [8.10] Apparently the Minister g:ive his assent too readily to the proposal of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). He seems not to have thought about the difficulties that will arise if refunds of revenue have to be made in consequence of the disallowance of any aetion he may take during a parliamentary recess. Goods on which the increased duties have been imposed will have passed into consumption, and it will be impossible to follow them. The members of this chamber are more strongly protectionist in their sentiments than those of the Senate. During the regime of the last Government many tariff proposals approved by to this chamber were defeated in another place. It would be unfortunate for any government, if. the members of another place could, by the mere carrying of .a motion, disallow duties which had been imposed. I ask the Minister to give an the assurance that steps will be taken to safeguard the revenue in the event of the motion being carried in the amended form desired by the honourable member for Swan. It is probable that the position could be met by the immediate introduction of another tariff schedule to restore duties disallowed by another place, but the adoption of that course'would cut right across the spirit of this amendment.",57
150,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.12] - Certainl y the honourable member for Darling Downs' (Sir Littleton Groom) has raised an important point. Unfortunately, the honourable member who moved the amendment is not now in the chamber. When the Government intimated that it would accept the amendment, it was understood that it would be restated in certain respects for greater clarity. A customs bill was introduced into the Senate some time ago with the object of correcting certain anomalies, and the honourable member for Swan was anxious at that time that power should be given to disallow duties which Parliament had not 'validated. I suggest that the motion be carried in its amended form, and that any amendment found to be necessary be made in another place. Motion, as amended, agreed to. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended, and resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr White and Mr Guy do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill brought up by Mr WHITE, and read a first time. Motion (by Mr WHITE ) proposed - That the bill be now read a second time.",57
151,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Yarra) [8.18] - The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White) has admitted, as has every other honourable member who has spoken on the subject, that the proposal of the Government does not adequately meet the situation by protecting Australian industries. On the one hand, it has been claimed that the depreciated currency of a foreign country renders it liable to cer-' tain disabilities with regard to the purchase of its raw materials, but no honourable member who pays regard to the disparity in thefigures-that were used this afternoon disclosing that this proposal does not go much more than one-third of the way towards meeting the position, can argue, at any rate with good reason, that the disabilities which' will be suffered by a manufacturer in a foreign country which has a depreciated currency will anything like balance the disabilities likely to be suffered by the Australian manufacturer by competition from that foreign country. It has been claimed that, taking the cost of a group of articles as £2,100 in the country with the depreciated currency, those articles will be landed here at £1,140 less than if the currency of that country were at par,. And £480 is the only addition that is to be made under the present proposal ! It is absurd to claim that that will offset the disadvantages under which our manufacturers have to labour. The Minister has claimed that there are certain other matters which will offset those difficulties, but he has not been specific. Therefore, I protest against the Government's proposal, and I doubt whether it will be as effective as the section of the act which it is intended to repeal, although I do not like that section, because its operation is in many cases clumsy, having notification to apply to a specific country. I dislike the present proposal because I regard it as inadequate. The Minister deprecated the fact that "" Japan "" was mentioned at one stage of the debate by way of illustration, claiming that it might cause enmity between Australia and that country. I do not think one word has been said that could do that.",58
152,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Las t night the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) referred to "" the Japanese menace "".",58
153,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable memher referred only to the menace of the loss of trade to that country, and his remark cannot be interpreted in any other way.",58
154,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I hope that that is the case.,58
155,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I assure the honourable gentleman that that is so. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports would be the last person in this chamber to provoke enmity, and that may also be said of any other member on this side of the chamber. The hope of the world lies in cementing friendships. However, that does not mean that we should allow countries to send their goods to Australia to the detriment of our industries and people. No nation can take umbrage when another country imposes an effective protection for its own industries, and no nation has been more intent upon doing that than the one which has been mentioned. As a matter of fact, documents which were distributed at the World Economic Conference, showing the extent to which various countries have erected tariff barriers, indicate that Australia's action in this direction pales into insignificance compared with that of many other countries. Much has been said about the barriers raised by European countries alleged against Australian primary products. Germany did not raise barriers against our wheat merely to retaliate against Australia, but in order that its farmers should be encouraged to grow more wheat, to preclude any repetition of its experience when it was blockaded during the last war. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) asked the Minister to give an assurance that the proposals of Government meet the situation adequately-in other words that they give Australian industries that measure of tection which is expressed in the report the Tariff Board against countries which have depreciated currencies. I submit that the facts and figures which are stated in that report prove conclusively that the action of the Government is inadequate, and the admissions by the Minister afford added proof in that direction. The Government is not even preserving the margin of difference to British industries; therefore, it is only right that a protest should be made against its proposals.",58
156,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.26] - But for the protest that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin)' I should not have spoken again on the subject, as it - has been exhaustively debated. The right honourable gentleman bases his criticism on the argument that the proposal of the Government does not bring the costs of an industry in a country which has a depreciated currency up to the level of an industry in a country which is on the gold standard.",59
157,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"No , on a par with Australia, which is a different thing. The Government ought to introduce a formula that will not cut down our protective duties because of the depreciated currency of another country with which we trade.",59
158,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"In other words, the right honourable gentleman wants a formula which would completely nullify the effect of the depreciated currency in that other country. He also used a similar argument against the reduction of duties to Great Britain, but in that case Australia was the country with the depreciated currency. If a country like Japan, which has a depreciated currency as compared with our own, has to buy its raw materials outside of its own territoryand Japan has to do that, for she is the second greatest buyer of Australia's wool, and also has to buy her cotton, rubber and other raw materials abroad-the result is that her internal costs are raised as she buys with - a depreciated yen. That must be patent to the right honourable gentleman. It would not, then, be a fair thing to take the full amount of the depreciation on any goods that that country exthe ported any more than it would be fair for us to allow the full depreciation against Great Britain. In the case of Great pro- Britain, we have deducted only oneof quarter of the duty, or 12^ per cent, of the value of the goods, whichever is the less. The Tariff Board recommends that, when dealing with a country which has a depreciated currency, a reasonable addition to the duty will he a fraction of the value of the duty, that fraction to be determined by a formula which is embodied in its report. In the examples which are given it is clearly shown that the formula does not make up the margin of difference in the costs between the two countries; but as I have pointed out, on toys that are imported from Japan, there is a 60 per cent, duty, plus a further special duty of 30 per cent., plus freight and landing charges. The result is that our industries will not be jeopardized.",59
159,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I am very doubtful on that score.,59
160,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable gentleman has no monopoly of sympathy for Australian secondary industries. The fact that Australia is much more prosperous now than it was two years ago indicates, not only that the Government appreciates the point of view of the manufacturer, but also that it keeps in mind the great primary industries, on which our prosperity depends. Similar direful prophecies were made when the Ottawa agreement was being considered. If honourable members learn that any industry is suffering as the result of this legislation, let them bring the matter forward in this House. These jeremiads are invariably uttered by honourable members who wish to give effect to their own ideas as to the duties that should be imposed, instead of leaving the matter to a qualified board, which can make a proper survey of the position Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Exchange special duty).",59

These modifications, which represent reductions, are made for the purpose of adjusting the rates in accordance with the 'budget proposals. As honourable members know, those proposals reduce the duty on spirits. The amendments give effect to such reductions. The effect of the modifications is to reduce the duties on whisky for blending with Australian whisky by 3s. a gallon, and on other whisky by 5s. a gallon. The reason that the duty on whisky for blending is being reduced by 3s. compared with' 53. in the case of other whisky, is that when excise duty is paid on whisky used in blending, the benefit of the excise budget reduction of 2s. a gallon is obtained, thus bringing the total reduction to 5s., which is equal to the reduction on other imported whisky. - Mr R GREEN (Richmond) [8.44] Is the amount of the duty to he reduced from 45s. to 42s., or to 40s. ? The reduction, as stated in the budget, is 5s., but according to the Minister's statement, it appears to be 3s.. and I should like him to explain the reason for the alteration.",60
169,Mr GUY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Bass) [8.46] - The honourable member is correct in stating that the budget proposes a'reduction of duty of 5s. in respect of this item; but as I have (pointed out, the effect of the modifications is to reduce the duties on whisky for blending with Australian whisky by 3s. a gallon and on other whisky by 5s. a gallon. The reason, for the whisky for blending being reduced by 3s. a gallon as compared with 5s. a gallon in the case of the other whisky is that when excise duty is paid on the whisky used in the blending the benefit of the excise budget reduction of 2s. a gallon is obtained, thus bringing the total reduction to 5s.",61

171,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The excise would be paid only on the whisky which is used for blending, and I assume that the whisky in question would not be subject of .to both customs duty and excise. This seems to be a wonderful concession to certain people who use whisky for blending purposes.",61
172,Mr DENNIS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Batman) [8.48] - I am opposed to this alteration of duty, and I cannot understand why the Minister has not advanced any argument to support it. It will benefit the distilling industry which provides less employment than any other industry in proportion to the money expended. I cannot understand why the Government should be so ready to accept the Senate's request. To-day, during the discussion on Imperial Airways, it was suggested by certain, honourable members that pressure had been brought to bear on the Government with a view to giving certain concessions to a company. I should liko to know whether, in this instance, influence has been brought to bear upon the Government so that further concessions may be given to wealthy interests which are really in no need of them. As a matter of fact, during the depression the distilling and brewing industries continued to pay handsome dividends, and we are certainly entitled to certain information before we agree to this proposed alteration of duty.",61
173,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.51] - I would point out to the honourable member for Batman (Mr Dennis) that the budget statement sets out concessions, not only on whisky and on beer, but also on tea, to the extent of over £250,000. The Government in its budget has tried to make concessions to every class in the community. This concession permits of blending in bond. The Government receives in advance the duty of 14s. a gallon. The distillers are given the concession of blending imported whisky - with Australian whisky in bond, but when the whisky comes out of bond they have to pay the ful l duty. Motion agreed to.

Motion (by Mr Guv) proposed - That the requested amendment be made.",62
176,Mr THORBY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Calare) [8.56] - An important primary industry is seriously threatened by this proposal to reduce the duty on dates from 3d. to ld. per lb. I am opposed, to it because it would cut, the ground from under the feet of the dried fruits industries which the Commonwealth as well as the States have already tried to assist by legislation. It aims a serious blow at the dried fruits industry. We have to recognize that some of the governments of Australia have spent a considerable sum of money in settling returned soldiers on fruit-growing areas. There is no justification for a reduction of duty in respect of dates, for which commodity we have many substitutes such as prunes, dried tree fruits and other dried fruits. must also be remembered that dates are imported from, countries which do not. allow us to have a favourable trade balance with them. I am definitely opposed to the request.",62
177,Mr FORDE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Capricornia) [8.59] - I hope that the Government will reconsider its attitude in regard to this request. This matter was investigated by the Tariff Board, which recommended against any increase of duty. When the Scullin Government was in office, the Australian Dried Eruits Association made strong representations for an increased duty, and because it was the policy of that Government to assist primary as well as secondary industries, it was considered advisable to grant the request. According to the report of the Tariff Board dated the 22nd September, 3929, among those in favour of an increased duty were Mr D. C. Winterbottoin. member of the board of management of the Australian Dried Eruits Association; Mr J. M. Balfour, chairman of the Victorian Dried Fruits Board; Mr A. MCKinnon, director of Redcliffs Co-operative Packing Company; and Mr H . G. Howie, chairman of the board of management of Australian Dried Fruits Association. Those general. ' who were opposed to the increased duty were the representatives of importing interests which import into this country dates, which are largely used in place of lexias and raisins produced in Australia. A glance at the Tariff Board's report indicates clearly the country from which v/e receive most of the dates that are imported. In 1928-29, the latest year quoted by the board in its report, we imported 9,247,763 lb. of dates from Baghdad, Mesopotamia. No one knows better than the Minister (Mr White) the conditions that prevail in that country, for in his book, Guests of the Unspeakable, he referred to this country in the following graphic language:Itinerant carpet sellers, vendors of bighlyoolorod aherberts, noisy water carriers bending under the weight of dripping goat-skins, clamorous shopkeepers, haggling buyers, whining beggars and yelping mongrels make that babul of noise and medley of colour that is ever associated with au Eastern bazaar. Scribes with rccd pens, ink and sand, still squat ou the ground writing love-letters at the dictation nf amorous illiterates. Under ragged awnings that shade crate-like benches It along the Basra creek, the wiseacres and indolents of the town sit cross-legsed, sipping coffee and puffing many-stemmed iiarquilcs just as tlieir eighth-century prototypes did in this same city, when Harnun el' Baschid held sway in Baghdad. Yet the honourable gentleman is now asking us to approve of a request by the Senate that the duty ou dates from this country be reduced from 3d. to' Id. per lb. The Scullin Government imposed a duty of 3d. per lb. on dates at the request of the primary producers. The Australian Dried Fruit3 Association made strong representations on the subject. During the last four or five years the production of dried fruits in Australia has varied between 35,000 and 55,000 tons per annum. The last crop harvested yielded 60,000 tons of fruit. The total sales of dried fruits in Australia vary between 12,000 and 13,500 tons annually. This means that about 48,000 tons of last year's production of 60,000 tons must be exported. Dates compete seriously with lexias and raisins. In support of this contention I direct attention to the following statement made by Mr D. C. Winterbottom, a member of the board of management of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, in his evidence before the Tariff Board :It is felt that - dates compete with appreciably affect the sales of Australian dried fruits. The argument that dates do compete with raisins and sultanas is wrong, in that dates arc used in cakes and puddings and replace raisins. Mr J. M . Balfour, chairman of the Victorian Dried Fruits Board, endorsed the evidence tendered by Mr Winterbottom, and stated that, after ascertaining the views of the trade and also of housewives, he had formed . the opinion that dates definitely compete with Australian-grown lexias. Yet the Minister is favourable to this reduction of duty which must benefit the country which he so extravagantly described in his book. The average total sales of dates in Australia is between 3,500 and 4,000 tons per annum. If the sales of sultanas and lexias in Australia were increased by 2,000 tons per annum, which is about half the weight of the dates imported in 1927-28, the cash benefit to the growers would be the difference between the return from sales made overseas and those made in Australia-abou t £25 per ton or a total of £50,000. Although raisins, currants, sultanas, dried apricots, peaches, nectarines, and prunes, are protected by a duty of 6d. per lb., dates, which are produced under the lowest working standards in the world, are admitted into Australia under a duty of l d . per lb.",62
178,Mr MOBHIDE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Date s are not produced here. Mr Forde.,63
179,Mr FORDE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"But they enter into competition with lexias and sultanas which are produced here. The duty of 3d. per lb. should be retained. Why has the. Minister altered his attitude on this subject? Is he afraid to ask the committee to disagree with the request of the Senate? Some explanation should be given for this sudden change of front. Our dried fruits industry is one of the most efficiently conducted primary industries of the Commonwealth. As the growers have to export 48,000 tons of their total production of 60,000 tons, and sell at a loss on the overseas market, they should be given some consideration. It is true that they obtain a satisfactory price en the local market, but this is only fair because they are required to subscribe to the protectionist policy for secondary industries. An industry which observes such high standards as does the Australian dried and fruits industry deserves the most favourable consideration of the Government. I not hope that this request will be rejected.",63
180,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.7] - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) for directing attention to my humble literary effort. I am only sorry that the honourable gentleman did not have the same privilege that I had during the war of living in the country referred to by the honourable member. Had he done so he would realise that dates grown there do not compete with the excellent dried fruits produced on the Murray river settlements and in other parts of Australia, but are better fitted for the Arabs. A duty of 3d. per lb. on dates is equivalent to an impost of 278 per cent. I am surprised that the honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby) should oppose this reduction, for he has very often condemned duties of only 20 per cent, and 25 per cent, on goods produced by secondary industries. I am afraid that geographical considerations have influenced the honourable member to utter his protest. He probably fears that the reduction of this duty may adversely affect the prune-growers in his own electorate. The honourable member wrote to me some time ago in the interests of the prune-growers, and I am interested to find that he can so quickly switch off from prunes to dates.",63
181,Mr THORBY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I was careful to refer to the dried fruits industry generally.,64
182,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable member suggested in his letter to me that there was no reason why the duty on dates should be altered, while the prune-growers - were having such a difficult time.",64
183,Mr THORBY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I still support what I said in my letter.,64
184,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable gentleman asked me to suggest to the Government that it should not seriously consider the proposal for a reduction of the duty to l d . per lb. The Tariff Board has recommended a reduction which is equivalent to a reduction of one-third of 27S per cent., .which surely is not a heavy reduction. The Government has not regarded this request lightly; but has considered all the factors of the situation. The revenue will be affected to an amount of £73,000 per annum by this reduction.",64
185,Mr BEASLEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,But the Minister supported the higher duty when the schedule was under consideration in this chamber.,64
186,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"This particular' item went through without any discussion. If the honourable member for Calare is insistent in his request, I shall read the letter which he wrote me, but I am prepared to spare his blushes.",64
187,Mr THORBY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I rise to a point of order. The Minister is suggesting that I have written something that should not be read. I therefore ask that he read the letter which I wrote to him.,64
188,The CHAIRMAN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,That is no point of order.,64
189,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I am quite prepared to read the honourable member's letter. I shall first read a letter written to him by the secretary of the Prune Packers' Association of New South Wales to the following effect:This association has been informed, that there is an extreme probability of the duty of twopence ,per l'b. on dates being lifted, and as any remission of this nature will certainly have a detrimental effect to the dried fruits industry, and prunes in particular, and in which so many Australians arc engaged, I have heen instructed to write and ask you to do your utmost to prevent this alteration to the tariff. In forwarding that letter to me the honourable member wroteThe foregoing letter speaks for itself, I would be pleased to hear from you if there is any suggestion of this taking place. Personally I am of the opinion that there is no reason to alter this item at present while the prune men are having such a difficult time. Let me now inform honourable members of the difficult times that these prunegrowers are having. It will then be seen that the reduction of the duty on dates will not adversely affect the prune industry. The reason for this is clear. l Dates do not compete against prunes. The dates which are imported by Australia are almost entirely from Iraq, formerly called Mesopotamia, the country which cost Britain 90,000 lives during thewar, and which, recently, Britain has magnanimously given self government. The following figures show the importations of dates from Iraq over a number of years:lb. 1920-30 .. .. 10,171,000 1030-31 3.873.000 193132 .. .. 8,004,000 1932-33. .. .. 8,223,000 This amounts to one shipment each year. Honourable members know that the Australian dried fruits industry is on a sound footing. Only today I introduced the treaty that has just been made with New Zealand, which gives a concession of l d . per lb. to Australian dried fruits and will further assist the industry. The market for Australian prunes is steadily increasing, sales of the Australian product during the period 1929-30 to 1932-33 having increased from 700 tons to 2,000 tons. This increase is due mainly to the fact that, the trees planted by returned soldiers have recently come into bearing. Honourable members should think seriously before they reject the Senate's request by supporting the strange alliance that has been formed between the honourable member for Calare and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.",64
190,Mr THORBY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Calare) [9.16] - I am rather pleased that the Minister has read the letter from the Prune-growers Association, for I do object to a Minister referring to a document and then failing to read it after giving honourable members to understand that by doing so he would and embarrass somebody in the chamber. I strongly support every word that appears in the letter and in the footnote that I inscribed to the Minister in his official capacity. It proves that I am consistent in my attitude. Eegarding the Minister's criticism of my alleged inconsistency and his reference to my strange alliance with the high-tariff section in this Parliament, I point out that my objection is against the Government specially selecting a small item like this for a reversion to. the 1921-28 tariff. I have in mind also shelled almonds, which caused an interesting position in this chamber some - months ago. If the Government were prepared to restore all primary and secondary products to the 1921-2S schedule, I should be quite satisfied; but I do object to its selecting a competitive line and reducing the duty on it from - 3d. to I d . , leaving the dried fruit-growers in a precarious position, for they still have to pay high duties on practically every article used by them for production purposes.",64
191,Mr GABB,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Angas) [9.20] - Eve n at the risk of being criticized for being inconsistent, I ask that the request of the Senate shall not be agreed to. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Forde) was quite right when he said that the dried fruit s industry made representations to the Scullin. Government to increase duties on dates, for I had something to say on that subject. The Minister takes the stand that the importation of cheap dates does not compete with Australian dried fruits. Perhaps he will explain away a letter which I have received from the secretary of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, and which reads as follows:Referring to the tariff debate which took place in the Senate on the 12th instant, when a motion was carried recommending that the tariff on dates be reduced from 3d. to Id. per lb., I. have to advise that this inatter was considered by my board at their meeting in Melbourne last week, and I was requested to communicate with you and ask for your support when this matter comes up for discussion in the House of Representatives. My association have always claimed that a ' higher duty on dates would' increase the sale of Australian lexias, and this is borne out by the fact that, since the extra duty came into operation, our sales have increased, ior whereas in 1930 the sales were 2,170 tons, they were 2,410 tons in 1931 and 2,407 in 1932. I would also point out that owing to the depreciated currency of the date-producing countries, our industry would be seriously imperilled if the duty were reduced to ld. per lb. and here it joins issue with the figures supplied by the Minister for whereas in 1929 the imports of dates were 4,084 tons of a value of £107,196, the imports in 1932, amounting to 4,067, were valued at £47,460. You will thus see that if the duty were reduced, dates could be sold in this country at a very low price. Thanking you in anticipation for your assistance. The Government cannot honestly deny that the importation of cheap dates brings them into competition with our dried fruits. Had the Minister any knowledge of the grocery trade he would uot endeavour to put up such a flimsy argument, for persons will always buy dates at 4|d. and 5d. per lb. in preference to raisins at 7d. and lOd. per lb. The Minister declared that a duty of 3d. per lb. represents a duty of 278 per eent. I admit that that nearly makes me ashamed of myself for having to oppose it , but if that is the case what is the initia l cost of the dates? Does the Government intend to countenance the admission of dates which cost about I d . per lb. to compete with the products of our dried fruit s industries? The honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby) said that a good deal of government money is invested in Australian dried fruit s industries, also that many returned soldiers are engaged in them. I know that that is. the position in connection with the irrigation settlements in South Australia. It is inexplicable to me that a government which has increased duties in many directions should be prepared to uncover our dried f r u it s industries to any extent to the competition of cheap foreign dates. It is not my nature to make appeals: I would rather give and take hard knocks, but I appeal to the Government to stand by our dried f r u it s industry. Surely it does not propose to throw in the towel to the Senate, and disregard the interests of our primary producers? I am somewhat disappointed that this industry has obtained a preference of only I d . per lb. and that on raisins only, under the agreement that has been made with New Zealand; at least 2d. per lb. was anticipated. Further, it is not clear from the Minister's statement whether that preference will apply only to lexias or to all classes of raisins.",65
192,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,It will apply to all classes of raisins.,66
193,Mr GABB,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I appeal to the Country party to support mc in this matter. remind its members that their leader associated himself with me in the "" battle of the almonds,"" when he said that the duty proposed by the Government was not scientific, rallied his forces and saved the day. The Minister said that the dried fruits industry is in 'good circumstances. It is in better circumstances than some other primary industries, but the credit for that is due to organization. I hope that the Minister will give further encouragement to it by not permitting the competition of cheaply-produced dates. I urge the committee to reject this request.",66
194,Mr MCCLELLAND,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Wimmera) [9.31]. - Althoug h I have consistently advocated the lowering of the extremely high tariff wall which has beeu built around this continent, I make no apology for opposing this suggested reduction. My chief reason, generally speaking, for favoring the reduction of our high tariff is that it has the effect, of increasing the costs of our export industries. As this reduction, in my opinion, is likely to endanger one of Australia's export industries, I must oppose it. Having listened to the speech of the Minister (Mr White) I believe that there is still hope for him and for Australia. Honourable members must have a vivid recollection of the vigour with which, a few months ago, the honourable gentleman opposed any reductions of the tariff items. It , therefore, comes as a great surprise to me to find him so willing to agree to the request of another place to reduce a duty by one-third. Millions of pounds of the country's money has been expended on the construction of works to safeguard - the dried fruits industry, apart from the private capital invested in that industry. I am confident that honourable members will agree that if there are any industries in this country which require the special consideration of this Parliament at the moment, they are our export industries, some of which are in a particularly precarious condition.",66
195,Mr HAWKER,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Wakefield) [9.35] If anything would induce me to vote for a comparatively high duty such as this is, it is the cheap and unjustifiable sneers I of the Minister at the honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby) and other members of the Country party who support the original duty. I propose to support the request of the Senate, however, because I believe that one docs more to help primary industries by acting along consistent lines. But, at the same time, it is absolutely unfair to compare the percentages of a duty in relation to the terrifically low prices of a period of depression, with the percentages of duty on manufactured articles, which maintain an average price in both good and bad times. Primary industries do not maintain prices by reducing production as the price-level falls, and for that reason their prices fluctuate to a much greater extent than do those of secondary industries; and.it is always necessary to have a much higher ad valorem duty to provide for them anything like the amount of shelter that is afforded to secondary industries. It appears to me, however, that l d . per lb. is fair protection, because even at the higher prices of normal times, it amounts to between 40 per cent, .and 50 per cent, ad valorem, which I have always contended should be ample to protect any Australian industry. Dates do not enter into devastating competition with Australian dried fruits generally. It is mainly the lexia growers who are concerned about competition from this source. Dates are bought because they are a cheap sweetmeat, and on that account they enter into competition with prunes, crystallized cherries, and other forms of dried fruits which are used for a similar purpose. But they compete with Australian fruits principally in connection with cake3 and puddings. According to figures submitted by the Australian Dried Fruits Association, the imports of dates have totalled approximately 4,000 tons a year, whether the duty has been l d . or 3d. per lb. Therefore, it does not appear to me that the effect on the sale of lexias has been very great. The sales of that dried fruit on the Australian market have risen from 2,000 to 2,400 tons per annum, in spite of the depression. I find it very difficult to believe, therefore, that the reduction of the duty to l d . per lb. have a serious effect on Australian dried fruits. On the other hand, however, the revenue would drop to the extent of £73,000, and it would be possible for dates to be purchased more cheaply. There is a further inconsistency in the attitude adopted by the Minister. The honourable gentleman introduced this schedule with the duty at 3d. per lb. in spite of the report of the Tariff Board, but took no action with respect to raisins, the duty on which was raised from 3d. to 6d. per lb. by the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde), when Minister for Trade and Customs. I have been told by representatives of the dried fruits industry that they did not ask for the latter increase, and that it has made no difference to them. If the Minister was really concerned about the price of these condiments, one would expect him to refer both items to the Tariff Board; but he did not do so. Apparently he has derived some pleasure from the situation which the Senate has brought to a head, in which he appears to think that certain members of the committee are acting inconsistently. That has not my endorsement. I am. fully aware of the penalties imposed upon export industries by the maintenance of very high duties on items which those industries need to carry on. Although I have considerable sympathy with honourable members who feel that they must defend very high protection of primary products while such high duties are imposed on what primary producers have to buy, I still believe that, in the . long run, one can do more good for the export industries by supporting consistently the lowering of duties to a moderate and reasonable level.",66
196,Mr BLAKELEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Darling) [9.44] The Minister (Mr White) and the Government are at least consistent in their policy of slashing Australian industries. Even on this item the Minister found it advisable to drag in the Ottawa agreement. been amused at the dissembling of my friends of the Country party, who are very strong free traders so far as agricultural implements are concerned, yet go almost mad when mention is made of would the prices of such goods as shirts, trousers, and mattocks, and of imposing duties which will enable Australian companies to employ Australian labour and use Australian materials in their manufacture. I cannot follow the extraordinary mental gymnastics of honourable members who have free trade-.protectionist views. They will fight to the last ditch to protect the onion or the potato industry, but make no effort to protect the secondary industries, some of which use the products of the primary producers. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker) was at least reluctantly consistent; but, in order to bring down the cost of production so as to relieve the primary producers of the alleged awful burden of sustaining the secondary industries, he is prepared to support a reduction of duty even though it be to the detriment of the dried-fruit growers. The honourable member, in support of this reduction of duty on dates from 3d. to Id. per lb., stated that some people had acquired a taste for that product. There are p. number of people who like dates as such, and not because they are cheap sweetmeats; but the honourable member believes that if a person requires dates, he should be allowed to obtain them, and that attitude is, of course, consistent with his free trade principles. He has consistently stated that the primary producers should be given opportunities to obtain their requirements in the cheapest market. He is prepared to give some preference to Great Britain; but, if the farmers' requirements cannot be purchased there, he contends that they should be purchased from any foreign country, no matter what the effect may be upon our own manufacturers. If our secondary industries were allowed to go out of existence, I am afraid that the primary producers would soon rise in their wrath and consign the Government to oblivion for leaving them at the mercy of outside competition. If any other country could produce the merino wool and milling wheat that are produced in Australia, the members of the Country party would not I have be so prone to advocate free trade. The tariff schedule was considered by the Senate at a time when this House was in recess, and honourable senators having, as it were, the ring to themselves, threw prudence to the winds, and apparently, with little discussion, saw fit to make a request for a decreased duty.",67
197,The CHAIRMAN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,The honourable member is out of order in reflecting upon the Senate.,68
198,Mr BLAKELEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"After some discussion, the honourable senators decided to attack an Australian primary industry by leaving it open to foreign competition. The Government is weakly supporting the Senate, but I am pleased to say that the Country party in this chamber is protesting against the weakness of the Minister. I should like to know how a reduction of duty on dates will lower the cost of production in this country. Perhaps the honourable member for Wakefield will enlighten me on that matter. I * protest against the insistent attacks which are being made directly and indirectly by the Government upon certain Australian industries. Our primary industries cannot exist without our secondary industries, and unless we encourage industries like the dried fruit industry and our secondary industries, unemployment will increase, the purchasing power of the community will be detrimentally affected and little money will be available for the purchase of primary products. We cannot exist exclusively upon our export trade.",68
199,Mr NAIRN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Perth) [9.55] - I believe that if people like dates they should have an opportunity to obtain them at a reasonable .price. . One of the chief complaints - which I have against excessive duties, such as the duty on dates, is that they frequently compel people to purchase cheap and nasty goods which they otherwise would not use. I have several times been associated with the Country party in endeavouring to obtain reductions of duty; and it is to me rather distressing to find that when some little industry, which affects one or two country constituents, is under consideration, one or two honourable members will depart altogether from their principles in order to obtain some small benefit for the localities which they represent. In obtaining those small advantages they do a great deal of injury to the larger rural interests Which they are supposed to represent. For the main part our rural industries are able to take care of themselves and the nominal protection which they receive under the tariff is, in most instances, of little or no value' to them. Dates are not' produced in Australia and I do not know of any other fruit which quite meets the same class of taste. It is true that dates may be used as a substitute for raisins, but we do not exclude food items from this country entirely on that ground. Tea is a very useful article of drink, but we would not exclude it merely to encourage the sale of Australian drinks. Dates are a useful and healthy food, and it is desirable that they should be available to the public at a reasonable price. A duty of Id., which represents a protection of nearly 100 per cent., is fair and reasonable.  have consistently opposed the increased duties imposed by the Scullin Government, and I am glad indeed to support the Senate's request. I agree with what has been said by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker). I believe that consistent reductions of duties will tend to reduce the cost of living, and a reduction of duty on dates will assist in that direction. The honourable member sympathized with those honourable members who opposed the Scullin tariff and were now opposing this reduction of duty, but that has happened only because of the inconsistency which has been shown in not reducing high tariffs generally. Had the tariff been reduced in accordance with the request of the Country party to the level of the 1921 tariff, there would have been no inconsistency on the part of the Government and members of the Country party, who, on principle, advooate reduced duties. Half a loaf is better than no loaf at all and I am prepared to accept reductions of duty as they are made. I shall continue to fight for such a redaction of duties as will bring our secondary industries to a position of equality with our primary exporting industries. There should be equality of sacrifice and of competition. I am pleased that a reduction of this duty has been requested by the Senate. My constituents use a considerable quantity of dried fruits, but I do not think that they or the other people of Australia wish to be deprived altogether of dates. Figures quoted in this debate have shown that Australia is consuming approximately the same quantity of dates now as in better times. I liken the duty on dates to the duty on soft timbers. We do not produce either article to any extent. There is no cause for us to wear a hair shirt and endure unnecessary discomfort. It is unreasonable to prevent our people from buying dates occasionally if they desire to do so, even though dates may be a'luxury, and this heavy duty has not prevented them from doing so. I do not think that it can be argued that the heavy duty on dates has helped the dried fruits industry.",68
200,Mr WATKINS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Newcastle) [10.2] I am opposed to this request, but for a different reason from that which actuates certain members of the Country party. The party to which I belong believes in protecting all our primary and secondary industries. Honourable members who speak of dates as a luxury seem to forget that dates are stamped into tlieir packages hy the bare feet of the Arabs. I become very tired of hearing honourable members condemn our local industries. It is high time in this Parliament we adopted a national outlook. We should substantially support Australian industries. I shall, therefore, oppose the request of the Senate.",69
201,Mr NOCK,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Riverina) [10.4] - I represent an electorate in which a good deal of dried fruit is produced, and I have been requested to oppose this request by the Senate, but 1 do not intend to do so. As the Country party is fighting for moderate tariffs, I . do not think that it would be consistent for its members to oppose a request for a reduction of a duty amounting to 27S per cent. It has been suggested"" that an increase in the consumption of dates would adversely affect the consumption of dried fruits, but I have not been convinced on that point. While I was in business years ago, an adjustment made in the duty on dates did not cause people to substitute dried fruits for dates. If they were not able to buy dates because of the higher price, they did not buy more dried fruit3. It is interesting to learn that, in spite of the higher rate of duty, our importation of dates was practically the same in 1932 as in 1929. This shows, to my mind, that, the tariff has not affected the consumption of these goods. I cannot believe that a reduction of the price of dates by even one penny per lb., in consequence of this' reduced duty, would adversely affect the dried fruits industry. Consumers who want dates will buy them if they can afford them; but if they cannot afford them they will not buy dried fruits as substitutes. Even under the reduced duty the price of dates will exceed the price at which our dried fruit is exported. I therefore support the Senate's request.

204,Mr GABB,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Angas) [10.17] - I wish to deal with one or two statements that have been made by honourable members. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) said that imports of dates into Australia averaged about 4,000 tons. It is true that in 1929 the quantity imported was 4,084 tons, which fell in 1932 to 4,067 tons, but those two sets of figures should not be compared because the depression occurred in the interval, proving conclusively that, in spite of the increased duty, the demand for dates has remained strong. Tho increase in the consumption raisins in Australia-and I presume this refers only to loxias-wa s 237 tons greater in 1932 than in 1930, proving that, despite the depression, the duties imposed ou dates by the Scullin Governgreatest ment, assisted the raisin-growing industry. The Minister has promised to make effort on behalf of the growers of doradillo grapes. It is possible for a muscat to be grafted on to a doradillo vine, and ask the honourable gentleman not to do thing that will discourage a move in that direction. Particularly do . I ask the honourable gentleman to preserve the inaction terests of returned soldiers who are gaged in the production of dried fruits.",70
205,Mr LANE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Barton) [10.20] - I hope that the committee will not accept the advice of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). Ten years ago when I visited the dried fruits areas on the Murray, I was informed that a month previously a resolution had been adopted providing for the discontinuance of growused ing doradillo grapes. Apparently, nothing has been done in that direction in the interim. It, is remarkable that the Government should endeavour to compel the poorer sections of the community to buy expenby sive dried fruits rather than cheap dates. It is impossible to produce dates in Australia on a commercial basis, and as the two articles of diet are quite dissimilar, the honourable member for Angas and those who agree with him on this subject are distorting the issue in drawing comparisons between the two; we should make the rate of duty on dates as low as possible. I remind honourable members that the growers of dried fruits are particularly well organized and, as a result, have reaped considerable benefit from the Government.",70
206,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.23] - I believe that, excepting the speeches that have been made from the Labour benches, the objections raised to the requests by the Senate have been influenced hy geographical rather than economical considerations. I cannot allow the opening remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker) to pass unchallenged. He said of that I had indulged in cheap sneers at the expense of the dried fruits industry. I assure him' that the misstatement will notdamage me in the eyes of returned soldier growers, for whom I have the admiration, and whose properties on the Murray I'visited recently in company with the honourable gentleman, an and the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). It is not just a matter of being sympathetic, and wishing those I growers well. The honourable member for anyWakefield knows what 'the Government has already done for the wiue industry, and the approval which has greeted its in that direction. He is also aware enthat a scheme has been submitted to the Government of South Australia in respect of growers of doradillo grapes, the details of which I cannot now disclose, but which, I think, will be acceptable to all concerned. I appreciate some of the difficulties under which the growers of dried fruits labour. Eor instance, while there was no primage on cornsacks or on hessian in the manufacture of cornsacks, it was charged on hessian used in the production of dried fruits. Recently I urged upon the Government the desirability of removing that impost, also the primage on caustic soda and other commodities used growers, with the result that they received concessions to the extent of £37,000. I mention that, because, if I allowed it to go unchallenged, the statein ment of the honourable member might believed. The honourable member for Angas stated that there had been definite ingoods. creases in the dried fruits industry. That is so and it is hoped that they will continue. The Government has decreased taxation on the industry, and has gained additional advantages for it through the medium of the agreement made with the New Zealand Government. I recently importation received a deputation at Mildura which put forward the contention that if dates - were admitted at a lower rate of duty dates. they would compete with our dried fruits. It is just as logical to claim apples compete with oranges, or biscuits importation with bread. In its report on the subject, the Tariff Board statedThe evidence submitted on behalf of the applicant association has failed to satisfy board that dates can be regarded as peting wit h sultanas or lexias in the sense that the applicants claim that they are. far as the figures presented are concerned, these could probably be used with equal force as an argument by cither those favouring request or those opposing it . The subject has been thoroughly disthat cussed, and, although the Government will he losing £73,000 in revenue hy reducing the duty on dates to ltl. per lb., I formally ask the committee to agree to the request of the Senate.",70
207,Mr HAWKER,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,- I rise to make a sonal explanation. The Minister Trade and Customs (Mr White) declared that I accused him of making cheap sneers at the dried fruits industry. Apparof ently the honourable member misheard I said that he was making cheap sneers at the attitude adopted hy the honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby) and others. I regret that the Minister so readily possessed himself of the cap which was not really intended for him.,71
208,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Grafton) [10.38]. - - I have been waiting patiently for the Minister to advance some reason why has approved the request that is before divided. the committee. When the matter of the duty on dates last came before this chamber, the Government supported a rate of 3d. per lb. Now it recommends a reduction to Id., and advances no reason for its change of attitude. The Minister says that he does not like to sacrifice £73,000 revenue. I should prefer to see that be amount spant in other directions, for instance, by eliminating the primage duty on all protective items against British I have never been able to convince myself that the duty on dates has accomplished its object so far as the .dried fruits industry is concerned. The proof is shown in the figures which relate to the of dates. In 1929, before.it had fallen into the trough of the depression, Australia imported 10,700,000 lb., of In 1932, though the duty of 3d. had been imposed and the that depression had come upon us, the of dates was still 9,750,000 lb. So that although Australia has been indescribably poorer during the last three years and the duty on dates has the been increased to 3d. per lb., the importacomtions have remained about the same, It is true that they were dearer than preSo viously. In these circumstances, it is hard to believe that the duty has had the effect the of improving to any appreciable extent the sales of dried fruits. I am convinced what we have to do is to reduce as far as possible the cost of living, and the cost of production. That would benefit the dried fruits industry to a greater extent than any other action. Something like SO per cent, of the total quantity of dried fruits produced has perto be sent overseas for sale under for open competitive conditions. I am not much concerned about this particular item, except from a revenue point view. If the Government has £73,000 me. to throw away, I would much sooner it was used in other directions where cost of production would be more directly affected; but failing that I am prepared to vote in such a way that the cost of living, and, consequently, the cost of production, may be reduced.

209,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.39] - I m o v e That the requested amendment be made. This request is made as the result of a recommendation of the Tariff Board dated as late as the 9th June last. If it is agreed to, the following will he the position compared with the Scullin tariff and ihe 3 921-30 tariff:Com pared with Scullin tariffBulk cornflour-reductio n of, per lb., British, l } d . : foreign, Jd. Cornflour in packets-reductio n of, per lb., British, Id.; foreign, - . AYES. Compared with 1021-30 t a r if f Bulk cornflour-reductio n of i d . per lb. British, and an increase of £d. per lb. foreign. Cornflour in packets-increas e of ld. per lb. foreign. The addition to the item of the words ""' starch flour containing maize"" is designed to overcome au administrative difficulty with regard to the tariff classification of certain commercial grades of cornflour, which are not cornflour as the layNOES.' man knows it, although it is derived from the same source as, and is similar in appearance to, ordinary cornflour. The amendment of the item along these lines confirms departmental practice - with rt'gar.d to the duty on these commercial grades of cornflour. The Tariff Board found the position to be as follows:(a) The lowest price of Australian cornflour delivered into store is £39 6s. 3d. per long ton, while the cheapest Scottish cornflour could be landed into store free PAIR. of duty and primage, but including present exchange, at £17 5s. l d . per long ton. (b) The customs duties have resulted in Australian consumers paying £22 Is. 2d. more per ton than if imported cornflour were available duty free. (c) If wages and cost of maize were deducted from the selling price of Australian cornflour, local manufacturers would still be unable to compete against imported cornflour landed duty free under the present exchange. (d) Although there is a large margin household use, per lb., between the prices paid for maize by the British, l f d . ; general, Australian and the Scottish cornflour 2Jd. manufacturers, 5s. a bushel in the one instance and 2s. 2d. in the other; after hold use, per lb., British, eliminating maize costs, the amount re2d.: general, 3d. maining for other costs and profits is£ s. d. Australian, including delivery charges into store .. 25 19 7 Scottish-Highes t grade 10-14 5 Lowest grade 4 9 5 (e) This huge difference in the amount of other costs and profits suggests that the manufacture of cornflour in Australia is either uneconomic, or is returning inordinately large profits to the local manufacturer. (/) <No matter which conclusion is accepted, the fact remains that the local prices are unreasonably high compared with prices in other countries. (g) After allowing for all' local disabilities, the board considers that a higher duty thau'lifd. per lb., equal to £16 6s. Sd. u ton, on British cornflour, is not warranted. A duty of l^d. per lb. is equivalent to 90 per cent, ad valorem oil the highest, and of 145 per cent, on the lowest price quoted at the Tariff Board inquiry for Scottish cornflour in bulk. The duty of 2d. per lb. on cornflour in packets is equal to 60 per cent, ad valorem on good.brands of English cornflour. The margin of Id. per lb. between the British and the general tariff rates shouldenable the Dnited Kingdom to secure any orders which are likely to be placed overseas. A number of other details are included in the report, of the board, which I hope that honourable members have read.",72
210,Mr FORDE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Capricornia) [10.45] If the Government - accepts the Senate's request, it will strike another blow at a large section of primary producers. I hope that this committee, after an examination of the facts, will decide to reject this request because, if carried, it will lead to unemployment in both primary and secondary industries. Thousands of maize-growers will suffer, and hundreds of workers in the maize products factories ofSydney, Melbourne and Adelaide will be put on part-time employment. The only advantage will be gained by the cornflour manufacturers of Scotland, who manufacture their products from black-grown maize. Black-grown maize has been the bugbear of Australian maize producers for many years. Under the South African reciprocal treaty of 1906, the duty on maize from which cornflour is manufactured was Is. per central, and to protect the maize-growers of Australia, the Commonwealth Government, in 1925, - after an investigation by the Tariff Board, decided to increase the duty to 3s. 6d. per central. Among the witnesses who gave evidence before the Tariff Board, and supported higher duties, was the present Deputy Leader of the Country  I must draw your attention to what must he a. self evident far-t r.o members of Board. With respect to South Africa, it is a question of very cheap black labour as against highly pairl Australian labour. At that time, the duiy was Is. 6d. per central, and the request was for an increase to 3s. 6cl. per central. I ask the honourable member for Gippsland to allow the same considerations as weighed with him then, to weigh with him to-night. Subsequently, a duty of 3s. 6d. per central was imposed by the government of the day, and, at that time, it was considered to be prohibitive. The honourable member for Gippsland submitted to the chairman of the Tariff Board a letter from Mr W. Cunirnings of Orbost, portion of. which readThe cost of producing maize in Orbost districts is 4s. 1 ld. per bushel. As the selling price in Melbourne has been very much below that for some time, you will recognize the necessity for an increase in the import duty charged on South African maize. ;i>i we cannot hope to compete against the cheap labour obtainable in that country. Mr Cunirnings asked for a duty of 3s. 6d. per central against South African maize. The honourable member for Gippsland said that he bad never known Mr Cummings to overstate his case, and that his statements were always well within the mark. In other words, he supported an increase nf over 100 per cent, on the duty then obtaining. The maize-grower is forced to buy his requirements in a highly protected market, and it would be inequitable to deny him the local market for his products. The Senate's request, if accepted, will mean a reduction of duty on cornflour from 3d. to l-Jd. per lb. British, and 2-Jd per lb. general, plus further reductions under the tariff exchange adjustment proposals, and will thus make the duty lower than it has been at any time during the last two decades.",73
211,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"That , is not correct. The duty was l d . in 192.1, and - id. later in that year.",73
212,Mr FORDE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"That was before the 192.1-28 tariff to which the members of the Country party are anxious to revert. There are quite a number of manufacturers of cornflour in Australia, among them being Clifford Love and Company Limited, Sydney, Maize Products Proprietary Limited, Melbourne and Sydney, the Tariff and Parsons Brothers and Company Proprietary Limited, Melbourne. That the old rate of duty is ineffective can be judged from the following list of importations of cornflour:1924-25 .. .. 299,000 1925-26 .. .. .. 501,000 192627 .. .. 932,000 1927-28 .. .. .. 1,330,000 1928-29 .. .. .. 1,032,000 In five years approximately 2,000 tons of cornflour were imported, with a corresplendid sponding loss to the Australian maizealthough growers of the purchase of 160,000 bushels of maize. The great problem of the maize-growers is the disposal of their product in the smail local market. If they are forced to ship maize overseas, and to compete with the product of black-labour countries, their industry will become unpaycornflour able. Their difficulties can be overconditions come only when the secondary industries of Australia so develop as to greatly increase the local market. The products manufacturers pay a high prict for maize, as will be shown by the followprotection ing prices which were submitted to the board:192S .. .. .. . . 4 4 1929 .. .. .. .. 5 10 1930 .. .. .. ' . . 5 3 1931 .. .. .. .. 3 ti 1932 .. .. .. .. 4 114 1933 .. .. .. ..5 8 Evidence was also submitted that the price of maize in America, as taken the Sydney Morning Herald of the January, i933, was as low as 7 cents, 3^d. a bushel. A fair average price was given at 21 cents, or 10£d. bushel, as against 5s. Sd. which was paid in Australia hy the maize products facturers. The Queensland growers, their evidence before the Tariff Board, stated that their position was so serious that any action tending to reduce the labour. market for; or lower the price of, their product would be a calamity. If the Minister persists in accepting the Senate's request, he will place a great hardship consumers? upon not only the maize-grow.crs, but also the employees in the industry.",73
213,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Maribyrnong) [10.57]. - I am surprised at the Minister lightly accepting a recommendation of the Tariff 'Board. The trouble in connection with the investigations of the Tariff Board is that the Australian manufacturer has to prove his case to the hilt, whereas the lb. evidence of the importing interests is accepted unless it can he refuted by local interests. The maize industry, in a number of districts throughout the Commonwealth, has reached a high state of efficiency. I speak more particularly of the maize fields of Yictoria, and the work that has been done there, the growers are a considerable distance from their market. Maize is used for many purposes. It is manufactured into cornflour, and there are .many by-products, such as glucose and other articles. In the evidence given before the Tariff Board, it was said that no additional protection was granted to the manufacturers, and that the being so unequal, the foreign manufacturer marketed no less than 2,000 tons of cornflour in Australia between maize 1925 and 1929. That was done even after the high duty was imposed for the of the local maize-growers. I was glad to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) quote the Per bushel. evidence that was given before the board s. d. by the Deputy Leader of the Country  was certainly able to testify to the accuracy of the evidence given by the maize-growers. It is impossible for the Australian maize-growers successfully to face competition from the maize grown from by black labour in South Africa or the 19th similarly poorly-paid labour in the or Argentine. The Scottish cornflour manufacturers are able to obtain their supplies of maize from these countries at approxia mately 2s. 2d. a bushel whereas the average price paid .by the Australian cornmanuflour manufacturers is 5s. a bushel. in Surely the Government realizes the reasonableness of assisting this industry, which employs a considerable amount of Mr E. F. HARRISON - What about the",74
214,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable member is probably unaware that 1-lb. packets of the best quality cornflour cost 9d. in Great Britain and only 7d. in Australia. If the manufacturing side of the maize industry is adversely affected by this alteration of duty there is no doubt that the producing side of it will also be badly hit. If the production of cornflour ceases in Australia the price of this article will immediately increase. That has heen our experience in connection with other imported manufactured goods, and it will certainly he so in connection with cornflour. I sincerely hope that the Government not force a vote on this issue this evening. It should be remembered that the Tariff Eoard made its recommendation in the face of the strongest support of the maizegrowing interests of Queensland, New South ""Wales and Victoria for the maintenance of a duty of 3d. per lb. It was pointed out clearly that even with the duty at that figure the consumers of cornflour in Australia were not penalized. My experience over a long period of years has been that local manufacturers do not fleece the consumers. It has been proved over and over again, that prices of commodities recede when* the manufacture of them is undertaken in this country. If adequate protection is denied the cornflour manufacturers, and they are obliged to cease operations, I am .sure that the price of cornflour will immediately advance in Australia. It is stated in the report of the Tariff Board that an exhaustive examination of the manufacturing accounts and balance sheets of the Australian cornflour manufacturers was made. But I point out that no such examination was made by the board of the accounts and balance-sheets of the overseas manufacturers who will benefit so greatly by a reduction of the duty. This is unfair to the Australian industry. It is honourable members to display an interest in this industry after factories have been closed and employees have been, dismissed. If this Government had one dominant desire while I was a member of the Cabinet, it was to prevent the dismissal of workers. Everything possible was done at that time to assist all our manufacturing industries to maintain operations.",74
215,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,That was where the Government blundered.,75
216,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I am astonished to hear that interjection; but I realise that the honourable member for Swan (Mr to Gregory) cannot be convinced of the wisdom of protection. I have often been surprised that honourable members who sit in this Parliament and, with remarkable persistence, advocate the claims of foreign industries to favourable treatment by Australia, do not seek seats in the parliaments of the countries in the welfare of will which they show such concern. Cornflour is a most expensive food product to manufacture. A continuous water process is necessary, extending over ten days from the time the maize is ground and soaked, and an additional three days are required to prepare the cornflour for packing. The Australian cornflour manufacturers have not exploited the consumers. I ask honourable members to consider why it is that Brown and Polsen's Scotch cornflour, No. 1 quality, is sold in England at 9d. per 1-lb. packet while exactly the same quality of Australian cornflour is sold here at 7d. per 1-lb. packet.",75
217,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,The figures quoted by the honourable member are out of date.,75
218,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I am more inclined to place reliance on my figures than on those which the Minister may have.,75
219,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I have had up-to-date figures furnished to me by cable.,75
220,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Cable d figures are not always convincing. I am quite satisfied that even if the Minister is able to influence a majority of honourable members to vote in favour of this reduction of duty he will regret it, for he will find that additional unemployment will be too late for caused in the industry.",75
221,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"We shall see. "" Mr Fenton - It is too late to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. Why should we allow disaster to overtake this industry? I should like some honourable members of this Parliament to be dependent for a while for their livelihood on the votes .cast in this chamber on tariff matters. It would very greatly influence their future conduct. A reduction of duty such as is now proposed will undoubtedly place the maize-growing industry in a precarious position. A sacrifice of approximately £125,000 will be required by the Australian maize-growers in order effect a saving of between £16,000 and £20,0.00 in the price of cornflour. The reduction of duty now proposed will involve a loss of employment to not less than 500 persons if the various ramifications of the maize industry are taken into consideration. One memher of the Tariff Board, who is himself a grower of cereals other than maize, made repeated references during the inquiry into this industry to the high price obtained for maize compared with that obtained for wheat, barley and oats. Why should a grower of one class of cereals complain because the growers of other classes of cereals obtain fair prices for their products? We have been told that the members of the Tariff Board are tariff experts-the board is now called a board of expertsbut they are not the only experts in Australia, and certainly I do not think that they are so expert .in regard to the cornflour industry as those with whom I have been in touch. In dealing with another industry some little time ago, the board made the following report:It might be advanced by the manufacturers in the United Kingdom that the additional duties, if imposed, would have the effect of excluding their product from the Australian market. In this connection, it is pointed out that the manufacturers concerned are well aware of the policy of the Commonwealth to establish and foster its own industries as far as practicable, aud the same opportunity was available to them to establish themselves in Australia as manufacturers as was open to those United Kingdom manufacturers who did so. The board considers it is the duty of the Commonwealth to look after the interests of those who did undertake manufacture in Australia, and who now find additional assistance through the tariff necessary to enable them to maintain business and expand their industry.",75
222,The CHAIRMAN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable member's time has expired.  - No honourable member is more interested in the welfare of the maize-growers than I am, for I represent an electorate in which 85 per cent, of the maize grown in Victoria is produced. Yet I shall support this request by the Senate for a reduced duty on cornflour. I do not think that the present duties can be justified. The report of the Tariff Board, as a matter of fact, shows them to be indefensible. It is true, as has already been pointed out, that the duty enjoyed by the maize-growers is generous; but even if the duty on cornflour were reduced to the figure now proposed, it would still be more generous to the manufacturers than the duty on maize is to the maize growers. Attempts are being made by those interested in the manufacturifig side of this industry to stampede the maize-growers into believing that their industry will be ruined unless the duty on cornflour is maintained at the old level. I believe that the cornflour manufacturers are using the maize-growers as catspaws. They want the duty on cornflour maintained at the highest possible level, but I do not believe that any honourable member can pretend to believe that a duty higher than that recommended by the Tariff Board is necessary. The report actually shows that if the manufacturers obtained the maize and the labour they require for making cornflour for nothing, the price of cornflour would not be reduced to a figure which would enable the manufacturers to compete with cornflour imported free of duty. The board says that no satisfactory explanation has been given of the difference between the New York price of cornflour, which is £17 16s. 6d. a ton, and the Australian price, which is nearly £40 a ton. The board sets out figures to the effect that the lowest selling price of Australian cornflour was £39 ,6s. 3d., while the price for the best quality Scotch cornflour was £16 10s., cheaper qualities selling at £10 5s. In its report, the board states:The disabilities suffered by the local manufacturers in respect of maize costs is £7 l is . ld. a ton. That is owing to - the much higher price which they pay for their maize as compared with manufacturers in Scotland. The report continues The disability suffered by the local manufacturers in respect of maize costs is, therefore. £7 l is . l d per ton-a n amount not nearly sufficient to account for the excess cost of £22 Is. 2d. per ton charged for the local pro-, duct. Neither does the disability lie in wages costs, which do not exceed £5 per ton in some of the Australian factories. In fact, from the figures already given, it will be seen that, if the local manufacturers obtained their maize requirements and the necessary labour for nothing, and passed on the whole of these benefits"" to consumers, they would still be unable to compete with importations landed free of duty at a cost of £17 5s. Id., including exchange.",76
223,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"What does the honourable member mean by ""landing free of duty""?  cornflour manufacturers obtained their supplies of maize for nothing and got their labour for nothing they would still be unable to compete with the imported product, even with the advantage of exchange, unless they were satisfied to accept smaller profits than they want today. I understand that when considering the desirability of granting a duty to an industry, the Tariff Board regards it as a reasonable test to ascertain whether the cost of the duty will be as great or greater than the amount of wages paid in the industry. If it is discovered that the additional cost imposed upon a product owing to the imposition of a duty is greater than the amount paid in wages, it is naturally regarded as a fairly unsound proposition. In this industry the position is even worse than that, because even if labour and material are provided for nothing the manufacturer is still non-competitive under existing conditions. It seems to me that the last word has been said that need be said in _ that respect by the Tariff Board.",77
224,Mr FORDE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Would the honourable member reduce the duty on maize?  to do so. The honourable member should get a proper perspective. The duty on maize is 3s. 6d. per central, which is under $d. per lb. The Tariff Board informs us that it takes about 1-J tons of maize to produce a ton of cornflour after allowing for by-products. The Tariff Board is recommending a duty on cornflour of l f d . British and 2$d. foreign, and, when packed for household use, 2d. and 3d. per lb. respectively, which is from three to five times greater than the amount of protection enjoyed by growers of maize. I am prepared to give the manufacturing end of the industry quite as liberal terms as those accorded to the primary end, but I do not think that any honourable gentleman could justify the retention of the original duty on cornflour in the light of the Tariff Board's report. A good deal has been said about what the position of the maize-grower might be if he lost portion of the demand for his product owing to a lowering of the duties, fallowed by the importation of cornflour. Some honourable members appear to think that an immense proportion of the maize crop is used in the production of cornflour. The report of the Tariff Board says that the quantity of maize necessary for the production of the whole of the cornflour manufactured in Australia is about 4 per cent, of the Australian crop, a very small proportion. However, I am anxious that our maize-growers should obtain the whole of that market, and I believe that this duty will enable them to retain it. There is no reason why the manufacturers should not be able to develop an excellent trade and make a substantial profit under these conditions, and I therefore support the request.",77
225,Mr RIORDAN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Kennedy) [11.22] I am wondering what is to become of the maize-growers if maize products such as cornflour, &c, are to be more or less freed from duty. These words appear at page 7 of the report of the Tariff BoardMaize-growers more conveniently situated are apparently receiving a price for their product which is out of proportion to the price received for other cereals of equivalent stock food value. The high price is made possible by the duty of 3s. 6d. per central on imported maize, and is almost sure to result in an increase in the acreage under maize, which, in turn, will tend to reduce prices. Should this not eventuate, or should climatic conditions curtail yields so that the existing disparity between local and overseas prices is maintained, then, the board considers that the circumstances would justif y an inquiry into the question of maintaining the present duty of 3s. 6d. per central on maize. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Country  on that issue? Does he think that there should be an inquiry into the duty on maize? And does he agree with the contention of the Tariff Board, particularly when maize is selling at 10^d. a bushel in the United States of America? In 1928, when a duty of 3d. per lb. was imposed on cornflour, maize wa3 selling in that country for 4s. 5d., and in Australia for 4s. 6d. a bushel. Does the honourable gentleman expect to maintain the protection for maize when the protection for maize products is wiped out?  will still be four times as great as that on maize.",77
226,Mr KIORDAN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"H a d t h honourable member read the report of the Tariff Board carefully, he would know that in 1924-25, when the duty was 2d. per lb. on cornflour, maize products were imported in large quantities, and that that state of affairs continued until 1928-29, when the duty was increased to 3d. per lb. In the intervening period approximately 2-,000 tons of cornflour was imported, which meant the lo3s of .sales of about 160,000 bushels of maize. The honourable member said that only 4 per cent, of our crop is used for the manufacture of cornflour. Definite evidence was given, before flie Tariff Board that the quantity used for the manufacture of cornflour is equal to the whole of the maize production of Victoria, in addition to which over 4,000 tons have been supplied in recent years by soldier settlers on the Atherton Tablelands. That is not, likely to continue, for immediately it was notified that there would be a reduction of the duties on cornflour, the manufacturers of maize products i u Melbourne declared that they could not renew their contracts for the purchase of maize at the price previously paid, or even at f l a ton less than what they had bepn paying for five years. Tho Minister cannot claim that no protest has been made to his department. The Maize Board, at Atherton, wrote to me on the 14th February last enclosing a copy of a letter which had been sent to the Minister for Customs, readingEnclosed is a ropy of u letter regarding Tariff Board inquiry, which is self-explanatory. .As you are well acquainted with the effect that this would have on the m&ize industry we would be extremely obliged if you could see your way clear to represent us at the inquiry, but if, in your opinion, the matter so serious as to warrant the board sending a representative (which they are reluctant to do if they can avoid the expense) we would like you to advise us immediately at the same time we feel confident that you could successfully represent us. I advised the board to send down a grower to give evidence before the Tariff Board, saying that he would have more weight than a politician, who might be thought to have an axe to grind. A Mr Crouch represented the Maize Board, and he statedThe present position of the Queensland maize-grower is so serious that anything ing to reduce the market for or lower the price on their products spells nothing less than catastrophe. The average price received by the e Queensland growers during the last seven years was 2s. lOd. per bushel, delivered at the silos. About (i.000 tons of Queensland maize is used annually in the manufacturing industries. Freight, sea carriage and handling amount to 2s. Id. per bushel on maize shipped to Sydney, and to 2s. 4d. per bushel on shipments to Melbourne. The present duties are supported, as the Queensland maize-growers do not wish for any further imports of cornflour which will reduce the demand of locally-grown maize. That is the evidence of a man who was sent from Atherton to represent the maize growers of that centre before the Tariff Board. Yet the board recommended a reduction of the duty, which must have a serious effect on Australian maize growers. Other witnesses expressed astonishment at the fact that American and Scotch manufacturers had not engaged in manufacturing operations in Australia. They will not do so becauso they would have to pay for maize the price which production under White Australia conditions makes necessary. While the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) was speaking, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E . J . H a r r i son) interjected "" What about the consumer?"" The consumer in Australia is paying for cornflour less per lb. than the purchaser of Scotch cornflour. No 1 quality cornflour is selling in England at 9d. per lb. packet, compared with 7d. per lb. packet for exactly the same quality Australian cornflour. That being the case, what fact emerges from the finding of the Tariff Board that the price of No. 1 Scotch cornflour is £16 10s. a ton, equivalent to approximately 2d. per lb. in bulk, while that of Australian cornflour is £36 a ton. the equivalent of approxiis mately 4d. per lb. in bulk or 6d. per l b . in packet form? It surely must be obvious to honourable members that considerably greater profits are being made by the Scotch manufacturers. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the consumer in Australia, would be' able to purchase cornflour more cheaply if the duties were reduced. If the committee accepts the recommendation of the Tariff Board, the one thing certain is that there must be an inquiry into the primary industry. The Tariff Board points out on page 1 of its report that the maize-grower is more contend- veniently situated, and is apparently receiving for his product a price that, is out of proportion to that of other cereals of equivalent stock food value. If the price of cornflour is reduced there will be a clamour for the reduction of the price of other maize products, and, in consequence of that, a demand for the lowering of the protection given to the maize industry. The tobacco industry, one of the greatest established in Australia within the last four or five years, has been destroyed as the result of the reduction of the tariff by this Government. Those who claim, to represent the primary producers in this Parliament permitted that to be done. They are now also allowing the thin end - of the wedge to be inserted in this case, and it will not be long before the maizegrower is driven out of his occupation. During the last four yeaTs, Maize Products Limited paid out the following jsums for wages and salaries:1929 .. 1930 .. .. 03.000 1931 .. .. .. 1932 .. .. .. In the same period it consumed the following quantities of Australian-grown - maize:1!»29 .. .. .. 1930 .. .. 570,410 1931 .. 1932 .. .. It statesWhilst the duty has been increased during - the past four years our selling price has been - decreased. We have no desire to take advantage of high duties in the matter of our price. Our plant has been built with a capacity - to supply the full requirements of Australia, and although our output has been curtailed through the decreased purchases of confection'<S'y by the public, any further decreased output through importations would mean added cost. Therefore, we desire the present rate of - duty to shut out foreign importations, thus ^enabling us to operate our plant at the highest possible capacity. I trust that the committee will reject the Senate's request.",78
227,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Darling Downs) [11.36] - I strongly stress the view that has been expressed on all sides of the chamber, that if there are secondary industries which depend on primary industries, every reasonable effort should ""be made to keep them in operation. 'The manufacture of cornflour is an industry of that particular description. In the first place, it supplies an article of food that is essential to the people of the Commonwealth; and in the second place it is built up entirely upon the product of a primary industry. Australia is naturally suited to the production of maize. According to the latest figures available, ill 1931 the area under cultivation in Queensland was 147,669 acres, and the yield 3,780,000 bushels. The Wide Bay district produced 1,360,000 bushels, the Moreton. district 1,274,000 bushels, and the Darling Downs district 492,000 bushels. The problem is to find markets to ahsorb the production; therefore, the disposal of even as little as 4 per cent, of the crop to this secondary industry is not to be despised. 2v£r. FENTON - That refers to only one £ product, from maize. There are several 05,000 others. 55,000 Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - Mr . 55,000 Crouch, giving evidence before the Tariff Board on behalf of the Queensland maize-growers, said that 6,000 tons of Queensland maize is used bushels. annually in manufacturing industries. 003,500 Therefore, anything that can be done 509,150 fo expand the industry should be 541,030 done. The bulk of our importations of cornflour comes from the United States of America. The published returns show that we imported from that country 1,320,000 lb. out of selling a total of 1,330,000 lb. in 1927-28, 1,022,000 lb. out of a total of 1,032,000 lb. in 1928-29, and 669,000 lb. out of a total of 702,000 lb. in 1929-30. Our importations from Great Britain are comparatively small. Mr H . F. Parsons, in evidence before the Tariff Board, made the following statement:At the present time it is understood that maize can be purchased by manufacturers in the United States of America for 21 cents per bushel, rwhieh on .par exchange is equal to 10id. per bushel. .The Australian manufacturers are paying as. per bushel for Australian maize in Melbourne, and in Sydney the price is reported as being, 5s. Sd. to os. 9d. per bushel. That is a striking and an astounding difference. President Roosevelt's schememay lift agricultural prices a little, but whether the increase will be permanent  also saidAfaize is practically the only cereal grown in large quantities in Australia which has maintained a high price compared with present depressed prices of other grain, and there is no doubt that the demand for maize for the manufacture of cornflour and other products made from it, is responsible for maize-growers throughout the Commonwealth obtaining good prices for their product. I do not think that it is the desire any honourable member to reduce the prices of primary products. If this reduction will have that effect, the results to maize-growers will be very serious. I hope that in the circumstances the Minister will agree to such a duty as will not only_secure the secondary industries, but also give confidence to the primary producer. Br. EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [11.43] - r I represent, I suppose, the biggest single maize-growing electorate in the Commonmake wealth. The northern rivers district of New South Wales has long been famed for the immense quantity of maize that it grows. On the Clarence river at one time nearly 3,000,000 bushels per annum, on the Macleay river an even larger tity, was grown at one time. I object this great primary industry being used as a eatspaw for the benefit of secondary industries which have not been as kind to the primary industries as they might have been. I believe the secondary industries associated with maize can best be expanded making the prices of cornflour and associated products cheap enough for people of Australia to buy them more readily. When one examines what has happened one finds that the various panies which use maize have always taken the utmost advantage of the duty; fact the Tariff Board's report expressly says so. All the comparisons that are made in the report of the Tariff Board are based on a price of 5s. a bushel for maize in Australia. But leaving the of maize out of consideration, the beenprice of Australian cornflour is still £25 19s. 7d. a ton, while the price of Scottish cornflour on the same basis without reference to the cost of maize is £10 14s. 5d. a ton, a difference of 250 per cent. Even at the rate requested by the Senate the duty is still greater thau the actual cost of maize to the Australian manufacturer.",79

229,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Onl y the other day I received a National City Bank list the which shows that, as the result of the Roosevelt programme, the prices of farm products have risen substantially and of are almost two-thirds of the level at which they stood four or five years ago. To-day the price of maize would probably be 3s. a bushel in American currency, which in Australian currency M'ould be, roughly, 6s. a bushel. I admit that a few months ago the position in America was very bad.",80
230,Mr MARTENS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,The right honourable rneniber is trying to reduce the wages paid in the industry.,80
231,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I am trying to certain that there will be an increased, quantity of maize used in this country by insisting* that the Australian manufacturer shall not exploit the public by charging exorbitant prices for his and products. Could any one suggest that quanthe Australian workman is so poor, into comparison with the Scottish workman, that he has to receive a wage 250 per cent, in excess of that paid to the other?",80
232,Mr MARTENS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,He does not get it.,80
233,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Of course he that does not get it, but the manufacturer does. Looki at the position by of the Australian manufacturer. The stock exchange figures disclose the fact the that the various maize products companies have year after year, despite, the depression, paid dividends of 10 per cent, comor even more, while companies in other lines of business have been unable into make any profit at all. The maize products manufacturers are in an extraordinary position. During the last four years there has been very little fluctuation in the prices of the various brands cost of their products.

Id. to 3s. 9d. a The Tariff Board stated quite frankly and candidly that the Australian facturer was taking the utmost advantage of the duty in order to obtain excessive profits. The board has made an. independent, inquiry into this industry. The quantity of maize necessary for production of the whole of the Australian requirements of cornflour is about 4 per cent, of the average Australian crop. the manufacturers were using 40 per cent, of the crop it would be doing something to build up its efficiency so as to enable its product to be sold in competition imported products under a reasonable duty.",80
234,Mr MARTUNS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Would the right honourable member allow the Australian manufacturer to buy maize under freeRiordan) trade conditions?,81
235,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The local manumention facturer has the advantage of a duty l f d . against Great Britain, and 2fd. against the United States of America. duty of l f d . represents a protection £15 per ton, while the cost of maize at 5s. a bushel is about £13 a ton. Thereits report statedfore, the value of the protection is greater that the value of the raw product. The willI n befactseenfrom dnty of 2fd. represents a protection of a ton, and the local manufacturer has necessary that advantage over the American manuwhole facturer. The statement of honourable tions members opposite that it. is protect this secondary industry by way of high duties in the interests of the primary producer, when the manufacof turer is using only 4 per cent, of the total quantity of maize produced in Ausmunity tralia, is all bunkum, and that fact is recognized by the producers themselves. They know that they are only being used as a catspaw. This reduction of duty will bring down the price of cornflour in Australia, increase the local consunipprices, tion, and improve the conditions not only of the producers, but also of the workers in the factories. Per bushel, Mr EzKTOii - It will beuefit the pros. d. ducers of maize grown by black labour. 9 Dr EARLE PAGE - We produce at most from 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 bushels of maize annually. In the maize State of Ohio, in the United States bushel. of America, the annual productionis 300,000,000 bushels, and it is manuall consumed in that country. Australia is a continent of an area of 3,000,000 square miles, and hundreds of thousands of acres can be used for the cultivation of maize, yet we are producthe ing only a few paltry million bushelsnot nearly so much as is produced by one State in America. By reducing the If duty on maize, we shall force the manufacturer to charge a reasonable price for his product. By placing the industry upon a reasonable basis, more employment with will be provided, and the manufacturers ultimately will be able to export their product.",81
236,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Swan) [11.54] - It has been somewhat amusing to me to hear the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. and the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) put the case for the maize-growers, but no was made by them of the costs of of transport, which increase enormously the costs to the grower. For instance, A it, costs the Atherton grower 2s. 3d. to of transport his maize to Melbourne where it is sold at os. a bushel. The board in the figures already jrivim it that if the local manufacturers: £25 obtained their maize requirements mid the labour for nothing and passed on the of these benefits to the consumers they would still be unable to compete with importalanded free nf duty at a cost of f 17 5s. Id., necessary to including exchange. Could there be any more damning indictment than that either of the incompetency the local manufacturers or of their greed for preposterous profits ? The comhas to pay the bill. In the face of the report of the board, I cannot understand how any honourable member can oppose a reduction of duty. The manufacturers are taking advantage of the existing high duty to charge exorbitant and their profits are used, not to benefit the - workers in the industry, but to swell their own dividends. If the report of the T a r i ff Board is correct-and there is no evidence to the contrary-ther e must be something wroug with the industry. I hope that the Minister will stand to his guns, and reduce the duty in the interests of the community generally.",81
237,Mr MARTENS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Herbert) [11.68] - It has been suggested that the Tariff Board's report is convincing and beyond dispute, but let me quote one 'brief passage to show that the board knew very little about the profits of the manufacturers. The report readsEven after allowing for the fact that the Australian margin includes costs of delivery to uiirchasers' stores, it is difficult to believe in an efficient and economic industry the disparity should be so great as the comparison indicates. If, on the other hand, the local industry is efficient and economic, then there must be large profits in the margin of £20 ]!)s. 7d. for "" other costs and profits"" in Australia. The board had access to the balance-sheets and profit and loss accounts of the three local manufacturers, but these documents did not contain sufficient detail to enable the board to isolate the profits made from sales of cornflour. Therefore, the assumption of the board that the local manufacturers were making large profits was merely guess work. The honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) has said that the cost of transport from Atherton Tablelands to Melbourne is 2s. 3d. a bushel. that the high cost of transport in Australia has been brought about largely by the action of a previous government, which he supported, in disposing of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers to a British shipping monopoly. It is the lack of competition in freights that has brought about high transport costs. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has stated that this reduction of duty will benefit rather than penalize the maize-growers, but he is not worrying at ail about their position. I suggest that the people responsible for the production of maize in Atherton can speak for themselves better than the leader of the Country party can speak for them. A representative of these people wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs on this subject on the 2nd February in the following terms:It has been brought uuder my notice by the chairman of the Atherton Tableland Maize Board that the Tariff Board should hold an inquiry in Sydney on 6th March into the necessity for the present rate of customs duty on cornflour, which, 1 understand, at the present moment, amounts to 3d. per lb. on iniportations from all other countries. The Atherton Tableland is vitally concerned in this inquiry, as any reduction in the present protection, on cornflour must reflect itself in the use of Australian-grown maize, and as the primary producer of maize, at the' present t.ime and fnr some considerable time past, has been practically growing maize at less than the cost of production, any further reduction in prices is likely to send the whole of the maize-growers out of business. Trusting that you will see the interest of the' maize-grower is protected, and would your that department consider the granting of a pass to one of the members of the maize-grower's organizations to attend the conference in Sydney on Oth March. If so, would you favour me with a wire so that I can get into communication, as they are anxious to know this as early as possible. I had the honour, during the recess, of visiting the Atherton district in company with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Scullin). At an interview, the maize growers urged us to do our best to keep the price of maize up to the level that was then in operation, and we intend to do so. Apparently, the Country party, which alleges that it represents rural interests, is chiefly concerned about destroying our primary industries. Such reductions of duties as that now under conI suggest sideration will undoubtedly have that effect - The honourable member for Biverina (Mr Nock) made some reference to the quantity of maize produced in Australia, and to the difficulties of the growers. I point out to him that not only the maize-growers, but also other primary producers in Australia have caused many of the difficulties under which they are now labouring, by substituting American tractors for horse teams, and buying American oil. At one time, 300 teams of horses were used in the Atherton district for hauling timber to market, but, nowadays, practically all the hauling is done by tractors. In this respect, the primary producers have been their own worse enemies. There can be no doubt that the Tariff Board has made very many definite statements on guesswork. It has referred, for instance, to the profits made in the cornflour industry; but it has not. supported its contentions with sufficiently strong evidence. The honourable member for Swan and ihe honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), are continually telling us that we are damaging the interests of the workers of this country by restricting imports; but I should like to know what would happen to the primary producers if it were not for the local market they now enjoy. The policy of the Country party will ultimately destroy our primary industries. The dumping here of products manufactured in other countries will result in the destruction of local secondary industries, and this in turn will destroy the home market for the primary producers. Australian industries which have been built up by means of bounties and high tariffs should not now be subjected to unfair competition by wealthy foreign interests with which are associated some of the Australian financial syndicates that support this Government. I hope that this request by the Senate will be rejected. Thursday, 26 October, 1988.",82
238,Mr JENNINGS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"South Sydney) [12.5 a.m.] - I intend to vote against this request. To do otherwise would be to subject an industry which is 100 per cent. Australian to a severe blow, and to damage the maize-growing industry of Australia. In fact, the acceptance of this "" proposal might easily lead to the dismissal from their employment of 500 or 600 persons. As no maize is grown in the United Kingdom, and as the prices of Australian maize products are regarded as reasonable, I can see no reason why we should reduce this duty.  The cornflour industry has been responsible for one of the greatest ramps to which Australian consumers have ever been subjected. Persistence in supporting uneconomic industries of this character must inevitably lead to additional unemployment. Such industries are like millstones around the necks of the Australian people. It has been clearly shown in the report of the Tariff Board that if the maize-growers gave their maize to the cornflour manufacturers for nothing, and the workers gave their labour for nothing, it would still be impossible for the cornflour manufacturers to compete against the cornflour manufacturers of the United Kingdom. Honourable members do a disservice, and not a service, to the Commonwealth by supporting high duties under such circumstances. This Parliament should order an exhaustive inquiry into the cornflour industry.",83
239,Mr ROSEVEAE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"That would not ensure the corn-growers a reasonable price for their corn.  Atherton get only about 2s; 2d. a bushel for their maize. It costs a good deal more than that, however, to get the maize from Atherton to the cornflour factories. Cornflour is a necessary article of daily food, particularly for the infants and invalids of the community. In these circumstances the present position is quite untenable. I believe that industries which are profiteering in consequence of ex- v cessive tariff protection should be brought to book. It was shown recently that the match-making industry was profiteering to an enormous extent. The flour-millers are, in my opinion, also making undue profits. The Government should order an inquiry into the flourmilling industry. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who has made a plea for the cornflour manufacturers, is incapable of realizing the uneconomic position of this industry and others of the same type. It would be unjust for us to continue to enforce the high duty on cornflour imposed by the previous Government. When the honourable member for Maribyrnong was tackled on this aspect of the subject he side-stepped it and endeavoured to plead the cause of the maize growers ; but the Tariff Board has shown clearly that this duty is not necessary to protect the interests of the maize growers. I , therefore, heartily support the Senate's request.",83
240,Mr HOLLOWAY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Melbourne Ports) [12.11 a.m.] - I have been requested by the employees of two large factories in my electorate to protest against this reduction of duty. But I am concerned about the subject from a much wider aspect. I suppose all honourable members have read recently of the efforts being made in the United States of America to raise price levels. The leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) has shown by speeches which he has delivered in this House that he is a student of international economics, and he must know that every country in the world is trying to raise the price of its primary products in order to restore prosperity. Yet the right honourable gentleman is now advocating a reduction of duty which must adversely affect the price of maize. In support of his argument he made some reference to countries where black labour is employed.",83
241,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Blac k labour is not employed in the maize-growing areas of the United States of America.,84
242,Mr HOLLOWAY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"I am inclined to believe that the right honourable member is in error in that statement. There are very few American industries in which negro labour is not employed. A great contest is being waged inAmerica at present between the white and negro workers in regard to membership of the American Federation for Labour. Let me remind the right honourable member that America exports less than 10 per cent, of her primary produce, so that'the arguments used to bolster up the Country party's case in Australia do not apply to America. It must be apparent to every honourable member who gives any serious thought to the subject, that a reduction of the duty on cornflour must react disadvantageously on the maize-growers, because it will undoubtedly lessen the demand for maize. A reduction in the demand for maize, or any other primary product, must ultimately result in a. reduction in the price of that product. That is an economic law which nobody would dream of contradicting. I have been asked to try to persuade the Government to maintain the existing duties. It is claimed that if the Senate's request is accepted it will make the duty lower than it has been for the last years. During that time there has been no outcry about exploitation, and if there had been there should have heen other methods of dealing with it. What happened when the right honourable memwill ber for Cowper was Treasurer, and prosperity smiled upon the land? I admit that there are exploiters in our midst, hut I feel confident that there are also other legislative methods by which they can be kept in check. There are 5,000 tons of cornflour manufactured in Australia every year, utilizing 500,000 bushels of maize and necessitating the cultivation of 17,000 or 18,000 acres of land. While that might appear insignificant from the viewpoint of some members of the Country party who represent chiefly pastoralists and wheat and wool-growers, it is a pretty big thing to thousands of small farmers working mixed farms. Surely it is recognized that there is already an alarming shrinkage in the demand for wool and wheat, and that it is criminal to aggravate the position by lessening the scope for the - manufacture of product.3 of maize, rice, almonds and the many other small products which help the struggling farmers to make ends meet. When the duty on maize was increased there was an immediate reduction in the amount of cornflour manufactured in Australia, the output falling by 2,000 tons in one year. It is obvious that this is only a beginning and if this request is approved we shall be asked to reduce the duty on confectionery and other by-products of maize, with the result that eventually no maize will be grown in Australia and we shall have to depend on the black-grown product. That is not the solution of the problem. I remind honourable members that under the National Industries Restoration Act the Government of the United States of America has purposely increased the prices of products to restore national prosperity. During the last three years the Country party, because it holds the balance of power, has been successful in bringing about the reduction of costs generally until we have retrogressed to the level of 30 years ago, when everything was cheap and nasty. As a result the primary pro30 ducer is worse off than' ever. We have lower labour costs, lower costs of material and of tools of trade, and that has not meant prosperity to the farmer or anybody else. I hope that the Government reconsider the matter and reject the request of the Senate, for that chamber has not considered the duty on its merits.",84
243,Mr BERNARD CORSER,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Wide Bay) [12.21 a.m.] - I sincerely trust that the Government will not accept the Senate's request. Unfortunately the Senate is prone to reduce tariffs without considering the effect on both primary and secondary industries. Here we are concerned with a great primary industry about which has been developed substantial secondary industries, and a proposal is made to damage both. In times like tbese we should preserve to the primary industries in particular every available market, for among other things that means additional avenues of employment for our workers. If this request is acceded to there will be a diminution of the market for maize used in subsidiary industries, and a detrimental result to whole community. If the Government refuses to consider those who are engaged in the maize industry, let it consider those engaged in the manufacture of cornflour and other by-products of maize. I hope that the committee will reject the request, which can have only a damaging eifect on both primary and secondary industries.",85
244,Mr BLAKELEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Darling} [12.34 a.m.] - I join with the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) in expressing the hope that the Government will not take this retrogressive step. To put it mildly, the action of the Senate is an irresponsible one, and indicates members of that chamber have not given to the maize industry the consideration that it deserves. Eor years various by-products of maize have received adequate tariff protection, with the result that a thriving secondary industry has been built up which directly employs 600 men and women, who are paid good wages and enjoy satisfactory conditions. The deputy leader of the Country  sistent to his free trade convictions, and, even though the heavens fall, to vote with the Government in accepting the Senate's request. His object is to reduce the cost of production, with the result that ultimately we shall be compelled to use cornflour made from African black-grown maize. All this is to be done merely to reduce the price of reapers, binders, mattocks, and other implements used by the man on the land. Like Sarah in Mr. Midshipman Easy, he says that the request is "" Such a little one"", that only 4 per cent, of the total Australian maize crop is used in the manufacture of cornflour. I am not in a position to controvert those figures, but I am not at all diffident' about questioning their authenticity. At least 500,000 bushels of maize are used each year in the manufacture of cornflour, and I am of the opinion that the figures which were presented by the honourable gentleman do not truly reflect the consumption of maize for this purpose. Members of the Country party intend to cut the fiscal throats of some of their supporters, so that the Australian market will be flooded with cornflour from Scotland, for, on the figures supplied by the deputy leader of that the party, Scotland can and will capture the market for the whole of our requirements of cornflour. ",85
245,Mr BLAKELEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable member attempted to make good his case by quoting figures which showed that, even if labour and material were free, Australian cornflour .would cost £22 more a ton than cornflour imported from Scotland. To be really consistent he and - his colleagues should remove the protection of 3s. 6d. a central that is given to maize, for there should be no differthat entiation in affording protection to the primary and 'secondary industries. If it is right to have blackgrown cornflour entering into competition with Australian primary and secondary industries, it should be just as right to open our doors to the black-grown maize of - South Africa. Consistent as the Deputy Leader of the Country party is, T venture to say that he would be the first to raise his voice to prevent the maize of South Africa, or of any other country, from entering Australia, and putting our maize-growers out of production. I invite the honourable member to inform this committee and his constituents whether he would or would not maintain that consistency of which he h so proud. Would he vote for every reduction, even if it adversely affected those whom allegedly be represents? Figures have been quoted to-night by the Minister and by some honourable members in regard to the selling price of cornflour. The statement is very definitely made by Maize Products Limited and Parsons Proprietary Limited that Brown and Polsen's No. 1 quality Scotch cornflour is selling in England at 9d. per 1-lb packet. The Minister has stated that these figures are incomplete or out of date, and that he has received a cable which gives the current quotations. The economic side, in its application to the maize-grower, is not unimportant. The average price of maize over a period of five years has been 5s. a bushel. ",85
246,Mr BLAKELEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Non e of the prions paid for primary products in the marts or ""to brokers are farm prices. The Tariff Board accepts that figure as an average. It represents a sum of from. £100,000 to £125,000 in the pockets of some of the maize-growers.  the 5s. reaches the grower.",86
247,Mr BLAKELEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The Labour party has always advocated the efficient and proper handling of farm products by pools and such like means, and the exclusion of private enterprise. My honourable friend shrinks with horror when it is suggested that the handling of his constituents' products, should be taken from private enterprise and controlled sanely, efficiently and economically. Until the farmers control the marketing, handling and selling of their own products they will continue to receive only one-half of the mart price. It is the inefficient and uneconomic marketing and distribution of primary products which causes the farmers to receive only 2s. 6d. out of the 5s. a 'bushel that is paid. But, whatever be the figure, it denotes the receipt of a large sum of money by those who produce maize. That being so, any constriction of potential markets must inevitably affect prejudicially the majority of maize growers in Australia. We should endeavour to keep up the prices of our primary products. During the last four years efforts have been made to increase and to stabilize currency. I shall not embark upon au explanation of the attempt of the Scullin Government to obtain an inflation of currency with a view to raising internal price levels. I u the United States of America all the efforts of the nation are concentrated upon proposals for increasing the prices of primary commodities, huge sums are being made available, and all kinds of subterfuges are being availed of.",86
248,Mr HUTCHIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,""" Subterfuges "" is the correct term to apply.",86
249,Mr BLAKELEY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"In my opinion they are merely evading the main issue: they are going all round the question instead of straight at it. The natural corollary of the lowering of the duty on cornflour must be the reduction of the price of maize. The industry is responsible for the employment of such a considerable volume of labour, not only on the farm, but also in connection with the transport of maize, first to the railway siding and then to the seaport and to manufacturing centres, that in this period of its history Australia cannot afford to lose it. For these reasons I am strongly opposed to the reduction proposed by the Minister in his fiscal retreat.",86
250,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.42 a.m.] Most of the criticism voiced to-night has been based on a circular sent to honourable members by one of the chambers of manufactures.,86
251,Mr MAKIN,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Oh , no !",86
252,Mr MARTENS,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I quoted a letter from the Atherton maize-growers.,86
253,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) quoted figures which I know are given in the circular of Maize Products Limited.,86
254,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,I have several circulars from which I wish to quote.,86
255,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"This particular circular is full of inaccuracies, and condemns the case of the other side. First, it says that the duty recommended is the lowest since federation, was established. I point out that the duty was Id. per lb. in 1901, that it was later reduced to i d . per lb., and that in 1907 it was increased to 2d.; at which figure it. stood until 1929. I have been told by honourable members and by deputations that, whatever the Tariff Board may say in regard to the wholesale price, the retail price at least is cheaper in Australia than in Great Britain. Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Eorde), the honourable memher for Darling (Mr Blakeley), and the honourable member for Maribyrnong Fenton) have submitted that price of Brown and Polsen's cornflour in the United Kingdom is 9d. per 1-lb. packet, while the Australian price is only 7d. per 1-lb. packet. I cabled to the customs officers in London for confirmation or contradiction of that statement, and my information is that cornflour is retailed in Great Britain at 6d. a packet, while Brown and Polsen's best is 8d. a packet. The October issue of the Australasian Grocer states that the average ruling price in Melbourne and suburbs for Brown and Polsen's cornflour is Sd. a packet. It is made in Australia under licence from Brown and Polsen. Three other brands of cornflour - VGlobe,"" ""Kream,"" and ""Ship""-are sold at 8d., and the price of "" Cornina,"" which is made in Melbourne, is lOd. a packet. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, as usual, has submitted that the reduction of the duty would create unemployment. He said that 500 persons might be thrown out of work; but when I referred the matter to the Tariff Board, the reply I received was that the estimated number of persons employed by the three principal manufacturers was 110 males and 29 females, and that in all the factories, the production of cornflour was carried on in conjunction with the manufacture of other maize products. The board added that it had not sufficient particulars on which to base estimates of employment created by the growing of maize and the manufacture of packing material. The circular of the Chamber of Manufacturers states that the employees are paid £4 14s. a week, but information obtained by the department shows that adult males receive 77s. 6d. a week in New South Wales, and 65s. a week in Victoria, while the wage for adult females is 38s. 9d. in New South Wales and 34s. 3d. in Victoria. Tariff Board states that Australian consumers pay £22 Is. 2d. a ton in excess of the cost at which importations could be landed free of duty. The circular on Mr White. which honourable members have based their argument is entirely inaccurate. The Mr Fenton - It is not.",86
256,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable member is still a prohibitionist. The depression should have taught him that he should (Mr not dogmatize, and that prohibition would the reduce, rather than increase, employment in this country. If we accept the recommendation of the Tariff Board, we shall give adequate protection to the industry, and leave it a substantial margin of profit. Mr SCUXT.IN - Why is 8d. a packet charged both in England and Australia for the same brand of cornflour?",87
257,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Possibl y the English company has a holding in the Australian company, and a price arrangement has been made; but the cost of the other comparable brand is lOd. a packet.",87
258,Mr HOLLOWAY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Melbourne Ports) [12.54 a.m.] - In making a plea on behalf of the consumers, the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) stated that the retail price of cornflour in Australia was 250 per cent, higher than in Great Britain. When we suggested that the Tariff Board had made no reference to the retail price, and that nobody had said that the quality of Australian-made cornflour was inferior to the English, Scotch or American article, the Minister pointed out that while Brown and Polsen's cornflour'was sold at Sd. a packet in England, the same brand made by the same company in Australia was sold at a similar figure.",87
259,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,The circular showed a difference between the prices.,87
260,Mr HOLLOWAY,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"In that respect the Minister has gained one victory. Although the prices stated in the circular, were 9d. and 7d., he has shown to the committee that British cornflour of the same standard as the Australian product is being sold in London at exactly the same price. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has said that the price to the consumer in Australia is 250 per cent, higher than the The price in Great Britain. It was a very misleading and unfair statement, and was made for the purpose of impressing upon the committee the need for this reduced duty. In making such a .statement, the right honourable member did not act in the interests of the maize producers; in fact, he acted against their wishes, and certainly not in the interests of the consumers.",87
261,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"Maribyrnong) [12,59 a.m.] - I felt sure from the attitude of the Minister that he intended to produce evidence to show the disparity between the prices charged for certain maize products in Great Britain and those charged in Australia; but, instead of doing so, he showed merely that the prices were exactly the same in both countries. The Australian industry is carried on by white people, while in Great Britain the raw material is produced by black labour and is manufactured in the factory by low-paid white labour; yet we are asked by the Government to patronize the British manufacturer in preference to the Australian. If , as the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has said, hardships are being suffered by the consumer, why did he not institute some reform when he and five other members of the Country party were members of a government that held office for six and a half years? I should be glad, indeed, to meet, the maize-growers on the Clarence or the Snowy rivers and to obtain from them their opinion of the attitude of their so called representatives in this chamber, the right honourable member for Cowper and the honourable member for Gippsland  companies which will be competing with our Australian company as a result of this reduction of duty is controlled by American capital, and. portion of its profits are sent to the United States of America?",88
262,Mr WHITE,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,What company is that?,88
263,Mr FENTON,IMPORTS INTO NEW ZEALAND,"The Minister should be able to ascertain that from the information at his disposal. In this industry, as well as in many others, foreign companies have established branches in Great Britain in order to obtain preference under our tariff. Although the Country party is extremely anxious to reduce the duty in order to bring about reform in this industry, it failed to bring about any great reform during - the regime of the Bruce-Page Government. I remind the so-called representatives of the primary producers that the more people we employ in our factories the more we shall develop the local market for primary produce. The men and women employed in our factories have to be fed, clothed, and housed from the land, and every benefit that is conferred upon them is passed on in some form or another to the primary producers. The Minister is not always fair in his statements. When he was reminded of the fact that the price of cornflour was 1 the same in Great Britain as in Australia, he said that he supposed that the Australian company was in some way connected with the British company, and that an arrangement had been entered into with regard to prices. The Minister had not the slightest authority for making that statement, and I give it an absolute denial. The Australian concern is being carried out as honestly as any other concern in Australia. Although the Minister holds a responsible position, he does not hesitate to make irresponsible statements that are unfair and not in accordance with fact. Honourable members who agree to the Senate's request will vote to give work to coloured people in other parts of the world, and to deny the right to work to their fellow Australians who are having difficulty in making a living. I am not pleased with the manner in which the Government has con. ducted this business, and I promise to give it more trouble in the future because of its behaviour to-night.",88

266,Mr CASEY,NEW OR OPPOSED BUSINESS,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [1.26 a.m.] - I move:That tihe amendment be agreed to. Under clause 49 of the bill as a peri t stood, the increase in old-age pensions, salaries, and so forth, did not operate until the pay-day following the day of commencement of the relative clauses. It was the hope of the Governances ment that the bill would be Houses of Parliament in sufficient time to permit the increases to take effect from surer) the next pensions pay-day, the 26th October. However, it was found imthat possible to do that, and the Government decided to make an amendment in another place, which will have the effect of ing the increases of invalid and age pensions retrospective to the 26th Oetolior, and the increases of the salaries of civil servants payable from day. Although, by reason of the difficulty of making administrative arrangements, it will not be possible to make either these increased payments on the clays named, the increases will be paid at the month. earliest opportunity, probably on the next pay-day.
