1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 October, on motion by Mr Beddall: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Anderson had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House recognises the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia who are affected by drought conditions and calls on the Government to act urgently to develop a strategy to assist these operators"".",11
2,Mr SIMMONS,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"I am pleased to be able to participate in this important debate on the Drought Relief Payment Bill, which will have a profound impact on many people who are living in drought devastated areas of Australia, but particularly those in Queensland and a large part of New South Wales. Members would be aware that the primary purpose of this rather urgent bill is to amend the Farm Household Support Act of 1992 to provide for a payment, to be known as a drought relief payment, to farmers in exceptional circumstances due to the extremities of the current drought. I am pleased also that the opposition is largely guaranteeing urgent passage of this legislation because, as all speakers in this debate would have acknowledged so far, this is a rather urgent measure which needs to be taken in order to address a very difficult situation for the people in those areas. In terms of complimenting the opposition for its support for the urgent passage of this bill, I was surprised to see that the opposition is moving an amendment which, while not declining the bill a second reading, asks the House to 'recognise the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia who are affected by drought conditions' and 'calls on the government to act urgently to develop a strategy to assist those operators' . All of us in this House, particularly those of us who represent regional and provincial Australia, would be aware that the drought is 1994 having implications for those people who live in the rural towns and cities throughout, in particular, New South Wales and Queensland. However, I believe that there is a little political cynicism in this move by the opposition to suggest that the government, in its very generous package, should take it a significant step further by extending it to small business operators. This is a $164 million package that will have a significant benefit for people in the drought declared areas. To extend this the measure to small business operators would have huge fiscal implications. Coming from the opposition at a time when it is urging the government to cut back on current fiscal measures, I find to be political cynicism to a degree. Clearly, the most effective way the government can assist rural communities is to support the base on which they rest. Throughout the drought devastated communities of Queensland and northern New South Wales, in particular, the way the government can do that is to ensure that the farmers who largely provide an income base for those communities have income to sustain those communities. The nature of the support to be provided through the drought relief payment is such that the money will flow through to families directly into their rural towns and, therefore, into the small businesses that the opposition suggests it is concerned about. When the government announced this measure on 21 September, both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) suggested that the implications of this particular measure would be to add upwards of $25,000 per annum to the budget of a family of two adults and two children. Clearly, that would have quite profound implications on the rural sector and also, of course, on the small business sector in rural communities. Direct income to meet the day-today living expenses also has a significant multiplier effect of around 1Y2. This means that every $1 spent in a community generates an extra $1.50 in the broader economy. As we know, most of this is going to be disposable income that is going to be used to perhaps pay off some outstanding liabilities at the local supermarket, at the local stock and station agent and at a range of other businesses within the community. It will also, in most important instances, be used to pay for food and other basic necessities of life. I believe that this is a very welcome measure but, importantly, I think it should be in the context of a range of other initiatives that the government has taken. During this debate, the government has been accused by some speakers in the opposition as being late to the party in recognising the severity of drought. I for one reject that notion out of hand. If honourable members look back over the record, they will see that the government has progressively implemented a series of programs to allow farmers to manage the drought in appropriate ways. Additional assistance was provided to drought affected farmers in Queensland through the exceptional circumstances provision of the rural adjustshown ment scheme. That was provided in the last budget, which was in May this year. In August this year, just a couple of months ago, the minister, Senator Collins, took to cabinet a submission which resulted in a further measure of nearly $14 million being provided to farmers. An additional $2Y2 million was provided in exceptional circumstances funds to Queensland through the rural adjustment scheme, and $5 million in exceptional circumstances funds was provided as support for New South Wales. We saw additional funding for the training and skills program and, importantly at this time of great financial need, an extension through greater resources of rural counselling services. I recall that at the time there were some derisory comments made by the opposition, suggesting that this was some sort of miserable handout of only $14 million. I am sure I also recall Senator Collins making the point that, at the time he visited drought affected areas of Queensland and talked to the people about the sorts of measures that he was likely to take to cabinet following his return from that particular inspection, the people were very appreciative of the sorts of circumstances and the types of assistance he was likely to put forward by way of the cabinet submission. The position has continued to worsen and, regrettably, the long-term outlook for drought breaking rains looks very bleak indeed. As a result of this, we saw further action by the government when, in the light of the continued bad situation in Queensland and northseen ern New South Wales in particular, Senator Collins took a further submission to cabinet on 21 September. Prior to that, I, as a member representing a rural and provincial area of New South Wales, had a number of representhe tations made to me. While the drought circumstances in the central western New South Wales centres of Bathurst and Orange are certainly not anywhere near as devastating as those circumstances in northern New South Wales; nonetheless, there was a degree of concern by people because of the constant images that we were seeing night after night on television, where families were being to be in very desperate circumstances. I was pleased that the motion I moved in the federal parliamentary Labor caucus at the beginning of September suggesting that the government give consideration to easing the assets test on farmers in terms of social security and other income support payments and in respect of certain Austudy payments, in particular for tertiary Austudy payments, was overwhelmingly supported later that month. As I mentioned, on 21 September we saw the significant announcement by the cabinet which has been the subject of debate in the House both yesterday and today. The Prime Minister announced the provision of $164 million, including the new drought relief payment which is the principal element of the debate of yesterday and today, to help farm families who found themselves in these extreme and very desperate drought circumstances. Importantly, the announcement also extended to providing further reforms to rural adjustment. Those measures were very warmly welcomed. I had a number of contacts with the New South Wales Fanners Association during the lead-up to the announcement of this package. I am sure many honourable members from both sides of the House received similar representations. There was also close liaison between the government and the principal organisation representing farmers in this country, the National Farmers Federation, which also played an important role. I recognise that both those organisations were extraordinarily complimentary of the government once those announcements were made. I think they were justifiably complimentary because, largely, the measures announced were the ones they were seeking. Of course, there will be circumstances where people fall just either side of measures. My friend and colleague the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) during his contribution last evening made the very important point that whenever we draw lines on a map, whenever we have a situation where no state government is in a position to adequately define the nature of drought, we are going to end up with those difficult circumstances. If the desperate circumstances continue, I would ask the government for further refinements to be made that will ease perhaps any unintended consequences that may arise as a result of some areas that are clearly drought affected in rather exceptional circumstances currently falling outside the guidelines. The other important part of this measure is that the government wished to ensure that the assistance would flow very quickly to farm families, particularly to those most in need; hence, the criterion of 24 months out of 36 months should apply. We have seen during the course of this debate some toing-andfroing as to the relative merits of both sides of this House in terms of what the adequate criteria would be. I acknowledge that the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), pointed out during his contribution that perhaps some of his comments had been misinterpreted. I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, but, certainly in terms of the information I had available to me at the time, the situation was that in his press conference here on 31 August the member for Gwydir suggested that we should in fact look at two years out of the last five years or three years out of the last five years as the criteria for falling into the category of exceptional drought circumstances. Again, it gets back to the nature of definition. This debate is surrounded by the difficulties we all have in coming together with an appropriate definition of extreme circumstances. More significantly, I can forgive and understand perhaps those comments made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. But I find it very difficult to forget about the comments made by his state parliamentary colleague Mr Causley, the New South Wales minister for agriculture. Clearly, he sought to make a great deal of unfortunate political capital from the circumstances in which many people in rural Australia find themselves. We were aware that a draft list of particularly affected districts was given to New South Wales officials by Commonwealth officials during the negotiation of this package. The circulation of the draft list wrongly created an expectation in some areas that persons would be entitled to special assistance. I know that Senator Collins has considerable regret that that occurred, but he made the important point that the final listnot the draft list-was signed by him only last Friday. The original list circulated in New South Wales by Minister Causley with the very large stamped draft gave high expectations, unfortunately, to the people in the western New South Wales Rural Lands Protection Boards districts of Coonabarabran, Coonamble, Dubbo, Mudgee, Nyngan and Walgett. I also noticed on that list the Rural Lands Protection Boards district of Grafton, which happens to coincide with the Legislative Assembly district that the minister represents. I am sure that, given the rather difficult circumstances the New South Wales government is facing-it is like a kangaroo in a country paddock with a spotlight in its eyes, going nowhere at the present time, with an election just a few months away-there was a very cynical attempt by that government, and the minister in particular, to use these circumstances. That aside, as a result of the debate over last few weeks, particularly in the last few days, I think people understand where the government is coming from. I believe a genuine compassion has been exercised in relation to the circumstances in which people have found themselves. Importantly, the government and the Prime Minister in particular have given notice of future generous tax concessions that will be made available to people. While people are sometimes cynical of those sorts of comments, the time to focus people's attention on the issue of drought proofing is in the middle of difficult circumstances. As people sometimes say, the urgent always replaces the important, but this is a time when we need to consider long-term important decision making. I am sure that over the next few months, as the government begins to develop its package, we will again see progressive and sensible legislation coming forward from this government to address the particular problem. Again, I thank all members who are supportive of this bill. As we all know, while many farming families still find themselves in difficult circumstances, and while there is a total farm indebtedness in this country in excess of $17 billion, the long-term solution is drought breaking rain. We can only hope and pray that that comes sooner rather than later. But, importantly, in the circumstances that precede drought breaking rain, the drought relief package that forms part of this bill is a progressive step forward.",11
3,Mr SINCLAIR,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL," It is particularly relevant that we have a debate in this House, albeit with only five of us present, on a subject that is absolutely fundamental to the survival of this country. Eighty per cent of New South Wales, about 40 per cent of Queensland-the figure is stretching day by day-something like 40 per cent of Victoria and, significantly, all consumers, are affected by drought. It could not be more appropriate to have the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) as the minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in the House. Before my colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) leaves the the chamber, I inform him that I am glad that at a recent meeting at Dunedoo he recognised that one of the problems of the rural sector has been brought about by the economic malfeasance of the federal government. That is the problem. Mr Simmons-That was 2Vz years ago.",14
4,Mr SINCLAIR,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"It does not matter. It was as true then as it is now in 1994. I will talk a little about things of yesteryear in a moment. This parsimonious package before us today is trite in the extreme if we compare it with the generosity of coalition governments. If you look at where we are today and where Australia is going and dismiss altogether the recovery prospects of the rural sector, then you are failing to understand that, in this diverse nation of ours, just as multiculturalism might apply in demographic terms so does multifaceted industrial production apply in economic terms. It appals me that, because there is nothing better, people are saying what a great job the government has done with this package. There are three things that need to be recognised to begin with. The first is the extent of the drought, and I have briefly referred to that. The second aspect is the alarming degree to which, as a result of the drought, the cattle kill is moving into the female herd. A few weeks ago it was about 40 per cent, two weeks ago it was 60 per cent, last week it had risen to 65 per cent, and before long it will be about 75 per cent. So we are not going to have females. It will take us about five years to recover, and when we recover we will have lost all those markets that lay behind the Uruguay Round negotiations within GAIT which have been the prime focus of this government's trade policy for the last 12 years. We are about to move into a World Trade Organisation-we are moving away from the restraints of the past-and as we do so one of our principal achievements will have been destroyed. There will not be a cattle herd to generate the beef required to meet the markets that the Uruguay Round was designed to provide. So we have enormous problems to the extent that the basic herd has gone because the drought covers so much of Australia. The third aspect of the drought that is important to understand is the fires that are breaking out alarmingly right down the east coast. They show dramatically how extensive the drought is. If you live in the town or the country you can see how dry your garden is, but the bush is tinder dry. The fires up and down the east coast have been horrific over the last few weeks, and the situation is getting worse. We all admire tremendously the efforts of those firefighters who were able to put out those alarming fires around the city of Sydney and elsewhere in New South Wales at the beginning of this year. But the year will get even worse. This is only October, and normally at this time of the year we are in the middle of a lush spring. The degree to which fire is starting to creep into this bushland of ours is appalling. One of the things people need to understand about drought is the impact it has on people, the social fall-out that those of us who have bush seats know only too well. The drought will have real repercussions not just on houses, not just on the bush, but on people. Not a day goes by when my office does not get somewhere between 20 and 100 calls from people in absolutely desperate straits. Unfortumeans nately, things are getting worse. This package, although it is welcomed to the degree that it provides some help, does not provide help to the majority of those affected by the drought. I want to come to that in a moment. Sure, some will be helped by the changes to the assets test for Austudy-and I welcome that change, although the assets test should be totally removed from Austudy, as far as I am concerned. I certainly welcome the drought relief payment, which is the principal subject of this bill. But drought relief payment is not new; we have done it before. We have done it to help other farmers in similar conditions. We have given them access to social welfare payments. Of course there will be those who need to be helped in that way. I welcome the further measures under the rural adjustment scheme, but they are inadequate. As the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), demonstrates, there is absolutely nothing in the package for small business. I do not know whether government members have ever been to a country town, but if you walk down the street of any country town you will see closed shops and vacant premises and to let, to lease or for sale signs. They are not there because people want to get out. They are not moving of their own free will. They are going because there is no chance of survival. We are getting ghost towns around this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is out there talking about his magnificent new real estate, where he is going and having an argument with one of his predecessors in a manner that does him and his office little credit. He fails to understand that people in rural Australia are increasingly getting into a position where the services, professions and tradespeople-the people on whom they rely - are having to go because of the impact of economic conditions that eventuate with a protracted drought. There is no reason for the government to walk away from those people. They have as much right to live and make a living as the Prime Minister or anybody else in the government. Power does not mean the abuse of the responsibilities it brings; it that you exercise those responsibilities on behalf of those in the community who have given you the opportunity for the time being to exercise that power. What does this package bring? It brings $164 million over two years. Oh, gee! I was quite fascinated. That sounds like a lot of money-$82 million a year. I went back and had a look just to see what we did on earlier occasions. Let me talk about the social fallout; the consumer effect; the extent to which the breeding herds are disappearing; the degree to which there is a fire risk; the degree to which we are getting ghost towns; and the degree to which there is a family crisis, a social crisis, with families breaking up; the appalling number of suicides of young people; and the pressures on individuals, which this government just walks away from-it does not think it matters. People really ought to be thought of as needing care, attention and assistance. They have been dealt with by this crowd as though they do not matter. I reintroduced the States Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Bill into this parliament 23Vz years ago. Then-money was worth a great deal more than it does today-for one aspect of aid alone we provided $100 million over four years for the rural reconstruction bill. Its provisions were a jolly sight more generous than anything that this government provides now, nearly quarter of a century later. It is interesting that the aim was not to displace private credit, not to relieve creditors of the consequences of commercial judgments that they made; rather, it was to provide help to those who have a chance, in a combined effort to retain in the industry as many producers as could possibly be placed on a sound basis. The whole point of today is that we have to help as many producers as possible to stay in the industry. What does this package do? It provides social welfare relief. This package will help people to a degree. But the government fails to recognise that a lot more needs to be done. I will come to that in a moment. A quarter of a century is a long time ago. Let us look at what has happened more recently. I refer to the speech that my colleague, the then Minister for Primary Industry and National Party member for Gippsland, made in this place on 16 September 1982 on the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill. The purpose of that bill was to give effect to the special Commonwealth drought assistance measures announced on 31 August 1982. There were two elements to that: a subsidy on interest payments over 12 per cent made by eligible drought declared farmers and a subsidy on fodder purchased to be fed to drought affected sheep and cattle. The interesting part about that package is that there were a couple of elements within it that I think the government really needs to refer to: the amount of money provided and the way the government was prepared to recognise, as we did a quarter of a century ago, that this is a federation. If we want to keep producers in the industry, the way to do it is to work cooperatively with the states and try to give them help in the forms of assistance they provide under their own drought assistance packages. It has already been mentioned in this place that Queensland is providing help for small business. That is what our amendment is all about. But what is the government doing? It is ignoring it. The New South Wales government is giving significant assistance by providing water to properties and homes, moving drought affected stock and giving some assistance to freight by moving feed to that stock. I want to come back to that in a moment. It is important to recognise that in 1982, 12odd years ago, $36 million was provided for the interest payment subsidy and $320 million for the fodder subsidy, the fodder relief program. Of course, it could be said that all that will do is drive fodder prices up. I do not know where this lot have been. I am going to talk a little bit about their attitudes. On the amount of fodder available, they ought to understand that the Wheat Board has already published the amount of grain that is available in this country, and I think even the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has acknowledged that it will be essential to import grain. There is a world parity price on grain, and that is the ceiling beyond which you are not going to have to pay for grain. The excellent package that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) produced showed the way to the government. The government is so busy pursuing its own trivial interests. As I mentioned before, none of the government members are here in the House to worry about what goes on in the parliament. I doubt whether any of them even understood that the package the honourable member for Gwydir produced would have given primary producers a chance. The measures announced by the government help the bottom few per cent. They provide little money and little help; they are inadequate. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that the government does not try to do anything to preserve the breeding herd. Fifteen years ago the then Minister for Primary Industry produced a package which amounted to $320 million for the fodder subsidy and $36 million for an interest rate subsidy. That was in then money terms. Those opposite do not understand that that money has long since been repaid to the government and to the people of Australia by way of the enhanced earnings which were possible because the breeding herd was preserved and because people were able to stay on the farm. Staying on the farm is another of my real concerns. I do not think the government has even addressed this issue. I was interested to look back to 5 May 1951 and to see what Dr Rex Patterson, the then member for Dawson in Queensland and the shadow spokesman on primary industry, said about the rural sector. On page 2586 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 5 May 1971 he is reported as saying: What is the point in propping up producers who in the end will get further and further into debt? It would be far better to take a more progressive and to phase these people out give them a chance to get out now before it is too late. That is all very well. I read in the paper this morning that about 25 per cent of farmers are going to leave the land after the drought. The government does not seem to comprehend this situation. If we let people go from the land, we lose the principal powerhouse of this economy. Sure, it has changed but it is still a powerhouse which has contributed significantly and will contribute significantly, particularly in generating export earnings. With the most critical economic problem in this country being our chronic adverse balance of payments-the balance of payments deficitwhat is the government doing? Not only is it letting one of the sectors that contribute to reversing that balance of payments wither on the vine; it is giving it a kick in the backside, and trying to get it out of they way as it does so. There are a lot of things that the government could do. Let us come briefly to the positive elements. What is not here and what should be here? The first point is the amount of money. The government does not seem to understand this situation. If the Prime Minister can spend $2V2 million on a house at a fancy residential address in the heart of Sydney, why the devil can he not do better than provide $82 million a year to a few in the farming community who are going broke? Why can he not extend that money to help those in small business? There is talk about ghost towns. They are not some sort of a dream time concept. They are there-the vacant premises, the vacant shopfronts, the vacant business houses. People are walking away; they have got no chance of survival. What does this crowd opposite do? It walks away and ignores them. The first thing we have to do is provide additional money to help those in small business so that they can stay there. We can help them to cover their debts. Their debts are rising. The number of creditors is rising. Small businesses are not meeting their bills month by month. Of course it is happening. There is no other way they are able to cover their credit. There is a problem with the capacity of the average creditor in the country view being able to meet liabilities to lending of production. Let us institutions. All of us have been critical of the banks in various ways. I am most concerned about the way in which the penalty interest rate increment applies. If we had something like the interest rate subsidy that Peter Nixon introduced in 1982, we might be able to overcome these circumstances. Those who are worse off in the rural sector, those who are trying to borrow money to buy feed, would be allowed to continue to operate their accounts on a viable basis. Sure, time and circumstances have changed. It is true that you could say, 'In those days interest rates were 12 per cent and today they are lower.' I commend the government for the fact that interest rates are lower, but they are stilI disproportionately higher than those paid by most of our competitors. As far as the banks are concerned, an interest rate subsidy would enable us to overcome some of the problems. I come to the third element that is quite noticeably absent. As I suggested before, the government should understand that the states themselves have a role in natural disaster relief. Queensland is introducing a scheme to help small businesses. I have identified what the New South Wales government is doing, and I commend it for doing that, but its financial resources are limited. I believe something is being done in Victoria too, although I am not sure of the detail. The important point is that this government must do more than just talk about drought relief in exceptional circumstances. We have already seen the appalling consequences of the present drought. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) gave an excellent speech yesterday when he identified the implications of six rural lands protection boards which were previously to be included in this scheme now being excluded because of some calculations that have been made. To make it even worse, even if the drought goes on for another month or two, they are not going to be brought within the scheme. It is quite ridiculous to have a very narrow definition of those areas which are to receive any benefit from this package. Leaving that aside, it is important to undergoing stand that the states too have a role. The federal government could very easily and, in my view, must provide for a natural disaster scheme which includes drought. The definition now prevailing, which excludes those six rural lands protection boards, must be redefined. It is absolutely inequitable to exclude those who believed they were going to be included and who have suffered inordinately. That is the product of an arbitrary decision. Whether it was made by the bureaucrats or the minister, I would not know, but it has certainly meant that people are being inequitably excluded. They should not be. The next element in my positive program is that thegovernment must make sure it works with the states in developing a reasonable way to help the states with their programs. Some areas where help can be given are already apparent. There is a limit of 1,500 kilometres on the grain subsidy for New South Wales. It is a lot further than 1,500 kilometres to bring lupins or grain across the continent from Western Australia. There is a limit of $15,000. The longer the drought goes on the more people are going over that limit. The federal government should say that, after a minimal expenditure by the state government, it is prepared to provide funds to help in drought relief measures that can be agreed on between the states at the Australian Agricultural Council. Goodness only knows it was done every year till about two years ago. What the devil is the matter with this crowd? Can those opposite not go out and make agreements? Can they not understand there is a role they can play? That element ought to be in this program. Another form of assistance I noted yesterday might help too. In the CashCrop magazine produced by the Australian Wheat Board, I noticed a paragraph headed 'Grain for equity' written by Ted Laskie, the New South Wales State Manager of the Wheat Board. He wrote: If you're in a drought-declared area, then you can use your remaining equity in the 1992-93 pools to buy feed grain from the AWB. What a great benefit it would be if people could get some equity on the grain they were to deliver not to the 1994-95 pools, for many will not be delivering very much, but to the 1995-96 pools when the drought breaks. Grain growers could reasonably be allowed to borrow from the pool for an amount of grain proportional to that which they have delivered over a number of years so they might buy grain at a reasonable price from the Wheat Board, not for cash but on terms, to enable them to feed their livestock. No doubt federal government help would be required to do it That is another form of assistance the government could provide. This package helps at the bottom end. It is great that the government is doing something but, for goodness sake, can it not get off its backside and understand how serious the problem is? The government's response is inadequate. A great deal more needs to be done and could be done if the government only had the sense, the sensitivity and the sensibility to do it.",14
5,Ms HENZELL,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL," I am delighted to support the Drought Relief Payment Bill, but I am not in a position to support the opposition's amendment. I am interested to follow my good colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) as he has trotted out another great rhetorical flourish, most of it very backward looking. In fact, in response to his final wordsMr Nehl-You could learn from the past too.",18
6,Ms HENZELL,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"The government is in a delightful position to both learn from the past and lead towards the future. I notice that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is in the chamber. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in the chamber because I wanted to make some points in this debate that he may be interested in. I want to address the issues of fodder subsidies and the national herd. These issues have been raised by National Party members, particularly the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), and they are of considerable concern. The other issue that the member for New England raised is why we are not consulting with the state governments. We did. An agreement was reached in 1992 that we would have a national drought policy, not a disaster relief fund, because it was no longer seen adequate as a means of effectively managing drought in this country. The reasons why we have moved away from the idea of fodder subsidies are that they discourage the self-reliance provisions of the national drought policy, they encourage overstocking and they create land degradation pressures at a time of drought. The main beneficiaries of the subsidies are transporters and fodder suppliers. The subsidies are not based on an assessment of need and are inequitable across industries. For instance, they provide little or no help to grain farmers in drought areas. It is typical that, we hear a great deal of breast-beating from the members opposite but not particularly constructive suggestions. One of the concerns raised by my colleagues opposite is the effect the drought is having on the national herd. This is obviously of importance to this country, as the member for New England said, for our balance of payments. It is vital that we maintain our national breeding stock. Let us look at what has happened over time. The Queensland sheep flock is now slightly larger than it was during the last major drought. The significant decline in numbers from 1991 is in response to the decline in wool prices as well as the dry conditions. The declines have been similar for wethers, down by 22 per cent, and for ewes, down by 25 per cent. The sharp decline in wool prices means that we cannot attribute the decline in sheep numbers only to drought. I now refer to the beef industry, which is very important in my electorate. Since 1981, the female beef herd in Queensland has been in excess of 4.2 million head, growing to 4.8 million head in 1993. Since the end of March 1993, the female herd has declined to 4.6 million head-a decline in 1993 of only five per cent. Members should note that these figures are as at 31 March each year. We have not seen a massive decline in the national herd. I think it is very important to note that, during this period, we have seen improved fertilisation techniques. I inform the House that my husband is working at the animal genetic breeding unit in the member for New England's electorate. That unit is working very hard with producer organisations to make sure that we improve the genetic mix of both the national beef cattle and pig herds so that we have an effective product, particularly for the export market. While it is extremely worrying and very distressing for farmers to make decisions to reduce stock numbers on their properties, it is essential if we are to have environmentally sound land management. I will refer to an article in Saturday'S Courier-Mail about Dr Dean Graetz, a CSIRO scientist. He was very critical of our farm management techniques and was pilloried by a number of people for saying something that I believe is very important. The challenge of this drought is not only for the government to provide direct relief, which is the import of the bill before us today, but also for our rural organisations, producers, government and scientific organisations to address how we are going to manage our breeding program in the rural industries in the face of the very dry climate we have in this country. The article states: ""Every time. I read a story about someone who has had their fourth crop fail, or whatever, I know there is a farmer who has not made sound business decisions,"" Dr Graetz said. The article further states: Dr Graetz was aware that what he said was bitter medicine for many pastoralists and was aware of the agony evident in many families. Although he is now studying climate change in Canberra, he has previously worked in western Queensland on land degradation and in the Division of Wildlife and Ecology. So it is not as though he is, as was suggested, a Canberra bureaucrat. The article continues: But he insisted that drought was a manifestation of a wider problem-a lack of management skills in the rural community. ""One local paper had a story about a grazier spending $1,000 a week hand-feeding sheep,"" he said. ""The sheep weren't of good quality and so could never return enough to get him out of the debt he's getting into. So where is the sound business decision? It is very important for rural producers to face these very difficult facts in these circumstances. One of the reasons there ought to be a decline in the national breeding herd at a time of drought is that we have to maintain the environmental integrity of the country. There are indeed many areas of this country which are marginal. The areas will need to be reassessed as to whether even dry farming should take place in those areas. These are the hard decisions that we are going to have to make if we are going to look after our country. The National Party leadership was over a period of years guiding the rural fortunes of this country, and we have now got the benefit of that leadership with environmental degradation in many areas of this country-the Murray-Darling basin, to name one. It is very important to counter the idea that this is an exceptional drought in a long-term climatic sense. Coral samples taken from the Great Barrier Reef indicate that the norm in our country's long history is to have many years of drought-not two or three or four bad seasons, but as many as 16 years of drought. Obviously, none of us look forward to that prospect with any sense of positiveness. We have to face the fact that the recent history of our country may have been the abnormal. While we expanded land use and developed what has been a very important rural industry in this country at a time when commodity prices were high, when it was very easy for us to make a good living off the sheep's back and off the back of our increasingly effective cattle herd, we are now facing the fact that we are going to have to look at these issues very carefully. This bill aims to help those efficient producers. The Prime Minister said in his speech on 21 September that we were not going to leave the rural people behind. I reiterate what I said in the Main Committee on 21 September, the day the package was released. I might add it was also my birthday. The drought relief package was the best birthday present that both I and Senator Sue West could have had. We share 21 September as our birthday. Mr Andrew-That was very generous of Senator Collins.",19
7,Ms HENZELL,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"-I know. How lucky can we get? We took the opposition to task on that day. In my speech in the Main Committee I quoted TIm Stevens from the Australian. I was taken to task by my colleagues the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and the member for Wakefield, among others. Indeed, my comments were taken up in the MPI on the following day by my colleagues the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the member for Calare (Mr Simmons). We were putting not just our view on the coalition's policy but the views of rural organisations and the press in this country. I refer to some of the comments made by people in response to the government's rural relief package. The Australian Council of Social Service on 21 September said: This is a strong, creative and positive response to these calls for actions. This much needed initiative will be applauded by the whole Australian community. Lex Buchanan from the Queensland Farmers Federation said on radio 4BC that he was very pleased with the package. National Farmers Federation President, Mr Donald MCGauchie, said on 21 September: Senator Collins, backed by Mr Keating, has done a good job for the farm sector. Both have our sincere thanks. Overall, today's package is a positive Commonwealth response to severe drought in the eastern states. Ian Macfarlane, the President of the Grains Council of Australia, said: Drought stricken farmers have been given new hope for the future with today's commitment by the federal government . . . The Prime Minister and Senator Collins had stood by their commitment to help drought stricken farmers. These commitments, given during recent drought toursand I was on that central Queensland tourhad given the rural community great expectations, which have now been met. He also said in an interview on 4QR: ... PM and Bob Collins have done an extraordinary job in assisting drought-stricken farmers ... quite outstanding ... far better than (we) could have hoped for . . . closed off no avenues . . . gave a clear message there is hope . . . farmers can look forward to the future ... you have to give credit where credit is due. This did not come from the ACTU or me: it came from peak farm organisations. John Crawford from the New South Wales Farmers Association said: A very significant step ... The government has taken an extraordinary step ... a giant leap forward to solving a major problem. The Prime Minister is to be applauded. With regards to the fodder subsidy proposed by the opposition: Flynn said it had been rorted in the past addand that's probably why the government wouldn't not go for it. The editorial in the Canberra Times of 22 September stated: All reasonable people will applaud the drought relief package but especially the decision to abolish the assets test for assistance. So across the board the government has been applauded for its efforts in this area and that has made it very difficult for the opposition to be positive. There is no doubt that it is very difficult for oppositions to oppose positively. When the Executive Officer of the National Farmers Federation, Rick Farley, wrote an article in the Australian of 26 September, the difficulties for the opposition continued. Mr Farley has been roundly criticised by the National Party and the opposition in general for his support on Mabo and other matters. This is an example of where, unfortunately, peak rural lobby organisations are far ahead of the opposition parties on rural policy. Mr Farley said: The ALP has been picking up support in regional Australia over the past 10 years-partly as a result of demographic changes-and now holds almost as many regional seats as the coalition. The Prime Minister's trip to drought areas in Queensland, leading up to the drought package, was remarkably successful. The fact that the package includes some of the proposals put directly to him at that time has not gone unnoticed. Keating is now in the position of being able to say: 'We came, we saw, we listened, we acted.' It is probably the case that not many farmers would consider changing their vote in response. The real benefit to the ALP could be in the regional towns and cities, where local businesses are badly affected by decimated farm income. Any improvement in farmers' cash flow will have a direct benefit there and that's where the swinging voters are. I understand that this article was not particularly well received by the opposition parties. In the Australian of 1 and 2 October, Tim Stevens, from the Australian, said: Mr Downer, Liberal Party federal director Mr Andrew Robb and former Liberal leader Mr Malcolm Fraser have all attacked the NFF, either publicly or privately in phone calls with Mr MCGauchie who, like Mr Andersonthe honourable member for Gwydir, I might is trying to calm everyone down. In response to the coalition's comments, Tim Stevens said: In response, an NFF source said 'The problem with the coalition is that they haven't come to grips with not being in government. We don't need them and certainly we don't want them until they get their policy act together. Besides, despite all this bickering, we are still far softer with them than we are with Labor.' Unfortunately, the opposition finds itself between a rock and a hard place. It is therefore difficult for excellent members like the member for Wakefield, who always speaks with concern, care, consideration and fairness in this House. But I felt it a requirement on myself to bring to the notice of the House this widespread criticism of opposition policies. We have not been about a knee-jerk reaction. Our policy has not been in response to a media campaign, as suggested by my colleague the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who continues to bleat about the issue. I suspect that the amendment to this bill that is before us today is the last gasp attempt by the opposition to salvage some credibility. We listened to the concerns of small business. They were put directly to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and to me and to the many other members of the government who have been out there consulting with people in the bush. We have a large constituency out there in rural and regional Australia. We did not just knee-jerk this reaction. This is a considered policy response. The financial assistance available in this package will have a significant flow-on effect to the small business sector in rural and regional Australia. We will see that pick up once farmers have the money to spend. They will be able to go out and spend that money locally. There is a disappointing aspect to the well meaning assistance provided by city people to country people. Busloads of bread and basic things landed in country towns in a well meaning, though unthought out, attempt to provide help. It caused major problems to small business people, who were carrying large debts on behalf of farming families. We have made sure that our policy will assist those people through the flow-on effect. I believe that we will see that sooner rather than later. It has been estimated that, between the normal RAS and the increase in exceptional circumstances RAS, rural industries already have access to another $660 million of resources because they will be able to manage their loans. What this policy is about is making sure that those efficient, effective, viable farming producers will be able to withstand what is a very difficult drought in many areas of the country. It may not be the most exceptional if we look back 200, 300 or 400 years, but it certainly has been a difficult drought. The challenge now for the government, working together with rural producers, is to put in place a set of policies for long term investment options that will make sure that we do not allow inefficient, unviable producers to go out onto marginal country further degrading that country. We must protect our viable producers so that the rural industries will continue to provide an important part of our export opportunities. At the same time we will not leave any other areas of the community behind. That was the thing that most impressed the people who met with the Prime Minister at TImbaroo. They saw someone who was caring. They got past the media image of the Prime Minister when he said to them very directly, 'We will not leave the rural people of this country behind.' They thought, 'There is hope here.' This drought relief package is an embodiment of that commitment. This government consults with people, with state governments, with the industries concerned and with the people at the grassroots and has delivered an excellent package. I commend the bill to the House.",20
8,Mr ANDREW,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Wakefield) (10.29 a.m.)It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) in this debate on the Drought Relief Payment Bill. I acknowledge her generous remarks relating to previous debates on rural issues, in which we seem to constantly be scheduled to follow one other. I do, however, think that she is being a little less than fair by suggesting that the opposition has been excessively critical about the drought package of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I remind her of the remarks of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who preceded her in the debate and welcomed the drought package. Most of the opposition press releases that I have seen since the release of the drought package indicate that the opposition has recognised the need for this package and has welcomed the welfare measures contained therein. While I do not have the documentation at my fingertips, I well recall the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), indicating that much of the package announced by Senator Collins reflected the very things that he, as shadow minister, had 10 days earlier indicated would be in a drought package if the opposition were in a position to be the government. I think that the opposition has been much more accommodating about this package than the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia indicated. I concede that in the Main Committee there was a debate over the comments Mr Stevens had made in relation to the opposition's drought package. Most of that debate, however, was over the impression of division over the drought package between the Liberal and National parties that Mr Stevens had sought to draw rather than over the context of the government's package as such. In participating in this debate this morning, I acknowledge that I, along with other bers of the opposition, am grateful for the action the government has taken with the drought package. Our criticism has been criticism that always comes from oppositions, Australia. and I think in this case it is valid. It is this: while the package is welcome it is too little, as indicated by the right honourable member for New England in his comments. He pointfodder ed out that, when he was in government, in 1982 $320 million was made available for or fodder subsidy and $36 million was made available for household support. This comthe pares rather favourably with the government's present offer of something like $82 million per annum, or $162 million in total. The opposition has not commented that the action by the government is not welcome but that what the government has done-as is stocks and herds. often the case with governments-is too little, too late. The bind we as a nation face is that we have not faced a national disaster such as this since 1982. In 1982, a nationwide drought, gripping not only Queensland and northern New South Wales but also Western Australia and much of South Australia, was one of the major factors in forcing the Fraser government from office. The fundamental problem that the opposiIn tion sees with the government's drought into package is not that there is anything specifithe cally wrong with the package but that, as has been said by previous opposition speakers, the drought package offers a welfare measure for farmers-which is welcome-but does little to keep in place the flocks and herds which available. will be necessary when the drought breaks and we look once again to agriculture genersense ating some real export assistance and doing something to address our disastrous balance of payments problems. I want to reinforce the points made by the right honourable member for New England. We are facing a situation where-thanks to government and opposition cooperation on the question of the GATT and on trade generally and thanks to the outcome of the Uruguay Round-it is reasonable to expect that in a good season Australia will face firmer wool prices and dramatically better beef prices. It memis also reasonable to expect firmer wheat prices. Feed prices for stock will consequently rise, which will cause a real dilemma in how the to go about restocking drought stricken For that reason, the opposition has not only welcomed these welfare measures but said that we need to have some reasonable form of subsidy and some capacity either to get feed to some desperately hungry livestock to get livestock out of that situation and to where the feed is presently located. Clearly, cost of moving feed to livestock or livestock out of a drought stricken area is beyond the resources of farmers for whom cash is already scarce. For that reason, the opposition has called on the government not only to implement these well farm measures but also to recognise the need to preserve the nation's The honourable member for Capricornia was understandably concerned about what she saw as the potential for land degradation in the face of a drought. We all know that. I have to say, though, that droughts are rarely good for land. Farmers do not tend to keep stock running over land that is already desperately drought stricken because there simply is not the water available to sustain that stock. the face of a drought, most farmers move some sort of feedlotting situation so that stock are not moving far for water but are located close to a water point and so the feed is either brought to the stock or, as I said, the stock and herds are totally relocated to another part of the nation where some feed is What we are proposing does not in any add to land degradation; in fact, the opposition's proposals minimise the land degradation that is characteristically a part drought in Australia and allows us to ensure that stock are not moving over land that has no feed on it and travelling large distances to find what little feed is available. That does not last long. They soon consume it. You then have a situation in which the stock simply have nowhere to travel because there is simply no feed and the stock will die. Instead of that, most farmers centralise a water point and provide some form of feedlotting. I challenge the point of the honourable member for Capricornia that, in many ways, there has been increased land degradation in Australia as a result of coalition policies. I have observed that, in my electorate, in the last two decades land degradation has been less and less a characteristic of rural Australia-no matter what the season. Much of my electorate is made up of the Mallee sections of South Australia, some of the driest and most unpredictable parts of rural Australia. I can take anyone to the Wanbi Research Centre, where they will see a great deal of work that has been done by farmers and the department of agriculture in difficult droughtlike conditions to ensure that the sandhills, which were always so much a characteristic part of the Mallee and which, since the Mallee had been cleared, had been increasingly encroaching into productive agricultural land, are now held in check. The sandhills are held in check by the very careful use of farming techniques, by increasing chemical tillage, by ensuring that stocks of rye, generally, are sown on those sandhills at appropriate times to keep them in place, by making sure that they are not stopped and grazed in their fragile condition and by making sure that they have been appropriately fenced. I contend that, for much of Australia, the real problem of land degradation as a result of agricultural activity is dramatically less than it was two decades ago. That is a great credit to every farmer because those two decades have seen some very difficult years in terms of drought and in terms of commodity prices. In the face of this much has been done, not only in the Mallee section of my electorate but in the west coast part of South Australia, to ensure that land is now kept in of place and that persistent dry seasons do not see the level of dust storms that once characterised agriculture in this nation. I have referred to the west coast of South Australia. I think we ought to pay tribute by the role played by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), who represents what has to be the most drought afflicted part of South Australia. I spent some time in his electorate 10 days ago, viewing some of the worse drought afflicted areas around Ceduna. It is obvious that the honourable member for Grey not only has a real rapport with the farmers of the area but, having been and continuing to be a farmer in that area himself, understands precisely what they need. It is fair to comment that, in the context of this particular drought package, there is nothing for those farmers on the west coast of South Australia who are currently facing a drought. The honourable member for Grey, in his responsible role, does not claim that there should be a large portion of this package directed to his farmers, even though they are in the grip of a drought. The opposition recognises that dry seasons are characteristically a part of agricultural Australia, that every farmer has an obligation to prepare for dry seasons and that only in three or four dry seasons-such as we have seen in northern New South Wales and Queensland-has it been appropriate for there to be federal government intervention, as has occurred with this drought package. However, I point out that the farmers represented by the honourable member for Grey face an extraordinary situation. He has already, I am sure, made this patently clear to the House in previous debates, as he has to the party room. The difficult situation his farmers face is that, while this is the first year of severe drought they have had, over the last three years they have faced a calamity. In one year, there was too much rain at harvest time, so effectively they harvested nothing and what they did harvest was available only for feed. On another occasion, so intrusive was a plague of mice that a great deal of damage was done to the ripening crop and to much of what had subsequently been harvested. So, in many ways, the farmers in this area face three years of dramatically poor income and effectively three years of drought, even though it has been raining. I think it is fair to say that what the governWudinna ment has failed to do in recognising the needs of Australian farmers is allow Australian farmers to prepare for the sort of calamity that is characteristic of farming. What the opposition has been critical of, and I think rightly so, is that the government has been too slow to pick up those sorts of initiatives that ought to be in place for every farmer. A classic illustration of the way in which farmers are able to prepare for difficult seasons that characterise rural Australia, not for a situation like that in Queensland and northern New South Wales, is the provision of effective and viable income equalisation deposits. I think there is a real case to be made for the government looking again at its lED scheme-looking at the tax arrangements that apply when IEDs are set aside, at the interest rates that apply to IEDs and at the tax arrangements that apply when IEDs are called on in years of low income. The challenge the government faces if it is to encourage farmers to anticipate the difficult seasons such as the farmers in the electorate of Grey are currently experiencing is that of providing farmers with a real incentive to provide for low income years. This is a policy area that needs investigation by those on both sides of the House, but it may be that IEDs should apply to a broader band than merely farmers, given, as the opposition amendment suggests, that droughts also impinge severely on not only the farmers in a community but also the small businesses which are so dependent on those farmers. It is the opposition's amendment and its impact on small business that I would like to address the House on briefly in these remarks. While I toured the drought stricken area of the electorate of Grey I spent some time in the town of Wudinna. In Wudinna in South Australia, to the great credit of all the farmers there, who are facing their third year of low income, they were not facing the member for Grey and me suggesting that we should be badgering the government for some additional handout. They were saying, 'We would like greater opportunity to take those farmers in Wudinna who are unable to survive and keep them in the community of Wudinna so that survives, and all other little rural communities survive, even though they may not be farming.' Thanks to an action by the present federal government, Wudinna has in place a telecentre, a modern communication facility that allows access to all sorts of information on computer terminals, with someone who understands how to drive a computer. The computer terminal is located at a convenient place in the town so any community organisation can go and communicate and get information on a range of activities, even a TAFE course if necessary, which is effectively fed into the centre of the town of Wudinna. They welcomed that and they were making this telecentre work. What the people in the town of Wudinna pointed out to both the member for Grey and me was that the real difficulty in keeping people in Wudinna and keeping the rural community of Wudinna-or any other rural community in any other rural electoratealive in the face of falling incomes was in actually having something other than farming for people to do in Wudinna. They said that, thanks to the telecentre, they have brought in farmers who clearly have real skiIIs-in steel prefabrication, in mechanics, in management and, in some cases, salesmanship as well. There is no reason for them not to be cultivating steel prefabricating or management skills or developing all sorts of alternative rural enterprises in Wudinna other than that the cost of production in Wudinna makes it so prohibitive for them to get started. Part of the challenge that I think the government faces therefore, if it is serious about a real package that addresses the needs of rural Australia and allows rural Australia to prepare for the sort of unpredictability that characterises rural Australia, as the member for Capricornia has insisted, is that of addressing seriously the cost of production that characterises rural Australia. Why is it that the proposal advanced by the opposition in the last election, which was simply to take the cost of transport in rural Australia and prune it dramatically by making the excise on fuel refundable to those who were using it in business, was not picked up by the government? If we could reduce both the unreasonable cost of employing people in rural Australia, not by being exploitative clearly but by freeing up the industrial relations sector, and the unreal cost of transport in and out of rural Australia, we would do something to allow businesses to set up alternative enterprises in regional centres in Australia. Much of the amendment currently before the House is to call on the government to recognise that any drought that directly affects farmers, particularly those in Queensland and northern New South Wales, indirectly affects industries in rural Australia, indirectly affects those who are in all sorts of enterprises related to farming but not covered by this drought package. The real challenge the government faces is in recognising that we do not want more centralisation in Australia. We do not want more people moving to the cities and out of rural areas. We want people staying in rural areas. If it is not efficient profitable for them to be in farming, then it may be to conduct a business in a rural area. The unfair cost of those businesses is one of the things that the government could address with an imaginative package. The drought package announced by Senator Collins contains a great deal in the way of welfare measures that have been welcomed by the opposition. What it fails to do is keep in place both the businesses, covered by the opposition's amendment, and the flocks and herds needed by efficient farmers if, when the drought breaks, they are to continue to make a contribution to addressing the balance of payments crisis this nation has. The opposition has called on the government through its amendment and through its speeches to recognise the need businesses have in rural Australia and to recognise the opportunity that will have to be there for farmers to restock when this drought breaks if any sort of drought package is in fact to be comprehensive. I commend the amendment to the House.",22
9,Mr ADAMS,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"I support the government amendments to the Farm Household Support Act to provide drought relief payments to farmers in exceptional circumstances due to extreme drought. It is a terrible situation that many families are facing at present in our country. The underlying principle of the national drought policy agreement agreed by the Commonwealth and all states in July 1992 was that climatic variability is a normal feature of the Australian farming environment to be managed along with the other risks associated with farm businesses. Under normal conditions good farm managers should be in a position to draw on accumulated risk management reserves. The exceptional circumstances provisions are intended to assist in those circumstances for which a good manager could not be expected to prepare. The drought package is targeted at farmers in extreme drought, those that could not be expected to factor such a situation into their risk planning. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has recently varied the guidelines so that instead of two years and continuous drought being considered exceptional circumstances it is now 24 out of 36 months. This is to cater for farmers who had dry years in 1991 and 1992 and, although currently droughted, actually had good crops last year. This has allowed more farmers on the mainland of Australia to qualify for these provisions. This has been a very difficult problem to deal with as everyone in every state has someone whom they believe should be covered by exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the formula has been amended to try to make sure those most severely affected were and are covered. Certain areas of Tasmania have had some extreme conditions where farmers have faced great difficulties. It was enough for the state government in Tasmania, along with representatives from various groups such as the Tasmania Farmers and Graziers Association, the Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries and Tasmania Development and Resources, to develop a drought strategy working group. Although the Tasmanian situation is never likely to be as bad as that of the mainland, there are still farmers in very difficult circumtion stances. Drought varies from region to region and there should be some recognition of this in the definition of exceptional circumstances. I will be seeking to address this through the caucus primary industry committee, of which I am a member. State minister Robin Gray met with Senator Collins and other state ministers to agree on the drought relief guidelines. All states agreed on the guidelines mentioned above, but some believed there was a need to take into account the different drought situations. But, whatever we say or measure, it is very hard to equate the Tasmanian situation with that of northern New South Wales and Queensland. That situation has reached horrific proportions that belong to famine plagued countries, and assistance must be given and given very quickly. That is what this bill is all about. I know that Tasmanians are also facing difficulties, and I would not wish on them the conditions facing those people for whom the main part of this assistance is targeted, but people must not think that Tasmania has missed out from rural assistance. I have been working very hard with this government on a number of programs geared for rural communities. RAP is one of the government's major mechanisms for providing assistance to community groups, industry associations and educational institutions to plan and deliver projects to solve local problems. These projects are designed to improve rural people's access to services and opportunities, including health, education, training, information and social services. This program, although not huge, has been useful for many people. Funding provided over the last two years totalled $61,416. Four of these projects have been in my electorate of Lyons. Then there is the Tasmanian Rural Counselling Service. There are two rural financial counsellors employed by the Tasmanian Rural Counselling Service under the government program. Grants have been allocated from the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio of $138,600 in 1994-95. Rural counsellors provide free and confidential advice to farming families experiencing difficulties for the purpose of assessing the farm financial posiin identifying options for the future. This includes the core activities of these regions, which are, after all, in the primary industry areas. Leading on from that is the rural adjustment scheme, the purpose of which is to provide support for long-term viable farmers to improve their farm productivity and profitability, and to determine whether it is sustainable. It will also look at upgrading farm businesses and property management skills or assist farmers leaving the farm altogether. It is in this area where assistance in exceptional circumstances would apply. To receive RAS assistance, each applicant has a number of factors taken into account in determining prospects of sustainable long term profitability: the capacity to access commercial finance, the capacity of the farm enterprise to become financially independent of RAS support, the level of non-farm assets, the level of non-farm income and the proportion of labour contributed to the farm enterprise. Commonwealth RAS expenditure in 1993-94 for Tasmania was $3.6 million, compared with total Commonwealth expenditure to all states of $150.3 million. The Commonwealth's allocation to Tasmania for RAS in 1994-95 is $2.7 million, compared with a total Commonwealth allocation to the states of about $108 million. Tasmania approved 96 applicants for normal RAS support in 1993-94, an approval rate of 90 per cent. Of the approvals, 14 were for productivity enhancement interest rate subsidies, 17 for training grants, 59 for professional advice and six for re-establishment. It is seen that the most effective way to assist rural communities is to support the base on which they rest. All these programs are geared to look at the wider problem, the multiplier effects and implications for a region if the primary economic resource is suffering. We have seen how this works in the forest industries in Tasmania and now, to a lesser extent, in the farming area. These are long-term programs-they have been in place for some time now-which have been assisting farmers and their families during that time. I fully support the package that has been developed for farmers in those really hard-hit areas. I also commend the minister and his predecessors for their foresight in seeing that we need to change the way in which farming is approached in Australia. We need to promote a better financial, technical management performance from the farm sector. This includes the improvement of farm risk management, with drought being one of the risks to be managed. I saw in my local press only today that, in some areas of Tasmania, the farms which have large areas of native grasses are surviving the drought much better than properties that have a high proportion of improved pastures. This sort of knowledge that is starting to come forward should be utilised within programs to enable us to assist our farming community. It is like the concern being expressed for the future of landcare programs. It would be a shame to see those programs left behind, but one can realise the difficulties in being enthusiastic when one is battling to survive. I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is on the record as saying that the government would look at the taxation scheme with a view to providing further assistance to the rural sector. I hope that area can be utilised through improving land and looking at native grass planting or the planting of shelter belts. In Tasmania's southern midlands and on our east coast, we face great difficulties in maintaining the eucalypt trees that are scattered throughout the farming areas. I hope we can follow through on that matter and maybe use the taxation system in some way in the future to improve the viability and the new way of looking at farming in Australia. I guess that is what RAS is all about: learning to understand drought and drier periods, and learning to come to grips with a new way of looking at the whole area of farming. One of the disappointments in listening to the other side in this debate is failure to come to grips with the new way of looking at farming in Australia. We have to understand why some of that happens, what can be done to limit the damage, how to wait out a reasonable period without too many unhappy consequences. So it is management, managing skills, attaining skills and risk management-all those things. I guess, even if we do that, there will still be exceptional circumstances-times when there is nothing to be done but provide direct assistance to people. With better knowledge and better management, hopefully fewer will require this assistance. After all, our strengths in Australia come from being smarter and being able to outthink our competitors. I guess we should see drought and dry periods as competitors, and we should use our skills to take on that challenge and to improve ourselves. That will happen only by looking at things differently, acting differently, moving down a different way of thinking and changing our culture from the way we have done things in the past. I support the amendments. I certainly wish all those people who will gain some assistance from the bill the best in the hard times that they are experiencing. I wish them well in the future.",26
10,Mr KATTER,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"In speaking in this debate on the Drought Relief Payment Bill, I note that I was most intrigued by the comments of Ms Henzell, the member for the seat surrounding Rockhampton",28
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,Mr Rocher)Capri cornia.,28
12,Mr KATTER,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In her speech, the honourable member for Capricornia quoted a number of experts in rural management. She said that the drought is the farmers' fault and that their current financial situation is their fault. That is the most extraordinary assertion from a person who is paid by the taxpayers to represent one of the bigger rural seats in Australia. I deeply regret that some people of that area had the misfortune to vote for her at the last election. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently returned from one of his many jaunts its overseas, he said that he was very pleased to say that Australia is no longer a quarry or some sort of extended sheep run. It was a dreadful statement; you could hear the vituperative venom dripping from his voice. When I heard this comment it was early in the morning and I thought to myself, 'That's really it; this bloke really hates those people out there who are not in the big densely populated cities of Australia-the people who work in the mining and farming industries in Australia. ' The Industry Commission's recommendations on the tobacco industry, which are most relevant to this debate, say that the farmers are non-competitive. That statement of the Industry Commission was correct, but it inferred that it was the farmers' fault that they were not competitive. Let me state to the House that, yes, the farmers are not competitive-but they face many farm costs. The first farm cost is interest rates, and I do not know any farmer whose interest rates are below 11 per cent. The last time. I looked the official business interest rates were 9.5 per cent. I think they are pretty close to 10 per cent now. When they were at 9.5 per cent, interest rates in the United States, our biggest international farm competitor, were six per cent. So our first farm cost was 50 per cent higher than that of our major competitors. The second farm cost is labour costs. We should not be ashamed or condemnatory-I think we should be proud--of the fact that our farm labour costs are $8 an hour whereas in California, for example, they are $4 an hour. The last time. I cited that figure I was corrected and told that the Queensland industrial court had put farm labour costs up to over $11 an hour. I do not know whether that is correct or not. That is the second cost input item. The third cost input item for agricultural production in Queensland is water. The incoming socialist government of Mr Goss put water charges up from about $3 a megalitre to $30 a megalitre. Our competitor, California-and it has to carry its water about 200 or 300 kilometres on average to the farm gate; we have to carry our water about 30 kilometres in Queensland-charges $3.90 a megalitre for water. So there is a 1,000 per cent difference in the third cost item. The fourth cost item is fertiliser. Urea costs $396 a tonne in Australia; it costs $203 a tonne in the United States. The final cost item is fuel. A litre of diesel fuel costs 25c a litre in the United States. In Australia, even when taxation is deducted, diesel fuel costs 42c a litre. To condemn the farmers for this situation is ludicrous and reprehensible in the extreme. The farmer has absolutely no control over interest rates. Interest rates are set by the federal government. The head of the Reserve Bank and the Prime Minister have made comments along those lines. The Prime Minister said, 'We set the interest rates.' It is a statement that I think he regrets having made, but the head of the Reserve Bank does not regret those comments. Anyone who knows anything knows that interest rates are set by the federal government. So that is a farm cost imposed by the federal government. The second cost, labour, is also imposed by the government. The arbitration commission and industrial courts decide what we will pay for farm labour; it is not under the control of the farmer. The third farm input cost in the state of Queensland is water for irrigation, and I imagine that the situation would be the same in New South Wales. So irrigation costs are also controlled by the government. The other two farm costs were fertiliser and fuel. There is something dreadfully wrong with the trade practices laws in Australia when we have a monopolistic pricing mechanism in Australia where, although world oil prices have dropped clean in half over the last 10 years, fuel prices have doubled here in Australia in the same period. Clearly, there is a dreadful problem with monopolistic pricing practices in Australia. There is no legislation on the books to cope with fertiliser, where there is no competition, or petrol, where there appears to be no effective competition whatsoever. We have a situation in Australia where the three major cost input items are between 50 and 1,000 per cent higher than those of our nearest competitor, the United States, which is a high cost structured country. Those three costs are imposed by the government. The farmer has absolutely no control over those costs. If you want to know why those costs have been allowed to go up in the way that they have, you need look no further than the most unpleasant statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia and the Prime Minister of Australia. They simply do not like farmers. I can say nothing other than that this government has launched upon a policy which positively seeks if not to destroy the owner-operator farms in Australia then to at least take a position of callous neglect which will enable them to go under. Mr Farley, in an article which has been referred to on a number of occasions, condemned the National Party and the Liberal Party. The National Party in my state removed death duties, and that is probably worth the family farm. The next generation would simply not get the farm in our day and age if it were not for those death duties having been removed. We did that. Mr Farley accused us of being non-achievers. Let me name a few of our achievements that come to mind. We set up the Agricultural Bank; the QIDC; the PillA; the AIDC, which was very helpful but I do not have time to explain why; the Rural Reconstruction Board; and the Commonwealth Development Bank. All of those institutions were set up to enable money to be borrowed at certain concessional rates of interest by the farming community. In every other crisis that farmers have faced in Australia this century, they have received assistance from mechanisms of that type. This is the first time that we have gone into a crisis situation and assistance has not been provided. Mr Farley, the representative of the NFF, condemned us. We put those institutions into practice; we preserved the farming sector. When we left office, the average farm income was $29,000. It is now $4,600 in real terms. We provided the assistance to enable these people to survive. Statutory marketing delivered to us the same thing that the industrial award delivers to the workers of Australia. Statutory marketing has been smashed to pieces by the ALP government. Interest rates have been allowed to soar to 25 per cent, and I think that was probably an average figure in the state of Queensland. In a high debt structured industry it was utterly impossible, even at the best of times, to carry those sorts of interest rates. When Farley, who is condemning us, took over, farm incomes were $29,000, there were 179,000 farms in Australia, and the farm debt was $4,700 million. In the 10 years that the NFF has been in existence, the number of farmers has dropped by one-third-which is in keeping with Mr Farley's statement that one in three farmers had to go. Senator Julian MCGauran from the National Party said to Mr Farley, 'Who the hell are you-spokesman for the banks?' Senator MCGauran was dead right in saying that; that is exactly correct. One in three farmers have gone. We now have only 122,000 farmers left in Australia. As I said before, farm incomes have dropped from $29,000 down to $4,600. Farm debt has risen from $4,700 million to nearly $17,500 million. This is the worse period in farm history in Australia. The figures in Queensland clearly indicate that one in two farms in inland Queensland now have a debt in excess of $500,000. Projected incomes for this year are minus $20,000-odd, albeit that that projection was made before the rise in wool prices. All that the drought is doing is delivering a coup de grace to an industry that was dying already. Looking for the contingent causes for that death, I refer to remarks made by Senator Boswell in the Senate chamber. He said that the causes of the wool crisis can be sheeted home to Mr Kerin who, acting upon the wishes of the then federal Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, decided to, firstly, undermine and break the confidence of the marketplace in the minimum price scheme for wool. In the week before Mr Kerin's infamous press conference, the wool price was 890c a kilo and we were selling 80 per cent of the clip; two weeks after that infamous press conference of Mr Kerin, we were selling at the minimum price of 870c a kilo and we were only selling 20 per cent of the clip. Anyone who knows anything about buying and selling or the real world knows that, if you say and clearly indicate that you are going to put the price of your product down and not stand behind it, people who buy after that period of time would have to be fools. Mr The buyers left in droves. But, of course, with criminal stupidity, the Wool Corporation of Australia continued selling. The market and auction system continued. We had massive sellers out there, but no buyers-and the price went straight through the floor. The blame for that can be sheeted to no-one other than those people sitting on the front bench on the other side of this House. The second factor was interest rates. State banks in the main-this is from Trevor Sykes in his book and a series of articles-provided finance for their friends, cronies and party supporters. This was all fully documented in WA Inc., the Victorian royal commission and the South Australian royal commission. Their friends and supporters had $22,000 million parcelled out to them-and Trevor Sykes names the names, so you can check it all up-and the whole $22,000 million vanished off the face of the planet. The Australian banks lost $22,000 million. No-one needs to be told where they went to get that $22,000 million back. The federal government allowed them to borrow money at interest rates of seven, eight and nine per cent, and it enabled them to parcel it out at interest rates in excess of 20 per cent-the highest margin in the entire world. Is it any wonder that, after losing $22,000 million, within two or three years they were back making record profits again? They made those record profits over the broken backs of the Australian farmers, many of whose families have lived out in the country for four and five generations and worked hard but who now have virtually nothing to show for that work. I am sick and tired of going into homesteads where there is nothing on the wallsnothing at all, not even prints. You sit down on chairs that are 20 and 30 years old and that in any self-respecting establishment would have been taken out to the shed and sold off in a garage sale-except that you would not get any money for them; of driving in motor cars that are not yuppie four-wheel drives but, in the main, two-wheel drives because those people cannot even afford to get a four-wheel drive vehicle-and they are vehicles that are 10 years old at that. Recently, in the North Queensland Register, a very reputable paper, I think the headline said that suicide rates soar in inland Australia, in rural Australia. Regrettably, in the last two years, in the area of myoid state electorate, I have attended five funerals of friends of mine who decided it would be far more pleasant to simply leave the planet. Those things would be excusable if they had not been as a result of the actions of this government. I am not talking about taking positive measures. I am not talking about the government removing the IEDs; our ability to look after ourselves was removed when the IEDs were removed. All of those tax arrangements-our ability to carry out water development projects on our station properties and to give us some real answer to drought-were removed. They were removed in years when the government was handing out $1,000 million in one-off items for foreign affairs and its representatives were prancing around the world stage handing out money with gay abandon. . Let me just list some examples: a $250 million commitment last year to the World Bank for which we do not even get any credit; $100 million to Vietnam; $42 million for a bridge in Laos; $7 million last week to a Prime Minister who happened to be here at the time-we wanted to make an impression so we gave him $7 million. These things are occurring whilst the rural people are left to carry this nation. As for the Prime Minister's remarks about Australia no longer being dependent upon some sort of extended sheep run and a quarry, I went through the figures. It is funny how the government has compiled the figures. When you go through the itemised figures, there are only eight figures you can extract from the export items of this country that are non-mining or non-rural items. In fact, only four per cent of our total exports do not come from mining or from rural pastoral and agricultural pursuits. So, whether or not you argue about what point of downstream processing we are talking about, when you look at those figures you realise that he was deadly wrong in his comments. Only seven per cent of Australia's real export earnings come from any sector other than mining and agriculture. If you undermine and break the agricultural sector in this country, then you are simply going to do enormous damage to the economy of this country-and it is already being done. Our cattle numbers are about 30 per cent less, if my memory serves me correctly, than they were 10 or 15 years ago. Our wool numbers are down, it appears, about 40 per cent on what they were six years ago. People are out there shooting away this nation's capital. The value and the wealth of this nation is being shot away and is dying out there at the present moment. I have just come back from visiting the Snowy Mountains scheme last week. I wanted to have a look over it. It makes one proud to be an Australian that almost one-tenth of the surface area of New South Wales has been not only drought proofed but now turned from tiny towns with populations of 3,000 or 4,000-Griffith and Deniliquin-into thriving cities of 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 people. That is what we were able to achieve as a nation when we had an enlightened government in this place which stood behind its workers; even if we did not like the workers, we still stood behind them. If you love your country, even if you do not like the farmers, for the sake of your country you should at least stand behind them and try to help them. It is impossible to look calmly at what has been done here: the destruction of the Agricultural Bank, the PIBA and the Commonwealth Development Bank. I carry around with me a number of heart breaking letters which were written by supporters of the Labor Party. One of them said that it had made him cry, that tears had rolled down his face when he thought of everything in which he had ever believed in a lifetime of supporting the Labor Party. He said that the only person who had got up and made a statement against the destruction of the Commonwealth Development Bank was a Tory-and we have had a number of letters along those lines. It has been said in this place by a member representing country people that it is the farmers' fault that we have this situation; member for Capricornia has said that. The Prime Minister has expressed what he thinks of Australia's farmers. What are the causes of this situation? Our debt was $17.3 billion before this drought came upon us. It has not increased greatly since then, but there is no doubt that it is the final coup de grace, the final straw out there that is breaking the camel's back. But that $17,000 million of accumulated debt came out of the disastrous wool decision and the imposition of interest rates that the farming sector could not possibly live with. We are the only country in the world which does not have specialised assistance for our farmers. On behalf of the banks, I would like to say thank you for the assistance package. I say that because there is no assistance there at all for the farmers; the assistance is going to the banks. (Time expired)",28
13,Mr LLOYD,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"The Drought Relief Payment Bill which we are debating is the government's reaction to a devastating situation now covering an increasing area of Australia. The government's response is disgraceful. I cannot welcome it; I can only acknowledge it, because it is four years too late and it is too restrictive. There are two types of drought in Australia. The first happens every three to four years, and it is acknowledged that farmers should be able to cope with that situation. The second happens every 10 to 15 years when there is a severe or exceptional drought. That type of drought is very well documented throughout the history of Australia. Farmers and, for that matter, town business people in rural communities cannot be expected to cope with it. For example, look at the situation in Australia in 1793. The early settlers of Sydney would have starved because of a drought had it not been for wheat from Chile. Skipping quite a few droughts which occurred after that, in the 1890s about 40 million sheep were lost in a very severe drought. Once again skipping some of the droughts which occurred, there was a severe drought in the 1940s, in 1967, in 1982, and now, once again, we have a drought that started four years ago in the the Darling Downs and other areas of southern Queensland, central Queensland and northern New South Wales. We are into the fourth year of a drought, not the first year. Well before the last election the coalition was aware that there was a severe drought. We worked with state farm organisations, rural counsellors and the NFF, particularly Michael Tooth: he was aware of the problem, although some other members of the NFF did not rate it very highly. There was recognition then that we were facing not an ordinary but a severe or an exceptional situation. Since time, the drought has been moving south. In my electorate in northern Victoria, sheep kills are under way at the present time. Because of irrigation, the impact that drought is having at this stage would be far less than the impact it is having in most areas to the north. The impact on those rural communities and on Australia is increasing and it will continue many years. One of the ironies of the wool stockpile is that the impact of the drought on wool exports on our balance of payments will not be felt for some time. The stockpile is now a great positive. The release of wool from the stockpile at that higher price will keep up the export prices for wool even though it will not help wool growers. The devastation of this drought has had a very significant impact on other industries, on this country's balance of payments and on the standard of living of all Australians. For example, look at grain. We will not be able to maintain our grain export markets. The figure for wheat exports keeps dropping all the time; it is already less than half of what it was last year. As the standard of living increases in those countries around the Pacific rim there is an increasing demand for barley for beer production. That will not be able to be provided. Legumes, whether for protein for humans or for animals, will not be able to be provided by Australia to countries around the Pacific rim, particularly South-East Asia. A massive kill of our beef herd and our lambs is occurring at the present time. That is probably bringing the consumers of Australia the cheapest meat, in real terms, that they have had for years-probably the cheapest meat, in real terms, of any country in the world. But that will change because of the dramatic shortage that will occur. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) pointed out, it is so sad that the GATT Uruguay Round has provided the beef industry with an opportunity to increase its markets but that we will not be able to provide those markets. Hard won export markets in grain fed cattle, which is highly value added, will not be able to be sustained in Japan, Korea and a number of other countries because of the price of grain, whether importthat ed or local. There is an ironic twist in the case of pig meat, a domestic industry. That industry will suffer because of the high price of grain and the increase in the importation of pig meat from Canada, which has some subsidised arrangements for grain, et cetera. The balance of payments calculation so far is about $2 billion. I believe that is a very for much understated figure. It does not take into account a whole range of other industries which will lose export markets and it does not take into account the importation of grain, which will become a significant factor; it is just starting now. I think we are talking about many more billion dollars of income lost, not just for farmers but for this nation. That is why, when we talk about maintaining the herd and the flock, fodder is critical. Those who criticise the fodder assistance proposal of the coalition are either very naive or they just want to genuflect to this government. No fodder scheme can increase the price of fodder-grain more than any thingin this country because the price of fodder is already above import parity. That is the ultimate levelling effect of price. The Wheat Board received some criticism in relation to its stocks of grain. This government's legislation changed the Wheat Board's role from one of having a.responsibility to provide a drought reserve to one of having just a responsibility for commercial pricing and commercial marketing. I acknowledge that the grain producers would say that fodder schemes and that sort of thing does not help them. That is why any assistance program has to be flexible-to pick up all the different categories that are affected. This drought is also potentially devastating to the environment. The Darling River will be the first evidence of that. It will have bluegreen algae before very long. With several years of drought, the Darling has basically stopped flowing. As the Deputy Speaker would know, getting enough water to South Australia is a problem, with no flow in the Darling because of the restrictions in the Barmah choke and the physical ability of getting water through. It does remind us-and the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has just indicated this-that we should be thankful for those water storages that have been built in southern Australia which mean that the Murray River and the Murrumbidgee River are flowing at this time. Before these water storages, when we had severe drought, those rivers also stopped flowing. Adelaide would really be in trouble if that were the situation now. There is also the problem of ground cover. So many acres of our land are fragile because of the drought. I want to be optimistic. When I look at, say, the Mallee country of Australia and see its productivity, its fertility, its stabililonger ty and its sustainable agriculture and compare it with what it was like in the 1940s, when it was blowing everywhere, it shows what has been achieved and what can be achieved after a drought, given a fair chance. The drought is also devastating for families and rural communities. As the member for Kennedy said, rural debt is already $17 billion, and it will leap. We have had the disgraceful situation where many farm families have not had food on their tables. Their children have had to be removed from school. Town business has dramatically suffered and employment of people in country towns has suffered. This situation is disgraceful because it is not new. Historically, it is obvious that it will occur every so often, and we need to be ready for it. It is disgraceful because the present round of the drought is already four years old. It is disgraceful because, had it not been for Ray Martin and what he did to publicise the drought in the media and the well-meaning generosity of thousands of Australians in country towns and cities who provided food parcels for these people, I do not believe the government would have acted even now. Country people have been treated as though they do not have the same rights as other Australians. There is no longer a welfare safety net for them as there is for all other Australians. They are being provided with food parcels as though they do not belong to Australia but to a Third World country. This legislation is limited because the only ones who will achieve any assistance at all are those who can show they have been in drought for two out of the last three years. Why has this happened when historically it is quite clear that severe or exceptional droughts will occur every 10 to 15 years? It has happened because of this government's ideology against country people and the self-employed and its ignorance of the country. The government removed or changed much of coalition legislation that was automatically in place to pick up this situation. First of all, in 1984 it removed or changed income equalisation deposits-this meant that the very important self-insurance mechanism was no there-less than two years after the last severe drought. It should have been obvious to everybody that that was the best way to help people put some cash aside in good years, which would have been tremendously important for wheat growers, for graziers in low rainfall areas where fodder is not an alternative, and for wool growers while the prices were high. I have seen this government do some very cynical things. In a belated attempt to make income equalisation deposits, or self-insurance, more acceptable, it announced the proposal in one budget and delayed its introduction for 12 months. Because wool prices were high at that time, wool growers were not able to take advantage of the proposal. There have been other tax incentives for on-farm assistance measures, or sustainable agricultural development measures, which others have referred to, which farmers lost faith in because the government kept changing them. This government brought in the assets test for Austudy, for aged pensions and for jobstart allowances in a way that did not recognise one of the great reasons why Australian agriculture is a world beater: it is an intensive user of capital. The average farm capital is $750,000, well above the cut-off for the assets test-and I include the non-incorporated town businesses in the same category in this regard. The government forgot the fundamental point: even if you do have an asset, you cannot sell it in a drought anyway. These people have not been able to get into the welfare net available to all other Australians. The government changed the farm household support to put more pressure on adjustment out of agriculture by basically turning it into a loan scheme. The last thing a farmer wants is another loan when he is in trouble. The right honourable member for New England, who did so much to put these processes in place when he was the minister, brought in farm household support in 1977, even when we had no assets test on unemployment benefits. He recognised the need to have a welfare net for farm householders for 12 months while they sorted themselves out. That is a right given to all other Australians, but this government changed that again. The irony is that the main element of this Drought Relief Payment Bill is basically, in a very restrictive way, a return to the original farm household support concept. This government also removed drought from the natural disaster scheme. Some would argue that it was because of Queensland's use; I would argue that it was because of the South Australian Labor government not being prepared to do anything to help its drought affected farmers at that time. Some would say that the criteria were not right. If the criteria are not right, you change them; you do not drop the scheme. We in our policy recognise that and changed the criteria for drought for inclusion in the natural disaster scheme to 'severe' drought to pick up the devastating situation we are suffering now. The decision to drop drought was made by a 'loaded' committee, which was instructed to remove drought from the natural disaster arrangements which are still there for fire, flood, et cetera. I give credit to Michael Tooth, who was the NFF representative, for the way he fought for this. That is why we decided that severe drought should still be a natural disaster. As the right honourable member for New England and others have pointed out, it is important to work with the states in this regard. Once the natural disaster scheme comes in it not only picks up the state measures that are working there but also picks up, for example, grain growers and town business people through the special loan arrangements. That is the point of the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) on behalf of the coalition. An article was published in the Stock and Land, a rural paper, on 29 September entitled 'Government's can't ignore natural disaster funding'. It states: Governments cannot leave farmers to the mercy of droughts as the Labor Government post-1989 has attempted to do, says respected agricultural economist Keith Campbell. He says while their severity and impact will vary, droughts are frequently beyond the capacity of farmers to cope with, and as such they demand action from government. Keith Campbell, who occupied the Chair in Agricultural Economics at the University of Sydney from 1955 until ... 1982Now Emeritus Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Sydney, he remains closely in touch with agricultural issues and is an occasional commentator on issues close to his heart. One of these issues is drought policy, or more particularly (as he sees it), drought non-policy. Professor Campbell is scathing in his condemnation of the Hawke Government for deciding in April 1989 that droughts should no longer be part of natural disaster arrangements. He argues that this decision, followed by its adoption of the recommendations of a Drought Policy Review Task Force, lie at the root of today's drought crisis. That is the loaded committee I was referring to. The article continues: Professor Campbell says the new arrangements overturned a tradition of government commitment to drought assistance that dated back before Federation. For most of this century, he said, a ""wellrecognised formula"" laid down the respective obligations of State and federal governments in terms of drought assistance. ""Seasonal droughtsthat is, the droughts every three to four yearswere recognised as the individual farmer's responsibility ... more widespread ones normally would attract State aid, and occasionally seasonal losses would be of such a degree that Commonwealth aid was needed."" He said while the various thresholds were not as well defined as they might have been, the system was a workable one and certainly a far more effective arrangement than the one now in place. Specifically, the notion that drought relief be effectively channelled through RAS and its ""exceptional circumstance"" provisions-as recommended by the drought task force-had proved to be ""totally flawed"". The inflexibility of the ""exceptional circumstances"" eligibility criteria ensured that necessary government help was being denied to many deserving farmers, as was evident from the disparity between the States in their uptake of federal funds. Professor Campbell said the inescapable conclusion was that extended droughts of four or more years' duration were ""beyond the competence"" of the Government's present legislation. The point I want to make is that, unless you have something automatically in place-such as IEDs, farm household support and natural disaster arrangements-anything a government does will be too little, too late, too restrictive. 'Exceptional circumstances' is probably the best and worse example. Non-interest loans will only be provided to farmers, not to town business people. But the criteria for achieving exceptional circumstances are so restrictive that very few qualify for it. It is also limited by the budgetary amount that is allocated whereas with natural disasters there is no limit once you get into the formula. This bill is confirmation of everything Professor Campbell has said and of everything the critics have said about this government being too little, too late and still not fully aware of the total impact on rural communities of this devastating, severe drought. I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party.",32
14,Mr HICKS,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Like all members who have spoken before me, I support the Drought Relief Payment Bill, which implements a much needed and long overdue drought package, as limited as it is. It is always a pleasure to speak after the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) because there would be few people in Australia who would know as much about the rural sector as he does. Whilst we in the Riverina are not suffering our fourth year of drought, as they are in parts of Queensland, nevertheless in most of the region outside the irrigation areas stock has been put on to many crops where they were planted and where they were able to could break the parched surface. Members who have spoken before me have put the case of those people sadly affected by long periods of drought in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who travels extensively throughout north-western New South Wales and who represents over a third of the state, has pointed out some of the problems with the new drought package, as has the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), whose electorate would be one of the worse affected in Australia. Both would agree that the package in many cases has come at least two years too late. Many farmers reeling from the HawkeKeating government's high interest rates and taxes, along with ever increasing farm input costs, as well as low commodity prices, have been facing a mainly government induced economic drought and have now hit the high sandhill with the long dry period of serious drought. The whole fabric of the bush, already wearing thin under the Keating strain, is now being tom asunder. As I have previously said, the conditions in the dry farming areas of the Riverina, whilst not the worse in Australia, have many people saying that they are facing the worse drought in living memory. Many are already moving to rid themselves of stock, much of it their breeding herds and flocks. As has been said by speakers before me, it is not only those on the land who are directly affected but also business houses in the small and not so small rural communities. It has already been intimated that large animal food producers such as piggeries, pOUltry farms and feed lots are now being severely affected by a shortage of grain and fodder. People who process grain are also being affected because there are limited supplies. Many of these producers are the major employers in rural Australia, particularly in the Riverina. Apart from the lost production, the effect of this unemployment on top of the Keating recession will be horrendous. Many of us who live in rural Australia know how difficult it is to maintain population levels in country towns and how melancholy empty towns can be. I am fortunate that I live in the oasis of the MIA. I am sure many like me are becoming aware, if they were not before, of the importance of conserving the nation's water supplies. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, knowing where you live, I know that you are aware of this. I was interested to read in the Prime Minister's drought statement of 21 September that the government would provide a generous tax incentive for the building of farm storage and water facilities to encourage farmers to better prepare for drought. Whilst nothing much has happened yet, it is indeed good news. However, whilst the conservation of water is the cheapest way to go, we must now get away from the fear that politicians seem to have today of building new, large storage dams, not only for irrigation purposes but also for ecological reasons. We are all aware of the blue-green algae problem, which the member for Murray mentioned; in the past few years it has been re-recognised. But it seems to be a scientific fact that if we can keep a reasonable flow through the systems then the problem of the algae is greatly diminished, even allowing for other causes for algal blooms. For example, the Darling River had stopped running when Captain Sturt crossed it in 1828 and in 1845. Since the 1870s, when rainfall records were first kept, there have been many drought periods in parts of the catchment. The Darling was affected by severe drought for eight years between 1895 and 1902. It was also affected from 1911 to 1916, from 1918 to 1920, in 1940, 1943, 1946, from 1964 to 1966, from 1982 to 1984, and during the current drought. Between Bourke and Menindee the river stopped flowing for 363 days from January 1902. That magnifies the point that the member for Murray was making that, if it were not for the dams on the Murray system, there would probably be no water flowing through those systems at the moment. Although many people blame irrigators for taking too much water, the fact is that if we wish the river to have an assured environmental flow we have to have more upstream storage. Now may be the time to examine the feasibility of diverting the north-eastern rivers for that purpose. The feasibility study will never be cheaper to conduct than at present. Of course, we all remember the promise Malcolm Fraser made that he would conduct an investigation into that project if he were elected in the 1983 election. For those who oppose irrigation or are less than enthusiastic about its implementation, I can only say that the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, FAO, believes that irrigation is essential and that, over the next 30 years, an estimated 80 per cent of the additional food supplies required to feed the world will depend on irrigation. Having said that we need more dams, I agree that the cheapest option for Australia in the short term is to educate people in the conservation of water. But water scarcity is a worldwide problem. Although water is a renewable resource, it is also a finite one. World water supplies are one-third lower now than in 1970 due to a population increase of 1.8 billion since that time. When a nation's water availability drops below one megalitre per annum per person, nations are considered water scarce-that is, lack of water becomes a severe constraint on food production, economic development and the protection of natural systems and human health. We live on one of the driest c.ontinents on earth. Part of our educational process should be to inform everyone, particularly school children, that fresh, potable water is a valuable and finite resource, and its availability will eventually determine the extent of this nation's growth. How many of us waste water or see water wasted every day. I must say that I am a keen gardener, but when I consider that each Australian on average uses 300 litres of water per day in their homes and in many parts of Australia half of the daily consumption is used on gardens I am warned that this cannot continue indefinitely. Another way water use could be contained would be for governments to provide capital for those irrigation schemes that urgently need refurbishment, such as the MIA. Many parts of the MIA are now 80 years old. Wherever possible, the concrete channels should be made watertight and earthen channels concreted or sealed to prevent leakage, which itself poses a problem. More has to be done. I hope to be able to say more on water preservation quality and management on another occasion, but I will now look at the plight of small businesses in areas that are being drought affected at this time. We are all aware that small business throughout Australia is becoming demoralised by the actions of the federal government, particularly as they become more aware of how the recently announced industrial relations policy affects them. There were a number of items on television this morning about that issue. More than two-thirds of Australian small business employers do not want the industry awards in their workplaces that are being thrust upon them by the government. Add to this the effect that drought is having on sales, which have been down for some time because of the recession and low commodity prices, and members can understand why the coalition is moving an amendment which recognises the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia who are affected by drought conditions and calls on the government to act urgently to develop a strategy to assist these people. If the government had moved sooner on this drought relief package, then small business would not have the problem it has today. Two weeks ago the owner of what I considered to be a very viable rural hardware shop in my electorate told me that it was the quietest day he could remember in 20 years. A weed spray salesperson told me his sales were down 80 per cent on last year. These are only two examples that immediately leap to mind. The coalition's policy on drought aid is based on relief, retention and recovery. Firstly, we believe that seriously drought affected farmers must be given immediate relief. Hopefully, this bill will do that, although some confusion does reign. Secondly, people must be able to stay on their land and maintain their herds and flocks. Thirdly, they must be assisted to start again when the drought abates. In relation to the third point, a number of farmers have approached me saying that there is no way they will be able to afford to plant next season's crops and they have asked whether the government could assist banks by having them provide a lien over next season's sowings. I have before me one of the many letters I have received from farmers in my electorate. This letter comes from Tallimba, which is west of West Wyalong. The letter reads: Dear Mr Hicks, I would be pleased if you would again make representations to Mr Collins, Minister for Primary Industry, in the matter obtaining grain to feed stock at affordable prices. We are still waiting for action to stabilise the price of wheat at affordable levels. Only Government can do this, thus also releasing other supplies. I will not repeat any of the mechanisms which can be used-he will have heard them all, however certain points need to be made. 1) Livestock also belong to the nation, not just a few farmers. 2) Shooting has already begunas the member for Murray has already intimated3) Without livestock, producers cannot recover. 4) Recovery to production is important nationally. 5) It takes less outlay and small administrations to make an input into feed grain, than to pick up or payout destitute producers. 6) The world wool trade would welcome a display of public confidence in that industry. An altemative is to go beyond interest subsidies and provide low interest, long term drought loans, to pay for wheat, or to resource next years crop, based on second mortgage, taking care that the huge outlay for wheat at $230 tonne, did not precipitate banks into finalising accounts, already high geared from drought and cost pressures. But, as has been said before by many members, the last thing that producers want today is another debt on top of the debt they already have. For too long now this government has taken farmers for granted. If it were not for the pressure put on the government from the media, farm organisations and the coalition, there would still be little done for farmers, despite the fact that they directly provide 26 per cent of our overseas earnings. As I said before, all types of taxes and interest rates on top of low commodity prices made these people almost peasant farmers even before the advent of the drought. The drought has now highlighted the problem and governments have to decide whether they want our agricultural sector or not. They have to get away from the old socialist class structure idea that if you own a block of land you are wealthy and of a different class. While many on the government side of the House would deny this charge, it becomes evident when you hear many of the interjections that fly from the government side. They just cannot help themselves. All the parliament ever appears to be doing for the farming sector is trying to fix a probing lem long after the crisis has developed and casualties are numerous. People in rural areas are tough and resilient, otherwise they would not be there, but they are also proud and like to be independent. They are sick of being treated as second-class citizens who, as a result of every action of the government, have to work even harder to survive. As I said before, either we want the rural sector or we do not. If we do, we must plan now to ensure that farmers can survive on their own and that they can manage things like drought, fire and flood and not have to have sections of their number continually coming to government for help-not only because of natural events but also because governments carry out acts that are completely beyond the control of farmers and tend to lead those farmers to ruination. If we can carry out this planning, then at least some good may come out of the drought, given that its detrimental effects will last for many years.",36
15,Mr NEVILLE,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"The previous speakers on this side of the House have already highlighted the many ironies surrounding the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994. I, like my colleagues and rural Australia in general, am breathing a collective sigh of relief as, after many attempts to convince the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the extent of the drought tragedy, they have finally responded. To their credit, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, and the government have responded positively, if not somewhat belatedly, introducing many of the in-principle measures that were part of the coalition package; namely, the family income support payment-the drought relief payment, the waiving of the assets test for Austudy and other payments, and a more flexible and expanded rural adjustment scheme. These are all welcome measures and should alleviate some of the burden of drought which, as we have heard today, has plagued many Queensland farmers, including farmers in my own electorate of Hinkler, for up to four years. In recent discussions I have had with the cattle industry, I was horrified at the continuvery high female kill, in particular the high rate of breeders in calf being sold at Queensland meat works. Normally about one-third of the Queensland kill is made up of females, yet in recent months it has peaked at around 45 per cent, with reports of 60 per cent of those females being in calf. For the unenlightened, such statistics indicate a very serious erosion of our cattle herd and put in question our ability to service some key markets in the years to come, even if the drought breaks tomorrow. For instance, the American market could well muscle in on Australia's markets. Hence, I cannot understand why there is such resistance to the coalition's fodder subsidy proposal that was put up by the shadow minister, especially in light of the government's decision now to import $20 million worth of grain. I turning to a few measures contained in the bill. The exclusion of bona fide retirement assets in particular should enable more farmers to access interest subsidies under RAS. Currently, about 2,800 Queensland farmers receive RAS under the exceptional circumstances provision. My advice from Queensland's new Rural Adjustment Authority is that the new guidelines should benefit a further 10 per cent of farmers. The definition of 'long term viability' still remains a bone of contention for many struggling farmers trying to access the scheme, as borne out in submissions to the Senate's rural debt inquiry. The question of preparing for future droughts still remains unanswered. The government has said that it will look at revamping the income equalisation deposits scheme and providing greater tax relief for fodder and water conservation. Let us hope that this amounts to more than just lip service. The return to the former Sinclair regime of IEDs would be most welcome. I applaud the coalition's amendment to this bill calling for the recognition of the plight small business operators in rural and regional Australia. Small business operators are, as has already been said in the debate, often forgotten victims of the drought. If it is not bad enough that country towns have been denuded of government services and facilities, the retailers and small business operators are now being choked by the drought. In my electorate of Hinkler, the drought has hit hard in the small business sector in a number of rural towns, in particular the likes of Monto, Eidsvold and Biloela in the north and west of my electorate. Monto is an important rural service centre containing 80 small businesses-from the taxi driver to the grocery store to the steelworks. The president of the Monto Chamber of Commerce, Ian Brighouse, says that businesses are feeling the effects of the drought, with business incomes estimated to be down 10 to 15 per cent. Mr Brighouse says that business is the backbone of towns like Monto and that the government needs to look at measures like tax breaks to help them survive. The story is the same in Eidsvold and Biloela. Biloela, at the crossroads of the Dawson and Callide valleys, has in the order of 100 small businesses. While principally a rural service centre, Biloela has the advantage of a couple of coal mines and a power station to keep its economy moving. However, my advice is that the business operators of the town are experiencing revenues down 15 per cent because of the drought, with incomes from non-essential small businesses like coffee shops, hairdressers, dress shops, et cetera, down as much as 40 per cent. The Queensland government has recently moved to assist this important sector with the introduction of a 50 per cent interest subsidy on new and existing commercial loans for eligible businesses. The affected small businesses can obtain a maximum of $5,000 per annum, that is, $10,000 over two years. Larger businesses may be eligible for $10,000 per annum, or $20,000 over two years. The pack 1ge is worth a total of $5 million. While I welcome the initiative, I agree with the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association's assessment that 'it will not go of far enough'. With outstanding farmer debts of $150,000 and interest rates on small business currently around 12 per cent, many businesses are carrying interest bills of $20,000 per year or more. In recognising the plight of small businesses in rural and regional areas, I call on the federal government to take the lead from the Queensland government and provide matching funding, topping up not only the actual amount of assistance but also the level of interest subsidies to, say, 100 per cent in line with on farm assistance measures. It would be a relatively easy thing to include in the drought package. Such a measure would be a welcome addition to the federal government's own drought package. I now refer to the molasses situation, which I believe has reached a crisis point in Australia. I wish to use this opportunity to highlight another cruel twist to the drought-that is, the growing crisis in stock feed and related drought supplements in both Queensland and areas of New South Wales. In recent days it has been heartening to hear the announcement by the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, of a national audit of fodder and grain supplies, especially in light of this year's poor wheat harvest and industry speculation about grain imports. However, it does disappoint me that his Queensland colleague the Hon. Ed Casey MLA does not appear to share the same level of concern about stock feed supplies, particularly when it comes to molasses supplies in that state and in northern New South Wales. What is molasses? It is an important supplementary drought feed. As a by-product of the sugar industry, in good times it is available from northern New South Wales right through to North Queensland. Molasses is a critical source of liquid energy. It also supplies an important means of protein supplementation through the addition of urea. Last week, following representations from many graziers and transporters in my electorate, I called on the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, and his state government to address the problem of dwindling molasses supplies in southern Queensland. I urged the minister to consider redirecting export bound molasses supplies from North Queensland to drought affected producers in the south. I also urged the state minister to convene a round table conference with representatives of the sugar millers, the Australian Molasses Trading-that is the conduit for export-the cane growers and the peak bodies of the grazing industry to map out a contingency plan to ensure that molasses supplies continue through the rest of the year and on to the start of the 1995 crushing season. His simple response was that there was no crisis and that I was a panic merchantdespite the fact that I made my appeal in a non-confrontationist manner and certainly in a bipartisan manner. A recent survey of southern Queensland mills south of Bundaberg in my electorate showed that nearly all stocks of molasses were either committed or contracted. Stocks at Fairymead mill in Bundaberg, the only mill with some spare capacity, were effectively being rationed. One local contractor who carries up to 27 tanker loads per week told me that he had been limited to five loads. That effectively means that 22 farmers, or groups of farmers, do not get any molasses. They have no quality fodder. Without the molasses, there is very little chance of their cattle surviving. He had already exhausted the 3,500 tonnes available to him under contract, but expected to carry 7,000 tonnes if stocks were made available. He had to travel up to 600 kilometres to Mackay to offset shortages. However, advice from senior management at the Mackay sugar company, as recently as a few days ago, was that they now have no spare capacity and are only servicing their immediate hinterland customers. Despite the fact that New South Wales producers were sourcing supplies out of southern Queensland, the state Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, refused to acknowledge that there was a problem with molasses supplies. That was last Friday morning. By lunchtime Mr Casey had changed his tune. In an interview with the ABC Country Hour, he finally admitted: ... we've got to the stage where there will have to be molasses brought down from north Queensland into the system in southern Queensland because that's the area of demand. This is the point that I had been making to him during the week. It took him until midday on Friday to acknowledge it. Since then, Mr Casey has seemed reluctant to sit down with representatives of Queensland's cattle industry to do some forward planning on molasses supplies. Meanwhile, the Cattlemen's Union-led by its state chairperson, Mrs Hazle Marland-went ahead and arranged for 6,000 tonnes to be sourced from the South Johnston mill near Innisfail in North Queensland, with a possibility of a further 20,000 tonnes being made available. The state government, in its generosityand I use the term 'generosity' advisedly-has offered to provide six 45-tonne rail tankers to help cart the molasses to a depot in Gympie in southern Queensland, meaning that the flow of important supplies southwards will be under extreme demand pressure all the time. It is hoped that the state will have a change of heart in the next couple of days and will provide additional rail wagon tankers. But if the cattle industry in Queensland cannot convince the state government of the imminent crisis in the molasses supplies, maybe the federal minister can. An ABC Country Hour interview revealed the minister as saying: ... 'We're certainly well aware of the problem I can assure you ... the fact that we are exporting molasses and that it may be required domestically Senator Collins is expected to announce the findings of a national audit of fodder and feedstocks during the current sitting of parliament. I look forward, in that report, to his assessment of molasses supplies. The problem of molasses supplies raises, dare I say it, the 'sticky' question of export contracts. In this season alone, Queensland will export some 430,000 tonnes of molasses overseas, principally to the United States market. Despite a record crushing season, domestic demand for drought feeding is on the rise. We are, I believe, rapidly approaching the situation wherein we may have to consider redirecting some export contracts in order to save breeding stock at home. I appreciate that this may put our export credibility at some risk. Yet we are now importing grain from overseas for the first time in many decades, and that alone should be indicative of the drought crisis besetting our producers. I realise that there are financial and other costs associated with breaking export contracts, but I have written to the federal minister, Senator Collins, calling for special funding assistance to cover such a situation. A guarantee or subsidy may be required to allow either North Queensland tankers to be diverted or, alternatively, for molasses to be imported from overseas. This happened in 1992. The state government was forced to divert from export 60,000 tonnes of molasses to southern Queensland, with a further 24,000 tonnes being imported by the Bundaberg Sugar Co. Surely it would be an appropriate and logical extension of the federal government's drought assistance package for it to find room to assist New South Wales and Queensland producers in funding such a redirection of supplies, if required. I am not trying to panic producers over molasses supplies or trying to politicise the drought. Rather, I am simply responding to a genuine call for help from battling producers. In particular, I am calling on the Queensland government to sit down with the industry and to do some forward planning of molasses supplies before it is too late. Surely the of 1992 cannot go unheeded. In conclusion, I welcome overall the federal government's belated drought assistance package. But we can still go further, as the Prime Minister said, 'to not leave behind the farmers'. The government could look at some special assistance to small business in rural and regional areas along the lines of the dollar-for-dollar subsidy of the Queensland scheme or the likes of an interest subsidy scheme such as that previously mentioned for molasses supplies.",39
16,Mr NEHL,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"I am normally very pleased to be able to stand up in this place and talk about issues that are of concern to Australia and Australians. But I must say that today I can take no pleasure in it whatsoever. This drought is so widespread and it has created so much hardship and devastation that it is with a great deal of sadness that I even contemplate participating in the debate. I do not think that most Australians yet realise the impact of this drought. I do not think that there is any way that they can realise it. Even those in the drought are not yet in a position to realise how bad it is going to be. I note that the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) earlier said that across the board the government has been applauded for its drought relief package. I have got to be fair dinkum. Yes, what the government has done is very good. It is excellent-as far as it goes. But it does not go far enough. She also quoted the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he said, 'We will not leave the rural people of this country behind.' Well, he is not leaving some of them behind. He did take 30 per cent of our drought package proposals. In New South Wales, 93 per cent of the state is drought declared, but 96 per cent of the farmers will not get any help. They will be left out on a limb. They will be left behind.",42
17,Mr COBB,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Woefully inadequate. Mr NEIlL-As the parliamentary secretary says, it is woefully inadequate. I want to take the time that I have to make a special plea for consideration of the situation of the north coast of New South Wales. I will come to the lesson point shortly about what used to be the Pastures Protection Board for the district of Grafton, which was in and then out. That caused a great deal of consternation. The rainfall on the north coast of New South Wales in many areas is quite high. Coffs Harbour, for instance, has a rainfall of 77 per cent. Out west, where they might have a rainfall of 19 or, say, 28 inches, if they lose two-thirds of that, they are in great trouble. If Coffs Harbour and other coastal centres which have a high rainfall lose two-thirds of their rainfall, people say, 'You still have 25 inches; you have tonnes.' But it is not true; it is not realistic. The reality is that the coastal areas with the high rainfall are in a green drought, but still a drought, even when they are getting more rain than the inland. It is a totally different set of circumstances and it needs special consideration. I appeal to the government and to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) to take on board this aspect because it is vitally important to the people I represent. The member for Richmond (Mr Newell), the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and I are all in the same boat-Labor and National Party members trying to look after the people on the north coast of New South Wales. It is a special case. It will be to the eternal shame of the present federal minister if he does not accept that, look at the situation and see what can be done. While I have welcomed the drought relief scheme, there is nothing for small business in it. Numbers of small businesses have been suffering desperately through the recession. Now they cannot get paid and are going to go out of business and go broke. It is disastrous. The government is providing $164 million over two years in drought assistance. I join with those who applaud the government, but it is not enough. To put that $164 million over two years into some perspective, when the government was reorganising the waterfront it provided $430 million in golden handshakes to the wharfies-$100,000 each-to try to get greater productivity on the wharves. There has been some improvement. But how would it be if we could give $100,000 each-I use this purely as an example-to those farmers who are in such dire straits? To put it in perspective, $430 million in golden handshakes to the wharfies and $164 million over two years for the farm industries, the primary producers, the backbone of this country. A one per cent interest rise will cost the farm sector $120 million and the Reserve Bank is telling us that there will be more interest rises down the track, perhaps two by Christmas. A one per cent interest rise on the farm debt will take away $120 million. We are really only dancing around the edges. We are not getting stuck into it. Another example is the gift to ANL, the Australian National Line. In one breath the responsible minister said we could not give it away and the next minute we are giving $20 million a year in income tax subsidies to the company. It does not sit sensibly. There is no comparison between the ANL or the waterfront situation and what is happening in primary production areas right around Australia. What is happening in these areas is total social disruption. We are getting family breakup. Other speakers in this debate have mentioned the absolutely tragic incidence of suicide that is occurring. Unfortunately, we have not seen the end of that. Something more has to be done. What the government is doing so far is good, but it has to do more. I would like to pay tribute to so many individuals, organisations and corporations who have responded in true Australian spirit to the drought. The one great heartening thing that has come out of this drought is that so many people right across Australia are caring and concerned and are exercising their compassion. I will give the House a few examples because I think that tribute should be paid. Some people in Coffs Harbour, where I live, Laurie Wynen and Di Strachan, operate Seafood Mama's, a very good restaurant. They put on four breakfasts and one lunch. They provided all the food, and the staff worked for nothing. That raised $6,119.25. They did so out of the goodness of their hearts. Coffs City rotary club then sent the money on to Narrabri rotary, who distributed it. A committee was set up by Robin Gourlay and, through the Salvation Army, distributed food and other things from the town to needy people in the country. They are able to maintain the privacy of people who need it. The rotary club in Coffs Harbour is sponsoring a food appeal. It takes us back to World War II, with food parcels for Britain. Right around this country, just as is happening in Coffs Harbour with Coffs Harbour rotary, people are being asked to donate food. This is for Australian farmers. I find it absolutely unbelievable. Thank God there are good, caring, compassionate people out there who are doing this. Earlier I mentioned small business. Out in these areas shopkeepers are suffering. They are not being paid. They need help, too. The government has to address that. I have been told that in many places people are selling off their valuable family heritage items just to stay afloat, just to pay the bills. It is not just the stock who are suffering; the Australian people are suffering as well. I mentioned corporations which have been involved in very generous incidents. Caltex provided $8,000 to fund a convoy of hay to Walcha. We all know about the Angry Anderson convoy, which Shell paid the fuel bill for, from Victoria to Texas in Queensland. Ampol provided $2,000 for 12 tankers from Lake Macquarie council, Newcastle council and a couple of private people to go to Glen Innes and distribute water. They have delivered water to 100 farms, each of them getting at least a tanker full, because they had no water. One of the most heart breaking things was the comment one of those tanker drivers heard when he delivered the water. A little boy said, 'Mum, does this mean I can have a bath tonight?' We have Australian kids who cannot even have a bath. While that may be dramatic, it is part of what is happening in this drought. We have to realise that. I tum to the headline in today's Sydney Morning Herald, 'One in five set to quit farming'. Twenty per cent of the states' farmers are forecast to have to leave the industry over the next 12 to 18 months. This is not me scaremongering-this is the head of the Rural Assistance Authority, Mr Graham Maslen, who said this to a meeting of the New South Wales Farmers Association yesterday: ... The Rural Assistance Authority have received requests for help from 1,200 farmers out of the new federal drought package. That figure is expected to rise to 3,000. I would not be in the least surprised if it rose a great deal more. Coming back closer to home, in regard to the Grafton area and the Kempsey area of the Rural Lands Protection Boards, it is pretty disgraceful what happened with the minister's declaration because it raised people's hopes. The Northern Star newspaper on 28 September refers to a statement by the member for Page, who I know is concerned about the farmers in his area but who cannot do enough, either. His spokesman said: . . . I would expect a number of North Coast farmers who have been drought affected now for at least three years would be eligible for assistance under the new measures. Mr Woods has praised the new drought assistance measures announced this week, saying they would provide great relief to drought stricken farmers throughout the country. I tell you what, there is no relief for those on the north coast. The honourable member for Page continued: I have been pleased to have been able to work with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Bob Collins, in the development of this policy. It will help those farmers affected by drought to hold on to their farms and to maintain a reasonable quality of life until the drought breaks. It is a basic improvement to policy which protects the policy directions of the Government That is what they are concerned aboutprotecting the policy directions of the government. That was on 28 September. On 29 September, the Advocate stated: . .. the Federal Government organised a Sky Channel link-up to launch its drought assistance package. During that link-up to explain the package and advise farmers, Grafton was one of the 21 areas in the state nominated as being eligible for drought relief. What a cruel hoax that was. Then, on 12 October, the honourable member for Page again says, 'Oh, for some reason or another, there was a draft list which included a number of areas which should not have been publicised. It was never approved by the minister.' It is not good enough on the one day to claim the great credit of working with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to introduce this package-it was going to be the salvation for farmers on the north coast and the whole country-and then to say what the honourable member said a few days later. I am terribly disappointed by that. It is not the way it should go. The Grafton Pastures Protection Board district has had drought for the last 17 months. It has to have drought for 24 months out of 36 months to qualify for drought relief. It is going to take another 10 months of sustained drought-which will be a total of 27 months-before one farmer in the Grafton Pastures Protection Board area can qualify.",42
18,Mr COBB,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,Heartbreaking.,45
19,Mr NEHL,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"It is dreadful. The Kempsey Rural Lands Protection Board district has been drought declared for 12 of the past 36 months, and people there have to wait another 17 months before they can qualify. I would like to expand on the situation in the Kempsey Rural Lands Protection Board district. At present, 10 per cent of the pasture is adequate, 85 per cent is poor and five per cent is non-existent. If there is little rain in three months, five per cent will be adequate, 10 per cent will be poor and 85 per cent will be non-existent. If there is little rain in six months, that last figure will rise to 95 per cent. At the moment, water supplies are adequate in 25 per cent of the area, poor in 70 per cent of the area and non-existent in five per cent of the area. If there is little rain in three months, there will be adequate water supplies in 20 per cent of the area, poor supplies in 60 per cent of the area and non-existent supplies in 20 per cent of the area. If in the next six months-which is the forecast-water supplies will be adequate in 15 per cent of the area, poor in no part of the area and non-existent in 85 per cent of the area. Grain available for local use is non-existent and 95 per cent of hay for local use is non-existent. The percentage of farms where onfarm slaughter may be needed-farmers, because of lack of money, feed and ability to buy feed, will have to kill their stock-is now at two per cent, in three months time will be at 25 per cent and in six months time will be at 80 per cent. So, if there is little rain in the next six months, people on 80 per cent of farms will have to kill their stock. The major district drought related problems are now lack of water on farms; lack of nutritious fodder; decreased availability and cost of purchased fodder; low saleyard prices, even for fat or feedlot cattle; no demand for store cattle; no agistment available; restrictions on town water supplies for stock; the closure of dairies; and increasing bushfire risks. If the drought continues for another three months, 80 per cent of farms will have inadequate stock water, an almost complete lack of stock feed and a total ban on irrigation. As well, 20 per cent of dairy farms will cease production and 80 per cent will have reduced production. If the drought continues for another six months, there will be a complete lack of water--except for human consumption-and an almost complete lack of pasture, and 90 per cent of dairy farms will have closed or ceased production. This is what we are staring down the throat of. I spoke today to a dairy farmer at Utungan in the Nambucca Valley, where 180 milkers have to buy water just to operate the dairy. They are very close to having to buy water for the cows to drink. For 180 cows, 60 litres a day is required. They are also buying hay. It did cost $120 a tonne but it now costs $175 a tonne. People in this area have been in a green drought for the last three years. For the first time in 30 years, there has been no water in the creek. I have received a letter from Bruce Rossiter from the Macleay Valley Cattlemen's Union, which states: there is little rain Dear Garry, It is with consternation we note that the Kempsey R.L.P.B. west of the Railway Line has not been included in the Exceptional Circumstances Drought Affected Area. We are a high rainfall area averaging 1200 mm. Bellbrook records going back to 1914 show that the last four years has been the lowest rainfall in living memory. 1991-750 mm, 1992-675 mm, 1993675 mm, and so far in 1994--425 mm. West of the Railway line none of the creeks are running. Mungay Creek has not run since June, 1992. The flow of the Macleay river is dropping faster than it ever has. From our inquiries we estimate that 80% of the farm water storage dams are unusable. Most cattlepeople on the Macleay have been supplementary feeding for most of the time in the last four years. We have only been drought declared for 13 months out of the required 36 months being a borderline case in most of the other months. The top end of the Macleay is included in the Exceptional Circumstances Drought Affected Area. i.e. Lower Creek, who have so far this year received 501 mm against our 425 mm. Farmers in this area are desperately in need of assistance. They certainly are. They desperately need assistance. We should note, too, that the NFF has provided an estimate that Australia's winter grain crop has already been reduced by about $2.2 billion compared with last year. The current estimated production of wheat is 10.4 million tonnes, which is down 38 per cent; the current estimated production of barley is 3.4 million tonnes, which is down 50 per cent; and the current estimated production of oats is 0.9 million tonnes, which is down 50 per cent. This is a national disaster. This is what it is and we are not realising it. In conclusion, I urge every farmer in Australia who may be in trouble not to sit there but to make an application for help. Some farmers may be ineligible but, for heaven's sake, we have to let the government know the extent of this. Farmers in great trouble are normally very patient, but it is time to become impatient. It is time to get up and do something. At the very least, all drought restricted farmers in Australia should send in a letter to their federal member and make an application to the rural assistance scheme. Do not wait; do it now. Let the government know the extent of this drought before it is too late. Of course, for many it is going to be too late already, but we have to build on what the government has done. I praise the government for what it has done, but it has not gone far enough.",45
20,Mr VAILE,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"I open my comments today on the Drought Relief Payment Bill by saying that we are not opposing the measures that the government has produced and that this bill is going to give effect to by addressing the extreme circumstances which have been caused by the drought and which are affecting a lot of our rural communities today. I would like to highlight to the parliament today that not just those parts of New South Wales and Queensland that have been declared as having severe drought and exceptional circumstances are drought stricken. The areas that the former speaker, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), and I represent-the mid-north coast of New South Wales-are experiencing extreme circumstances and severe drought. I will give the House some statistics. The rainfall this year has been the lowest on record since 1905. In fact, the situation for water is absolutely desperate, not just domestically but for stock water as well. It is something that the government must keep in mind, yet the people in my electorate are not covered by the Drought Relief Payment Bill and they are not capable of applying for assistance from the government because of the declarations in place. I will read the amendment moved by the shadow minister for primary industries, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), late yesterday afternoon with regard to small business operators. These people are really suffering. I think we have failed to recognise the extent to which they are suffering as a result of this drought, bearing in mind that people in rural towns rely on the rural community very heavily for their custom. As this drought has been biting over the last 12 or 18 months in some areas and over the last four years in other areas, the people in the rural small business community have been very accommodating in extending credit. They have been carrying not only their own debts, the debt of maintaining their stock in trade, but also a lot of the debt of the rural community. The people in the rural community are in such a devastated situation that they have no hope of servicing a debt with small business. It is very important that the government recognise that. The amendment that I urge the government to support, moved by the shadow minister yesterday, reads: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House recognises the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia who are affected by drought conditions and calls on the Government to act urgently to develop a strategy to assist these operators"" . What will happen if the government does not accept this amendment? Is the government saying that it will not recognise the plight of small business in rural areas? If it does not accept the amendment that is exactly what it is saying. It should be made abundantly clear to all small business operators in rural Australia that the government, by not accepting this amendment, does not care and will not recognise the situation that those small businesses are in. Mr Nehl-Leaving them in the lurch.",46
21,Mr VAILE,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Exactly. We will not go down the path that many previous speakers have gone down by putting on the public record all the other areas in which the government this year has recognised the special interests and special needs of different community groups. The bill before us today is a piece of enabling legislation which gives effect to the package that the government announced recently. We support that and acknowledge that the package will go a long way. It does not go all the way-not as far as the coalition policy did when it was released. The government should have followed that. The government's response to the severe drought conditions in Australia today is partly because of the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to two different sections of the rural community in Australia, but it is also in response to the policy that the coalition released a number of weeks ago. We will be poohpoohed by the government members for saying that, but it is a fact. The government, and particularly the Prime Minister, has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to address this very serious issue that is confronting Australia today. It has also just come to realise the devastating effect that the drought is going to have on not only the front line of rural producers but also the rural small business community. It will also affect the consumers across Australia and the people in rural Australia that rely on rainwater for domestic use. I will quote some statistics shortly to outline that fact in my electorate. I make a note here of the parallels between the policy the government has introduced and the coalition's drought package. In relation to the provision of immediate farm family income support, the coalition had a revamped household support scheme and a suspension of the assets test on welfare payments. The government has picked this up via the new drought relief payment. The government has paralleled the measure we announced in advance of its policy. We also outlined improved access to Austudy for children from farm families in drought areas by exempting them from the on-farm assets test for this benefit, greater flexibility and increased funding under the rural adjustment scheme for farmers experiencing drought exceptional circumstances, and provision and assistance through RAS for up to 12 months after the drought breaks. These measures were announced well in advance of the government putting its policy together. That is why we have not criticised the government's package, apart from the fact that it was too late. The government should have been pro-active instead of reactive on this issue. We hear every sitting day in this place from members on the government benches about how many rural and regional seats the government holds. Why were those people not taken note of? Surely those people must have been talking about this drought in the caucus more than two months ago. Why has it taken the government so long to react? The government has been reactive on this issue rather than pro-active. I know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) had meetings with the state ministers for agriculture with regard to getting a standard description of drought declared areas across Australia, but there seem to be-we hear examples every day-arbitrary lines drawn in the sand. People on one side of the line are going to be eligible under this package to claim relief from the Commonwealth government and people on the other side of the line certainly are not. The explanatory memorandum states that one item of the bill seeks: . . . to provide that a person qualifies for drought relief payment if he or she is: a farmer; at least 18; an Australian resident; in Australia; and in possession of a drought exceptional circumstances certificate issued in respect of him or her. The drought exceptional circumstances certificate is issued to farmers by a RAS authority under a memorandum of understanding between the RAS authority and the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The certificate is evidence that a farmer's property is located in an area affected by extreme drought, consistent with guidelines issued by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in respect of the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme. It is still too arbitrary. Rainfall does not observe a line in the sand. So the government, and the minister particularly, should be doing a little more work in that regard to try to make that a little more flexible. There are people who desperately need assistance and need it now, but because of the rule book and because of the arbitrary nature of those declarations cannot get it. So they are suffering while their neighbours 10 miles down the road might not be. It is a vexed question in a lot of areas of Australia as far as this support is concerned and I think the government desperately needs to recognise that in dealing with the measures we are debating today. One thing this debate has brought out is that the government, although it has been there for 10 years, has not had a specific strategy to deal with severe drought in advance. Drought we deal with. Drought is a natural event, as the Prime Minister said. Severe drought we have to be a little more humane and compassionate about. I think the government has a lot of work to do to put in place a proper strategy to deal with this. During the last sitting week I spoke in the grievance debate about the relief-this was prior to the release of the government's package-that was available and the seriousness of the situation. I spoke about a fundraising exercise that was conducted in the town I live in, Wingham, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It is a small community which managed to raise $27,000 on one night at a charity auction. This was all for drought relief for western New South Wales. Part of that money was provided in drought relief through the farm aid program that was developed by the Ray Martin program. In fact, auctioned on the night was one of Ray Martin's more colourful ties. He might be a relation of our current Speaker here, who has the same surname and also wears colourful ties. A lot of the money went through that Ray Martin program, ending up with what I think is called the Farmhand group, which, I am led to understand, is administered by the NFF-and that is fine. All the money raised throughout the community for relief and that is being targeted to drought stricken areas goes through that particular program. One of the government members made me aware after that debate that that money attracts a dollar for dollar subsidy from the government. The government said, 'We will provide the same amount of money as is raised through here.' It ended up with $3 million or $4 million. From that same night, I think $7,500 was given to the Smith Family for exactly the same purpose. In my area and throughout New South Wales, the Smith Family is providing direct household support. The Smith Family is a recognised charity in Australia. It does a fantastic job in these areas, yet to date I am not aware of the government matching dollar for dollar the money that the Smith Family has raised to be directed not at its other programs but for drought relief. I received a letter before I came down to Canberra for this week's sitting from Mrs Margaret Pollard, who is manager of the Smith Family office in Taree. The letter reads: Re our conversation mid week. I would like to advise I received $7,500-00 from the Wingham Auction. Due to the above response, where the group raised $27,500-00, I would appreciate if you could lobby on behalf of myself, my branch and The Smith Family as a whole for Government assistance on a dollar for dollar basis for our 'Drought Fundraising' . This charity is out there supporting hundreds of families with crisis cash and other assistance given IMMEDIATELY. These families can't wait for assessment or for this organisation to raise the necessary funding. Therefore it is very important to receive as much assistance as possible and we really do need this boost. Application has been made through our head office channels, but to date we have had no response. This is a personal approach by me, to see what you might be able to achieve for my branch and the organisation for which I work. That is an organisation that is providing immediate cash relief for families in crisis. There are lots of families in crisis that do not fall within the criteria for drought relief set out in the bill. I will write to the minister and include a copy of that letter. I urge the government to seriously consider that matter. I tum now to a letter that I received from the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association, which asks for support for rural small businesses. That organisation highlights a few points: No one else was prepared to help the farming community, certainly not many of the banks, but small business did. Now, because the drought has lasted longer than anyone anticipated, many of these small businesses are in danger of total collapse themselves. The recent initiative by the Federal Government to assist farmers is certainly very welcome but there is nothing of significance that will allow farmers to pay off much of this debt. That is the debt that they have to small businesses in those rural communities. The association raises one very salient point about government assistance-it relates also to the letter from the Smith Family-and that is: If we as a nation can provide (and we should) assistance by way of finance to South Africa, Ireland and aid to Papua New Guinea and Rwanda etc, then surely we have a moral obligation to also do something constructive for our own rural business. That is a very important point, a salient point, for this government to consider in future deliberations. I bring to the attention of the parliament and the minister some of the severe circumstances that exist on the coast of New South Wales as a result of this drought. I will read some statistics from the Gloucester Rural Lands Protection Board, which covers part of my electorate. As of today-I received these statistics today-the percentage of farms where on-farm slaughter may be needed is five per cent. In three months time, it will be 40 per cent, and in six months time it will be 55 per cent. In relation to major district drought related problems, the board states: Now, water supply a major problem with many creeks dry and main river dropping alarmingly. No 'on-farm' hay-Victorian supplies mainly poor quality and becoming too expensive for drought feeding. Cost of grain up 50% in last six months. Farmers (particularly dairy) operating at major deficit per week hoping for improvement. In 3 months, 'crunch' time for major management decisions. 70% of district will be out of stock water and probably one-third of stock will have to be put down (too weak to transport for sale). Grain will be un affordable and hay supply almost non-existent. General notes: Coastal area goes in and out much more quickly than inland areas. Wingham rainfall this year-8 inches less than 1905 dryest record year and Taree rainfall this year-13 inches less than 1980 dryest record year. From the Kempsey Rural Lands Protection Board, the percentage of farms where on-farm slaughter may be needed is presently two per cent. In three months time, it will be 25 per cent, and in six months time it will be 80 per cent. In relation to the major district drought related problems, the board states: 1. Lack of water on farm. 2. Lack of nutritious fodder. 3. Decreased availability and cost of purchased fodder. 4. Low saleyard process even for fat or feedlot cattle. 5. No demand for store cattle. 6. No agistment available. 7. Restrictions on town water supplies for stock. 8. Two dairies closed due to lack of feed and/or water. 9. Increasing bushfire risks. In 3 months time, 80% of farms without adequate stock water. 2. Almost complete lack of stock feed. 3. Total ban on irrigation. 4. 20% of dairy farms will cease production-80% reduced production. Those pointers will have a devastating impact. Honourable members have heard what will happen in three months time. In relation to the weather outlook, the National Farmers Federation states: The Bureau of Meteorology has indicated that over the next three months there is a significant chance of drier than average conditions across virtually all of the agricultural and pastoral regions of Australia. The strong EI Nino weather pattern suggests that drought-breaking rains may not occur in northern Australia before autumn 1995. At the beginning of the new year, a lot of my electorate on the mid-north coast of New South Wales will be absolutely devastated because of the lack of water. I return to the point that started my contribution to the debate: to date, with the drought relief policy that the government will implement with this legislation, it will not at this stage assist any of the people in crisis in my electorate. The people that are in stressful situations now are being helped by organisations like the Smith Family. The challenge now is before the government. The Smith Family has been in contact with the government to match dollar for dollar the money that it is raising, which is providing immediate assistance to a lot of families in crisis-the same way that the Prime Minister has promised to match dollar for dollar the money raised through the farm aid appeal, which is being distributed through the Farmhand network of the NFF. I urge the government to look at those areas and also to bear in mind the exceptional circumstances being experienced in electorates such as mine that do not fall into those exceptional circumstances categories established to date by the government.",47
22,Mr BEDDALL,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"In closing the debate, I welcome the support of the opposition in facilitating the early introduction of the Drought Relief Payment Bill and its support for the passage of the bill. The severity of the drought and the human and social consequences which have resulted have been well documented during this debate, and I will not repeat them all now. Suffice it to say, urgent action is required to assist worse affected farm families. The government's drought package is a good one by any measure, and has been acknowledged as such by the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia and the wider Australian community. The package provides for a systematic and eastern comprehensive approach covering farm welfare, assistance for farm businesses and protection of the land resource base. The government has indicated that it will be considering further action to assist in easing the burden of the current drought and in preparing for future droughts. Initiatives are being considered in the areas of taxation, income equalisation deposits, structural adjustment, land care and climate research. The drought relief payment before the House represents only one aspect of the wider package. The package deals effectively with the three Rs mentioned by the oppositionrelief, retention and recovery. Importantly, the package provides for well-targeted assistance, not the sort of untargeted scheme mentioned by some members of the opposition which is open to abuse. Fodder subsidies have already been proven to be ineffective and do not have the support of many farm organisations. I acknowledge that the eligibility criteria for the drought relief payment will mean that some farmers will not qualify. The package targets assistance to worse affected farm families in exceptional circumstance areas. The government has made it clear that assistance will be demand driven and that all farmers who qualify for the drought relief payment will receive assistance. The bill provides that funding for the drought relief payment will be by way of standing appropriations so that the funds will not be limited. The government acknowledges that the effects of the drought are not simply confined to farmers and their families. This government package supports the base on which rural Australia rests-namely, the farmers. The nature of the support is to be provided through the drought relief payment such that money will flow through families directly into rural towns. Direct income to meet day-today living expenses has a multiplier effect of around 1.5, meaning that every dollar spent generates around $1.50 in the broader economy, much of which will be retained in country towns. The drought relief payment recognises the special circumstances which have excluded farmers and their families from government assistance to date. In short, the government es not support the opposition amendment, t we do welcome its support for the early ssage of the Drought Relief Payment Bill drafted. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmae. Bill read a second time. Message from the Administrator recomending appropriation announced.

Second Reading",50
23,Mr LAVARCH,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In 1948, in response to the destruction and brutality of two world wars, the international community drew up a statement of principle on the protection of fundamental human rights. It was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles stated in the declaration were set down in response to a period of intense global conflict-as the declaration itself states, in response to the disregard and contempt for human rights which resulted in acts so barbarous they outraged the conscience of the world. The declaration makes clear that: recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. Australia played an important role in the postwar international diplomacy which led to the creation of the United Nations and the ing of the declaration. We have remained committed to those fundamental principles. These principles are as central now to our national identity and international reputation as they were when we were able to contribute to their development almost half a century ago. These basic rights are universal and cannot be limited by national or state boundaries. They are the birth right of every human being and of all Australians. Every level of government in Australia is responsible for ensuring that these rights are protected and promoted. Indeed, there is no more fundamental reason for the existence of governments but to respect and enhance the rights of citizens. Australia can feel proud of its record on human rights. However, we must also recognise that not all Australians have always enjoyed, or today enjoy, a full range of rights. We know that for many generations the nation's treatment of its indigenous population was less than praiseworthy, that Australian women faced very direct forms of discrimination, that those with a disability were judged not on what they could do but rather on a stereotype of what was perceived they could not do. Few would deny that many Australians still do not enjoy full equality of opportunity, free to live and advance their lives according to their abilities and judged only on merit. While we have much to be proud of, not everyone is treated with respect and fairness. This bill is about basic freedoms-the right of adult Australians to make their own choices about sexual practices within the privacy of their own homes. This has been a controversial subject matter. In the public debate which has preceded the parliament's consideration of this bill a variety of arguments have been advanced. It has been claimed that Australia is being dictated to by foreign lawmaking bodies and that our national sovereignty has been diminished. Others assert that the real issue is the rights of state governments and that the Commonwealth should not contemplate such a law. Some allege the law will render inoperative laws dealing with incest or the regulation of the sex industry. I draft- will address each of these issues. First of all, the bill does not represent the outcome of some process of abdication of national sovereignty. On the contrary, the fact that our national parliament is now debating this bill itself puts lie to that claim. One of the basic decisions made at Federation, indeed a reason for federation, was that the Australian people should speak with one voice internationally. That is why this parliament was given the power to act in relation to external affairs and why the pursuit of Australia's international interests is an executive function of the national government. Participation by Australia in bilateral and multilateral agreements is a free sovereign choice by this nation. It is a long process, which involves consultation within Australia and generally prolonged negotiation at the international level. The consultation process takes place in accordance with principles agreed between the Commonwealth and the states. It involves consultation at all levels including heads of government, the Standing Committee on Treaties comprising senior Commonwealth and state officials, and directly through relevant functional areas. For human rights, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General plays a consultative role. It was the Liberal-National government of Malcolm Fraser which accepted the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980. It did so after a long period of discussion with the Australian states. It is article 17 of that covenant on which this bill is founded. Australia acceded to the optional protocol to the covenant in 1991. This followed a decade of consultation with the states and territories, including discussions by ministers on human rights and later by attorneysgeneral. The majority of jurisdictions, including Tasmania, did not object to Australia's becoming a party to the optional protocol. It was this optional protocol process which highlighted the inconsistency of particular sections of the criminal code of Tasmania with the protection from arbitrary interference with privacy detailed in article 17 of the international covenant. The government fully recognises the importance of such consultations, particularly in areas of shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states and territories such as human rights. But a right to consultation does not mean a right of veto, nor does it mean that the national parliament and national government can walk away from the fact that internationally it is these institutions that represent Australia. There has also been misrepresentation of the impact the ratification of a treaty has on domestic law. The fact is that treaties are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. They cannot alone impose obligations on individuals or create rights in domestic law. This means that the rights prescribed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights only become part of Australian law through the passage of legislation by an Australian parliament and through the decisions of Australian courts. Obviously this bill and this debate are evidence of that very point. Before joining a treaty, consideration is given to whether legislation is necessary; if so, whether existing federal or state legislation is adequate and, if not, whether the treaty should be implemented by legislation at Commonwealth or state/ territory level. Often no change of law is called for, or the Commonwealth relies on state and territory laws to carry out the provisions of treaties. The essential point is that Australian law is made by Australian parliaments and Australian courts, not by the action of entering into a treaty. This same fundamental point is true of the views of the United Nations Human Rights Committee. It has been argued that the ability of Australian citizens to take a complaint to the Human Rights Committee is a transfer of judicial power to a foreign body similar to when there were appeals to the Privy Council and Australian law was being determined outside this country. Such an argument is totally flawed. It is, of course, the case that up to 1986, when some appeals from the Australian superior courts were permitted to the Privy Council, the law of this country was directly affected by such decisions. The recourse to the Human Rights Committee permitted under the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights bears no resemblance to Privy Council appeals. The Human Rights Committee is not a court. It does not make binding decisions. It has no power of enforcement. Its decisions do not oblige any action from Australia to change our laws or alter our practices. While the government does believe that the views expressed by the committee have weight and should be regarded seriously, this committee cannot alter Australian law. By allowing complaints to the Human Rights Committee, Australia affords its citizens an avenue to explore whether our good record on human rights is being maintained. It displays our confidence in our capacity to meet the same standards which Australia contends internationally should be met by all nations. Human rights in Australia is a shared responsibility of all governments and of each of the parliaments of the Commonwealth, states and territories. The Commonwealth parliament has enacted legislation to provide civil remedies to those Australians who may experience discrimination on the grounds of sex, race and disability. All of this legislation, together with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, is based on international treaties to which Australia is a party, that is, the Commonwealth parliament relying on the external affairs power in the constitution. same power is the basis for this bill. This bill is an extension of the Commonwealth's human rights regime, and yet it appears that the use of the external affairs power is, to those opposite, the vehicle for the clash of two so-called principles-respect for human rights and support for states rights. The government believes that there can be no such clash, as only individuals and not governments enjoy rights. Governments exist to protect rights, not to enjoy them at the pense of the individual. The power to legislate for external affairs was granted to the Commonwealth parliament by the Australian constitution at Federation. The constitution also provides that if a Commonwealth and state law are inconsistent then the state law is inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency. The High Court was created and empowered by the constitution to determine such questions. These basic provisions have all been part of the workings of the Australian federation since its creation. The High Court long ago recognised the power of the Commonwealth to make laws to give effect to Australia's international obligations. As long ago as 1936, in the decision of King and Burgess, ex parte Henry, Chief Justice Latham said: The Commonwealth Parliament has been given power to legislate to give effect to international obligations binding the Commonwealth or to protect national rights internationally obtained by the Commonwealth whenever legislation was necessary or deemed to be desirable for this purpose. He also said: [The] possible subjects of international agreement are infinitely various. It is, in my opinion, impossible to say a priori that any subject is necessarily such that it could never properly be dealt with by an international agreement. These principles have been further developed by the High Court. This is not something new or extraordinary that has been invented by the court in recent times. The Commonwealth has used the external affairs power to reinforce Australian sovereignty. Some examples are the maritime boundary agreements with France, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and IndoThis nesia. Most recently we have taken steps to ensure that Australia benefits from the right to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone recognised in the United Nations Convention on the Law of The Sea. There were no complaints about treaties eroding our sovereignty or overriding the states in these cases. The human rights legislation I referred to earlier, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discriex- mination Act, all have the same potential impact on state laws as this bill. A state criminal law which is inconsistent with any of this legislation will, by operation of section 109 of the constitution, be rendered ineffective to the extent of the inconsistency. The implication of the views now expressed by many in the opposition is that Commonwealth laws should be read down so that state laws are not affected. This is to return to the notion rejected by the High Court in the landmark Amalgamated Society of Engineers v. Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd case of 1920. In the state of Tasmania sections 122 (a) and (c) of the criminal code mean that the private sexual activity of consenting adults, whether heterosexual or homosexual, can be a criminal offence. Section 123 of the code goes on to make all other 'indecent practices' between men a criminal offence. The effect of these two sections together is that adult homosexual men in Tasmania are committing an offence if they participate in virtually any sort of sexual conduct together in the privacy of their own homes. These Tasmanian laws apply to acts in private as well as in public. They draw no distinction between conduct involving children and conduct involving only adults. Consent of the parties is irrelevant. In December 1991 the United Nations Human Rights Committee was asked by an individual Tasmanian citizen to examine these provisions and to provide a view on whether they were consistent with article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The committee is the body established under the covenant to administer the covenant and to monitor compliance with its provisions. The committee formed the view that sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code are an arbitrary interference with privacy and placed Australia in breach of article 17 of the covenant. The Australian Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, in his report on the Tasmanian provisions, also found that they placed Australia in breach of its international obligations. Mr Burdekin rejected the Tasmanian government's arguments that the laws were a reasonable and proportionate response to a perceived threat to moral standards. He said that the fact the laws are not enforced clearly suggests they are not necessary for the protection of moral standards. He noted that no other jurisdiction has comparable laws and that discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality is unlawful in three out of the six states as well as both territories. He also found they were not a reasonable or proportionate response to HIVAIDS, particularly when the Tasmanian government itself had endorsed the national HIV-AIDS strategy which calls for such laws to be repealed because they deter people from seeking medical advice and assistance. As the Human Rights Commissioner put it: The moral fabric of Tasmania is not more fragile than in other parts of Australia, nor does it require greater levels of protection. Laws such as these Tasmanian provisions are simply no longer acceptable to modern Australian society. Similar provisions have been repealed in all other Australian jurisdictions. Such laws are oppressive. They are unjust. They do not meet the standards accepted by most Australians. In the face of such a clearcut case, the present Tasmanian government has refused to reconsider these provisions. It has, therefore, become necessary for the Commonwealth to act. The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill translates one important element of our obligations under an international agreement into binding domestic Australian law. Paragraph 1 of article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Most Australians probably take it for granted that they live in a society in which they are free to pursue their private lives and, in particular, their private sexual lives free of unjustified government intrusion. That is the right enshrined in article 17-the right to be free from unjustified and unnecessary government interference in your everyday private life. The bill provides that sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy. This guarantee is to operate throughout Australia, including in the external territories. The bill offers protection to all Australians. Article 17 of the international covenant does not provide that the right to be free from interference with privacy is absolute or unlimited. The article explicitly recognises that in some circumstances it is legitimate to intrude into the privacy of individuals. The article provides that no-one will be subjected to 'arbitrary interference' with privacy. The key word in this test is 'arbitrary'. term 'arbitrary' guarantees that where laws intrude on people's privacy the laws must justified, necessary and reasonable in circumstances. In order to meet this test, law must have a legitimate purpose and be proportional means to achieve that purpose. All such laws must pay due regard to the rights and dignity of the individual. The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill recogship nises and incorporates these limits. The deals only with sexual conduct in private between consenting adults. It is appropriate and fully justifiable to laws which regulate sexual conduct in public, sexual conduct involving children and conduct to which a person does not consent. Expressly, the bill does not affect these laws. Such laws exist throughout Australia and are acceptable because they rest on an appropriate balance between the right to privacy in one's sexual conduct and the interests of the comvariety munity at large. Indeed, such laws exist Tasmania quite apart from sections 122 and 123 of the criminal code and deal in a much more balanced and appropriate way with sexual conduct which impacts unacceptably on the community. The age of consent for sexual activity varies across the states and territories and also varies depending on whether heterosexual or male homosexual activity is involved. The governinternational ment recognises that there is not a consensus across Australia on the question of an appropriate age of consent. The bill does not prevent states and territories from setting age of consent below 18 years of age. The bill deals with sexual conduct involving those of or above the age of 18. It is generally recognised across Australia that by the age 18 people are expected to be mature enough to make a range of decisions for themselves and to take responsibility for themselves their actions. Laws which seek to regulate the private consensual conduct of those over 18 will not tion be affected unless they are an arbitrary intersignificant ference with privacy within the meaning of article 17. There are a broad range of laws any across Australia which deal with private sexual conduct of adults. All jurisdictions, for The example, make incest a criminal offence. do There is clearly a consensus throughout be Australia that such laws are justified on the medical and other grounds even when they a cover conduct between consenting adults. a Such laws seek to prevent children being conceived by parents whose genetic make-up is harmfully close. The laws also recognise and protect the special nature of the relationbetween grandparents, parents, children bill and siblings, for example. The laws are limited in their scope, relating only to very close relationships. They are reasonable and proportional. They draw an appropriate have balance between the needs of the community and the rights of the individual. Such laws sexual will not be affected by this bill. The sex industry in Australia is also regulated. States and territories have sought to deal with the commercial, community and health issues involved with the industry in a of ways. Appropriate regulation of the in sex industry is not, however, an arbitrary interference with privacy. It is a necessary, justified and reasonable regulation of the industry. Some laws, however, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as justified, reasonable and proportionate. Sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code fall into this category and in doing so have placed us in breach of our obligations and jeopardised our high standing in matters of human rights. This bill is not a servile capitulation to the views of some international body. It is a the statement of this government's belief in and support for the standards enshrined in the international covenant. The bill is not an invasion of the sovereign rights of state of governments. State governments, like governments everywhere, have a duty to protect the rights of the individuals within their jurisdicand tion in conformity with recognised international standards. Where a state government fails in this duty, the Commonwealth obligato act is clear. I believe that this bill is a step in guaranteeing the protection of the freedom from intrusion by government in the most intimate details of one's personal private life. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",51
24,Mr RUDDOCK,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Berowra) (1.15 p.m.)The House today is debating the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994. It is a bill which addresses a number of issues but does contain within it arguments about two issues of principle on which coalition members have strong views: the right to privacy and the right to the proper sharing of powers between the Commonwealth and the states. In relation to these two matters, and in this specific context, we find that the issues are joined, and that means that people have to determine which one should be given greater weight. This bill will guarantee a right to privacy for consenting sexual activity between adults in private. The coalition has a long standing and strong commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals. At the last election we stated in our law and justice policy: The coalition puts a high priority on the right privacy, especially the right to privacy against government. However, when considering this bill the coalition has had to balance our commitment to privacy against our commitment to the proper sharing of Commonwealth and state powers and in particular our extreme reluctance to support the use of the Commonwealth's external affairs power to encroach on areas that are otherwise the responsibility of states. After careful consideration of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, the coalition has decided that the balance must come down on the side of protection of individual privacy in this instance. Therefore, we will not be opposing this bill. I give notice, however, that at the end of my comments today I will be moving a second reading amendment on behalf of the coalition which will add to this bill when it is read: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Federal Government to reform the treaty making process so that the Commonwealth Parliament, the State and Territory governments, and the community are properly consulted on the content and implications of treaties. I notice that today, in his very comprehensive address, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has addressed some of these matters, as he did on a radio program which I heard this morning. I am one who takes an interest in matters relating to human rights. I note the Attorney-General's comments that Australia can feel proud of its record on human rights. He then goes on to point out a number of areas in which Australia may not necessarily have addressed those matters fully. Last night in this parliamentary building there was an address by the Secretary-General  which he made comments on us all. It is particularly interesting to me as one who recently attended, as did some of the Attorney-General's advisers, the international conference on human rights. In an international context, for what I believe are essentially fairly base political motives of the government about human to rights issues, Australia now sees its advocacy of some of these matters to be in conflict with its ability to enter into dialogue with other countries and other parties interested in human rights issues. The consequence of that, of course, has been that we have seen some very interesting modifications of Australia's public position on a number of international human rights matters. I note particularly the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Seattle. He suggested that President Clinton ought to be modifying the view of the United States on human rights stands, particularly in relation to Indonesia. At the world conference on human rights it was very obvious that the Attorney General was also reading down Australia's long-term commitments, I suspect because some members of the government believe that we are now finding it more difficult to get elected to particular international bodies. One of the international bodies that the government might have in mind for the future, and where our human rights advocacy might jeopardise a seat, is the United Nations Security Council. I always find it interesting when people argue about Australia's record on human rights as if it had an element of greater virtue than that of others. That prompts me to comment on the discussions about the way in which treaties are entered into. I do not disagree with the basic analysis that the Attorney-General has outlined, except to say that in all of these matters it is necessary to look at the way in which processes that have been in place over a long period of time have been undertaken. It was interesting that in relation to some of the basic human rights documents, of course, there were very lengthy consultations. The Attorney-General referred to the Liberal-National government of Malcolm Fraser which accepted the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980. It did so after a long period of discussion with the states. I know that the Fraser government put great store by those consultations and entered reservations quite frequently because of the nature of those consultations. Reference was made here to Australia acceding to the optional protocol following a decade of consultation. I suspect that that reference was put into indicate that the government was applying the same standard. But I think it comes out very clearly in the Attorney-General's speech that the government sees these things in a different way from the coalition when the Attorney-General makes the point that a right to consultation does not mean a right to veto. I am not suggesting that it should mean a right to veto, but it comes down to a question of where the balance lies when consultation is undertaken and whether those discussions are entered into seriously with a view to recognising the particular concerns that exist, not only with state governments but with many other organisations that ought to be consulted. A number of organisations in the business community and so on have been making it clear to the government that they believe that consultation these days is very much a matter of form rather than a genuine desire to bring people on board to reach a reasonable consensus. So this question of where the balance lies is a very important one. While I am not bringing into doubt the commitments that ought to be accorded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in the context of some of the other treaties that are accorded recognition these days there is a proper view that ought to be acknowledged that greater consultation would give greater credibility to the treaty making process and to the treaties themselves, would bring more people on board and would lead to more ready acceptance of the outcome. It is in that context that people are suggesting that the parliament-notwithstanding the fact that it is at the moment the executive that has the power to conclude treaties-have a role at an earlier stage. That has taken me a little from the essence of this bill, which is contained in clause 4 and states: (1) Sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. (2) For the purposes of this section, an adult is a person who is 18 years old or more. The essence of this bill provides a basic human right to Australians: the right to individual privacy. There are, however, limitations to clause 4. It states that it relates only to sexual conduct, not to a wider right of privacy that exists under article 17. The reference to 'consent' means that the clause does not relate to any non-consensual activities such as rape or where a person is incapable of consenting-for example, a mentally disabled person. The clause does not apply to sexual conduct between an adult and a person under the age of 18, or two or more people under the age of 18. The reference to 'acting in private' means that the clause does not affect laws concerning gross indecency in a public place-laws that exist in virtually all jurisdictions. The long title of this bill states that its purpose is 'to implement Australia's international obligations under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights' . However, the purpose of the bill is to implement only a limited category of Australia's obligations under article 17, being those that relate to sexual conduct involving consenting adults acting in private. The background to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is that Australia ratified the covenant in 1980. The covenant contains many basic human rights such as the right to life, liberty, freedom from torture, freedom of expression, thought and conscience, and the right to privacy and equality before the law. Article 2 provides that parties to the international covenant undertake to respect and ensure to all individuals within their territories the rights recognised by the covenant, without distinction of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Article 2 also obliges the parties to legislate or take other necessary measures to give effect to the rights in the international covenant where they are not already provided for by existing legislative or other measures. Finally, it obliges parties to provide to any person whose rights under the international covenant have been violated an effective remedy. The terms of the international covenant were not enshrined in legislation when ratified first by Australia in 1980. This was on the basis that existing Australian law provides sufficient protection for individuals. However, there is no express legislative right to freedom of speech, privacy, equality before the law or many of the other rights recognised in the international covenant. Accordingly, there is often no effective domestic remedy for Australians when rights under the international covenant are breached, contrary to the requirements of article 2. Australia acceded to the first optional protocol of the international covenant in 1991. This gave Australians the ability to complain directly to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva if they considered their rights under the international covenant had been breached. However, a complaint can be made only once an individual has exhausted all domestic remedies. The constitutional position, as we understand it, is that currently the Commonwealth parliament has no direct power to legislate in relation to privacy. That is why the government is relying upon its external affairs power under section 51 (xxix) of the constitution to give support to the legislation. It is understood that a law which implements the international treaty, to which Australia is a signatory, is a law in relation to external affairs. However, this bill does not fully implement the whole of the international covenant, or even the whole of article 17. Doubts have also been raised about whether partial implementation of article 17 is sufficient to enable use of the external affairs power. This situation is not dissimilar to the Franklin dam case, in which a number of judges found that legislation implementing a treaty under the external affairs power need not implement the whole treaty provided that legislation were reasonably considered to be appropriate or conducive to the performance of the object of the treaty. Given this, the coalition believes that, although clause 4 is much narrower than article 17 of the international covenant, it does not detract from the obligations under the article or the overall convention and that therefore it would be most unlikely that any challenge to its constitutional validity would be successful. We sought an opinion on this matter from Mr David Barnett QC, and he backs that assessment. He says two things. Firstly, he says: It is clear that the bill would give rise to a valid act. Secondly, he says: . . . the bill would not affect the regulation of sexual conduct provided that such regulation is not an arbitrary interference with privacy. It follows that the bill would have no effect upon laws dealing with such matters as regulation of the sex industry, sexual conduct amounting to professional misconduct by a doctor, child pornography or sexual conduct in public. These matters would continue to be regulated by state law. So we come to the question of why we have this legislation. The origins of this legislation can be traced back to the first optional protocol and when Mr Nick Toonen, from Hobart, sent a complaint to the UN Human Rights Committee. Mr Toonen's complaint was that sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code breached his right to privacy under article 17 of the international covenant and his right to equality before the law under article 26. Section 122 of the Tasmanian criminal code, to which Mr Toonen's complaint related says: Any person who-(a) has sexual intercourse with any other person against the order of nature; or . . . (c) consents to a male person having sexual intercourse with him or her against the order of nature; is guilty of a crime. Section 123 says: Any male person who, whether in public or private commits any indecent assault or any other act of gross indecency with another male person or procures another male person to commit any act of gross indecency with himself or any other male person is guilty of a crime. Mr Toonen was able to send his complaint directly to the UN Human Rights Committee without referring it first to an Australian court, because there was no Australian law implementing his right to privacy under the international covenant and hence there was no domestic legal remedy that he could take. The Human Rights Committee of the United Nations upheld Mr Toonen's complaint that Australia is in breach of its obligation under article 17. The committee's findings of 8 April 1994 were that Mr Toonen was entitled to an effective remedy according to article 2, and an effective remedy would be the repeal of sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. As the Tasmanian government has decided against repealing these sections of the Tasmanian criminal code, this legislation now before the House will effectively give Mr Toonen the remedy requested by the UN Human Rights Committee, which I might say brings me to the point made by the Attorney in relation to these matters. He commented on section 109 of the constitution, which renders ineffective any state law to the extent that there may be inconsistency with a Commonwealth enactment. He went on to say: The implication of the views now expressed by manyand I underline that word 'many'in the opposition is that Commonwealth laws should be read down so that state laws are not affected. I might say that I think it would be more appropriate to say 'some'. I do not know that that view is appropriately ascribed to many. I understand the operation of section 109 and the way in which this legislation would ensure that the Tasmanian law would be struck down only to the extent of any inconsistency with the Commonwealth's position. The coalition's position on this matter is that we have had a long and proud record in relation to human rights and guarding the privacy of individuals, particularly against intervention by governments. The coalition has always taken stands against invasion of privacy by governments. It might be timely to remind people of some instances. We took a stand against the Hawke government's attempt to introduce an identity card, and I think we effectively foiled that measure. The coalition has been forthright in its criticism of the government's data matching programs in particular and has ensured the maintenance of some sunset clauses to bring data matching to an end if the process cannot be shown to be efficacious. I have to say that, even with reports tabled yesterday by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), one doubts whether the financial efficacy that is argued by the government as being present has been clearly substantiated at this time. The coalition has always argued that individuals should have the right to join or not to join unions, whereas the government denies freedom of association with its duplicitous backing of forced union membership. I want to move on to other matters about which I think it is appropriate to draw some inferences. It was in 1973 in this parliament that a motion was moved by a former Liberal Prime Minister, Sir John Gorton, rejecting criminal sanctions for homosexual activity and seeking intervention here in the Australian Capital Territory, where the Commonwealth had legislative competence. John Gorton's motion was supported by a number of people who still sit in this House, two of them being the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), members of the National Party. I supported that motion myself by my own vote on that matter. But what was particularly interesting to me and a number of my colleagues was that it was the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, amongst those who presently sit in this House, was recorded as voting against it. It was in 1976, 18 years ago, that Bob Ellicott, the then Attorney-General, effectively decriminalised homosexual activity in the Australian Capital Territory by saying: I think it is time we acknowledged that this ought not to be the subject of the criminal law. If the coalition's human rights record is compared with that of the government, it will be found that the government's approach on these matters has been nothing but inconsistent and hypocritical. The Hawke government's attempt to introduce the Australia card showed double standards in relation to individual privacy. Only yesterday the coalition opposed a migration bill which sought to retrospectively validate what was an unlawful detention. The bill is an assault on the principle of the operation of the rule of law to protect civil liberties and it violates individual rights. It is a matter about which the government is almost salivating at the prospect of having a double dissolution issue, as it seeks to retrospectively validate unlawful detention, a very significant example of double standards on the government's part. Furthermore, in acting to prevent states from allowing voluntary student unionism, the government is in our view acting in breach of the freedom of association provisions of the international covenant. So the government ought not to be crowing, as it appears to be, about these matters, because its record on a number of them evidences an inconsistent and hypocritical approach. The coalition, as I mentioned earlier, was faced with a difficult decision between two fundamental principles: privacy and the proper division of federal powers under the constitution. It needs to be clearly understood that the opposition believes that Australia has a proud and active record of involvement and leadership in promoting cooperation between members of the international community. We are absolutely committed to that objective. Our record in government was testimony to that commitment. That was amply demonstrated by the Attorney-General's comments today about the Fraser government's involvement in the international covenant. However, under this Labor government, international treaties are being used as a constitutional battering ram to change the balance of power in the federation. The process of proper consultation with this conduct parliament, with the states and with the broader community has broken down and ought to be restored to the genuine consultation that took place under the Fraser government. We will be working to restore such an approach. We want it to be understood-and make no mistake about this-that this issue of the role of international treaties in changing the nature of the federal division of powers is a significant one. There is a great deal of concern mounting in the community about it, and on this side of the House we will continue to pursue the issue actively and vigorously. It is only in the context of this particular issue, where there are two principles at stake which are basically in conflict, that on balance we have decided that our commitment to privacy of the individual must be paramount. Therefore, we will not be opposing this bill. I move the following amendment that has been circulated in my name: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Federal Government to reform the treaty making process so that the Commonwealth Parliament, the State and Territory governments, and the community are properly consulted on the content and implications of treaties"".",56
25,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Bass) (1.45 p.m.)I rise today to speak on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill because this bill and the matters which surround it have caused not only widespread debate but open and outright hostility. I am pleased to say that, while a few people in my electorate of Bass have been parties to this hostility, their numbers have remained very small. There has, however, been a very nasty, bigoted, misinformed and vitriolic selective letterboxing campaign conducted in my electorate. Some deranged comments have been made on handwritten, photocopied slips of paper which have found their way into the letterboxes of some of my constituents, and I apologise to them for that. Let me quote to the parliament what was said in those little notes: Voters of Bass-we pay Silvia Smith to represent our views in Canberra. But she wants to impose foreign laws onto us. If we lose our anti-sodomy laws in Tasmania then Silvia Smith should lose her seat in Bass and many politicians must be tried treason. We do not want an alien dictatorship. This provides an example of the misinformed and reactionary nature of this debate. Let me make it very clear to the parliament, and especiaIly to the people of Tasmania, exactly what it is that this bill will do. This bill means that sexual conduct in private and between consenting adults will not be the subject of interference with privacy by the law of the Commonwealth, the states or the territories. It does nothing more and nothing less. The problem with this debate has been the scaremongering and the misinformation which have been propagated. The first element of this has been the idiotic perception that the age of consent will be lowered to 14 years or even less. There is no pro-homosexual conspiracy aimed at luring young people into such a lifestyle. Such a suggestion is bigoted and ludicrous. The current age of consent for sexual activity differs from state to state. It also differs depending on whether heterosexual or male homosexual activity is involved. This bill does not impact upon the ability of the states to set their own age of consent for sexual activity. AIl this bill deals with is the sexual conduct of those over the age of 18 years. It is certainly generaIly accepted that by the age of 18 people are mature enough to make a range of life decisions and are responsible for their actions. People must accept and realise that this bill does not, is not intended to, and will not impinge upon the age of consent for sexual activity. Unfortunately, this argument has been used as an emotive deception by antihomosexual groups such as Tasalert, and it is an insidious attempt to enlist the support of moderate-thinking people to their bigoted cause. A further argument of the detractors of this bill is that it will open the floodgates for all sorts of currently unlawful sexual offences to be conducted in private. Absolutely 100 per cent no way! Australian laws which regulate the consenting private sexual acts of Australian adults will be impinged upon only if they for interfere with privacy within the meaning of article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There are many just and necessary laws throughout Australia which deal with private sexual acts between adults. We have heard some of those mentioned here today. The laws dealing with incest are a very good example. AIl Australian jurisdictions make incest a criminal offence, and rightly so. Everyone recognises the need to seek to prevent children being conceived by parents of a close genetic nature. The argument has been used by the detractors of this bill that it will enable this sort of activity. The bigots fail on this count as weIl. None of these necessary regulatory laws will be impacted upon. The justified medical and other grounds upon which they are based will stand firm. The floodgates will not be opened for the type of sexual behaviour which is controIled by these very necessary laws. It has also been stated that this bill represents the beginning of the end of regulation of the sex industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. Regulation of the sex industry is, again, highly appropriate and is not an arbitrary interference with privacy. This regulation is necessary and justified and will not be impinged upon one iota by this bill. One of the major arguments in this debate is the contention that this bill will aIlowand, indeed, promote-acts of public indecency. To hear some of the more rabid opponents of law reform in this area, one might think this bill will aIlow homosexual acts to be committed at every street comer, park and bus stop in the land. It is certainly unfortunate that these people have been taken seriously and their arguments listened to. I suppose that I have to refute even this ludicrous contention, just for the record. Public acts of sexuality will still be dealt with by the law, just as public heterosexual acts will be dealt with. Any public sexual act is an act of indecency and should be dealt with as such. In Tasmania currently, as we have heard, sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code mean that it is a criminal offence for two consenting adults, whether homosexual or heterosexual, to have anal sex in private. These provisions go on to make all other 'indecent practices' between men a criminal offence. When it all comes down to it, this means that adult homosexual men in Tasmania are breaking the law if they engage in virtually any type of sexual contact together in the privacy of their own homes. These laws draw no distinction between acts in private and acts in public. There is no differentiation between conduct involving children and that involving adults. Consent is not taken into account. Let me state clearly for the record that not only is it justified but it is also necessary desirable to have laws dealing with any sexual conduct in public, with sexual conduct involving children and with sexual conduct with those who do not consent. Such laws exist throughout Australia. They maintain the balance between the right to privacy for sexual conduct and the interests, health and well-being of the general community. Let there be no mistake: weB-balanced laws governing this type of conduct exist in Tasmania, totally independent of sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. In fact, Tasmanian laws which deal with sexual conduct which impacts unacceptably on the community are excellent, and they will not be affected by this bill. I repeat: they will not be affected by bill. Tasmania's criminal code act was enacted in 1924. Sections 122 and 123 are anachronistic and are regarded as such by most Tasmanians. The Tasmanian state government has been asked to remove these sections of the act. This would be a far more desirable way to effect the outcome we will gain by passing the legislation which is before us today. Only a few years ago, the former Tasmanian state Labor government passed a homo- bill through the lower house which had the intention of repealing the offending provisions. Unfortunately, the legislation was not passed by the upper house of the Tasmanian parliament. There has been much talk throughout this entire debate on whether it is desirable for Australia to be party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I myself have received letters which state that Australia should not be party to this treaty and that complying with its measures impinges upon the rights of the states to make their own laws. Unfortunately, the states rights argument has been used again in this debate in an endeavour to gain the support of fair minded and moderate people who happen to love their own state and thus to involve them in the lowest form of politics: the politics of bigotry and hatred. Let us examine exactly what article 17 of the international covenant does bind us to and think about whether it is desirable or not. This and covenant protects the following: the right to life; the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy; the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to freedom of movement; the right to equality before the law; the right to a fair trial; and the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. I ask members of the House to consider today whether any fair-minded Australian would not want to be associated with, and indeed bound by, principles such as those I have just mentioned. When some considerations are made in certain quarters on the this opposite side of the House about what they intend to do with this bill when this bill comes to a vote, they would be wise to consider the principles that I have just listed. Otherwise, they would be voting down some of the philosophies that got many of them into this place. Let me make something clear. These international obligations have not been imposed upon Australia. They are obligations which were freely accepted in 1980 by the Fraser government, as stated earlier here by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in his opening lines. This was not something done in a back room as part of a dark and secret deal; it was done with full consultation with the states and the territories. It took 10 years before Australia became a signatory to the optional protocol. No-one can level the allegation that the signing of this international treaty was done in a closed way in order to dupe the public. Australia's obligations under this treaty raise no question of undermining Australian sovereignty, contrary to what has been stated by certain quarters in this debate. The views of the UN Human Rights Committee do not have force of law in Australia. Make no mistake: this is our decision. This legislation is reflective of a decision of this government to take action. It may have been stimulated by the UN Human Rights Committee, but it is still no-one else's decision but this government's decision. The argument has been raised that the federal government should have defended the Tasmanian position in the international arena. All arguments put forward by the Tasmanian government were certainly considered when the Human Rights Committee considered the case, but let us look at the facts. The Tasmanian government's stance is directly opposed to Commonwealth policy and to the practice in every other state in Australia. The arguments of the Tasmanian state government are fundamentally flawed. The arguments used stated that these laws protect Tasmania from the spread of HIV. The Tasmanian state government tried to dress up these archaic and homophobic laws as being valid on the grounds of public health and moral decency. Quite the reserve is true. It is well documented that these types of laws directly obstruct the health programs which are aimed at limiting the spread of HIV, and they do this by driving underground the very people who are most at risk. Would you openly seek medical testing for HIV if you thought that it could land you in gaol? I certainly would not. Let me finish with a local perspective on this issue. Tasmanians are not uniformly rednecks and homophobic. I can assure this House that those who have been very vocal in Tasmania against homosexual reform are very much in the minority. In my own electorate of Bass public meetings called on this issue have had very poor attendances. I am sad to say that the level of public opposition to homosexual law has been beaten up, largely by the mainland media, simply because over-the-top bigotry is a good story. I must add, however, that the Tasmanian media people have been very responsible in this area. This is a good bill. There is no need for anyone in this chamber to oppose it. I must say that I will be watching with great interest those who do. I commend the bill to the House.",60
26,Mr WILLIAMS,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Tangney) (2.00 p.m.)I want to talk principally about the government's motives in introducing this bill, the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994. The government has not introduced this bill because it is concerned about privacy. The government has not introduced this bill because it is concerned about Australia's international obligations. What the introduction of the bill does is to demonstrate that this government does not really care about individual rights, it does not care about the federal division of responsibilities and it does not care about Australia's obligations as an international citizen. The bill is in fact a cynical and transparent attempt by the government to curry favour, to grab votes, to further centralise power in the federal government and to try to divide the coalition. These are the real motives behind the government's actions. I want to give some background to this bill to expose the government's motives. In 1980 Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and it became, as a result, a party to that covenant. As a party, Australia becomes bound under article 2 of the international covenant to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as set out in the covenant are violated shall have an effective remedy. That remedy should be provided and enforceable not by international law but by municipal law, which means in this case by Australia's own legal system. Australia does not have and never has had any legislation under which a person can bring an action in an Australian court for a remedy for a breach of the rights guaranteed to that person in the international covenant. T.he remedy need not, of course, be in that dIrect form and preferably would not be. Many of the rights guaranteed under the covenant are in fact dealt with by the common law or by acts of state parliaments. Many of those protections were part of our laws long, long before the international covenant was even drafted. On 25 December 1991 Australia's accession to the first optional protocol to the international covenant took effect. Australia's acceslaws. sion entitles individuals in this country with complaints about claimed breaches of the international covenant to take those complaints. to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. A person can take a complaint to the Human Rights Committee only if he or she has exhausted all domestic remedies for the claimed breach in his or her country. Where there are no domestic remedies available in Australia for a claimed breach of the rights and freedoms contained in the covenant, people in Australia may, therefore, take their complaints directly to the committee for determination. Mr Nick Toonen, a homosexual living in T-smania, took a complaint to the Human Rights Committee in December 1991. His complaint was about sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. Those sections provide that any person who engages in sodomy with a person of either sex, or any male person who engages in acts ?f gr?ss indecency with another male person, IS gUilty of a crime. Mr Toonen complained to the Human Rights Committee that those laws. breached, among other things, his right to pnvacy under article 17 of the international cove?ant. Article 17 gives people in a state that IS a party to the covenant a broad and general - ight to protection of their privacy from arbitrary or unlawful interference. It is worth quoting it in full: 1. - o one shall be. subj-cte- to arbitrary or unlawful mterference With his pnvacy. family. home or correspondence. nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. 2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. On 8 April 1994, the Human Rights Committee published its views, upholding Mr Toonen's complaint and finding that Australia was in breach of its obligations under article 17. The Tasmanian government has not repealed the criticised laws and has made it clear that it does not intend to do so. The. feder- go-ernment is not legislating to fulfil ItS obhgatlOns under the international covenant and provide a remedy at Australian law for anyone who claims that his or her rights are being breached by the Tasmanian Instead, the government has introduced this bil.l. The government makes two import-nt claims about what this bill will do. First, It says that this is a privacy bill and that this government wants to secure individual rights. Secondly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a-d hi- government sanctimoniously say that thiS bill fulfils Australia's obligations as a party to the covenant and thus is vital to its standing as a good international citizen. The claims made by the government for the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill camouflage its real reasons. First, this bill is not really about privacy. It does not implement all of the provisions of article 17. The bill refers to sexual conduct between consenting adults in private and says that there should be no arbitrary interference with that conduct. The - ill. - oes nothing for the concerns of many mdlvlduals about the increasing and unwarranted encroachment by this government and by administrative bodies on the private and business affairs of ordinary Australians. The only form of privacy that the bill protects from arbitrary interference is the privacy of consenting adults to engage in sexual conduct. If the government were serious about protecting Australians' rights to privacy, as it is bound to do under the international covenant it would deal with privacy rather than with sexual conduct alone. In case the contrary is suggested, let me say also that this bill is not a bill about homosexuallaw reform. It does not pretend to protect the rights of homosexual people, whether male or female, as such, or to prevent discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference. Informed people have recognised that this bill really is a cynical attempt by the government to appease members of the homosexual community and secure their votes without offering social reform. I believe that the Tasmanian laws are wrong. In fact, they are inconsistent with the Liberal Party's federal platform. The platform calls for understanding of, and respect for, individual conscience and moral judgment and for a recognition of the individual's right to live according to those judgments. It is the philosophy of the Liberal Party that controls over the free actions of the individual should be avoided unless there is clear evidence that the equal rights of others or the protection of the community requires the imposition of controls. It is not the role of a government or of a political party to impose moral judgments on individuals where there is no public interest in the results of the exercise of those judgments. The sexual practices of consenting adults in private, in my view, come within that principle. The principle can accommodate both those who approve and those who disapprove, for whatever reason, of homosexual conduct or unorthodox sexual practices. I have said that I believe the Tasmanian laws should be repealed, but I believe that the Tasmanian government should be the one to repeal them. The federal government should not intervene legislatively to render the laws ineffective. Another major reason why the government's claims in respect of the bill camouflage the real reasons is that this bill does discharge the obligations Australia undertook when it ratified the covenant. The government has made no attempt to provide a domestic remedy within the Australian legal system for alleged breaches of an individual's rights under the international covenant. In this way the Commonwealth government remains in breach of its obligations under article 2. In fact, the proper way for the obligations to be implemented would involve actions by state governments. Until the Toonen case decision, the government made no attempt whatever to have state governments take steps to fulfil the obligations under the covenant. If there were domestic remedies, enforceable by Australian courts, there would be no need for the involvement of United Nations bodies. The findings of the Human Rights Committee in the Toonen case have brought adverse publicity to Australia. This publicity has been described by one commentator as 'to all intents and purposes a potent declaration of international delinquency'. This is most regrettable and, unfortunately, impacts on Australia's credibility in international forums promoting human rights. It has served to highlight the continuing concern of many Australians, including the members of the coalition parties, with the way this government blithely ratifies and accedes to international treaties and protocols without proper regard to their contents. When the executive branch of government signs an international treaty, it is incurring on behalf of the nation the obligation set out in that treaty. This is similar to an ordinary person signing a contract. A person can get out of a contract only if all the other parties to it agree. At law, a treaty can be signed on behalf of the nation only by the executive branch of government. In practice, parliament has no involvement unless legislation is needed to implement the treaty. The states may be consulted on occasions, but consultation is not mandatory. Nor is the approval of the states required before the Commonwealth ratifies a treaty. One of the major problems with international treaties is that in their terms they often fail to recognise adequately the nature of a federal state. By becoming party to a treaty, Australia not may assume obligations that it needs the cooperation of the states to perform. The international covenant is a particular example of this. One of the advisory committees to the Constitutional Commission recommended that a treaties council be established to enhance parliament's role in the treaty making process. This is not the occasion to discuss that recommendation in detail; I mention it merely to show that I am not the only one who is concerned about the consequences of the government's lack of consultation with others before it assumes the significant burden of international duties and obligations. In fact, industry groups have recently issued two major press releases: one in January from eight peak bodies led by the Business Council of Australia; another, I think, in April by 11 peak bodies again led by the Business Council. In them they expressed concern about the impact of treaties on business-treaties which have been entered into without consultation or, in some cases, without the knowledge of industry. The interests of all relevant parties including the states should be considered and taken into account before the Commonwealth enters into a treaty. If this is done, the government should have the support of the entire community to satisfy the second need, namely, for parliament to give legislative implementation to all aspects, not just selected narrow areas, of all the international treaties into which Australia has entered. The coalition cares about responsibilities, not just individual responsibilities but also our responsibilities a nation. This bilI uses section 109 of the constitution effectively to override Tasmanian laws. Where a Commonwealth law and a state law are inconsistent, the Commonwealth law prevails and the state law is invalid to the extent of the inconsistency. So that part of the Tasmanian anti-sodomy laws that is an arbitrary interference with private adult consensual sexual conduct will be rendered invalid by this bilI if it becomes law. The Commonwealth does not have the constitutional power to legislate with respect to human rights or sexual conduct or privacy. It relies on the scope of the external affairs power contained in section 51 (xxix) of the constitution to support the legislation. This biII is really the most recent of transparent attempts by the Commonwealth to use the existence of a treaty to trample on the delicate balance of federal-state legislative powers. The use of this device by the Commonwealth should be understood as having a serious and damaging effect on federal-state relations. I want to comment briefly on some parts of the terms of the bill. The bilI speaks of 'arbitrary interference' and says that phrase has the meaning it is given in article 17 of the international covenant. Ultimately, the meaning of the phrase will be a question for the High Court to determine. The bilI is drafted to ensure that the High Court will interpret the expression in the light of the interpretation of it by the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. It is by no means certain what the High Court will decide constitutes an arbitrary interference and what does not. That uncertainty is an undesirable result of this legislation. There is considerable concern in the community. It has been mentioned that the Human Rights Committee will in fact make decisions binding Australians. For my part, I do not accept that. The High Court will form its own opinion. At its highest, it will have regard to decisions of the Human Rights Committee. In the light of the terms of the bill, it will probably be important for the High Court to take account of decisions by the Human as Rights Committee in that respect but it certainly should never be bound by them. The Human Rights Committee itself warrants particular comment. By the standards of the Australian legal system, the finding in the Toonen case was made in breach of the rules of natural justice, in breach of the rules of procedural fairness. Although the laws in question were Tasmanian laws, the Commonwealth, as the party to the international covenant, was the defendant to the complaint by Mr Toonen. The Commonwealth did not defend the Tasmanian laws and so the Tasmanian government was effectively condemned in its absence. The crucial parts of the committee's findings were conceded by the Australian government in its submissions to the committee. Australia admitted that Mr Toonen had been a victim of an arbitrary interference with his privacy and that the Tasmanian laws cannot be justified on public health or moral grounds. It is therefore not surprising the Human Rights Committee made the findings that it did. It would be very wrong to tie the interpretation of the crucial phrase in this bill to the determination of a committee that conducts its hearings in that manner. As I said, I accept that the interpretation is not tied. The Human Rights Committee in the Toonen case found that the Tasmanian laws were an arbitrary interference with Mr international Toonen's right to privacy. In doing so, committee said that a law will not be an reform, arbitrary interference if the interference proportional to the end sought to be achieved by the law and necessary in the circumstances of the case. The committee found that the Tasmanian laws were not reasonably necesbe sary for the protection of morals, nor were they a reasonable or proportionate means achieving the aim of preventing the spread HIV or AIDS. The effect of the bill depends on how the High Court applies the test of arbitrary ference. There is also considerable the community that the bill may override state laws prohibiting incest and regulating prostiof tution. I believe those concerns are misplaced but it highlights my argument that this is really not the way to go about enforcing Australia's international obligations. In the bill the government is obliging the High Court to consider very broad concepts in order to make judgments, and the judgthe ments are essentially on political questions. is requiring it to decide whether a an arbitrary interference with privacy. This wrongly abdicates the responsibility of parliament-this parliament and state parliamentsto decide those questions. It leaves it courts to determine those matters, without providing guidance. It was not necessary do it in this way. I have explained why I believe this is not a bill about privacy and why the government does not care about individual privacy and human rights. I have asserted and why I believe this is not a bill about the discharge of Australia's obligations under international covenant. I do not believe government really cares about our responsiIiams), bilities as an international citizen. In fact, the bill does none of the things Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have claimed it will do. It constitutes really attempt by the government to centralise in Canberra, to damage the federal-state compact and to divide the opposition. What is needed is a thorough reform of the processes by which Australia enters into treaties and then implements the the obligations assumed under them. In the the constitutional division of responsiis bilities between the Commonwealth and the states should be respected and not overridden. Notwithstanding my concerns about the bill, the Tasmanian laws, which I believe should repealed, remain. The question of whether or not to support or oppose this bill inof volves-at least for me-a fine and difficult of balancing act between my commitment to the rights of individuals to privacy, on the one hand, and a proper sharing of powers in the interfederal balance between the Commonwealth concern in and the states. I have suggested that there are other ways achieving the true objectives of implementing Australia's obligations under the international covenant. In the end, the choice offered now is only this bill or a continuation of the Tasmanian laws. On balance, my personal decision, reached with some difficulties, is that I will not oppose the bill but, for my part, if the Tasmanian government were to repeal laws in question, I would see no reason It whatever for the bill in its present form to state law is remain on the statute book.",63
27,Mr HOLDING,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"I commend the Attorney-General (Mr to the Lavarch), whose speech was measured, balanced and designed to discharge the to obligations of the Commonwealth to its international obligations. Equally, I commend the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) who speaks for the decent citizens of Tasmania, who have been subject to a welter of propaganda, misrepresentation, homophobic explained attitudes and religious bias. I find it disappointing that honourable the members of the opposition, including the this honourable member for Tangney (Mr Wilcome into this House and accuse the government of false motives, accuse the the government of introducing this legislation in order to split the opposition. We did not need an to split the opposition. From the very first power occasion this issue was raised we had a massive reaction from the Tasmanian government, not talking about the real issues, not talking about the fundamental rights of Australian citizens, including Tasmanians, but talking about states rights. Anyone who has looked at the history of homosexual law reform in Australia will realise that the reforms that have taken place in all states of the Commonwealth except Tasmania have not been the prerogative of anyone political party and, indeed, if one looks at the legislation that has been passed in state after state, the one thing that is clear is that on most occasions people have crossed the floor in order to exercise what is basically in many cases an act of conscience. I will not be surprised if that exercise is repeated in this House. We have every reason to believe that it will be. However, to say, as the honourable member for Tangney did, that the motive of the Attorney-General in introducing this legislation was not any commitment to fundamental human rights but some kind of political ploy is arrant nonsense. It is unworthy of someone who finishes up telling us that he has wrestled with his conscience and, after that massive exercise, he is actually going to vote for the legislation. What I would like to know from the honourable member for Tangney and the other spokesman for the opposition on this issue today, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), is, when their colleagues in Tasmania said that they were going to take this issue to the wall, what advice was given to them by the honourable member for Tangney, or by the strong, true, brave Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer)? Did he not address it on behalf of his party which, at both a national level and within the states, has a reputable position on the question of homosexual law reform? Was there any message sent from the coalition to its political colleagues in Tasmania saying that their endeavour to maintain these laws was totally unacceptable and would be repudiated? There was not. We all received letters from the Attorney General of Tasmania. These letters contained two or three pages of arrant nonsense about state rights. Was that letter the subject of any response from the Leader of the Opposition or his shadow Attorney-General? What are we talking about here? We are talking about a piece of state legislation which does not sit comfortably, whichever way it is put, with the fundamental rights of Australian citizens. It proscribes not only homosexual conduct but also anal intercourse between married couples. If Australian citizens respond to the tourism advertisements of the Tasmanian government and go down there, their freedom of choice in terms of their preferred sexual activity could find them in breach of the law. That is the issue. Let me state my own position, and I believe the very principled position of the government. I do not believe that this government or any state government has any right to tell an Australian citizen what form of sexual conduct he will have within his own home. I do not believe any group of politicians sitting in Tasmania has any right not to have the honour or the integrity to say, 'No government, state or federal, has the right to pursue what citizens choose to do, be they males or females, with their consenting partners in the privacy of their own bedrooms.' That is the issue. Do any of the honourable members opposite who are accusing us of all sorts of conspiracy want to say that they would accept a situation where any government of any kind of political philosophy said it had the right to tell them what their sexual preference was to be and how they would conduct themselves with their sexual partner? It is a gross intrusion into the basic rights of every Australian citizen. If this coalition were to honour some of the traditions which exist within their own party, whereby they were on many occasions prepared to lead the argument and not follow it, they should have said to their Tasmanian colleagues, 'You will not have our support; we will not be coming into the parliament to talk about the complex balance between state rights and federal rights.' We are talking here about quite fundamental human rights. One may well ask the totally legitimate question of why it is that this law-which remains on the statute books and which is giving so much concern in terms of state rights to our colleagues opposite-is not being enforced. Why is it that there are no raids on private bedrooms to arrest people? The answer is simple: they know the law is wrong and that it is an intrusion which should not be accepted in any state in the Commonwealth and that it will not be accepted by right-thinking and decent Tasmanians. They know that. But they also know there is a homophobic group in Tasmania whose religious beliefs are such that they want to proscribe all these activities, and they do not want to offend that group. As long as they have this sort of legislation on the statute book, then the insults that take place on a daily basis, directed at gay and lesbian people, will continue. The assaults that take place on them will continue, and they will be continually relegated to the position of being second-class citizens in their own country. Let me say this: I do not believe that in a modem, plural, democratic society like Australia there is any Australian citizenwhatever their sexual preference or religious beliefs-who should be treated as a secondclass citizen. That is what this legislation is all about, and that is what the government's response is all about. It cannot be said of this Attorney-General that, on behalf of the government, he did not do all that was possible to get the Tasmanian government to repeal these odious laws in its own right. If the government had done that, there would have been no need for this legislation. But it did not respond. What is more, one would be entitled to think, given some of the responses that came from the coalition, that it was politically correct not respond; because there was a lot of sympathy over there, and it has already started to emerge. What would a person believe if they were a stranger wandering into this parliament? This is a debate about human rights. I will rephrase that: this is not a debate about Commonwealth-state rights and trying to balance the role of the Commonwealth and the role of the states. It does not matter where one looks in terms of legislation-at health, industrial relations or taxation policy-there is a continual daily argument going on between states of different political complexions and Commonwealth governments of different political complexions on the complex and never ending political issue of Commonwealth rights as against state rights. It is a political permanent in the Australian political environment and scene. This is not what we are talking about. We are talking about the rights and liberties of the Australian citizen. We are saying that we will not yield to the homophobes who have waged an untruthful and unrelenting campaign, which has already been mentioned by the member for Bass; we will not yield to a government which purports to raise the false issue of states rights in order to add power to religiously intolerant people who can provide it with a few numbers at election time. Considering the terms of the legislation and the propaganda that has ensued from Tasmania, we are told that Tasmania is under threat. It is not as if it is bad enough that you have this legislation on the statute books; listening to some of the spokesmen on behalf of the Tasmanian government you would almost believe that, if these odious provisions were repealed, it would be almost compulsory for you to become a homosexual. What nonsense! I was concerned to hear people who, speaking in terms of their religious beliefs, were trying to justify the Tasmanian legislation. I suppose all one can say in a society where we have to show, and properly show, religious tolerance is that there were those who in the past used Christian doctrine to endeavour to justify slavery; there were those in South Africa who tried to apply Christian doctrine to in order to justify apartheid; and there are those who, as a result of their fundamental beliefs, believe that they have the right to dictate how Australian citizens will behave in terms of their relationship with their partners in the privacy of their own bedrooms. That is the central issue. It is the only issue. It is unfortunate, I believe, that the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General have tried-I think quite legitimately and very properly-but have failed to persuade the Tasmanian government that we did not need to act in this matter; it was a matter that the Tasmanian government had within its political capacity to rectify. But it is equally true that, in terms of international covenants, those covenants do not look at state laws or state legislation when they find a particular piece of legislation is not in accordance with international treaties; they look to the nation state. So, in terms of representing this nation state, if we are unable-and we are unableto persuade an errant state government to remedy this situation in terms of its own legislation and to enshrine human rights and abolish this type of legislation, the only recourse available to us, so that Australia as a nation is not condemned internationally, is to take action in this parliament. That is what has occurred. It is the height of hypocrisy to come in here and make comments like 'Well, I've got a terrible problem in balancing states rights' and accuse the government and the Attorney of all kinds of hidden motives when the issue, as I have said, is comparatively simple. And it is comparatively simple. From the research that has been done, both in Australia and internationally, we now know enough about sexual behaviour to know that human beings, being what they are, find their own level of participation, their own relationship with their partner-be they male or female, be they gay or lesbian. As part of their human personality, people find out those things which they do as part of the process of being human. I do not believe anybody in this House can justify a position which comes down to this. No politician, no group of politicians, no government-state or federal-has got the right to tell Australian citizens what their preferred level of sexual conduct should be. I am not talking about children; I am talking about adults. Every community has the right-and the duty-to protect its children. No government has the right to tell you in the privacy of your own home-whether you are married or whatever your relationship ishow you will conduct your preferred level of sexual activity. That is not what Australian society is about. That is not what living in a democratic, complex, multicultural society is about. Living in such a society is about legislatures enlarging and enriching human freedoms and human rights. That is why I hope this legislation proceeds through this parliament quickly and we resolve an issue upon which, on one view of it, if the coalition had been doing its job properly and providing effective political leadership in this nation, it would not have been necessary for the Commonwealth to legislate. Since it has been necessary, I commend the legislation to the House and I commend the actions of the Attorney-General to the House.",67
28,Ms WORTH,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"My colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has clearly set out the coalition's position on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill and this allows me the opportunity to take a broader approach. The philosophy which guides me as a parliamentarian is the belief in the dignity of individual endeavour and a commitment to nurturing the personal freedom which is at the root of individual endeavour. Paradoxically, government is both the greatest facilitator of this freedom and the greatest threat to this freedom. On the one hand, it is the means by which we create the prosperity and security which is perhaps a necessary condition if people are to be free to pursue their full potential. On the other hand, government can become an end in itself, increasing its power-its control over people-for its own sake. The philosophy of liberalism grew out of the need to find a way to limit government, to protect people's freedom, and this is the philosophy that guides me. In consequence, I cannot oppose the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. This bill provides that sexual conduct involving consenting adults in private is not to be subject by law-be that law federal state or territory-to arbitrary interference; in other words, interference which cannot be justified on the grounds of public good. I consider the right to privacy to be fundamental to human dignity. When a government takes upon itself the power to arbitrarily intervene in and direct a relationship between consenting adults-I stress the word 'consenting' and the word 'adult' - the dignity that comes from being the master of one's own destiny is lost. I have been lobbied by just a few individuals and groups who have chosen to interpret the present bill as a proposal endorsing homosexuality and who, in tum, have asked me to oppose this bill on the grounds that homosexuality is immoral. While I am always open to the opinions of those whom I represent, I do not believe that these requests to oppose this bill are based on a sound interpretation of the nature of the bill. This bill is not about the morality or the immorality of homosexuality. This bill is about the right of consenting adults to conduct a sexual relationship free from government interference. I would ask those who would have the government impose moral behaviour on individuals to consider the words of a participant in the debate that preceded the decriminalisation of homosexuality in England. The debate took place in the 1950s. I will quote from the words of the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Fisher: One of my correspondents boldly writes to me, 'So far as possible, every sin should be declared a crime' - which is precisely the belief of the totaliof tarian state, which defines its own sense of sin then makes it a crime. I am afraid that there is a very common belief that only crimes are sins and that the not illegal is therefore lawful and right. At this point, the Archbishop is referring to the heterosexual sins of fornication and adultery. The Archbishop continues: The State and the law are not concerned directly, as the Church is, with saving the souls of men from their own destruction. The right to decide one's own moral code and obey it, even to a man's own hurt, is a fundamental right of man, given him by God. I can only add to the Archbishop's words by reiterating that, by allowing this bill to pass through the House, I am not promoting homosexuality; I am merely sanctioning the right of each of us to make and live by our own decisions. I wish to stress that I respect the opinion of those who have concluded that homosexuality is immoral, but I would simply ask that, in tum, these people respect the right of others to form their own moral judgments. In deciding not to oppose this bill, I must declare my indebtedness to my friend Murray Hill. Not surprisingly, given its progressiveness on a number of issues, the first state to decriminalise homosexuality was South Australia, and the Hon. Murray Hill, who was then a Liberal member of the South Australian Legislative Council, was instrumental in bringing this about. ",70
29,Ms WORTH,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"He is a great man. In 1972 he introduced a private member's bill, the object of which was to decriminalise sex between consenting male adults in private. I understand that his son, Robert, who is now the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, had a hand in drafting the bill. Murray Hill made it clear that he did not personally believe homosexuality was morally acceptable; however, he was motivated-in the face of significant condemnation of his actionsby what he believed to be his responsibility as a representative of the people. During the second reading debate he explained: I represent the interests of people. People come before all other ""interests"". In this issue, I am confronted with a minority of people whose cause to change the law . . . is just and right. Irrespective the severe personal criticism that I know will and come from some members of the public, I cannot justify my claim to represent ""people"" if I tum my back on this minority. In accordance with what he believed to be his duty as a representative of the people, Murray Hill undertook to do away with the laws which made homosexuality a crime and which legitimised the persecution of the homosexual minority. To do so at that time was an act of significant political courage. I would hope that today I am remaining true to the political tradition bequeathed to a generation of South Australian Liberals that followed. The then state Attorney-General, Peter Duncan-currently the member for Makin in this place-crafted the legislation which was to complete the process that Murray Hill had begun. In the words of Murray Hill during the debate on the then Attorney-General's legislation, 'I commend Mr Duncan for his courage and obvious concern for these people.' It is interesting to note that, at approximately the same time the member for Makin was drafting the legislation which would decriminalise homosexuality in South Australia, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was voting against a federal notice of motion which also sought the decriminalisation of homosexuality-a motion incidentally which was moved by the Liberal Party's John Gorton. One of the more disturbing aspects community debate that has preceded this bill has been the willingness of some organisaimparted tions to play on people's fears by misrewe presenting the implications of this of the people who have written to me seem to believe this bill will override all of the which currently exist to regulate sexual conduct. This is simply not the case. The bill proscribes arbitrary government interference in sex between consenting adults in private. The fact that both the participants in the sexual act being referred to adults-and, further, must be consenting adults-means that this bill will not override state laws relating to rape and sexual assault on minors. Further, the fact that the governthat ment interference being proscribed is arbitrary interference means that this bill will have effect upon the state laws dealing with regulaview tion of the sex industry, sexual conduct amounting to professional misconduct by doctor, child pornography or sexual in public since all these laws can be justified as necessary to preserve the public good. It has been argued by those who have asked me to oppose this bill that government regulational tion of homosexuality can be justified in same terms-that is, as necessary to preserve the public good. They argue that government regulation of homosexuality is necessary protect the community from the spread of AIDS. I would suggest that the notion that this bill, by indirectly decriminalising sexuality in Tasmania, will lead to the spread of AIDS in that state is misguided. It is true that Tasmania has the lowest rate of HIV infection in Australia. However, fact that South Australia, the first state to decriminalise homosexuality, also has a government comparatively low rate of HIV infection suggests that the rate of HIV infection is linked to the legal status of homosexuality. Indeed, common sense would suggest that laws which make criminals of homosexuals are a deterrent to individuals coming forward for HIV testing. I take this opportunity to answer the correspondents who have counselled me to be obedient to God's will and oppose this bill. of the My answer is brief. My upbringing was strongly Christian and the messages that were to me when I was young were that had no right to judge others and that it bill. Many was important to be tolerant. Having explained my reasons for not laws opposing this bill, there are issues which should be aired. This bill was drafted in response to a United Nations Human Rights Committee finding that parts of the Tasmanian criminal code breached the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The offending parts were must be those outlawing homosexuality. Having signed and ratified this international treaty, Australia committed itself to ensuring human rights standards set out in the treaty were observed in this country. When no the Human Rights Committee published its that Australia was in contravention of these standards, Australia became bound, not a by the threat of force but by honour, to conduct address this breach. In the absence of any willingness on the part of the Tasmanian government to reform those parts of its criminal code which breached the standards set out in the InternaCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, the as every other state and territory has done over the past 20 years, it has fallen to the Commonwealth government to create a law to which addresses this breach. This has been done in the form of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. It has created a Commonhomowealth law which will indirectly override Tasmanian law. This bill creates the opportunity for homosexuals affected by state laws outlawing sex between consenting adult males the in private to challenge these laws. While I understand what has caused the to follow this path in this particular case, I cannot sanction the general trend not towards centralised government. I point out that I am not opposed to Australia becoming a party to international treaties. It is perhaps pertinent in the context of this bill to remember that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was ratified during the years of the Fraser government after consultation with all states including Tasmania. Since ratification of the covenant, the coalition's recognition of, and so implicitly its commitment to, a standard of human rights transcending national boundaries has been reiterated in The Things That Matter, which states: The global trend to democracy, freedom and respect for human rights must be nurtured with long term commitment. Participation in international treaties is essential if Australia is to play its part in the international community. I would argue that those who fail to recognise the existence of this community are as bereft of vision as were those who resisted the Federation of the Australian colonies. As Federation has proven, we are capable of a number of allegiances. Our allegiance to our respective states was not superseded by our allegiance to Australia. I suggest that our loyalty to Australia will not be superseded by our growing recognition that we are members of an international community. Indeed as Pierre Sane, Secretary-General of Amnesty International, has said: We live in a global community. It is simply not possible in the 1990's for any nation to pretend that it exists in isolation, that its affairs are not affected in one thousand and one ways by the policies and actions of other nations. We are surrounded by the evidence of this interconnectedness: trade, transport, communications, migration, defence, drug enforcement. I do not oppose our participation in international treaties. However, I am strongly opposed to the present government's use of these treaties. At the beginning of this century, the Australian people voted for the Australian colonies to federate. I would argue that Australians were instinctively suspicious of authority at this time, that they were therefore sympathetic to the idea of limited government and that they intended the states to be preserved for the purpose of checking the power of the new national government. Over the last decade, Labor has shown scant regard for our federal system of government. It has consistently sought to extend its power beyond the limits imposed on it by the Australian people. One of the strategies that is being increasingly used towards this end involves the exploitation of the powers to sign and ratify treaties that presently reside with the executive. As I said, I do not oppose Australia's participation in international treaties. We do not sign away our sovereignty in such instances. While our participation in a treaty may suggest the need for our domestic laws to be changed, the actual power to do this, or not to do this, remains with the Australian parliament. However, it cannot be denied that Australia's standing in the international community is significantly damaged if our domestic laws breach the standards of a treaty which we have signed. It logically follows that the initial decision to enter into a treaty should be based on discussions which include both Commonwealth and state parliaments, since it is the agreement of these bodies which will ultimately be required if Australian domestic law needs to be changed to honour our commitments under an international treaty. It is to this country's detriment that the present government has chosen to enter into treaties without any real effort to draw the Commonwealth and state parliaments into the decision. The government's method of consuldirectly tation with the states has been grossly inadequate and its public consultation almost non-existent. The ratification of International Labour Organisation convention 158, contrary to the view of all but one of the states, is a case in point. I would argue that there is purpose to this madness. At present Labor is using both its power to sign international treaties and its external affairs power to thwart the spirit of our federal system and to extend its powers into areas of state responsibility. If this is not the case, then I challenge the government to do as the coalition has said it will do in The Things That Matter; namely, to 'reform Australia's international treaty making processes to ensure that the Australian parliament, the states, industry and the community are consulted' and to 'ensure that there is a detailed public statement on the implications of international treaties on Australia's law, economy, environment and trade competitiveness before they are signed'. Labor has created a climate in which Australia does not enter treaties as a nation. Perhaps, inevitably, we are divided when the moment comes for us to alter our domestic laws in accordance with our treaty commitments. Finally, I would like to echo in this House a plea made to all Australian parliamentarians by Pierre Sane of Amnesty International. He said: Ask yourselves not how do you limit your international responsibilities but rather how do you, with such a proud tradition of parliamentary democracy, legislate to give full effect to these responsibilities.",71
30,Mr LATHAM,DROUGHT RELIEF PAYMENT BILL,"Werriwa) (2.53 p.m.}-The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill establishes a national safeguard to ensure that the privacy of sexual conduct between consenting adults is protected from unreasonable legal interference. The bill will not affect laws dealing with public acts or acts involving children. This legislation will indirectly render null and void sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code which prohibit oral and anal sex between heterosexual and homosexual persons. The offensive section reads: Any person who: has sexual intercourse with any person against the order of nature; or consents to a male person having sexual intercourse with him or her against the order of nature, is guilty of a crime. The crime listed in the Tasmanian legislation is 'unnatural sexual intercourse'. The bill before the House today is directly inconsistent with the Tasmanian law and, accordingly, it will prevail under section 109 of the Australian constitution. The legislation has a sound constitutional base. It is a partial implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory. The federal parliament, through the external affairs power, is entitled-indeed obliged-to pass laws implementing Australia's treaty obligations. The law passed by the Tasmanian parliament is outside the boundaries of good government. No government should be in the business of defining natural or unnatural acts of sexual intercourse. In a liberal democracy, government should not play the role of bedroom police. Acts of consenting adultshomosexuals and heterosexuals--engaging in anal and oral sex should be left in the bedroom as a question of choice between those persons. I point out to the House that the Tasmanian criminal code is not just restricted to acts of homosexuality. It applies just as much to acts between consenting heterosexual adults. For that reason, the Tasmanian criminal code denies a large number of adult Tasmanians and visitors to Tasmania the choice of behavioural activities that one would normally expect in a democratic society. As I said, governments should not play the role of bedroom police in the homes of consenting adults. The Tasmanian criminal code seeks to repress an innate feature of human character-the freedom of consenting adults to choose their own mode of sexual behaviour. In history, repression of the innate features of people has been known as tyranny or fascism; that is, the restrictions governments have placed on freedoms of expression, movement and ethnic background. The Tasmanian code is no less offensive. To place a restriction on consenting adults, in the privacy of their own bedroom, to choose their mode of sexual behaviour, is as offensive in a liberal democracy as any of the restrictions associated with tyranny and fascism-freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of ethnic background and expression. These values are totally foreign to Australian notions of tolerance and egalitarianism. Just before question time when we are expecting the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), I am surprised that he is not on the speakers list, that he is not going to take an active part in this debate. One would have thought that on such an important principle that has invoked controversy in the community the Leader of the Opposition would set out his views on this issue and lead his party into debate. It is a shame, because on 8 June this year at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition said: .. , international treaties have been allowed to intrude into Australian domestic law without being sanctioned by the Australian people and without reference to Parliament . . . It is a question of whether Australian law is made in Australia by Australians and for Australians. At the National Press Club, he was asking for the sort of debate that parliament now has before it. He thought that these questions about international treaties should be debated by the parliament. But now that the opportunity for debate on this legislation has arisen he is nowhere to be seen. He is not on the speakers list to contribute to the debate. He will not be providing the House of Representatives with the sorts of views and contributions that he said at the National Press Club were absolutely essential. Instead, what we have from the coalition is a situation where only some opposition members will be supporting the legislation. Others have given a guide to their opposition to the legislation and their intention to force a division. Earlier today the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) moved an amendment to the legislation. Later on today or tomorrow morning some opposition members will be taking a long walk around Canberra and abstaining from the vote. For the Leader of the Opposition, in many ways, this is a long walk in its own right-a long walk in the snow of politics. The Liberal Party has to face up to the way in which the old rhetoric about states rights is now totally outdated in Australian politics. This legislation and the mixed response of the coalition is very much a turning point in the historic debate in Australia between human rights and states rights. Happily, states rights have now declined as a political force. With improvements in transport and communications, Australia is now a more compact and secure society. The stock-in-trade of conservative politics since Federationexploiting fears about Australia's isolation and the tyranny of distance through issues such as protectionism, white Australia, the communist bogey, monarchism and states rights-has just about exhausted itself. This leaves open an emerging agenda for the progressive politics of tolerance, independence and national standards for egalitarianism in this country. On all these issues, time after time, the coalition shows itself to be out of step with the national mood. It does not understand the way in which Australian society has changed and evolved in the 1980s and 1990s. Instead of being inward looking and frightened about our position in the world, Australians are now outward looking and want to embrace the values of tolerance and egalitarianism expressed in this legislation.",74

33,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Leader of the House and the Minister for Finance. On a day when the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke says the current Prime Minister has lied, on a day when written notes show the current Prime Minister has not told the truth, on a day when through sheer hatred it is the Prime Minister who has gone too far, will the Leader of the House drag the Prime Minister into this chamber so he can answer Mr Hawke's charges, which raise the most serious and fundamental questions about the Prime Minister's capacity to tell the truth? If the Prime Minister is not prepared to come in now, is that just further proof that he knows that if he does not tell the truth in this place and is caught, he will be forced to resign?",75

35,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,76
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be patronising in this particular case because that sort of childishness deserves it. When did you tell the truth on the question of who you voted for in the last leadership ballot but one-John Howard or your leadership predecessor? As far as the views of the Prime Minister are concerned on this matter, I wish to quote something which is directly relevant to it: If Saddam Hussein was left to go his way with the booty of Kuwait, how many years would it be before the world was contemplating another Middle East incident, probably involving Saudi Arabia, where Saddam's arsenal then contained more punishing and destructive weapons? Does the world then say from the position of vulnerability territorial ambitions should be acceded to? How would the international environment look if he decided to wage a massive and destructive campaign, not just against Saudi Arabia, but also against Israel, with all of the retaliatory issues which such a course would invoke? A benign policy of appeasement now would be not only unjust but also dangerous and the family of nations would have to contemplate life in the international economy with up to 75 per cent of the world's oil supply, the lifeblood of most nations' commerce, in the hands of one malicious tyrant. It would certainly be blood for oil then. What I was quoting from then, of course, was a speech by the Prime Minister, then Treasurer, in the House of Representatives when the matter was debated here. At all meetings on these matters that I have attended involving the former Prime Minister, these views are consistent with the views that he put forward on those occasions. The sort of nonsense that you are going on with as far as this is concerned is just that-nonsense.",76

38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, there are many alternative explanations to any particularOpposition members-Oh!",76
39,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course there are. In any set of conversations that anybody is likely to have over time there will be different impressions about what obtained to them. On the particular issue that you are concerned about, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been answering questions most effectively in the Senate. He is the person who has attended most of the meetings on these issues. The fact of the matter is that the government took a stand at that time. The nature and content of the stand were always going to be matters of discussion inside the government before its stand ultimately emerged before cabinet and then before the Australian parliament. All members of the government were solid in their commitment to the decisions that were arrived at by the cabinet and subsequently advocated. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",76
40,Mr DOWNER,PRIME MINISTER,"I seek leave to move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith that the Prime Minister be required to come into the House now to answer the most serious allegations ever levelled at a serving Prime Minister; that he answer the charges of the former Prime Minister that he has not told the truth; that he explain a written record of a meeting, which again demonstrates that he has not told the truth; and that, in the true tradition of democratic decency, he answer the charges against him, not just with his own version of events but with proof to back it up.",76
41,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is leave granted?,76
42,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,Yes.,76
43,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Leave is granted. Motion,76
44,Mr DOWNER,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That the Prime Minister be required to come into the House now to answer the most serious allegations ever levelled at a serving Prime Minister; that he answer the charges of the former Prime Minister that he has not told the truth; that he explain a written record of a meeting which again demonstrates that he has not told the truth; and that, in the true tradition of democratic decency, he answer the charges against him, not just with his own version of events but with proof to back it up. I move this motion because the charges that have been levelled by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, against the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can be rated only as being amongst the most serious charges that can possibly be levelled against a Prime Minister of this country. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who, after all, worked for many years with the present Prime Minister, has asserted that the Prime Minister has lied to the Australian people. That is an inordinately serious charge for a former Prime Minister who has worked for many years with the current Prime Minister to level against his successor. It is not just that this charge has been levelled by the former Prime Minister against the present Prime Minister-it is more serious than that. The former Prime Minister has documentary evidence to establish the veracity of his case. The Prime Minister has simply gone to ground, refusing to attend the parliament, refusing to address the parliament and refusing to explain to this most democratic of all Australian institutions why he lied to the Australian people about the Gulf War, about his own version of events in the lead-up to the Gulf War and about his views on that matter. The fact is that the Prime Minister should come into this chamber, to which he was elected by the people of Australia, and answer the charges levelled against him by the former Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister does not come into the parliament, it is a clear sign that he has simply been caught out. There is no question of that. If he refuses to come in here, we all know why. If he refuses to establish his case in this, the most democratic of all chambers in Australia, we all know why. It is because if he misleads this parliament he will be forced to resign. The Prime Minister is prepared to make assertions on the ABC's PM program-which, as it turns out, the former Prime Minister has said are lies-but he is not prepared to come into this chamber and make those same assertions; to defend himself and to defend himself with documentary evidence. It is perfectly clear that the Prime Minister has simply scurried away and, to use his words, hidden 'under arock', ashamed of what he has said and he has been exposed once more for his hyperbole and deceit for which he has such a well renowned reputation. This whole issue goes to the very heart of the integrity of the Prime Minister of Australia. People say, 'Who should we believe on this matter?' Some people say, 'You shouldn't believe Bob Hawke,' but not the Leader of the House. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) does not say that. When asked a question, the Leader of the House says that both Hawke and Keating are telling the truth. Hawke says that Keating lied, Keating says that Hawke lied and the Leader of the House says that they are both telling the truth. Where are you all?",76

46,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The House will come to order.,77
47,Mr DOWNER,PRIME MINISTER,"It is Watergatesque. When Senator Gareth Evans is asked for his version of events his response is that he cannot remember. If we cannot remember something that happened years and years ago, that is an absolute disgrace, but Senator Evans, as Minister for Foreign Affairs at that time, cannot remember discussions that took place. Who would believe that? The fact is that noone would believe it. But who would believe the Prime Minister? After all, look at his record. Here was the man who said that before the 1990 federal election-remember it?-that there would be no recession, and bang! Australia went into the worse recession it has had for 60 years. Here was the man who promised before the last election that he would give immense tax cuts to the Australian people, knowing all along that he could not afford them and would not be able to deliver them. So when the truth came he abandoned three-fifths of the tax cuts that he promised the Australian people. He is the man who in 1985 argued for a GST and came close to the point of resignation over getting rolled on the GST. In 1993 he was so passionately against it that he mounted his whole election campaign on its opposItIon. He is the man who, as former Prime Minister Hawke has pointed out, distorts history and has distorted history knowingly to claim that the British Foreign Office apparently wrote the Australian constitution. When you look at the record of the present Prime Minister, you see that truth and the Prime Minister are strangers. When words like 'truth' are in the room, the Prime Minister is always elsewhere. When the light of truth shines anywhere near the Prime Minister, he is always in the shadows. This time the Prime Minister has not only been caught, but has also been caught red-handed. There are witnesses, there are written notes and there are embarrassed ministers, like the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Leader of the House, who will not come out and confirm the so-called Keating version of events because they know that former Prime Minister Hawke has simply got to the heart of this matter. This whole exercise goes back to the extraordinary PM interview that the Prime Minister gave last night. It is worth reflecting on that extraordinaryMr Tim Fischer-Indulgent.",77
48,Mr DOWNER,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, indeed. As the Leader of the National Party says, it was an extraordinary and indulgent interview. The Prime Minister was asked by Fran Kelly: Prime Minister, in his book, Bob Hawke recounts how at the time in 1991 you weren't interested in sending Australian troops to the Gulf war, yet you say at the time that you were saying that should go after Saddam Hussein and finish him off. This is the typical sort of macho stuff you hear which has absolutely nothing to do with the truth. She went on: Did you support involvement in the Gulf war or not? PAUL KEATING: I did. That is just a straight lie, a straight distortion. Then he goes on to talk about meetings he had-all this macho chest thumping stuff. He said, 'We're going to continue to see this sort of criminal activity by Saddam Hussein.' He said: . . . I think we should be in a position to respond positively to a commitment on the interdiction role in the Gulf'. Then he goes on to talk about a later meeting. Apparently at the later meeting the now Prime Minister, then Treasurer, said: Well, I'll tell you what we should do. this is what he claims he said at the meetingI don't agree we should put a squadron of FA18s there, but I do believe we should commit to Desert Storm, but I'd leave two ships up the top of the Gulf and bring the other two home. That is his version of events. But what does the former Prime Minister say? First of all, the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, says, 'Of course this is not true. Fortunately, the record makes it absolutely clear and shows who is the liar in this matter.' That is the record of that meeting of 29 November. Then Mr Hawke quoted-not just political rhetoric, empty claims or the sorts of howling claims that we hear from the present Prime Minister-from the record: Keating started arguing that we should not do anything. What has the US ever done for us? He cited agricultural trade issues. Gareth Evans responded, as did the prime minister, in the United Nations terms. Where does that come from? That comes from the record of the meeting. As Mr Hawke said, you cannot have a clearer enunciation of the Prime Minister's revision of history than that. I think that is one of the most damning now indictments I have ever seen in Australian they politics and is a matter that exposes the present Prime Minister for all that so many Australians suspect he is guilty of; a man who. does not just gild the lily but a man who simply has no interest whatsoever in telling the truth. There was the claim by the Prime Minister that apparently there was a discussion about sending FA18 aircraft to the Gulf in the context of the Gulf War. It is all there in his speech of last night. He said that he had said, 'I do not think we should send a squadron of FA18s.' As the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke points out: The issue of FA 18s and sending a squadron of FAI8s simply was not before the cabinet. It was not a proposal before me or before the ministers. The Prime Minister was saying, 'I decided we shouldn't send FAI8s,' when FA18s were not even on the agenda. Minister Beazley, you know that is true. You do, do you not? Is it right that the government was considering sending FA18s to the Gulf? No answer. It is quite clearly not true that the government was considering sending FAI8s, and you know it. I know it; you know it. We know who has not told the truth, do we not? We know that the Prime Minister has failed to tell the truth. This is a matter of profound embarrassment to the Leader of the House because Mr Hawke involved him in all the discussions about the Gulf War. Remember how the Leader of the House was regarded by the former Prime Minister as a sort of son. So that sums it all up. I was quite interested when browsing through the Sydney Morning Herald, which is not an organ that I happen to agree with or admire on every day of the week, to find a story entitled 'PM: crush Saddam this time'. All this macho stuff is just pathetic. Last time the Prime Minister said, 'Let's not get involved. Let's keep right out of it.' That is what he said last time, but this time he says, 'Let's crush him.' When it comes to whose version of events is true, buried away in the story, interestingly, in response to the Hawke book, was a statement yesterday by a spokesman for the Prime Minister saying that Mr Hawke was wrong. It is not surprising that the Prime Minister would say that, as we know he will say anything. What was interesting was how the sentence in the article went on: ... other senior Government officials agreed with the former prime minister's version. Is that not interesting? In that article of yesterday, Tuesday, 11 October in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Prime Minister of this country has at last, by his own party and his own former leader, Mr Hawke, been exposed for all we know him to be-a man who has no respect whatsoever for the truth. As I said earlier, when words like truth are in the room, the Prime Minister is always elsewhere. I think this particular issue has exposed, in a highly dramatic way, the Prime Minister's attitude to the truth. His whole strategy is to go out there and say anything that makes him appear to sound tough. All this stuff about cleaning up Saddam Hussein and so on is all designed to make him look tough and try to make him popular. How pathetic! Somebody who goes out and simply invents a fantasy like that, to use the sorts of words that Mr Hawke uses, is not somebody who can and should ever be treated with respect. The fact is that the Prime Minister should come into this chamber and explain himself. But where is he?",78
49,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Government members interjecting,79
50,Mr DOWNER,PRIME MINISTER,"Well, where is he? Is he sitting in his office? Is he at home having a snooze? Where he is not is in the most democratic institution in this country-the Australian parliament and the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament. The Prime Minister is answerable to the parliament and he should be here to answer the documented allegations made against him by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. Since Sir Edmund Barton's time, Prime Ministers have come into the House of Representatives on sitting days to answer questions. The first Prime Minister who has not done that on a regular basis is the present Prime Minister-a man who comes in here on Mondays and Thursdays, if the House happens to sit on both of those days. But, no, he is too important to come into a democratic institution like a parliament on Tuesdays and Wednesdays! And some weeks the parliament does not sit at all on Mondays. So in those weeks you see him here one day a week. I notice the Prime Minister going around saying, 'Why doesn't the opposition ask me questions about this, that and the other?' How can we ask him questions? He is not here. He is too self-important, too grand and too imperial to bother coming into the parliament. You would think all of you people sitting back there would want the leader of your party to tum up in the parliament occasionally. You, the backbenchers, are all supposed to tum up, and half of the frontbenchers tum up, but you people do not seem to mind.",79

52,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! Those on my right!,80
53,Mr DOWNER,PRIME MINISTER,"It says something about the character of the Labor Party and its commitment to democratic institutions-in other words, the contempt you have for this parliament and the contempt, above all, the Prime Minister has for this parliament and for our democracy that he does not bother to tum up at all. These charges are the most serious imaginable levelled against a Prime Minister of Australia. They are charges levelled by his predecessor, a Labor Prime Minister-a man whom you were all happy to go around and laud to the ceiling a matter of years ago, whom you have all decided now, after all, is a villain of the Labor Party and whom you are going to attack. I seem to recall that the Leader of the House had Mr Hawke make advertisements for him at the time of the last election. Mr Costello--You've dumped Hawke, haven't you?",80
54,Mr DOWNER,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes. Have you dumped Hawke? That is an interesting question. But there was a time when you all thought Hawke was the greatest thing in the world. You would have done anything for Hawke, and now you are all dumping on him. But you know something that Hawke knows-that is, Hawke is telling the truth about this matter. Hawke is telling the truth and the present Prime Minister is scurrying away. Why won'the come in here to the parliament? Because he knows that if he does not tell the truth in this chamber he will be forced to resign. The Prime Minister knows that, even in the Labor Party, whilst that convention is not upheld all the time, if a Prime Minister comes into this parliament and lies to this parliament, that Prime Minister will be forced to resign. The documents show that what the Prime Minister has been saying on the ABC and what, no doubt, the Prime Minister was boasting elsewhere to other media outlets after his interview yesterday on the ABC-I understand he was scurrying around the press gallery selling his tale-is a tale. That is the best you could describe it as. If the Prime Minister is exposed for not telling the truth, he can try to find some excuse to the media. But if the Prime Minister is exposed in this parliament, if he is caught out misleading the parliament, he knows that he will be forced to resign. That is why he will not come into the parliament now to do the decent and honourable thing-that is, to respond to the allegations that have been made by the former Prime Minister and to deal with the documentary evidence that has been presented. The Prime Minister should come in here and respond to those allegations. He should do more than that: he should produce documentary evidence to prove that the assertions he has been making are accurate. The fact is that the Prime Minister is not bigger than the democratic process. He must answer the charges levelled against him, and he must answer those charges with evidence. The Prime Minister is drunk with power. He has a swaggering arrogance. He thinks he can do anything and be accountable to noone. The fact is that he cannot. Prime Ministers are accountable to this chamber and they always will be-and he is. He will not scurry away forever. He should come before this chamber today and answer, with evidence, the allegations that have been levelled against him by his predecessor. I urge support for the motion that the Prime Minister should come before this House and respond to the most serious of allegations and evidence provided by Mr Hawke against him.",80

56,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"I second the motion. At the first press conference of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), after rolling Bob Hawke, he pledged that he would not gild the lily, that he would tell the truth. I ask: has he honoured that pledge? Opposition members-No.",80

Bob Hawke is right when he says that the Prime Minister's credibility has been destroyed. It is totally destroyed, as has been adequately proven by the Leader of the Opposition today. Keating does not deserve to be Prime Minister of Australia. After all, 51 of those opposite voted for him not to be Prime Minister of Australia. He is well-known for rewriting history.",81

64,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"He is well-known, sadly, for regarding Australia as the arse end of the world. He was given not one but two chances to withdraw that, and he declined to do so. The Placido Domingo speech fully revealed his deluded and almost mad view of Australian history-as Hawke calls it, a perversion of history. It is interesting to reflect on what ex-Senator Peter Walsh is on record as having said in describing Keating's self-delusion: I have no doubt that Keating believes his version of history, and that's the tragedy. The Prime Minister, as Peter Walsh has identified, is absolutely into self-delusion. Prime Minister's versions of events, both large and small, can now simply and sadly not be trusted. Bob Hawke has exposed this self-delusion speaking from New Zealand this day in categorical terms and quoting in absolute terms the official minute, which was not written by Bob Hawke or Paul Keating: it was written by an arm's length adviser. The minute states: Keating started arguing that we should not do anything ... It quotes Keating direct: What has the US ever done for us? It continues: And he cited agricultural trade issues. The quote from the official minute goes on to say that Gareth Evans responded, as did the Prime Minister, in terms of the UN, its resolution and its response. Does anyone think that, if there were a counter minute, some other official minute, sitting on the files the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) would have stood up in this House this day and produced that minute in answer to the first question? Does anyone think that if Senator Gareth Evans-after several hours of warning, after looking for all those files and diary notes that he is well known to keep-had found one piece of paper that gave some contradiction to this official minute he would have produced it? In fact, those opposite failed to produce it because there is none. The best they could do was a quote from a Sydney Morning Herald article relating to a speech given much later, as they attempt to rewrite history. Bob Hawke has exposed absolutely the selfdelusion of the Prime Minister. Bob Hawke has quoted the official record which fully reveals the Prime Minister's lack of integrity, lack of credibility. How can a man with such a fundamental flaw in his character ever be trusted with the prime ministership of this country? From this point on, no-one will ever believe the Prime Minister again. No-one in Australia will believe the Prime Ministerwhether he is overseas or here in Australiawhen he is giving assurances on domestic The issues. This is a major problem for the whole nation. We have as our Prime Minister a man who has been exposed fully here today by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill), by the Leader of the Opposition and, above all else, by the former leader of the Labor Party-the man for whom you had such high regard, and still do presumably, the man you voted for in the caucus ballot and the man you now tum turkey on.

66,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"The Prime Minister's lack of credibility is fully exposed-not only by the self-indulgent interviews, the selfdeluding nonsense, but by the absolute way in which Bob Hawke took to the Prime Minister today. The trouble is that we are now led to believe that the Prime Minister's advisers are on holidays and that, suddenly, the bronco from Blaxland has gone berserk. I simply say: that excuse is not good enough. It was the Prime Minister who ordered up the interview with Fran Kelly. It was the Prime Minister who volunteered, who walked that distance from his office to that nice little studio in the ABC quarters, who sat down and then gave the most arrogant, indulgent interview that has ever been put to air. Let me remind you just how indulgent and how arrogant that interview was. It is timely to quote just one sentence from the Prime Minister's first answer to Fran Kelly's first question. Fran had a busy day yesterday. I recall being interviewed by her on another matter-a nonsense agenda. Fran Kelly was still clever enough, late that day, to ask the Prime Minister about the Gulf War. He replied, 'You know, we went into a meeting.' In response to Fran Kelly's first question about Bob Hawke, the Prime Minister said: I did. That is just a straight lie, a straight distortion. There was only two Ministers at the original meeting-this was about whether we committed people to Desert ShieldOne of the most important decisions any government can ever make with regard to its people is a decision to send people to war. It is a matter requiring a very serious resolution of both houses of parliament, a matter which, to its credit, the government of that day brought before both houses of parliament in a special January session. It is not something to be taken lightly. The Prime Minister continued: that was Hawke, Michael Duffy, who was Acting Foreign Minister, and me. Without any notice, I was asked around, and he said I might get a call from the United States: What do you think we'll do? Typically Bob Hawke, he didn't say: Look, I think this is what we should do, now what do you think? The question always is: What do you think we should do? This is the exact quote of Keating which is relevant: You know, will the real leader please tell us what we can do here? How arrogant! What absolutely sickening arrogance from the Prime Minister of the day. I think it is now time that the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) entered into this fray. The member for Holt sits with us today; he is not rostered off today. He is a noble backbencher. He is a person of some integrity. He is a person who should now take the opportunity to respond. We know that the member for Holt was at the meeting. You confirmed that you were at the meeting. You surely have some recollection of that particular meeting. Here we have a person, the member for Holt, in a unique position to give a verdict in relation to these matters, and we will see what he has to say. But whatever he has to say has to be counterbalanced against what Bob Hawke had to say on this matter. Are you saying we should ignore what Bob Hawke had to say? Are you saying we should ignore the advice and the official minute on what Bob Hawke had to say? I say we do not. I accept Bob Hawke's version of events. I accept that Bob Hawke was telling the truth and that the Prime Minister of this nation this day was not telling the truth. He should come into this House and account for that. I know this last fortnight has been difficult for the Prime Minister of this country. Firstly, he went to that magnificent conference in Hobart. He went there saying that the uranium policy is illogical and saying, 'I am the real leader and, when a real leader is required, I will put my head up, I will argue before the delegates and I will sway the conference.' He knew that only a handful of votes would give this country a fair dinkum policy on uranium, give jobs back to the Koongarrra Aboriginals and stop the export of Australian jobs to Canada. What happened? The Prime Minister wimped out. The Prime Minister went for the fudge. The Prime Minister failed to show any degree of leadership, integrity, credibilityMr MCGauran-Old Jellyback.",82
67,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"As the member for Gippsland says, he is Jellyback No.2. Then the Prime Minister decided to move on. He went to Adelaide. What was he doing in Adelaide? He did not have such a good time because he stood up and told mistruths to the women's international conference, had a nice little discussion with Glenda Jackson and then put the knife into the member for Forde (Ms Crawford). He has left the member for Forde hanging on a string, without a seat and with nowhere to go. Worse still, there is a particularly ugly of this conduct with regard to the member for Forde: after that magnificent photo on the front of the Australian, the member for Forde has been got at. She has been told to vanish. She has been told to pull her head in. She has been told on the record by Kaiser, by Ludwig and by perhaps even the Prime Minister himself. It was sad to see that yesterday the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) denied government policy on this issue and came to the dispatch box and stabbed the member for Forde in the back, the front or both. So the Prime Minister went to Adelaide and failed on that score. Finally, what did the Prime Minister do? I advise the House that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) went to the snow. They went skiing at a resort in New South Wales last week. I acknowledge that there were school holidays last week. I acknowledge that prime ministers and ministers are entitled to have holidays with their families in the snow. But no minister for aviation faced with the largest air crash during his period as minister for aviation had the right to stay skiing last week. He was Pontius Pilate on the snow, for which he must forever remain condemned. He should have the courage to come in here and make a ministerial statement today. Has he, or has the CAA, today grounded Seaview Air? Why did that take 10 days when, had he been at his desk for the working days last week, we might have seen some quicker action in relation to that. Who was the minister for aviation at the snow with last week? None other than the Prime Minister. So confident was the Prime Minister about the dimensions of his skiing activities that a heavy confiscated a photo of the Prime Minister taken in a public place. The heavy grabbed the camera and asked for the film to be removed so that there would be no record of the Prime Minister in a public place. In the clear-cut terms of this motion, can we ever take the Prime Minister at his word again? Can we ever believe the Prime Minister's version of history? Can we ever believe any pledge or promise given by this Prime Minister? Can we ever trust this Prime Minside ister again? It is for these reasons that the Prime Minister is deserving of the censure of this House in the strongest possible terms.",83
68,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"-lim always unconsciously, even if not verbally, gets it right. Basically, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) spent about half of his speech discussing everything but the topic of the motion. He then managed to conclude that what we were actually debating was the censure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We are not actually debating the censure of the Prime Minister. This actually happens to be a motion asking the Prime Minister to come into this House and answer questions. Opposition members will have the opportunity, as they well know, to have the Prime Minister in prime ministerial question time tomorrow layout before them, if they are so inclined, his memory of the historical record of three years ago. This urgent matter that requires consideration today and at no other time-not tomorrow when there is an opportunity to question the Prime Minister-is one you have had the opportunity to question the Prime Minister on at about 10 question times. In case you happen to be unaware, the particular suggestions were published in the former Prime Minister's biography, and you have not seen fit to ask the Prime Minister one question about them in the last three months. The Leader of the National Party gets up in here and says, 'There can be no graver decision but a decision to commit the country to war.' I would agree: there can be no graver decision but a decision to commit the country to war. He says, 'There is an overriding and substantial importance in our relationship with the United States.' I agree: there is an overriding and substantial importance in our relationship with the United States. If you happen to take the view that what was alleged by the former Prime Minister to be the attitude of the present Prime Minister is a matter which requires discussion, why in the last three months have you not asked him one question on the subject? The material has been there for you. You have had the opportunity to ask him questions. You come in here with bogus, confected indignation about what the Prime Minister is alleged to have said and done. You have had three months to work yourselves up into this lather. Having had three months to work yourselves up into this lather, you can wait an extra day to ask the question of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was here last Monday. Did he get a question on the memoirs of the former Prime Minister? The Leader of the National Party was arguing, 'If you actually opposed us going into the Gulf War and if you had the view that the United States alliance was not viable or the Americans had not done anything for us, that is a matter that you ought to answer.' If you actually believe that about the Prime Minister",83

72,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Order! With respect to the Leader of the Opposition, who is trying to be heard over the top of his colleagues, when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking the Leader of the House sat there and said not one word.",84
73,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Opposition members interjecting,84
74,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I would hope at least he would give the same respect.,84
75,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I am grateful for your protection in the matter: I appreciate - t i- the sense that order is reqUlred to be maIntaIned in this place, but I really do not need it with this bunch. I am used to this crew. We have been at it with them for the last eight yearsat least I have as Leader of the House-and what we have had from them is the same sort of nonsense as we have here. If you really believed there were serious defence issues at stake, if you really believed the Prime Minister of the country had a view that was different from the relationship that we have enjoyed for a considerable period of time with the United States, you have had, as I said, three months to raise it. That is the substance on which you can draw conclusions. As to whether or not the Prime Minister ought to be here to be questioned, the Pri-e Minister is accountable to the House; he IS accountable to the House in Prime Minister's question time. Since the Prime Minister, al-ng with the rest of the House, has been appeanng here only a couple of days a week as opposed to the previous three or four days, we --ve discovered that until recently the opposition has been prepared to treble the number - f questions it has asked hi.m. Not o-ly h-s It had three months to ask him a question, SInce we have hadMr Downer interjecting",84
76,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"No, these are the arguments you used. I think arguments about whether or not the Prime Minister ought to be here at this moment are totally trivial, I agree with you, but I am obliged to engage in them because you did. I am supposed to reply to you in debate. You regard them as trivial and I regard them as trivial, but I will respond to them because you put them forward and basi.c courtesy requires me to answer those proposItions. Since the Prime Minister has appeared in the House twice a week as opposed to three or four occasions, you have trebled the number of questions that you have managed to ask him. Even though you have trebled the number of questions you have managed to ask the Prime Minister, you have not found one occasion-not one--on which you wished to question the Prime Minister on a matter that you now claim is fundamental to our international policy, fundamental to our defence stand. Not one at all. Mr Thckey-The evidence has just come out.",84
77,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"In so far as 'evidence' is around on this, to respond to the honourable member for O'Connor, all the evidence was there in the book that was published by the former Prime Minister. You ought to do a bit of reading. This has been around, as I said, for a very considerable period of time. It is not an obligation on the Prime Minister to appear whenever you think he ought to appear for a discussion. I would particularly advise the Prime Minister not to bother to appear when this confected indignation is around on a matter on which you could have questioned him on a multiplicity of occasions to this time. The opposition leader gets up here and portrays himself as a man fanatically devoted to the truth and by argument he says the Prime Minister is a man fanatically devoted to telling lies. This is the bloke who managed to be proud of the fact, as was published in the Australian-and he did not contradict itthat he got out of the last leadership ballot, apart from his own, by telling both sides that he voted for them. That is the lowest heel behaviour that just about anybody in the political process could simply contemplate-a totally gutless performance, if ever there was one. Then he managed to go and tell his former leader about two hours before he ran against him, 'Of course, old son, I have got total confidence in you and I will be backing you up.' This is the man who wants us all to believe he is totally equated with the truth, a fanatical devotee of the truth, a man who will always tell the truth whenever he stands on his feet in politics. This man, who is also totally devoted to the truth, manages to find himself featuring on a commercially distributed video by the League of Rights in which he is giving one of his wonderful performances before the league on constitutional matters. He sustained the argument for 24 hours, until it became untenable, that, no, he was not at a League of Rights meeting, he was at a Christian youth group--a Christian youth group which just happens to be run by a whole lot of septuagenarians espousing sentiments which have not been associated with Christianity since time immemorial as far as anyone who has any theological interest is concerned. This is the fanatical devotee of the truth who comes out making statements, as he beats his chest, about where he is headed in policy terms. This is the fanatical devotee of the truth who is opposed to foreign investment--or he wants a shade of grey on the position on foreign investment. We have quoted back the statements that he made about five or six years earlier. Now he says, 'The reason that I made those statements at that point of time, of course, was because I was working for the Chamber of Manufactures.' So he had a set of views then when he was working for the chamber and now he has another set of views. This is a man who is pristine in his devotion to the truth. He wishes us all to be judged by the standards that apply to him. This is the bloke who, I recollect, in the course of the last election campaign debated the goods and services tax with a totally fanatical devotion. He came across to Perth, and I was involved in a debate with him. He was the third most devoted member on the front-bench to the goods and services tax. But, now that he is the leader, he says, 'That was John Hewson's little number; not mine. I actually never really had anything to do with that at all. It was not me; it was old Johnny. I, of course, am a man of a personality which is so much more inclusive.' The opposition leader is a child. As you basically pointed out, Mr Speaker, he was speaking and I was sitting here saying nothing because I wished him to get his argument out as best as he could announce it. Mr Tuckey interjecting",85
78,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The member for O'Connor is certainly not in his right spot.,85
79,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"We now have the opposition leader here rabbiting away at me in the most childish fashion for over the last 15 minutes screaming, 'Liar! Liar! Liar!' as one after another of his untruths are detailed here in parliament. This is the man who goes out and says, 'Look, really, I am a devoted and all-inclusive Liberal Party leader. I am a man in the great traditions of the Liberal Party.' But for 10 years he has been running around nailing the moderates in the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party on every single one of the positions which he now says that he basically embraces and always has. He says, 'Not that I have changed my mind, and not that I have become a better and more loving and caring and kindly human being, but I had one set of views then which were convenient and another set of views now which to my ambition are convenient.' This is the opposition leader who sits around reckoning that he has a right to come into this place and demand the appearance of the Prime Minister at any point of time to question him on the matter of whether or not there is truth and who is telling the truth.",86

82,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"The fact is that any process by which decisions are made involves a whole plethora of possibilities that are discussed, and a whole series of attitudes will from time to time be expressed. A whole set of policy options will be put forward in the course of those discussions. At the end of the day a position is arrived at by the government, and all members of the government devotedly hold to it or, if it is not devotedly held to by all members of the government, resignations will follow. I must say that, at every meeting that I have Duffy, M. J. been involved in, every statement that I have heard made by the Prime Minister is in accordance with the statements that I read out in the course of question time. Mr Costello-Don't you mislead the House.",86
83,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I am even more aware than is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the consequences of lying to the parliament, so I am very cheerful about pointing all that out in that context. The opposition's proposition here, therefore, is a complete nonsense. So in the opinion of those on this side of the House the Prime Minister has absolutely nothing to answer to as far as this debate is concerned. He has absolutely no problem in dealing with this issue. The opposition's position on this is absurdly confected. If you really thought these issues were serious, if you really thought that the country was in the hands of a person who had no fundamental understanding about the importance of our alliance relationships, who had been opposed to participation in the Gulf War and ought to have been supportive of it, you have had three months to deal with it. You have chosen not to. You have chosen not to avail yourselves of the opportunities that have been presented to you in question time to question the Prime Minister because you do not take your position on this seriously.

In answer to the very first question today the Leader of the House quoted from a document. It was a quote from the Prime Minister. I invite the minister to table that document and advise of the date of the Prime Minister's quote.",86

86,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Social Security aware of concerns in the community that some people may be receiving social security benefits that they are not entitled What is the government doing to ensure NOES public confidence in the social security system?,88
87,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is true that, from time to time, one hears claims that large numbers of people are getting social security benefits of one form or another that they should not be. The government has implemented a range of measures to ensure that social security payments are properly targeted to those in need. An independent expert, Professor Weatherley, of Harvard University, reviewed the operation of our system. He published a report in 1993 which concluded: There likely was a compliance problem in the 1970s and early 1980s. PAIRS Guess who was in government then! The report further states: Since the mid-1980s, a series of administrative and policy measures have been implementedwhichhave effectively solved the compliance problem. That is the outcome of an independent expert's review of the operation of our system. We have a system which in a good many respects is at the cutting edge in terms of its effectiveness in combating fraud and compliance problems. We have an array of comprehensive front door measures to ensure that payments are granted correctly, recognising that people's circumstances can change. We had a comprehensive program of reviews conducted, totalling 2.3 million, in the last financial year. A total of 40,000 of those reviews were the result of allegations of incorrect payments by members of the public. All such allegations were followed up. Of the 2.3 million reviews, 7.6 per cent identified overpayments and 1.6 per cent identified underpayments. The net savings from this compliance effort and this review activity totalled $37 million per fortnight, or nearly a billion dollars in the course of the year. These reviews are targeted at potential areas of risk that are identified in various ways so that the proportion of those that produce some variation in payment or eligibility does not to? reflect the general level of non-compliance. The evidence is overwhelming that the great bulk of people receiving social security payments are entitled to them and that those clear. seeking to defraud the system are a tiny minority. What does the opposition say about those sorts of activities? On the one hand, the opposition leader recently talked about the prospect of cuts being made in welfare in unspecified areas. On the other hand, the opposition spokesperson on social security matters seeks time and again, when legislation boards? comes before the House, to ensure that the cost of measures, which in some cases is already substantial, such as the home childtions care allowance, is pushed out further. He knows full well that his leader is committed to making cuts in that area. The hypocrisy it all is quite phenomenal. Yesterday we tabled the annual report of the data matching program, which confirmed that the savings as a result of that program amount to some $80 million in direct per year and about $120 million in indirect savings. We are talking about pretty close $200 million worth of savings arising from the data matching program. What does the opposition, which professes to be concerned about tightening fiscal policy, do? Every time that legislation comes up for consideration, the opposition seeks to pose a sunset clause. The double standards and the hypocrisy of this whole exercise quite phenomenal. This is just another examwhich ple of the fact that the coalition has bility whatsoever when it comes to' talking about tightened fiscal policy. Prime Minister",88
88,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Leader of the House and the Minister for Finance. I refer the minister to the IS-minute speech that he has just made, in which he fused to comment at all on the veracity of respective views of the Prime Minister and refused Mr Hawke on Australia's Gulf ment. Does the minister fully and unequivocally agree with the Prime Minister's view that Mr Hawke's version of this matter is just a straight lie?",89

90,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. What steps is the government taking to ensure that children are protected from exposure to harmful or disturbing material from new sources of information and entertainment, such as computer bulletin",89
91,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members may be aware that last week the Minister for Communicaand the Arts and I released a report of a task force of officers from our two departments which examined the appropriate regulaof tion of computer bulletin boards. Members would be well aware of the recent censorship legislation which has passed the House of Representatives that deals with the classification system for films, videos and, more savings recently, computer games. At the moment, no classification system is to in place for computer bulletin boards. The difficulty of simply applying the current regime to computer bulletin boards is quite obvious. Firstly, access to information on bulletin boards is gained via the telephone network. Regulation of such telephone traffic reimwould raise serious privacy issues. The government clearly-and no doubt the opposiare tion-is not interested in having any laws would unreasonably intrude upon the no crediprivacy of the telephone system. Nonetheless, we have received complaints. Law enforcement agencies at both the state and the federal level have received information about computer bulletin boards being used to traffic a range of offensive materialin some cases criminal material, such as stolen credit card numbers. There is also some reevidence of material which, if produced in the film, video or literature form, would be classification under the current legislaWar committive censorship scheme. The task force recommended a range of options. At one extreme, it recommended that a self-regulatory regime be developed by the operators of bulletin boards to form their own and codes of ethics and, at the other extreme, it recommended the complete application of a censorship regime to bulletin board traffic. I do not think the latter option is realistic in terms of both cost and intrusion upon people's basic rights, particularly the sanctity of the telephone system. However, I am interested, as is the minister, in gaining community comment on the other range of options, such as whether a complaints based system, which currently operates, say, on 0055 numbers, with the involvement of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, could also apply to the boards or some legislative framework which would be based largely on self-regulation by the industry, supported with some legislative back-up to apply that category of material which would otherwise fall foul of our legislative provisions regarding film, video and computer games. These are important issues, especially with the growth of the use of these technologiessmall use now by Australian households, but already Australia is the second greatest user in the world of this technology behind the United States. Obviously, these technologies will become more popular and become a greater issue in more Australian homes. I do urge the industry and those interested in these issues to examine the task force report and to give the government their comments on the appropriate legislative response. Prime Minister",89
92,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer my question again to the Leader of the House and Minister for Finance. 1 remind the minister that Senator Evans, the foreign minister, Senator Robert Ray, the minister for defence, and now he, the Minister for Finance, have all refused to endorse the Prime Minister's version of events leading up to Australia's involvement in the Gulf War. Does that mean that the foreign minister, the defence minister and the finance minister all endorse Mr Hawke's version of events?",90
93,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I made absolutely clear what my view was of matters within my knowledge, and you have had them expressed clearly to you in answer to your first question and during the course of my remarks. Mr MCGauran interjecting",90
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gippsland had better be a bit careful. Medical Records: Access,90
95,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. 1 refer the minister to the decision, handed down this week, of the New South Wales Supreme Court to uphold the right of a private medical practitioner to deny a patient access to her medical records. This decision surprised me, as I am sure it surprised many in the community. 1 would be grateful if the minister would indicate whether or not the government has a response to that decision.",90
96,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Certainly this is a matter that 1 think many in the community are surprised about and would echo the sentiments of Ms Breen. She is quoted in the press as saying that she was incredibly offended and astounded at the decision that she was not able, as a matter of right, to have access to her personal medical records. 1 think, plainly, this brings into question the way in which we should deal with a regime for freedom of information and whether freedom of information legislation should be extended to the private sector. That, of course, in the context of this case, is against a background where 1 do not think anyone would challenge the proposition that medical information would have to be amongst the category of information which you would say to be most personal and most important to know and that any citizen might be concerned about. So, against that framework, we have an odd situation where, if people are patients within the public hospital system of any state, they have a right under freedom of information legislation to access their personal files and information about their medical treatment. But, if they are patients within private hospitals or are seeking treatment from private medical practitioners outside the public health system, they have no such right. The case in which Ms Breen was the plaintiff and which was decided and determined against her in the Supreme Court of New South Wales is a case, of course, where J make no criticism of the judge involved. He was doing no more than, as Dr Cashman, who acted on her behalf, said, confirming what was understood to be the status quo. Nonetheless, there is now, I think, a very lively public question as to whether that status quo ought to remain. To that effect, some while ago I announced the establishment of a review of the Freedom of Information Act, which is now 12 years old. The Freedom of Information Act, as you know, now provides an effective regime for any member of the public who has dealings with the government to access their personal files and information. Complementary legislation exists at a state level. The interesting question is whether or not that legislation should also, in the way in which we evolve that legislation, apply to the private sector. The review will consider, particularly in the areas of medical records or banking information and the like, whether such an entitlement ought be provided. A discussion paper will be published on this very interesting issue towards the end of this week, and we will be looking forward to receiving public submissions. A final report will be published to me and made public at the end of next year. So we have a process that has actually anticipated this problem, is in place already, and will bring to light responses that may enable us to have a different solution to this issue which has obviously bedevilled Ms Breen. I do not think there would be anyone in this House who is not insensitive to Ms Breen's circumstance as a woman who had two breast implants which, unfortunately, were not medical successes and who has now found herself in a circumstance where she has been denied access to her medical files other than through subpoenas issued in pursuit of legal proceedings. These are issues that I think are properly the subject of an issue of public inquiry and I look forward in due course to the report of the Law Reform Commission and the Administrative Review Council. Aviation Safety",90
97,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Now that the CAA has finally acted on Seaview by grounding it, can the minister explain what new breaches of regulations by Seaview Air have occurred to bring this about? Or were the assurances from the chief executive of the CAA on 5 October and again last Monday that Seaview had met flying operations and airworthiness regulatory requirements, along with your own reassurances to the House on Monday, a wilful misleading of the Australian public and the parliament? I ask the minister: why should the people of Australia not believe you have been appallingly complacent to the point of negligence in your responsibilities as Minister for Transport and minister for aviation?",91
98,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This week I received a complaint, following the Seaview accident, here at Parliament House from someone who had travelled on Seaview in June and July of this year. The letter contained the most serious accusations against the company in terms of the safety involved in that flight. Mr Tim Fischer-You received a warning last May.",91
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party!,91
100,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will deal with that in a moment, Mr Speaker, and I will deal with the sequence of events. But let me indicate to the House what has happened this week. That letter was referred to Mr John Pike, the gentleman I appointed on Monday as the head of the bureau, charged with the responsibility for air safety in the Civil Aviation Authority.  lunchtime today that he had decided to withdraw the approval of the Seaview Air chief pilot, which would have the effect of grounding the airline from today. Let me say to the House that the allegations that were made in the complaint to me will be fully investigated  to table them in the House without the permission of the person who wrote to me this week, but I can indicate to the House that a copy of the letter has been made available to the member for Hume in his capacity as the shadow transport minister. I think the fact is  since he undertook his new duties. Mr Tim Fischer-Where were you last week-skiing?",91
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,92
102,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can I take the opportunity of repeating to the House the requests that I made on Monday of this week. Mr Tim Fischer-Monday of this week.,92
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Leader of the National Party.,92
104,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is that anyone with any information about unsafe practice in any airline in Australia should come forward with that information. I called for it on day and I repeat that call today. There are four avenues for those complaints: firstly, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation; secondly,  air safety regulation; thirdly, the House of Representatives select committee into air safety-the one that I commissioned-with the task of investigating air safety and chaired by the honourable member for Shortland. Let me tum my attention to the interjection from honourable members in connection with my absence early last week. Let me say in respect of that-because it has been raised both now and in the motion-that the Seaview Air crash occurred on Sunday, 2 October. On the day it occurred I was travelling with my two sons to the snow. I was spending three days with them, and I make no apologies for that. I make no apologies whatsoever-having spent the previous week, the first week of the school holidays, at the ALP National Conference in Hobart-and nor should I.",92

106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is entitled to be heard in silence.,92
107,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me advise the House that I spoke to my staff on several occasions during Sunday afternoon. I was on leave until Wednesday, 5 October but the fact is I was in contact with my staff on the Monday, on the Tuesday and on the Wednesday in a number of different conversations. It needs to be borne in mind that during this period the search for this aircraft was still under way. That search was not curtailed until Wednesday night and, indeed, on Thursday it was renewed and continued on a partial basis. On Thursday of last week I was at my desk in Sydney. I was briefed by officers of the Department of Transport in respect of the Seaview crash, but I was advised through my staff of the circumstances of the search on Sunday, on Monday, on Tuesday and on Wednesday in a number of separate conversations. On Friday I was ill and did not attend the cabinet meeting in Adelaide, but I did see the article in the Sydney Morning Herald. I asked for the letter that was referred to in that article and the relevant papers associated with Mon- CAA's surveillance of Seaview Air to be provided to me. The CAA provided those documents to me on Sunday afternoon. Immediately after reading the documents, I called Mr Roser, the CEO of the CAA, to organise a meeting with the acting Chairman of the CAA, Mr Ingersoll, and me. That meeting was held in my office on Monday morning. There is certainly nothing to apologise for about the sequence of events.",92
108,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Make a statement, Laurie.",92
109,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a pretty serious matter, so just listen. It is pretty unfortunate that the opposition is here today seeking to politicise this issue-that is what you are doing; you are seeking to politicise it-when you well know that the government responded, and responded speedily, to all of the problems with the CAA at every point this year, including the matters raised by the honourable member for Hume in this parliament",92
110,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How? When? What did you do? Give us the dates.,92
111,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mitchell asked me,92
112,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Table the documents.,92
113,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will have great pleasure in both answering him and tabling the documents. I said in parliament this Monday that Mr Sharp's speech on 4 May to this House, one of great concern and which raised the question of Seaview Air, was sent by my office to the CAA for investigation. Indeed, Mr Sharp himself yesterday morning acknowledged that on the Alan Jones radio program in Sydney. He said: Laurie Brereton responded to that speech that I made in parliament the following time and said that he would take note of the comments I made in the parliament the day before and that he would do something. Which, Mr Sharp said, is what was done. Mr Sharp claimed in that speech on 4 May that a company called Western Airlines was still flying when, in fact, it had cease- to h-ve any operations after June 1993. Havmg Said that, as a result of my referral of his allegation Mr Sharp received a letter from the Civil Aviation Authority on 5 May 1994 asking him to provide more information about his seri?-s allegations. I table that letter from the ClVlI Aviation Authority to Mr Sharp. It took one month and one day for Mr Sharp to respond but he did so on 6 June in a letter in which he declined to provide his information to the Civil Aviation Authority. He instead indicated his preference to raise these matters in the context of a parliamentary inquiry, an inquiry which I announced immediately after the BASI report into Monarch and which the member for Hume welcomed in a press release dated 20 July. I table for information of members both Mr Sharp's response 31 days later and his press release congratulating me. But that is not the end of it. On 17 June Mr Sharp received a further letter from the chief executive of the CAA indicating to him that if confidentiality was an issue-and he raised that in his response that he sent earlier in month to the first contact with him-and if that was his concern in refusing to detail his allegations to the CAA, then he could avail himself of the CAIR system, the system instituted by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation which allows BASI to pass on details of allegations for investigation without revealing sources. I table the letter from the CAA to Mr Sharp on 17 June 1994. Mr Downer-What were you doing all this time?",92
114,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All this is coming from my reference to the CAA. You do not like this because you do not like the truth about it. Mr Costello-Why didn't you make Sharp the head of air safety?,93
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will day in question come to order!,93
116,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 4 July Mr Sharp again wrote to the Civil Aviation Authority declining to use the CAIR system, preferring instead to use the parliamentary option, and I now table that letter. The parliamentary inquiry was established on 20 July this year as part of the government's comprehensive response to the BASI report on the Monarch accident, a report which revealed systemic failures in the CAA-all of which the government is addressing. Mr Downer-You never spoke on it.",93
117,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to the point you are making in just a moment. Not only was that response welcomed by Mr Sharp in his 20 July press release, but he also called upon me in my Sydney office on 21 July to personally welcome the government's approach. He visited me in my office. Contrary to the newspaper report, he did not go into any detail of specific allegations about the CAA. While I was delighted with his the bipartisan approach, I took notes of that conversation which I dictated to my secretary on 25 July. These were recorded as a file note, which I table along with a print-out of the time the document was saved in the Department of Transport's system. At the time of the tragic Seaview incident, there is ample evidence from the papers I have tabled in the parliament today that Mr that Sharp had detailed the evidence he had about Seaview to neither me nor the Civil Aviation Authority. I invited him to bring his information forward. As a matter of fact, in that file memo note, if you read it, you will find that I urged him to bring his informationMr Costello-So it's all John Sharp's fault, is it?",93
118,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I urged him to bring any information he had to the office. You do not like this, do you? The fact is that we had at that point mere allegations made under parliamentary privilege without any detailed backup. Let me say to the House that it is not always enough, without the support of some evidence, to have actioned the sorts of proceedings which have subsequently, this week, been taken against Seaview Air. Last weekend, when it became clear to me that the Civil Aviation Authority agent dealing with this, Mr Macionis, was not across the history of this airline's problems, I moved quickly. Indeed, I might say, the first person to congratulate me in a press release was the member for Hume, who thought that it was entirely appropriate that Mr Macionis be replaced. Let me complete my answer by saying that when hard evidence on the airline continuing to show a disregard for safety came to my office this week by way of the letter from a Seaview passenger, it was quickly referred to the new head of the CAA safety division and action has now been taken. At every point this year, when a question has been raised about Seaview or anything else, there has been prompt and immediate action. All I have ever sought was hard evidence to back that up. While I have welcomed the degree of bipartisanship to date in the support from the member for Hume, let me say it is certainly not evident in the blatant politicking that has been indulged in by the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party. These gentlemen know that the government has taken these allegationsMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is rare that I take this of order, but I find that comment of the minister grossly offensive. I have done none other than properly pursue the aviation safety matters. I ask that it be withdrawn.",93
119,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Coming from a man who referred to me as Pontius Pilate earlier this afternoon, that takes some hide. Mr MCGauran interjecting",94
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have already had the opportunity to talk to the member for Gippsland. He is starting to go a bit over the top. The Leader of the National Party has raised a point of order in which he has said that he has found the words used by the minister offensive on this occasion. During the course of the debate that terminology has been used on a number of occasions. Certainly to my knowledge, while I have occupied the chair, I do not think anybody has raised it as offensive. However, the Leader of the National Party has. It might assist the chair if the minister would withdraw the comment and draw his answer to a close.",94
121,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I will. The fact is that the opposition has had every chance this year to put forward any hard evidence in its possession. It has been the opposition that has chosen to instead use the parliamentary inquiry that I ordered. That is your choice. You live with it. For my part I hope that this inquiry will give anyone with any evidence the opportunity of coming forward. I hope that we can see, in the interests of improving aircraft safety in this country-a huge and tremendous challenge-a common purpose across both sides of politics, rather than the sort of politicking we have seen on this issue in this House this week. I will continue to treat these issues with absolute seriousness. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, in line with the bipartisanship referred to by the minister, I seek leave to table a statement by the member for Hume on the very aspects that the minister tabled papers on. Leave granted. Home Building",94
122,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed point to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. The minister will recall her answer to a question without notice on 22 September this year concerning consumer problems with home building. Has the minister subsequently seen reports of criticisms of her remarks by Ms Jan Wade, the Victorian Minister for Fair Trading, who says that Victoria is well advanced in a review of home building issues? In light of Ms Wade's reaction, can the minister advise whether or not there is still room for concern about the standard and effectiveness of the system in Victoria to protect consumers in relation to home building?",94
123,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the Victorian Minister for Fair Trading is actually complaining about her own colleagues and their criticism of what is happening in Victoria in forestry research centre in Indonesia; and one which is particularly close to my heart, ICLARM, the International Centre Aquatic Resources Management headed by Dr Meryl Williams. Dr Williams was formerly the head of AIMS, the Australian Institute of Marine Science. She is a very capable woman in a field which I predict will be ever more important as the land which is available for agriculture becomes more marginal snow. and more difficult to bring into production. A defining feature of our aid program is that we try to use our areas where we have comparative advantage as components aid program, and that goes in spades for international agricultural research. I might release. also point out-it is nice that I have the attention of the Leader of the National Party, who was present at the launch of Derek Tribe's book-that international agricultural research generates benefits in developing countries. As a result of that growth, there substantial benefits for Australia in having access in direct ways to the technologies which are developed. For example, it is estimated that with the wheat varieties develanything. oped by CIMMYT, to which I referred earlier, we get 150 times our annual contribution to that each year in returns to our own wheat farmers. It is a very good example of how, through the aid program, we do well for ourselves by doing good to others. I thank the member, whose interest in aid is well known, for this very timely question. Aviation: Safety",94
124,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. When did the minister become aware that during a ramp check last weekend of two Seaview planes carrying a party of 21 people it was noted by the inspecting officers that the maintenance releases of the planes were about to expire; that the planes could not return to base in time for the required maintenance action for renewal; that there were 16 deficiencies found, some involving non-compliance with aviation directives; and that the CAA had then issued a 'permit to fly' under civil aviation regulation 134, which enables planes to return to base for maintenance? Can the minister explain why the CAA engaged in practices that were putting travelling passengers at risk as late as for Living 10 October, two days ago?",96
125,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member asserts that the Civil Aviation Authority allowed an aircraft to fly in an unsafe conditionMr MCGauran-No, unacceptable.",96
126,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A thin cover of powder,96
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question was asked. The minister can answer.,96
128,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the implication a was that the CAA allowed the aircraft to fly of our in an unsafe condition. Mr Tim Fischer-Beyond its maintenance,96
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party has already been warned.  on Monday in a decision that was criticised are by those sitting opposite to tackle these very issues. I have no detailed knowledge of the matters raised by the honourable member. Mr Downer-You don't seem to know,96
130,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sooner or later the opposition will need to wake up to the fact that we are dealing now with a very technical area, and we are dealing with a statutory authority with statutory responsibilities. I will appoint people that I have confidence into carry out that function. The task is now Mr Pike's and he has already acted today. I will be more than pleased to take up with him the details of the matter raised by the honourable member and report to him and the House. Interest Rates",96
131,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a dorothy dixer, which I am sure the minister can hit for a sixer. My question is directed to the acting Treasurer. I ask Brother Beazley: is he aware of reports that Australia",96
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Kalgoorlie might be a bit careful in his flippancy.,96
133,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer: is he aware of reports that Australia has the highest interest rates in the OECD? Can the acting Treasurer tell us the truth of this matter?,96
134,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thanks, comrade, for 19.7 your question. It is much appreciated. Yes, I am aware of the fact that somebody culating untruths on this matter. Indeed, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is fetish of it. Mr Costello-Never!",97
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What a surprise! Last night on the Jon Harker program he said that interest rates in Australia are at the highest rate in the OECD. I thought that was worth bit of a check. We have had a look at Economist to see whether or not it had any veracity. It did not list the rates for everybody in the OECD, but it did list the rates for 15 of them. The three-month rate in AustraliaMr Costello-No, the prime rate. Read out the prime rate.",97
136,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The three-month rate, which is the one most relevant to the housing mortgage rates, since you are making that proposition, is in Australia 6.3 per cent. Let me read the rates that are put down here: 6.4 per cent in Denmark, 8.8 per cent in Italy, 7.8 per cent in Spain and 7.9 per cent in Sweden. Three of the other members of the OECD which are not placed on that list are higher as well. I could also add, since the shadow Treasurer is constantly chatting to us about New Zealand rates, that New Zealand's rate is 7.9 per cent. The shadow Treasurer always mentions this in the context of mortgage rates. But Australia is not in the position in which he states it is. It is nowhere near the proposition that he puts forward. He is, as usual, completely wrong. He is only exceeded in his inaccuracy in this matter by his ignorance. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I ask that the Economist table that he has been referring to be tabled, including the prime bank rate which shows the point exactly. Please don't try to hit your own wicket.",97
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. The minister is tabling what has been required.,97
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because it is so useful, I could add to that list-it is occasionally raised that we do not have the OECD as our journed. only competitor in this regard-South Korea, 14.5 per cent; Taiwan, 7.5 per cent; Greece, per cent; Portugal, 10.3 per cent; Thailand, 9.2 per cent; Indonesia, 14.75 per cent, is cirand I will table that as well.

145,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (5.00 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of a new laboratory complex for CSIRO Division of Food Science and Technology, Werribee, Victoria. The proposal to relocate the Victorian based activities of the Division of Food Science and Technology to the Werribee technology precinct is part of a program of integrating food research activities in Victoria. The new Relafacilities will be constructed in an area immediately adjacent to those of the Australian Food Research Institute at Werribee. The CSIRO Division of Food Science and Technology at the institute undertakes complementary research work for the food industry, especially the dairy industry. The collocation of these key research and development organisations will impact positively on the food industry in a most costeffective manner, will greatly enhance research collaboration and will permit significant rationalisation and sharing of accommodation, resources and processing equipment. The proposal is fully supported by the government of Victoria and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation. The work will involve construction of research laboratories, a pilot process bay, administration, support and amenity facilities, an auditorium, associated site works and services, car parks and landscape works. It is anticipated that the construction will cost an estimated $10.1 million and will be completed in late 1996. I table the attached drawings and commend the motion to the House.

I note that Ms Van Der Meer's contribution in regards to an analysis of different situations in countries around the world on the matter of citizenship was a major background material for the inquiry. The inquiry dealt with a variety of issues. A focus will certainly be on the year 1999from the committee's point of view, at least; I hope that the minister will agree-as the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship. The committee has put forward a variety of propositions that should, in reality, receive emphasis in that year. There should be a year dedicated to Australian citizenship. There should be a national citizenship week to increase national interest in the matter; should be national awards; and there should be a very broad effort in regards to education on citizenship. We have had submissions during the inquiry from the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, from the Parliamentary Education Office and from many other sources indicating that there can be a major effort in this field. One of the crucial issues the committee dealt with was dual citizenship. I must confess that my views on the matter changed in the course of the inquiry. I originally had a view that this issue should not be basically dictated by commercial changes around the world. I was not especially persuaded that a few individuals might not be able to advance their careers within multinational corporations because we did not allow dual citizenship. However, in the course of the inquiry I think that there was substantial evidence for a change. The current situation is that section 17 of the Citizenship Act states that persons will lose citizenship if they carry out any act or thing the sole or dominant purpose of which and the effect of which is to renounce Australian citizenship. One of the major reasons committee members came to the conclusion that there had to be change was when they faced the reality of the degree of discrimination this involves-that if a person takes out our citizenship and the country of their existing citizenship permits it then, in reality, we allow them to have dual citizenship. So in reality we have those people born here for practical purposes being second-class citizens. This is a matter of importance. There are now, apparently, in the area of three million Australians-at least as early as 1986, and they have probably grown since-who do have citizenship with other countries. This matter has been largely controlled by the Hague convention since after the First World War. It substantially involves a different world, where people were not that able to move around, to change residence, et cetera. It substantially directed itself to the problems that arose from dual citizenship: people being compelled to do military service for their former country of residence or birth, passports there being seized by other countries and the problem of enforcing personal injury claims and property claims in another country. Along the road there was a variety of bilateral agreements to try to overcome these various problems. As well as facing up to this clear area of discrimination against part of our population, I think subclause 6.30 drove home another reality when it said: In Europe, there is considerable momentum for change in citizenship law as membership of the European Union prompts countries to re-evaluate their citizenship law. What they are getting to is the fact that internationally the majority of countries taking one position or the other is swiftly changing. In the last year or so Italy, the Netherlands and France are among those that have made substantial moves towards dual citizenship. We did not immediately abandon the point that the DIEA made to the inquiry that Australian thought on this matter was largely predicated on 'a detraction from the ideals of a single citizenship for all Australians'. It is said that citizenship status should not be treated as a commodity which is sought for purely economic reasons or the convergence of travel arrangements, employment opportunities and tax advantage. Certainly the committee considered those facts but, as stated in paragraph 6.89 of the report, in seeking what 'best serves the needs of the contemporary Australian society' it concludes that the current provisions are 'outmoded and discriminatory' . The committee also noted importantly in paragraph 6.92 that there is no evidence to suggest that persons who possess dual citizenship-and there are significant numbers now-are disloyal or lack a commitment to Australia simply because they have chosen not to relinquish their former ties and heritage. We also considered the administrative burden on embassies and consulates, the nature of Australia as a country changing in recent decades, with a greater emphasis on tolerance and diversity, and, as noted earlier, the question of employment and business opportunities. So the committee has recommended that Australia does move towards allowing dual citizenship for all people, not just for those who happen to have been born overseas. That is in line with a trend internationally and a reality that Australia must face. Another matter the committee dealt with was the question of the power of the minister to revoke citizenship. Currently section 21 requires that someone actually be convicted under section 50 of the Citizenship Act in regard to fraudulent conduct leading to the gaining of citizenship if they knowingly made a false or misleading representation or concealed material circumstances when applying for citizenship or, if after applying, they were convicted of a sentence leading to death or 12 months imprisonment or, finally, if it is contrary to the public interest. The committee-which includes, I should note, a number of people who have substantial involvement and a deep interest in migration matters, not only from the evidence given to the committee but from their own experience in the electorate-has become concerned that if we allow people basically to obtain permanent residence by fraudulent conduct then that should be tackled; it should not just be a matter of the minister and the government only being able to act where the fraud involves the later event of citizenship. As well as that, the committee has recommended that it not in future be requisite that an actual conviction be obtained. It will be noted that since 1949 under the current provisions only five people have suffered from the provisions of this act. In my own mind this is a significant opportunity for the government. You get these claims every day of the week in your office, particularly in regard to spouse applications. There are suggestions that the committee does not quite go this far but I think there is a fair ambit there for more action by the government. The views of the committee were summarised in paragraph 4.183: The Committee rejects this view ... once persons acquire citizenship, it should be beyond the power of the state to take that citizenship away... it is appropriate for the Minister to have the power to revoke . .. if it is discovered that the person obtained the citizenship by deceit or fraud, or if a crime committed ... is of such magnitude that it would have resulted in the refusal .. . of the application. I note in passing that we are not Robinson Crusoe on this suggestion; Canada, New Zealand and the United States have similar provisions. So this is in substance saying that the actual stage of seeking permanent residence can be reviewed towards revocation of citizenship and that the conviction itself should not be necessary. At the same time the committee reiterated a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There are a few other matters. Recommendation 50 concerns the attendance of officers of the Australian Electoral Office at citizenship functions. We have had claims that this has been basically abandoned because there is too much overtime involved in the process, some of these ceremonies being on weekends and at night. The committee had a view that it is far more important that people who have become citizens of this country have the opportunity to exercise their right to be on the electoral rolls of this country and to vote. Evidence was produced that the current process where people can apply for enrolment at the same time they apply for citizenship is being undermined by the inaction and negligence of a number of councils around Australia taking up to five months to notify the Australian Electoral office that particular individuals have become citizens of Australia. An instance was given where in a few days in Queensland thousands of people had to be notified within a week, from recollection, to get on the rolls because of this failure. So what we are effectively saying is that we would like to see the rights of these individuals and their opportunity to participate have a bit more weight than a bit more overtime in the AEC. I think we know from a variety of television documentaries the plight of the British child migrants who were brought to Australia after 1945. There have been estimates that there are as many as 10,000. Whilst their representatives ltave put forward a view that they should automatically be given citizenship, the committee did not agree with that aspect, noting that some individuals might not particularly want to become citizens. I think we should note that a very high proportion of British have not chosen to take up this option anyway. Equally, some people might thereby receive citizenship who on other grounds are unqualified. As I say, we did not agree with that, but the committee has recommended that their charges be waived in regard to applications. In the defence forces, there is currently a concession in regard to the requirements of residence. The committee has recommended that that be extended to the people in the reserves who have served full time for three months. Another matter is the question of the standard of English required of successful citizenship applicants. Currently, for some unknown reason, there is a distinction between those people who have to have a requirement of English and those who have to have a knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. In the latter case, minister can waive the discretion if people are over 65 years of age; in the former case, when people are as young as 50 years of age. Ii The committee has recommended that in future the limit should be set at 60 years of age for all people. As I say, there are a variety of recommendations in relation to citizenship applications, such as residence revocation. As well as that, the committee very strongly indicates that it would like to see a greater priority put by the government and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on the importance of citizenship. It has advocated that moneys be devoted to local government authorities to ensure that citizenship ceremonies are improved and that we attempt to get some indications of best practice. I think that all politicians know from their experience in going to these ceremonies that, even within a kilometre, two different councils can have very diverse practices. Some of these ceremonies really do not do much to inspire the new citizen as to the importance of the function. As I say, in this report there is advocacy of more oversight by the department, more interest by the department and more liaison with the local government authorities to try to bring in standards and to actually get a minimum list of requirements in regard to issues such as who can attend ceremonies and who can speak at them. Finally, as I said earlier, there is the question of trying to increase education in this area. I think we all know that in the school system there can be some controversy about the nature of what is taught, and there is the possibility of some bipartisanship in the way the matter could be put. But, fundamentally, the committee worked very well to reach an agreement that the government should beef up its act in this area as well. I commend the report.",99
148,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave - I believe that the report entitled Australians all, enhancing Australian citizenship, which has been prepared by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, will make a contribution towards the greater recognition of the meaning of citizenship. In this day and age, the many seek citizenship not for what they can do for the country but, to adapt that phrase of Kennedy, for what the country and, in particular, citizenship can do for them. Some see citizenship more as a vehicle to attain privileged access into Australia than as a means of contributing towards the good government and proper well-being of the citizenry as a whole. Many people do not see the responsibilities that flow from citizenship-be it in terms of voting or participation in the civil service, the army or in other areas where citizenship is a prerequisite-as being particularly consequential. This report has really set down what we see as the minimal parameters which need to be addressed by the government to enhance the value of citizenship itself. Commendation should go to the chairman and the members of the committee, but credit must also go to, in particular, the secretary of the committee, Andres Lomp, our legal adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin, Mr Stephen Boyd and others who have helped us, including the secretariat. They really have done a great deal of the work. I want first to say, however, that my concerns in the reference began with a comment by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). As noted in chapter one of the report, the minister advised the committee that: ... the Government considers that the core criteria in relation to acquisition of citizenship by birth of the Act) and descent (ssIOB, IOC and 11 of the Act), and the core criteria in relation to grant of citizenship (s13(1) of the Act) and the new pledge, are appropriate and not in the significant amendment. Those were matters, therefore, that were not dealt with by the report. I must admit that, as the report notes, only limited evidence on the criteria for the grant of citizenship was received and that evidence did not allow for detailed investigation. I am not one who believes that the present processes of the granting of citizenship, the pledge and the general surrounds in the conferring of citizenship are adequate. I think it is important that, along with the enhanced status that this committee report suggests, there be an opportunity for people to understand the virtue and merit of having an enhanced stature beyond that which I believe is given at that moment. I do not think that the present oath or pledge is sufficient. Indeed, as one who feels quite strongly about proper process, I do not think that the pledge deals in proper process. Whatever might happen in the future, I think it is important that we recognise the constitution as it is and our rights and responsibilities within that constitution. I very much regret and, indeed, condemn those who have changed that process in what I see as a means rather to pursue political objectives than to make citizenship worthwhile. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), whose speech preceded mine, said many of the things that I think need to be identified within the content of the report, but a few matters are worth commenting on. Prior to the close of his remarks, the honourable member referred to the extent the differing ages attract a dispensation for those who lack knowledge of the English language and those who do not have an understanding of the rights, responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. To my mind, in order to justify their being able to meet their obligations as citizens, it is necessary that people know a sufficient amount of English. I am pleased to see that that is retained because I believe it is very important that there be an understanding of the way in which the nature of our society (s 10 is essentially preserved around the basis of our all being able to communicate with each other. Of course, there is reason for those who come by virtue of a program of family reunion after they have perhaps reached the age of 60 to have that requirement dispensed with, but I do not believe that that should pertain to younger people. If we are going to retain the capacity that has really given Australia a unique characteristic, a lingua franca is absolutely essential, for that relates very much to what citizenship is all about. To those who perhaps have not thought about the meaning of citizenship-whether it relates to being naturally born or naturalised by the pledge or oath that is a requirement of the conferring ceremony-I commend the reading of chapter 2 of the report, which begins on page 9. It describes something of the background of the status other civilisations once attributed to the term 'citizenship'. The concept derives from the classical Greek and Roman worlds. They were entirely different from ours, yet in those societies it was important that people understood that citizens were, as Aristotle described them, 'all who share in the civic life of ruling and being ruled in tum'; in other words, people who receive a unique responsibility in society. We have tried to identify the fact that citizenship is not just a vehicle to attain a passport; it far more than that. Given the background of this issue, the fact that only recently has the concept of citizenship been revived and the fact that, in a society like ours, so many come from other communities to adapt to our way of life, it is even more important that these people should have a capacity to recognise the virtues and values of being Australian. For those of us who were born here, it is equally important that we too, as citizens, should not just take for granted the opportunities, the privileges and the rights that flow from that status being conferred on us. The committee report has accordingly made a number of recommendations with respect to enhancing the stature of citizenship. As the honourable gentleman who preceded me, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), suggested, the conferring ceremony is one which often leads to a financial burden on councils. The differences between local government bodies is often quite distinct, so we have suggested that there be a review of the core criteria for the granting of citizenship and that there be a profile developed aimed at trying to ensure some idea of the rights and responsibilities that flow. We have also suggested that we should try to help local government financially to ensure that the citizenship ceremony is one which ensures that the people who acquire citizenship are given public acclaim and that the ceremony itself allows for public recognition of the importance of the decision being taken by those people. We have looked at the extent to which there can be a revocation of citizenship. It is proper that there should be that opportunity to revoke citizenship where persons knowingly commit fraud in relation to their citizenship applications and also where such fraud is committed in order to obtain permanent residence in Australia. Again, that is part of giving to citizenship the proper stature and status that should flow through to it. It is important that there is a recognition that if citizenship is acquired by fraud in any way there should be no permanency about the citizenship so given. It is also important that, where citizenship interviews are being conducted by postal offiis cers, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ensure that those officers are of appropriate seniority-that is, postal managers - and that they are trained adequately in requirements for the granting of citizenship and the process for interviewing citizenship applicants. I do not think the matter of citizenship should in any way be dealt with at any stage of the process in a perfunctory fashion. Another of the recommendations that the government, I trust, will pick up-it is certainly one that I strongly endorse-is that Australian passports incorporate a statement that the bearer of the passport is an Australian citizen. I believe that to be a matter of some significance. It is one that I think is important in the context of trying to identify the fact that a person is an Australian citizen. It is something that should apply. Finally, the most important part of the recommendations of the committee in a political sense is that relating to dual citizenship. This is a matter on which numbers of us have been engaged in a soul-searching process over the years. There is no doubt that a number of fairly prominent former Australians no longer enjoy Australian citizenship because they have sought the citizenship of another country and in so doing have relinquished the citizenship of their country of origin. I do not like the idea of a person being able to give equal allegiance to two societies-at heart, I confess that I would prefer that there be only one citizenship-but I recognise the reality that many in this country who now hold Australian citizenship are bound by their country of origin to a system where they have dual citizenship. We are in the rather strange situation of having citizens from many countries who regard the fact that they also have Australian citizenship as irrelevant and they retain their other allegiance. As has been mentioned, the whole problem is complicated by the extent to which so many Australians are in the position of having originally had British citizenship and being British subjects, or being Irish citizens and being British subjects or coming from New Zealand. They are in a different position. It is that group of people who, obviously, have found it difficult in recent times to accept that Australian citizenship now is a prerequisite in many ways. They have not acquired that citizenship and that is to be regretted. I think they, too, have British passports and many still travel on them. We have sought to recognise some of those anomalies. Hence we have recommended that Australian citizens in future be allowed to acquire dual citizenship. That will mean that any former Australian citizen who has lost Australian citizenship will have the unqualified right to apply for the resumption of Australian citizenship. There are many other aspects of the report which are commendable. It is a report which does help to enhance the nature and character of Australian citizenship. It is a report which should help the public understand-the native born, those who seek to acquire Australian citizenship and those who have been resident here for many years without acquiring Australian citizenship-that there is an important role they can play. Now that my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has arrived it is possible for me to conclude. I know that he, too, wishes to comment on the report to which he has contributed a great deal. It is a very important report. It is one which I commend in its entirety to the government. I believe and trust that the government will accept each of the recommendations in full.",102
149,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"by leaveThis matter is of particular interest to me. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, interestingly enough, refers to the way in which this particular inquiry was initiated. The view that was formed by the government when it looked at the issue of the oath and affirmation of allegiance particularly was that there ought to be a wider debate on citizenship and the need for a fundamental review. I first called for a fundamental review of citizenship in 1992. In this context the report is a response to the political dimension that citizenship had largely lost its importance. It was seen in a context of people being able to obtain certain immediate benefits but not necessarily in terms of the wider issues of obligations. As a result of the view that had been formed that we have a constitution that sets out certain basic structural arrangements for government in Australia and certain rights that people achieve, we have certain legislation that sets out people's rights and responsibilities. The national agenda for a multicultural Australia developed views about the extent to which people ought to have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, its interests and future, the acceptance of the basic structures and principles of our society, and a recognition that citizenship imposes obligations as well as confers rights. The right to express one's own culture and belief involves a reciprocal responsibility to accept the rights of others to express their views and values and, within carefully defined limits, to have the right to express their individual cultural heritage. All Australians have the right to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of the barriers of race, ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender and place of birth as well as the opportunity to maintain, develop and utilise effectively skills and talents that all Australians have regardless of background. These elements of the national agenda for a multicultural Australia, which I have just summed up, seem to me to embody what it is to be Australian. This report talks about citizenship in the modem world, enhancing Australian citizenship and the adjustment to Australian citizenship law in order to have a better understanding of a number of issues that relate to how you acquire and can possibly lose and reacquire citizenship. The report deals with a number of matters of that sort. Because of the terms of reference, the committee has not addressed a number of issues relating to the length of time people must be here before they obtain citizenship. It has not addressed the issue of the requirements of English language competency. The committee recognises that there ought to be a reconsideration of these issues, but because the government had determined in its terms of reference that they should not be the subject of review in this report the committee simply flagged that these are matters that do need further reconsideration. We have dealt with issues relating to citizenship processing and passports. I do want to spend a great deal of that, except to say that there are important recommendations about the way in which citizenship ceremonies are conducted and the responsibilities of local authorities which confer citizenship by delegation. Some local authorities see in those citizenship ceremonies almost a personal fiefdom, a proprietorial ownership, which enables them to decide shall be able to come and not come and who should be able to speak. We have offered some views on that which I think are helpful to the government. The point that I want to draw people's attention to is dual citizenship. I think it is the reviews first time, since the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee looked at the matter almost a decade ago, that this has been the subject of a comprehensive review. As an Australian, I, like many others, would like to think that Australian citizenship was somea thing that you held and did not give away lightly-something that was meaningful-but we have a situation where a very large proin portion of our community is now dual nationsome as. That dual nationality cannot be taken away from them. The determination of dual nationality arises because, after they have become Australian citizens, another country says, 'We will not relinquish their right to be that way. citizens of our country.' There is a framework of international law where, for instance, citizen of the United States migrates to Ausof tralia and takes out Australian citizenship does not lose United States citizenship. The report outlines the practice on that. That situation applies to many other countries. If distinguished Australians such as Rupert Murdoch go overseas and take out American citizenship, under our law they forfeit that citizenship. I am not in the business of defending Rupert Murdoch or his business interests, but I looked at a number of submissions that we received from individuals, one of which was from a lady that I know very well who is living with her children in France. She sets out not only her emotional attachment to Australia but also why it may be necessary for her and her family to take out French citizenship. The consequences for not her and her children as Australians if they time on any of have to do that areMr Lindsay-Dramatic.",105
150,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"Quite dramatic. I ask myself: why do we put the onus on our citizens to have to weigh up those matters so closely? It may be that it is necessary for her to enrol her kids in school in France, where who she happens to be for business purposes. There might be a whole range of reasons for them to take out French citizenship, yet there is a forfeiture of this long standing connection with Australia. In her case, her family had been Australians for three or four generations. Interestingly, if we go through the previous of dual nationality, we find that the arguments were predicated upon a fear that many Australians from places like the Baltic states, Greece and other European countries thought there was a potential for conscription if they remained citizens of those countries or concern that a totalitarian regime may have some continuing hold on them. That prompted people to say, 'If they have dual nationality Australia, that might compromise them in way if they were travelling internationally.' So the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee developed this very narrow view based on representations of a particular character at the time. I think it has to be seen The weight of evidence in this inquiry was a overwhelmingly in favour of changing the law dual citizenship: that is, Australians going but offshore taking out citizenship of another country should not automatically forfeit their Australian citizenship. Honourable members will probably gather from this discussion that I came to a view on this matter in the context of this report that one ought to speak throu'gh the committee report to the government and say, 'We have reached a time when the issue of dual citizenship can be addressed again.' Section 17 of the Citizenship Act, which requires people to give up their citizenship, is something that can be amended. I see this part of the report as being the most important. It recommends a fundamental change in approach, but I want the government to know that a bipartisan approach was adopted on this matter. I think it is an area in which the government ought to move quickly. It will be doing so in an environment in which Australians generally will welcome such a change. I commend the report to the House. I take this opportunity of again thanking committee clerk, who I notice is with his colleague in the advisers box. I particularly thank our specialist adviser, Dr Cronin. I also thank the young interns from the Australian National University. Mr Ronaldson-It was a good program.",106
151,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,I hear my colleague saying that it was a good program. It is another case where Miss Rosemary Van Der Meer was able to give the committee a great deal of very valuable assistance in reviewing the citizenship requirements around the world. I for one appreciate the role of the university and the internship program. I see it as being very beneficial. HUMAN RIGHTS (SEXUAL CONDUCT) BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.,107
152,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill establishes and protects a basic right for all Australians: the right of consenting adults to privacy in their own bedroom. Much of the public debate and the debate in this chamber has been set in terms of states rights versus human rights. The truth is that governments do not have rights; only citizens have rights. Indeed, it is the role of governments-federal and state-to defend basic rights such as the right to privacy. Legislation such as this is a very important contribution to the rights of Australian citizens. It also says a lot about Australia's emerging maturity as a nation. I made mention of this prior to question time. It reflects on the way in which political issues are being determined in this parliament. Australia has always been an egalitarian society in its values and mannerisms, but old Australia expressed this by locking out people and ideas, straightening out change and living in fear of its isolation and the tyranny of distance. Australia in the 1990s is a very different society. It is expressing its egalitarianism in a different way, through values of tolerance and acceptance. We are now a much more inclusive society, willing to take its place in the world-not so much frightened our by distance and isolation but willing to break down the barriers to Australia's place in the international community. This has occurred in migration policies, such as the abolition of White Australia. It has also happened through the internationalisation of the Australian economy. We should be very willing, as a parliament and as Australians, to take our place in international treaties for the protection of basic international and national rights. As Manning Clark said, the time has come for the enlargers to determine Australia's direction. That is very much the direction of the Keating government. The Australian Labor Party now stands as Australia's only national party, placing national responsibilities and values ahead of parochialism and the politics of isolationism and fear of distance. The Liberal and National parties are an unholy alliance of state interests, a strange mixture of liberal and conservative values. This is a party and a coalition of shellbacks and throwbacks to old Australia, an Australia now past. The snarly honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) can object, but it comes out time and time again in the seams of coalition policy, such as that displayed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in relation to a monocultural society, a throwback to White Australia and fear of Asian migration. It comes out in the obsession of the opposition with the monarchy-trying to use the British crown as a security blanket for the insecurities of people in the coalition and fellow travellers like Joan Sutherland. This unholy alliance comes out in the National Party and its lingering attachment to industry protectionism, a policy that was ditched a decade ago. It has come out in the statements of the Leader of the Opposition; the ambivalence he strings out about foreign investment and international treaties. It is also a feature of coalition policy on states rights, of the attitude taken by so many coalition members to this legislation and the denial of land rights to Aboriginal people in Western Australia. The coalition has presented a compromise on this legislation that again reflects its attachment to old Australia-fear of distance and fear of isolation. It is saying it does not support this bill, but it will not oppose it. That is, the coalition does not support the basic privacy and human rights of Australians; it just will not oppose them. The National Party organisation has actively encouraged its members of parliament to oppose the bill and vote against it. I am pleased to be on this side of the parliament supporting this bill, part of the government's approach of achieving an outward-looking tolerant egalitarian Australian society, not throwing back to the days when Australia was insecure and frightened of its place in the world, days when we relied on White Australia policies to lock migrants out of Australia, relied on industry protection and relied on the British crownMr Ronaldson-It was your policy.",107
153,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"The Labor Party has moved past those things, and you have not. That is the point of this debate. The ALP has moved itself into the 1990s while the coalition is still locked back in the 1950s kowtowing to Menzies and his cabinet. The coalition has not updated its policies and has not got a decent understanding of the way in which Australian values have evolved through the 1980s and 1990s. That is why the coalition is in such an abysmal mess on a basic issue like this-a basic issue of human rights; the right to privacy for all Australians. Some coalition members support the bill, others oppose it, others are going for a long walk around Canberra to abstain on the vote and the member for Berowra is moving an amendment-four positions within the one coalition, and you are trying to tell me the coalition has updated its policy. It has not. It is back in the 1950s and that is reflected in the way in which its members are presenting themselves and their voting intention on this legislation. The decline of states rights is one of the most important developments in Australian politics in the 1990s. The states rights defence is based on a view of an Australian federation in which the rights of state governments take priority over the rights of citizens and the national parliament. This is a throwback to the insecurity of the colonies last century. This doctrine was buried in the engineers case in 1920 in which the High Court of Australia ruled that federal constitutional powers should be allowed to operate without artificial restrictions. This judgment was confirmed in the uniform tax cases in 1942 and 1957. The idea of states sovereignty in Australia is now a moribund and archaic concept, if in fact it ever existed. Prior to Federation in 1901 the only source of sovereign power in Australia was the British crown. The colonies accepted that and indeed many of those opposite-the colonists and the monarchists of the Liberal Party and the National Party-probably wish it were still the case. But the truth is Australia has moved on. It cannot be argued in logic that the colonies gained any greater sovereignty through the act of federation. In fact the colonies sought a national framework in which to defend their own interests and explicitly approved of the federal parliament taking responsibility for the external affairs power. When the Australian constitution was drafted section 51(xxix), on the external affairs power, was left intentionally weak not to protect or enhance the sovereignty of the states but to preserve the sovereignty of the British crown. For 20 years after Federation, Britain conducted most of Australia's external affairs. Through the Imperial Conferences of the 1920s, however, Britain withdrew from these arrangements thus enhancing the sovereignty of the national parliament but leaving the position of the states and the rights of the states unchanged. Over the decades since, the sovereignty and responsibilities of this parliament have been further confirmed. The High Court has continued to place national responsibilities and states rights in their proper perspective. In 1985 the chief justice of Australia, Sir Anthony Mason, told an audience at the University of Virginia that proponents of states rights 'tend to assume, quite wrongly, that the constitution preserves in some way or other the actual balance of powers, or the actual federal-state relationship as it existed at some undefined time shortly after the constitution came into operation'. In 1986 Justices Mason, Brennan and Deane wrote in a joint judgment-and members opposite might care to listen to this: If the Constitution contemplates that the States be subject to control or regulation by the Commonwealth or its agencies in particular respects, their subjection to that control or regulation cannot amount to a relevant impairment or inhibition on their capacity to govern. That makes the point that states rights are subordinate to the rights of the national parliament-set out in the Australian constitution, interpreted and decided upon in judgments since 1920 by the High Court of Australia. The High Court, to its credit, has interpreted our constitution to mean that human rights are more important than states rights. Australia has an important role to play in fulfilling its international responsibilities. In discharging those responsibilities it has been left to the federal parliament and the federal government to be party to international treaties. You only need to look to the views of Garfield Barwick, not someone known to take an enlightened view on these matters. In 1975, as the chief justice in the Seas and Submerged Lands case, he said: Only the Commonwealth has international status. The colonies never were and the States are not international persons. Only this national parliament can discharge Australia's international responsibilities. Until recent times there was bipartisan support in Australian politics for the fulfilment of these responsibilities through international treaties. Australia is currently party to approximately 920 treaties, about the OECD average and well less than the 7,000 in force in the United States. Treaties have enormous benefits to Australia.",108
154,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"Oh, yes!",109
155,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"The member for Parkes scoffs at that notion. He might like to consider that the package of multilateral agreements included as part of the Uruguay Round will increase Australia's exports by around $5 billion and our GOP by $4.4 billion by the year 2002. A lot of those exports and a lot of that growth will come out of your electorate, from the primary producers you seek to represent. So do not regard these international treaties as being restricted to the rights of privacy or human rights; they relate to interwill national economic relations and have a host of benefits for the Australian people. With advances in communications, transport and trade Australia must accept its role in the international community. A constructive role relies on international cooperation through international treaties. The whole thrust of our national policy is to integrate Australia's economy and our social fabric with the international community. We are building the model of a successful outward-looking trading nation with all the virtues of a dynamic multicultural and tolerant society. That is the government's position. The opposition is always edging us back towards White Australia, towards industry protection, towards this inward looking focus on international investment, on international treaties, and on the monarchy and relying on Britain to give Australia a sense of security. It is only the Labor Party that is bringing Australia through with the values relevant to the 1990s. Those values are reflected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was signed by the Whitlam government and ratified by the Fraser government on 13 August 1980. Members opposite might like to consider the joint press release issued by the then Fraser foreign minister, Andrew Peacock, and the Attorney-General, Peter Durack, when they stated: Ratification of the convention was important not only for the benefits it would confer on the Australment Ian people, but also because it promotes a firm basis of principle which Australia would apply in considering intemational human rights questions. The convention is the basis of the legislation now before the parliament. It was signed by the Whitlam government, ratified by the Fraser government and acted on by the Keating government, the bipartisanship having been destroyed by the Downer opposition. This legislation is set fairly in the great traditions of liberal democracy-that is, the liberating role of government to provide and guarantee basic human rights and freedoms. No human right is more important than the right to privacy. This legislation shows that Australia takes seriously its national and international responsibilities for civil and political rights. It is a significant part of Australia's emerging maturity-no longer an isolated and inward looking country but a nation confident enough to open its economy and society to the world and tolerant enough to protect the basic rights of its citizens. This legislation says that human rights are more important than states rights. It says that governments do not have rights, only citizens do. It says that governments have no role in the bedrooms of Australians, regulating aspects of sexual behaviour and choice among consenting adults. It is a bill that demands and deserves the support of all fair-minded Australians and each of the members assembled in this House of Representatives. (Time expired)",109
156,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"The previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), accused us of certain things. However, I think he is living in the past and parading his old prejudices before us today. We are debating the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, which is probably the shortest bill ever to come before the parliament. It is one paragraph long, four lines; indeed, the substance of the bill is only one sentence long. But rarely has so much been written about so little in the media. What concerns me are the reasons why the government has brought this bill into the House. I think the reasons are typical of the way that this government acts. This governis not bringing this bill in because it passionately believes in it. It is bringing it in so that more power may be centralised in Canberra. It is bringing it into gamer the homosexual vote. It is bringing it into have a shot at the Tasmanian Liberal government and to score a cheap political point. It is bringing it in in an attempt to cause mischief amongst the federal coalition, and it is bringing it into provide a diversion from the troubles that exist in this country today. That particularly distresses me. We have the situation today where Australia is suffering a record current account deficit, in excess of $2,000 million a month. We have a record overseas debt created by this government. We have new record high real interest rates and interest rates rising at this very moment. In this country we have 850,000 jobless, record high youth unemployment, record high youth suicide, near record bankruptcy and drought crunching the life out of rural Australia. Ninety per cent of the state I come from is declared drought stricken. People are trying to get wheat into the country. It is $27 a tonne to bring it across the Pacific from America and Canada, and it is $40 a tonne to bring it from Perth. These issues have been neglected for months while the government has been working on this bill. I think that the government has its priorities skewed. As soon as this bill is out of the road, the government will then be continuing its work, which it has been at for two years, on the racial vilification bill. When we see these sorts of priorities being set by the government, it is hard not to be cynical about its motives. It is interesting to look at what this bill does. The one four-line sentence I referred to earlier states: Sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In other words, I think that means, in layman's language, that the police cannot burst into your bedroom and check what you are doing in there. By itself, that is an unremarkable statement. I do not think there is anyone who would object to that by itself. It is uncontroversial; it is almost banal in intent. It is when we go a little further and consider the effect of the bill that we have some disquiet about it. In effect, the bill sets out to nullify chapter 14 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 of Tasmania and, in particular, sections 122 and 123. I will read out the relevant parts of those sections. Section 122 states: Any person who ... has sexual intercourse with any person against the order of nature or ... consents to a male person having sexual intercourse with him or her against the order of nature, is guilty of a crime. That person will be charged with unnatural sexual intercourse. As the Attorney-General of Tasmania, Ronald Cornish, says in a letter to me: Section 122 of the Criminal Code refers to sodomy. You will note that this section does not discriminate against people, only against conduct, hence this section applies equally to both heterosexual homosexual couples. Section 123 states: Any male personit excludes femaleswho, whether in public or private, commits any indecent assault upon, or other act of gross indecency with, another male person, or procures another male person to commit any act of gross indecency with himself or any other male person, is guilty of a crimethat person will be charged with indecent practice between male persons. The Attorney General, Ronald Cornish, then says: Section 123 of the Criminal Code contains a prohibition against indecent assaults or other acts of gross indecency committed between male persons. You will note that this section is directed towards conduct by male persons only. As I said, the Tasmanian Criminal Code Act was enacted in 1924. If it were enforced-in other words, if someone were arrested in their bedroom-once this bill that we are debating here today becomes law, an appeal could be made to the High Court and we would then have a conflict, with a Commonwealth law saying one thing and a state law saying something else. Of course, under normal circumstances, the Commonwealth parliament has no direct power to legislate in relation to privacy. To support the legislation, the Commonwealth relies on bringing this bill before the House by tapping into its external affairs power under section 51(xxix) of the constitution. That is something that we on this side do not think should be automatically done in the way the government has been doing with increasing frequency in recent years. Of course, once you have a federal law up against a state law, the federal law applies. I do note that this bill says that there will be no interference whatsoever with minorsthat is, people under 18 years of age; there will be no interference whatsoever with people who are conducting these acts of sodomy, or whatever else they are doing, by force; and there will be no interference with the Tasmanian government if it wants to come down on people who may be conducting these acts in public. In other words, to be doing and something legal under this federal bill, you must be over the age of 18, your partner must consent to what you are doing and you must be doing it in private. That, as it stands, is not something that any reasonable person could object to in any way whatsoever. However, for the coalition there are two principles involved in this bill-probably for the Labor Party there is only one. The two principles are those of privacy and states rights. Dealing with them in tum, the principle of privacy is a very strong one indeed. This principle says that it is the right of two consenting adults to do whatever they want to do in the privacy of their own home. I think in many senses that is inviolate. On the other hand, we have the principle of states rights, by which the federal government, using the external affairs powers, overrides state laws. We believe that the states should have the right to make laws for themselves in areas where they have jurisdiction. Privacy is one area where they do have jurisdiction. We believe that the state government will rise or fall at the next state election according to what the people in that state decide for themselves. If the federal government wanted to have that changed, wanted to have the constitution changed, it should put it to the Australian people by way of referendum. Of course, states rights is not a principle that the Labor Party seems to hold at all dear. It treats it with contempt, and I accept its stance on that. The coalition holds both these principles very dearly indeed. Therefore, when a piece of legislation like this comes before us, it is very difficult for us to decide which way to go: if we vote for the principle of privacy, we will violate the principle of states rights, which we hold dear; if we vote the other way, we will violate the other principle. So we are caught, in a sense, on the horns of a dilemma; we have to work this out ourselves, and we have done so. There is a range of opinion on this side of the House as to what we should do with the bill, from those who believe we should support it to those who believe we should oppose it. We have arrived at a position. We are genuinely tom between both principles; I, for one, am genuinely tom between both principles and in a minute I will come to how I have resolved the dilemma. I do not believe, in adopting the coalition's position not to oppose this bill, that the constitution was ever meant to be abused in the way in which the government is abusing it. The Tasmanian law has been in place since 1924-a period of 70 years. I do not know how many state parliaments have been in existence in that period-probably in the order of a couple of dozen or so. If the truth be known, most of those have probably been Labor Party parliaments. Since 1924, the elected representatives of Tasmania-whether they be Liberal members or Labor members have not seen fit, until this time, to talk about changing that law. If the people of Tasmania feel strongly about it at the next election they will have their chance to exercise their rights at the ballot box, seeing that this issue is now so prominent in the public debating arena. The coalition has had to decide one way or the other; it has decided not to oppose the bill. I believe in this instance that the principle of privacy outweighs the principle of state rights. I do so with some reluctance because, as I have said, in supporting one principle I am forced to violate another. Therefore, I think it is inappropriate that legislation be brought before us which puts us in this position. I have made this decision for a number of reasons. One of those reasons relates to the effect this bill will have in Tasmania. In practice, in many ways, this bill will have a nil or negligible effect in Tasmania. You might ask: why do I say that? I say that because, to my knowledge, since 1924 the Tasmanian authorities have never arrested anyone in their bedrooms doing whatever they want to do in their bedrooms. Despite that, everybody-including the present Liberal government in Tasmania-knows that homosexual acts are occurring in the homes of Tasmanians every night. I do not know what the number would be; it could be in the order of 10,000 or 15,000. Homosexual acts have probably been going on since the time of convict settlement in Tasmania. They are going on in every state of Australia and in every country in the world. The government knows this, everybody knows this, and the government has chosen to do nothing about it. If this bill comes into effect, I do not think it is vital to what the Tasmanian government wants to do; it does not desperately need this bill. I also have a philosophical reason for not opposing this bill. I am basically a libertarian; I believe that people should be able to do whatever they want, provided it does not impinge on other people's rights. I transgress from that belief in a number of instances. For example, I believe in the compulsory wearing of seat belts. In this case, people should not have a choice because I think the wearing of seat belts saves many lives. Philosophically, I think the rights of privacy in this case override the state's rights. I saw Manoly Lascaris being interviewed the other day on the Sunday program. He was the partner of Patrick White for something like 47 years. He was a quite charming gentleman who gave a very honest and revealing interview of the years that he spent as the male friend of Patrick White. In no sense, shape or form would anyone want to have a bill which allowed the police to burst into the bedroom and arrest those people for whatever they may have done over that period of time. I am not enamoured of acts of homosexuality in any shape or form. I have opposed special grants being given by the federal government for the mardi gras. I have opposed the government granting a special category for homosexual immigration into this country. I have tried to put the AIDS debate on a proper scientific level rather than have it hijacked by the homosexual lobby. Nevertheless, even though I do not approve of what homosexuals do, I respect their rights as human beings to do what they do in privacy. That is just one of the principles by which I abide. I have also decided not to oppose this bill, if you like, for political and pragmatic reasons. The government has brought this bill before us for mischievous reasons. From the coalition's point of view, it is in our interests politically to sort of ho-hum the bill, let it through to the keeper, and not have the journalists poised with their pens ready to write when we break asunder and cross the floor and do all these other things. We should get rid of this bill and concentrate. on the main issues that I spoke of earher-the drought, the level of debt, the interest rates and things like that. I would like to say a few words about the hypocrisy of the government, which h- railed long and loud in this debate about thl- Tasmanian act. I looked up who brought In the bill in 1924. The first reading was in February, the second reading being later that month. The Attorney-General of the day was Albert Ogilvie and the Premier was Joseph Lyons, of the Labor Party. It was the Labor Party that brought in this bill in 1924. Mr Knott-He later became a Labor rat.",110
157,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"There have been a few of them on that side lately. I suppose Bob Hawke would come into that category, too, by your classification. It is the Labor Party's act. The Labor Party has been in power for most of the 70 years since 1924 and it has done nothing about this law, either federally or in the state parliament. On 18 October 1973, ex-Prime Minister Gorton, the former member for Higgins, moved a motion in this place which read: That in the opinion of this House homosexual acts between consenting adults in private should not be subject to the criminal law. It is interesting to see how people voted on that motion. Five people who voted on that day, 18 October 1973, are still members of this House today. Of those five people, four voted for that motion and one voted against. The four people who voted for that motion to take homosexuality out of the criminal acts were: Bruce Lloyd, Phillip Ruddock, Ian Sinclair and Ralph Willis. You might well ask: who was the one who sits here today in this chamber who voted against it? Who was that person? It was P. J. Keating. He was the one who voted against it. When I discovered that, I was prompted to go back to his maiden speech because when people give maiden speeches they often lay go down their long-held beliefs. I see that he had some very interesting beliefs. He proposed various things, such as: the government should fix wages; it should have control over prices and services; no worker should have two jobs; and immigration is far too costly. He hinted that it should be shut down. Then he said: In the last couple of years the Government hboasted about the increasing number of women In the work force. Rather than something to be proud of I feel that this is something of which we should be ashamed. Questioning the government, he said: Is it doing anything to put the working wife back in her home? It is not. It engages in a lot of claptrap. It denigrates the Labor Party for its constructive proposals. I presume those proposals were to keep women in the home. I do not know when he had his conversion on the road to Damascus. I suspect it was pretty late, and I suspect it was for crass political reasons. Do not come in here and give us the claptrap that these people have always been pure on this issue. The Labor Party brought in the Tasmanian bill. People like the Prime Minister have opposed getting rid of this sort of thing. The government is bringing this bill in here today for mischievous reasons. While I support the coalition's position and will not be opposing this bill, I believe the government's history on matters pertaining to this bill is very murky indeed. It can take only very limited credit for the action it is taking in this area. (Time expired)",113
158,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEES,"I will speak to the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill because I think it is important for the people of Australia who look at this bill, who look at the speeches that have been made on this bill, to get a clear understanding of what the record is, what views prompted people to vote the way they voted. I support the bill and do so because I have some intrinsic problems with what otherwise takes place in this country of mine. For instance, I will now go through the intimate details of a sex act between my wife and me. Please, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you feel that it is a little too graphic, when you believe that it is not the sort of thing should be said in this House, please pull me up because it is quite honestly the essence of this bill. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we spend a lot of time here. When we go home, we go home to our loved ones. When I go home on Friday, I will go home to my loving wife. I will probably get home around five. I will then go and do my family chores, one of which will be to assist in the care of my two sons by bathing with them. After that, I will assist with the cooking of food. When that is done, and when my two sons have been bedded down, I will engage in conversation with my lovely wife. We will talk about the week in our working environments and then, at an appropriate time, we will head off to our bedroom. Upon closing the door, hopefully we will fall into each other's arms in an embrace. Mr Bradford-My goodness!",114
159,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEES,Is it getting a bit much for the member for MCPherson? That is exactly my point. Mrs Bishop-Talk about privacy. Can't we have some?,114
160,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEES,"That is exactly my point. Now that you have heard my story and have been somewhat embarrassed by how far I have gone, the point has been made that what takes place between my wife and me is none of your business. You have no right to know. Mr Miles-We don't want to know. Why are you telling us?",114
161,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEES,"If you would listen, you would find out. The point is that what takes place between my wife and me-the intimate details; the physical facts; the descriptions of what happens; where I put what, where or why-is no-one's business, nobody's. Last week we talked about sodomy. That is no-one's business, not in here. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) made a point about privacy-and please correct me if I am wrong, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - that what two consenting adults do in private is not the affair of governments and legislation. I hope that that is an accurate assessment of what the member for Parkes, a National Party member, said. I totally agree with him. The looks of dismay and comments from the member for MACKellar (Mrs Bishop), the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) that I may in fact describe in detail the acts that take place in the privacy of my bedroom is what this bill is all about. You do not want to know because it is none of your business. That is precisely what is in this bill. Can I reflect for a moment on the embarrassment that would be attributed to my wife if I did describe in vivid detail her undergarments and the acts we engage in in our loving relationship. Is she entitled to that privacy? Is she entitled to know that the actions which take place between her and me are our own property, our own intimate details, which are not to be discussed in parking lots, pubs or parliaments? That, in essence, is the question. For some reason certain people say that they should be able to determine the conduct that takes place in that intimate, consenting, private adult relationship. From my Christian education, I was taught not to put myself up as judge of others. That was expressed to me as one of the central themes of Christianity. It is not for me to stand in judgment. The central theme of Christianity is that there is someone else who will judge. I ask those Christians who sit in this place with me to reflect on that. If they do not believe that, they should vote accordingly. If they do believe that, again, they should vote accordingly. I will not speak long in this debate because I do not think a lot needs to be said. We need to understand that human rights are in fact that: rights bestowed on people because their humanity. Much sniggering, laughter, innuendo and homophobic activity will take place because of this bill. That to me reflects more on the people who conduct themselves in that activity. While I ask members to look into their own hearts and souls, while I ask that they consider the tenets of Christianity, while I ask that they think about their comments to my opening remarks in this speech, I also suggest that they take note of the logic behind their thoughts. Members did not want to know what my wife and I do sexually. The member for Mackellar said that members do not want to know, or words to that effect. Quite rightly so. That is probably the first and only time that I will agree with that member. I would suggest that it would have been inappropriate privacy. for me to give that description in this place. This parliament, or any other parliament, is not the place where those things should be canvassed. When the members who agree with the Tasmanian legislation stand up this place and describe their own sexual in explicit detail they will then have the right books. to make comments about others. Until they are prepared to stand up in here and explain in explicit detail what they do with their genitalia to people that they love, or do not love, or to people they pay for or whatever, in the Christian ethic they should not stand judgment on others. Jesus Christ never did; looked down on people who set themselves up as judges. I hope from my speech in Hansard that the people of my electorate can understand why I will vote the way that I will. What I ask them to do if they are male is reflect on the attitudes that they have to the boyish gossip that takes place about sexual activity. I refer to the immature gossip of conquest and so on. If they are female, I ask them to reflect on whether or not they would want their partner to stand in a place like this and explicitly detail their actions, their groans and their moans in their physical relationships. I ask the people of Australia whether they think this is the place for that to be discussed. If they say no, irrespective of whether they are practising sodomists, whether they like or of dislike buggery, whether they want to have anything to do with buggery or not, I ask them to think about whether they would want the explicit details of their relationships discussed here. I hope that they say no; that it is inappropriate. I hope they say that it is not the sort of thing that politicians should be deciding for them or anyone else. I hope people, whether they are homophobic, whether they are against gay activity, or whether they are heterosexual, will understand that the right to privacy-and this was mentioned by the member for Parkes-and the right to do what they like with consenting adults in the privacy of their own homes is the ultimate form of privacy. I hope that people understand that I have no alternative but to vote for continued legitimacy and My last comment is that this act is not being engendered in Tasmania and is not being used. That is not an argument. That is an argument for not having it on the books. in I oppose fascism. Laws which allow fascism acts to take place should be expunged from the",114
162,Mr MILES,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak on the very important Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. I want to tum to the origins of this legislation because I think it is very important for the House to understand in just how this bill came about. I will firstly he pick up what the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) said about the corresponding legislation in the Tasmanian parliament. This legislation was brought in by the Tasmanian Labor Party in 1924. Legislation has an educative role for people growing up and society generally. It is important that people understand some of the concepts of how we run our society. The legislation has been used in an educative way in Tasmania to illustrate the values and concepts that are important for a society and it will continue to be used in that way. The legislation in Tasmania is in a sense benign. It adds to the window-dressing of the government in this place. I will refer to that again later. Former Senator Peter Walsh, a recently departed Labor minister, said as recently as the end of August in an article in the Australian Financial Review that the government is 'bunging on an act for show'. That is exactly what this is all about. The government is putting on an act because in actual fact there is no invasion of privacy in Tasmania. It is putting on a show and it does not mean a lot. The government is windowdressing. This legislation is designed for political purposes and nothing else. I will outline the origins of this In May this year the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said that the government would repeal or override sections 122 and 123 of Tasmania's criminal code. The Keating Labor government was going to intervene in Tasmania and override these sections of the law. It was going to ride roughshod over Tasmania. It set up the scenario that it could walk over any state's criminal code. However, there was a campaign mounted in Tasmania, and no doubt the government did some legal homework after looking into the matter. It found that it was not able to override any state laws by bringing in legislation in this manner. It could not override the criminal code. If it did, it knew a High Court challenge would most likely be successful. The other fact is that the government holds four seats in Tasmania and it saw the tide running heavily against it. The government had to find a way to placate the people whom it had purported to support. The government had to do a V-tum. The government was going to introduce the legislation in July this year and we were waiting for it. When the government looked into it it found that there were still problems with it. It was trying to decide how to legislate in regard to privacy. Privacy, as we have heard, is within the province of state governments and has been for a long time in Australia. The government said, 'What we have to do is to find an international treaty, an international convention, which will allow us to override the states.' This is probably about the seventh or eighth time in the last eight years that the government has found another avenue to evade the original intentions of the constitution. The first point is that this is Labor legislation. It was dreamt up by the Labor Party; it was designed by the Labor Party; and it was brought into the parliament by the Labor Party. It is not the type of legislation that the coalition would be interested in bringing in. The Labor Party had to bring in some legislation because it was pressured by people out there to do something about the Tasmanian laws. But the Labor Party had to do a V-tum legislation. from its original intention. As an article by former Senator Peter Walsh in the Financial Review of 30 August stated, this is 'bunging on an act for a show'. This legislation has no real substance, but is that not typical of the Keating government? Yesterday and today we saw this interaction between the former Prime Minister and the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That categorises the nature of this government: it is a government of deceit, and this was demonstrated today and yesterday. The government is not interested in spending the time of this parliament on important legislation; rather it is interested in trying to find a hook on which it can create mischief. That is the essence of this legislation, and former Senator Peter Walsh says exactly that in the newspaper article to which I have referred. As shadow minister for schools and vocational education and training, I was very interested that the government had been alerted to the fact that it was in contravention of an international agreement. I also discovered that 18 months ago the government had been advised on children's rights. The government had been advised by the United Nations committee that, due to its commitment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it did not meet the international obligations with respect to school discipline. For 18 months the government has been asked to do something about this. I would suggest to the government that it is highly hypocritical for it to act on the recommendations of the United Nations committee with respect to Tasmania's laws, yet refuse to act on the decision of two United Nations committees on physical or mental violence in schools and homes. Why does the government pick out one international obligation but fail to address the others? It is an act; it is a show; it is window-dressing. Other people would say that it is purely a stunt, and it is. The origins of this legislation come from the Toonen case, which was taken to the UN committee a year or so ago. This came about because of the signing of the first optional protocol which, just to let everyone know, was ratified on Christmas Day 1991. It was slipped through in the quiet period of the year-ratified on Christmas Day 1991. That is typical of the Labor Party: do not let the Australian people know what it is doing about international agreements; sign away Australia's independence. That is what it does. Let us have a look at this particular UN committee. It has 18 people on it from different parts of the world. Five of those 18 countries have laws against homosexuality similar to those of Tasmania. Not only that, four of those countries have not even signed the first optional protocol. Its members deign to comment about the rights of people in other parts of the world when in their own countries they have done nothing about it at all. One of those people comes from Yugoslavia. I ask people to watch their televisions at night to see whether the human rights in Tasmania are more sustained than those in Yugoslavia. I do not think anybody in this House would have any doubts. Tasmania is a beautiful part of Australia. Some of the comments which have been made in this House and in other places about Tasmanian people are outrageous and wrong. This committee on which this government bases its reasons for acting meets in secret. You cannot cross-examine its members. It is accountable to nobody. People talk about privacy, and I acknowledge that is very important. But having the right of privacy is not the only thing that is important. Who protects the right of privacy if you do have it is also important. A state government in Australia is more likely to protect people's rights than an unelected, unaccountable UN committee would ever do. Here we have a federal government which is prepared to put more stock in an unelected overseas committee which accepted and did not question absolutely false evidence than it is in a duly elected state parliament. That is the nature of the Labor Party. I find it absolutely incredible that the government says, 'We must have our own Australian identity; we must bring in the Australia Act and make sure that we do not have any reference to a court in another country; and we must make sure that our head of state is within this country,' when the genesis of this legislation comes from a decision made overseas. If there were a real reason to act with respect to these laws in Tasmania, why did the government not act when it was elected in 1983? Because this government puts more stock in an unelected overseas body which is totally unaccountable to anybody in the world. The government is prepared to do that and ignore duly elected state governments in this country. I have heard people talking about state rights and human rights. This debate is not really about state rights and human rights; it is about human rights and people's rights. States do not have rights, but people within the states do have rights. The people in Tasmania have a right to elect their duly elected governments to make laws for them. How this committee operated was very interesting. When the committee received the submission from Mr Toonen, it realised that it could not deal with it because 'sexual preference' was not referred to in any of the United Nations conventions or treaties. So what did the committee do? It redefined what the word 'sex' meant. That is how it got around it. That is how sneaky it was. It changed the definition of 'sex' to include 'sexual preference'. But up until that time it has not included it. As I said, the committee then accepted false information. I want to mention to the parliament some of that false information. First of all, Mr Toonen said: Since lodging my communication I have lost my employment, partly as a result of this communication. He went on to say: I stopped working for the Tasmanian Aids Council on July 2nd, 1993 after 4Y2 years employment as a result of an external review of the Council which recommended the termination of my employment. The review was imposed on the Aids Council by the Tasmanian Government through its Department of Community and Health Services. He also said: The actions by the Department were motivated by its concerns over my high profile complaint, the United Nations Human Rights Committee and my gay activist. At no time was there any question my work performance being unsatisfactory. Each of those things is false. If we go back to the information provided we find that those statements are false. The UN committee did not question the falsehood of those comments. Yet this government deigns to come into this place and bring in legislation based on the fact that this committee accepts false information. I find it totally incredible that a government would do that, but it has, and the legislation is before us today. I fully support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). As a country, we have to take a good hard look at these international treaties and the way in which Australia deals with them. For too long we have avoided addressing new mechanisms whereby Australia signs and ratifies international treaties. I know that one of this government's purposes is to get rid of state governments. There is no place for a government in Australia to continually thwart the Australian constitution, but that is what this legislation does. The right to privacy is an important one. I acknowledge that. But no governmentcertainly not a Labor government, because Labor governments are the most intrusive governments this country has ever knownwill protect my privacy. If we look through history we find that governments do not protect people's privacy or people's rights. They are more likely to take away people's rights. The rights of people will be protected only by the people themselves. For this government, with its intrusiveness and desire to bring in an ID card, to come in here and purport to protect the privacy of the Australian people is just beyond belief. This is the government that would bring in an ID card to intrude into our privacy. I say to the Australian people: this government cannot be trusted with this form of legislation. If anything, it will bring about difficulties for Australia rather than benefits. Privacy is important and people in Tasmania already have privacy. The laws governing the rights of police to enter and search private dwellings in Tasmania are very strong. This bill purports to protect of a person's privacy with respect to their sexual conduct, but nobody's privacy has been intruded in this regard. So why is the legislation being introduced? There has been no invasion of privacy in Tasmania. I challenge the Attorney-General, or any member of the government, to come in here and tell us where that privacy has been invaded. Tasmanian legislation is quite adequate and has adequately protected people's privacy. This legislation is purely a Labor Party political stunt. The Labor Party does not want to talk about the overseas debt. It does not want to talk about the Prime Minister buying a $2.2 million house. It does not want to talk about the lies being told by the Prime Minister. It does not want to discuss unemployment. It wants to evade the major issues. I do not oppose this legislation, but I certainly cannot support it because of the reasons which I have outlined to you-that it is based on false information to an overseas, unelected and unaccountable body. It is totally un-Australian.",115
163,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I have listened to as many of the contributions that have been made to this legislation, the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994, as I have been able to. From both sides of the chamber some of the contributions made have been quite thoughtful and, in many respects, very valuable. I mention particularly the contribution that was made by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), which I thought was very thoughtful, very principled, very balanced and very sensible. Those contributions which have been made from this side of the chamber too have been of very significant value. I have been pleased so far-and I hope that this will persist right through the course of this debate-that. some of the more absurd claims about the possible implications and results of this legislation have generally been avoided. The explanatory memorandum has made the legislation perfectly clear. When we keep in mind that the Acts Interpretation Act places a responsibility on courts when considering legislation from this parliament to take into account the explanatory memorandum and also the second reading speech of the minister in introducing legislation, we cannot lightly dismiss the content of that explanatory memorandum. There have been matters of personal subjective judgment, some personal observations, some claims with which I would not agree, some that I would dispute and some which did not provide as full a coverage of the particular points that have been dealt with as could have been provided. But, despite these reservations, I think the debate so far has been a fairly sensible one. I want to congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on his second reading speech. That speech has probably made it unnecessary for members to canvass the details of the legislation, the legal implications of the legislation, the background to the development of treaty obligations by Australia and issues of that kind which are inherent in that legislation. The Attorney-General's second reading speech was moderate, balanced, objective and analytical. I would commend it to any person in this parliament or any person in the wider community who has any interest at all in the issues raised by this legislation and its impliwhole cations. It was a very thoughtful presentation. Some of the comments that the Attorney General made deserve repeating. The comments that I have chosen to repeat are not necessarily the most important but, to a large extent, they summarise my concerns about the matters that this legislation seeks to address, and they reveal the way in which the legislation is responding to the types of concerns which, quite correctly, are concerns for this parliament. In part, the Attorney-General said: Indeed, there is no more fundamental reason for the existence of governments but to respect and enhance the rights of citizens. I agree with that absolutely. He also said: This bill is about basic freedomsin particular, he went on to say: the right of adult Australians to make their own choices about sexual practices within the privacy of their own homes. I would think that that has got to be fairly fundamental. It addresses the question of whether it is appropriate for governments to intrude into matters of that kind-the intensely personal behaviour of people and their partners in the privacy of their own bedrooms. The Attorney-General also reminded usthis is particularly relevant, especially in light of some of the comments that have been made by some members of the oppositionthat it was the Liberal-National government of Malcolm Fraser which accepted the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980. That government did so after a long period of discussion with the Australian states. It is article 17 of that covenant on which this bill is founded. The Attorney also said later in that second reading speech that most Australians probably take for granted that they live in a society in which they are free to pursue their private lives and, in particular, their private sexual lives free of unjustified government intrusion. That is the right enshrined in article 17-the right to be free from unjustified and unnecessary government interference in one's everyday private life. That is fundamental to the question of this government seeking to use the external affairs power, not necessarily and exclusively to deal with the particular problem which exists in Tasmania but to deal with it more generally over the whole of Australia. While I do not want to deal with all of the issues that were raised by the opposition speaker who immediately preceded me, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), it did not add very much to his concerns, which I understand, for him to be making comments of the kind that this was just a stunt by the Labor Party. One of the opposition speakers earlier today-I think it was the former shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr WiIIiams)said that one of the motivations on the part of the government in introducing this legislation was to try to split the opposition. I think one of our speakers responded and said that we did not need to do that; opposition members have done it admirably for themselves. Claims of this kind do not contribute anything to the debate. 'It is a stunt by the Labor Party.' 'One of the reasons the government introduced this is to attempt to split the opposition.' What absurdity. The honourable member also said that the rights of people should be protected. Of course they should. That is what this legislation is largely about. He said that governments are more often intrusive of the rights of citizens than protective of them. That is often very much the case. But, with the increasing level of social enlightenment, there is an increasing number of cases where governments, in responding to community concerns-not just state based or national based concerns but international community concerns-have found it necessary to become more intrusive in order to protect human rights. Some people might say, 'This concerns sexual practices that we find a little abhorrent and unpleasant. Let us not be concerned about them.' But I have just made the objection that it is the intensely personal nature of the physical relationship between partners, between consenting adults, in the privacy of their own bedrooms that we are concerned about. Some people make the claim that this is a legitimate area for government involvement, that it is appropriate to have, in effect, governments, government agencies and law enforcement authorities peeping through the blinds of private bedrooms with binoculars.",118
164,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,In Tasmania?,120
165,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I will come to that. I am glad that the member opposite raises it. It is critical to the whole question of the legitimacy and honesty of the Tasmanian government in pursuing that type of approach. I appreciate the interjection. There are a number of legal definitions and so on involved in the legislation with which I do not want to deal-the question, for example, of just what is meant by arbitrary interference, what is meant by interference in consenting behaviour between adults in private, what is meant by 'consent' and what is meant by 'in private'. They are all matters for interpretation and judicial responses presumably in the future. I suppose there are plenty of forms of human behaviour we all find unpleasant, but whether or not it is appropriate for governments to intrude into and proscribe those forms of behaviour is a completely different question. When it is so intrusive that is a completely different question. There is a quaint expression, I notice, used in the Tasmanian legislation that refers to the 'order of nature'-human sexual behaviour which is 'against the order of nature'. How quaint. Good heavens, I would not like to canvass the various types of personal sexual behaviour that all members of this House have engaged in. What a voyeuristic and interesting study that might be. What a quaint little expression from down in Tasmania, 'against the order of nature'. I think it is even more serious to make some particular unpleasant behaviour a criminal offence. It is not just identified as something which offends the community or community susceptibilities or preferences. It is not just identified as something the general community might find offensive or unpleasant or distasteful. These people are criminals. These people are made criminals by that legislation. There is a question involved in this whole area of public policy concern about just what we mean when we talk, as we often do so glibly, about a liberal society, what we mean when we talk about a tolerant, open, libertarian, non-judgmental society-all laudable concepts. There are some people who are happy to mouth them but not so happy to enact them, to ensure that the society we seek to put into place is a society which encompasses all of those qualities. There are plenty of things I find objectionable. I find, for example, expressions of hate intensely objectionable. I find 'hate' a dirty four-letter word. Is it to be proscribed? I find intimidating and threatening behaviour grossly offensive. I find behaviour that is deliberately of a personally or socially provocative kind offensive. Often I find smoking in public places offensive. Public drunkenness, no longer an offence, I do not find very pleasant. Some forms of attire I do not find very pleasant. Oral language and sometimes body language I find most objectionable, most unpleasant, most distasteful. We live in a society where there are developing social mores. I think we have to accept responsibility. In this case the responsibility is on us to ensure that all of those types of qualities, which we all would like to think are inherent elements of our social arrangements, are given the opportunity for expression and, to the extent necessary, make it appropriate for us to seek to protect them. The member for Braddon said that from his own point of view he would not be voting against the legislation. Of course that is inherent in the amendment which has been moved by the member who led for the opposition. But it is not particularly appropriate the opposition to say, 'We are not going to support the legislation, but we are not going to oppose it either.' What in heaven's name does that mean? Oppositions will earn public credibility and public respect when they determine a collective position and they all adhere to it loyally. That is what political organisations in our type of democraticMr Rocher-On your side, not ours.",120
166,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"No, the honourable member is not correct. He understands the essential nature of disciplined political parties operating essentially within a twoparty system-in this case, the coalition and the Labor Party. He respects it because on a number of occasions he has voted with the coalition because of that discipline. I will guarantee, as would the honourable member, that there have been occasions when he has swallowed his pride and his principles in order to respect something that he should respect. He is here because he is a member of the coalition and he brings with him the responsibilities of being a member of the coalition. I hope a division is called. I would be very tempted to provide the second voice to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) if he calls for a division. I would be very tempted to provide the second voice in that call in order to have those people determine whether they vote for this legislation or against it, to have their names recorded as supporting it or opposing it. But they are not going to. Mr Ruddock-Follow your voice.",121
167,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,Are they not upset? Mr Ruddock-What about Barry Simon? Call for a vote and then don't follow the vote.,121
168,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I appreciate that interjection. This brings me to the point made earlier by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). In effect, he said that the legislation in Tasmania was not used for intrusion into civil rights. Let us just have a look at that. If this is such a vital matter of morality-which some opposition members are seeking to defend-then, clearly, homofor sexuals should be kept under constant surveillance. If it is a fundamental question of morality, as those opposite so often claim, homosexuals-sodomists-should be kept under almost permanent surveillance. Their movements and their companions should be documented and their behaviour should be inquired into, but it is not. The last conviction for private gay consenting sex in Tasmania was recorded in 1981, and a $50 fine was imposed. But we understand that the maximum penalty relating to homosexual sex in Tasmania is 21 years in gaol. What purpose does that particular penalty serve? If, in fact, it is not being applied-nor should it be applied, as everyone in this chamber would agree-but is provided for in the legislation in Tasmania, what is its purpose? Mr Ruddock interjecting",121
169,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"Whether this purpose is deliberate or not, a maximum penalty of 21 years in gaol being imposed for a particular offence certainly assists to develop in the public mind the idea that homosexual activity is in some way a horrendous offence and that those who participate in that type of activity are in effect horrendous people. It therefore follows that, if they are horrendous people, they are probably not deserving of very much human consideration and that perhaps they do deserve abuse, intimidation, assault and discrimination. Let us make no mistake-that has been the effect of the legislation. Mr Rocher interjecting",122
170,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"It has been the effect of it. Surely opposition members are not going to deny that which is self-evident. It has been the case. Before I conclude, I would like to refer to a comment made by the National President of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). At the National Press Club a short time ago, he said: . . . Labor is in an excellent position to win and if the Downer-Costello team deliver a sixth consecutive failure, then I would expect the Liberal Party in its present form to break up. The Liberals were probably a national party under Menzies, Holt and Gorton but they are now a loose coalition of States' rights parties, something borne out by their inability to reach a coherent policy position over Mabo and 'gay' rights. An ALP victory in 1999 would take us into the 21st Century and the Republic, another area where the Opposition is neither coherent nor consistent. I wish to add to the comment made by the National President of the Labor Party the comment made by the former Leader of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). When he was sacked, this was his comment in an official published statement: ""To be specific, I am very concerned that the Liberal Party has again failed to live up to its standing commitment to the individual, to inclusion and to represent the broad range of attitudes and views of Australians in the 1990s. Until we do this, we will not be a relevant political force in this country."" (Time expired)",122
171,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"It is something of an understatement to say that the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 has been the subject of a great deal of public discussion and debate over recent times. It involves many competing issues but, to date, the debate has been centred on states rights and human rights. The issues involved are most certainly complex and go to the heart of the political balance between the Commonwealth and the states upon which our federation is based. Whatever we might think of the relevant law in Tasmania, the constitutional and legal issues cannot be ignored. The bill is not really about sodomy but has everything to do with the usurpation of our federal system of government and exposing Australia's sovereignty to the intrusions of foreign national bodies. So that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), is under no misapprehension, I state that I am opposed to the bill. My reasons are straightforward but are not necessarily limited. The decision of the United Nations Human Rights in 1996 Committee was seriously flawed and failed to take into account the reservations of the Australian government at the time of ratification. State criminal codes are the responsibility of state governments and should not be overridden by the Commonwealth. As well, relentless and ruthless use of the external affairs power in the constitution is undermining the system of checks and balances that the original division of powers between the states and Commonwealth was supposed to guarantee. This is a power grab by Labor, with centralisation and abolition of the states being amongst its objectives. Australian laws should be made, legislated and interpreted in Australia by our parliaments and our courts, and should not be determined by United Nations committees or any other longforeign body. This bill, while purporting to further human rights, is inimical to the civil liberties of our citizens. The assumption made by the government in introducing this bill is that the decision of the United Nations Human Rights Committee reflects Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, in particular, articles 17 and 26 of the covenant. Article 17 is the article upon which this bill relies for its justification, though the law in Tasmania does not-I repeat, does not-breach this article. In part, the article states: No-one will be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour or reputation. Forgive me for the sexist remarks. Those are the words of a United Nations committee, and I regret that the female gender was not included. The question that therefore needs answering is this: do sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code arbitrarily or unlawfully interfere with a person's privacy? The answer clearly is no. Sections 122 and 123 do not unlawfully interfere with rights to privacy. Their very inclusion in the criminal code, by way of legislative process, renders them lawful. As for arbitrarily interfering with a person's privacy, it should be pointed out that there is nothing arbitrary about the enforcement of sections 122 and 123. Police can enter premises only where they believe a breach of sections 122 and 123 has occurred and where a warrant has been issued. For police action to be arbitrary, the action must be without reasonable cause. The Tasmanian criminal code already precludes any arbitrary enforcement of the law from occurring. Mr Ron Cornish, the Tasmanian Attorney-General, put it well when he said on the AM program of 21 September: ... the reality here in Tasmania is that adults in private are not interfered with; there is no power for the police to enter and search private dwellings here in Tasmania, even on the suspicion that an offence may be committed under Sections 122 and 123 of the criminal code. Of the 46 convictions under these sections since 1976, there has not been a conviction against consenting adults in private",122
172,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,QED.,123
173,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"QED. Then there is the annexe to the relevant covenant that details the reservations and declarations Australia had when signing the United Nations covenant. The annexe for article 17 makes it clear that Australia, when signing the covenant, did so with the intent of not abdicating its ability to legislate in contravention of article 17 in the national interest, including the protection of public health or morals. From this, it is clear that the Tasmanian criminal code could not be found to be in breach of article 17, as ratified by Australia. The interpretation of article 26 by the human rights commission to redefine the word 'sex' to include sexual preference is an absolute nonsense. The purpose of article 26 is to ensure that all persons are treated equally before the law. That is the case in Tasmania. At the time of the drafting of the constitution of this country, the states agreed to a division of powers between the Commonwealth and the states. Some powers were to be the exclusive preserve of the Commonwealth, some were to be concurrent and the residual powers were to be the preserve of the states. I have heard no-one seriously disagree that criminal law has been the exclusive preserve of state governments, yet this government believes it has the ability to legislate on any issue, including the effective overriding of sections of Tasmania's criminal code. The federal compact to which the states originally agreed was a very different arrangement from that which now prevails. Constitutional change over almost 100 years is understandably inevitable, but the continuing march of the Commonwealth to increase its powers at the expense of the states has been relentless. The coalition strongly supports the federal system in which federal and state powers are distributed so as to encourage participation and to act as an effective barrier against centralist, remote and even, in extremes, authoritarian control. The use of the external affairs power of the constitution has enabled Labor to spuriously circumvent the original and clear intent of the constitution. This bill before us is nothing but a sham that will further reduce the legitimate areas of states' responsibilities. Our system of government at all levels and between different levels is reliant on a necessary process of checks and balances. Labor cannot and never will understand that it is the maintenance of checks and balances in our system of government that contributes towards the development of a workable and sustainable democracy. Every tier of government should be obliged to work within fixed parameters and abide by the established constitutional framework and conventions. Australia under Labor is moving relentlessly towards centralised government. Labor has one major objective: to increase the power of the federal government and eventually abolish the states or reduce their power to such an extent that the state governments become no more than Commonwealth branch offices. Mr Wayne Goss, Australia's most successful Labor Premier, if only because he is the only one, and inheritor of the Bjelke-Petersen fiscal legacy, writing in the Australian of 21 September, stated: There is a real problem developing in the constitutional structure of this country. The continuing of power to Canberra is leading to the de facto abolition of the states. Public debate talks of a new Australian nation by 2001. I suspect the states de facto abolition will be complete by then. The international trend, however, is in the opposite direction. Several European nations, including those in the Eastern bloc, are moving towards federal systems and encouraging political decentralisation and devolution of power. At the same time, business and the Australian Public Service are devolving powers and responsibilities to local areas and smaller business units while the federal government continues to buck the trend to pursue its policy of all power to the centre. The fact is that our liberties and democratic system are best protected when the commitment to our federal system is strong. Christopher Pearson put the case against increased centralisation in the Australian on 30 August. He stated: There is no local shortage of object lessons in the tyranny of centralised power. People understand readily enough that any further concentration of power in Canberra is inimical to civil liberty in general. Defence of the constitution should start with why we need checks and balances on all government and why Lavarch's privacy bill is not a legitimate check on the Groom government. After all is said and done, the fact remains that it is the democratically elected Tasmanian parliament which refuses to repeal its antisodomy laws. Whatever we might think of that, it is the right of the Tasmanian parliament to enact and to leave on the statute books laws which reflect the moral or other values of that state. Interestingly, it can be argued that the Tasmanian House of Assembly is far more democratic than is the House of Representatives. The House of Assembly in Tasmania is elected under the Hare-Clark system of multimember electorates that better represents the breadth of opinion in the Tasmanian community. Let the Democrats stew on that when this bill gets to the Senate because they seem to be in favour of multimember electorates and proportional representation. I am sure they will display their democratic properties when they decide that the Tasmanian government, because it has a superior form of reshift presentation, should have the right to legislate and to leave on the statute books laws which reflect the moral or other values of that state. It is a fundamental human right that the people of Tasmania can elect a parliament which will determine the laws by which they live. There can be few more fundamental human rights than the right to elect a government by popular vote and for the government elected to govern by rule of law. If the Tasmanian people want to change the law, whether it applies to sodomy or anything else, they have the option of doing so via the ballot box or by normal political processes. Labor's so-called privacy bill is a denial of the democratic and human rights of the Tasmanian people and should be rejected for that reason alone. Another principle preventing my support for this bill is my belief that Australian law should be made, legislated and interpreted in Australia by our parliaments and courts. International committees, whether they be from the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation or the like, should have no role in making our laws. For a start, international treaties are ratified by the executive government of Australia with parliament and the states having no formally guaranteed role in the ratification process. The federal government, prior to ratifying a new treaty, may consult with the states, business and other interest groups, but if the government nevertheless wants to become a party to a treaty the ratification cannot be stopped. This poses a dilemma because Australia is currently a signatory to about 900 treaties and is considering signing 60 other treaties within the space of the next 12 months or so. By using the external affairs power, treaties have been employed to increase the scope of federal power at the expense of the states. But also importantly these treaties are drawing Australia into a position where our national sovereignty is being given away piecemeal to international agencies. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",123
174,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"This process is occurring without the knowledge or approval of the Australian people and, more often than not, without the detailed knowledge or approval of their elected representatives. With more and more Australian law being determined by international agencies that are accountable to nobody, it is Australians who are being disenfranchised. In the Bulletin of 11 October, Sir Ninian Stephen is quoted during his recent Sir Earl Page lecture as having said: When power passes from nation states to international agencies, the individual elector risks become increasingly unimportant. The decline in the extent of national sovereignty may mean just that: policy affecting the citizen may be determined at levels altogether too remote, in international forums, by people largely immune to the sorts of pressures that the citizens can still exert over policy making by the Australian government. International agencies and their appeal committees, such as the UN Human Rights Committee, are accountable to no-one in Australia, not even the Australian government. What faith can the Australian people have in these agencies when we cannot be certain that the people on international committees have the experience, qualifications and insight to make a valid appeal decision? Obviously, we cannot have faith in such abilities, as the decision in the Toonan case, where the UN Human Rights Committee got it totally wrong, attests. Australia's parliaments and courts are ultimately accountable to the Australian people. These institutions also have a knowledge of Australia's law, history and other institutional arrangements that an international agency could never hope to acquire. If international treaties are to determine Australian laws or, at the very least, influence them in some way, it is necessary that the federal parliament and the states have a role to play in ratification of treaties. It is not good enough that the executive can ratify treaties that have the potential to have an effect upon the operations of not only the Commonwealth government but also the states. When the constitution was originally drafted and accepted by all the colonies at referenda, the external affairs power was in no way intended to apply as it now does in the context of this debate. Nobody foresaw the scope of the external affairs power, nor did they foresee the extent to which Australia's system of government is now influenced by so many treaties. Clause 4, which is the heart of the bill, raises several questions which have been discussed in many forums but which have been largely dismissed by the government and by other supporters of this bill. It is quite clear that, if this bill applies to consenting adults, who are defined as persons of 18 years or more, committing sodomy in private, it must also apply to prostitution and incest where those persons are consenting adults and the acts take place in private. The legislation creates a right to sexual privacy. Mark Baker in the Age on 24 September stated: The legislation is also expected to spur argument that, if a right to sexual privacy exists, then there must also be rights to other forms of privacy, and those rights should be protected by legislation. Some legal analysts believe this bill could also be used to protect the privacy of individuals from the arbitrary actions of the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities Commission, the Trade Practices Commission and other government agencies. Whatever the merit of that argument, the point is that this bill sets a standard against which other privacy issues will be judged. This bill could also form the basis of a de facto bill of rights, one concept of which was rejected in 1988. Just as importantly, especially in the short term, this bill shows all Australians that Labor has sacrificed the federal system for the accolades of noisy, unrepresentative lobby groups. The majority obviously matter little to Labor because it lacks the clout of minority pressure groups. Besides, this bill is futile because there is no legal issue at stake for consenting adult Tasmanians committing sodomy in the privacy of their own homes. As we all know, Tasmanian police do not prosecute where the act is committed in private. All that will be achieved by this legislation is the further erosion of Australia's sovereignty, a degrading of our federal compact, which is now almost in tatters, and the alienation of the Tasmanian people who surely have the right to govern themselves in accordance with truly democratic and truly Australian principles.",125
175,Mr HAVILAND,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur) (7.36 p.m.)I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this very important bill. The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 provides that sexual conduct between consenting adults over the age of 18 acting in private will not be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference. This is a bill which has not been considered to be necessary in the past because it contains basic human rights and reflects human values which many people take for granted as being basic common sense. However, because of the refusal of some state governments to remove outdated, draconian laws from their statute books and the attempts by reactionary forces in our community, including some of those opposite, to make cheap political mileage from this by using it to espouse their misguided and monotonous support for so-called states rights, it has become necessary to enact this legislation in order that our laws in this democratic society reflect international standards as outlined in article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1980 to which Australia is a party. Article 17, paragraph 1, of the covenant provides: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation One would have thought that was a perfectly reasonable statement of principle to which nobody in this House or in the community could possibly object. But it is important to put this bill and this whole debate into some context. From the outset, let me stress that this bill is talking about sexual conduct between and involving only consenting adults in private. We are not talking about sexual conduct involving children or child abuse. We are not talking about acts of sexual assault or domestic violence of a sexual nature. We are not talking about incest, despite what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has said. We are not talking about sexual conduct involving animals, or conduct which would amount to professional misconduct, or about laws involving sexual abuse of people with an intellectual disability, and we are not talking about laws which regulate the sex industry, despite what the honourable member for Curtin said. We are talking only about acts of consent between people over 18 years in private. I emphasise this point so that this bill is not misrepresented by those opposite or by anyone else for mischievous political reasons: what we are talking about is the ability of adults to engage in mutually consensual sexual conduct in the privacy of their own homes without the fear of interference or intrusion by law enforcement agencies or other people. Although the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has said that the opposition will not oppose this bill, there are still some on the opposition benches who will oppose it, as has been made quite obvious today. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) pointed out in question time in the last sitting week of September, there are more positions existing in the Liberal Party on this bill than are illegal in Tasmania under its laws. All I can say to those opposite intending to oppose this bill is to listen very carefully to what I have to say and what other government speakers have to say. I mean that in all seriousness. This is a very serious issue. If they listen to the debate and take it on its merits, they should not and could not possibly oppose this bill. Those who oppose this bill represent the peeping toms of Australian politics-those who would look through the keyholes of the bedrooms of Australian people to see which way they have sex in their own homes. I think that is disgusting, which is why this bill is so important. This bill underlines a very important princioutside ple in our democracy. It highlights the importance of the distinction between moral values and beliefs on the one hand and legal rights on the other. I state the obvious when I say that a wide range of differing beliefs on social and moral issues exists in our society. In a democracy it is appropriate that these different views and beliefs exist and that individuals have the right to hold different views on issues. The important point here is that individuals do have this right so long as they do not seek to impose their views on others who have differing views. One of the key features in our democratic system is freedom of religion. In Australia a number of different religions and denominations are practised. Christianity is the dominant religion but, in our increasingly multiculpermissive tural society, there are also significant numbers of Muslims, Buddhists, Jews and Hindus. The Christian religion itself is represented by a number of different denominations, while there are also a large number of Australians who do not subscribe to any religion. Undoubtedly, there are many Australians who, because of their religious beliefs or their personal moral values, do not approve of certain types of sexual conduct. This particularly applies to homosexual conduct, as we have heard. It is these people in particular who are being targeted by the government's political opponents and who are being urged to oppose the bill currently before us. But, while these people have every right to hold their own personal beliefs about certain types of sexual conduct, it is important to remind all Australians that this bill is about legal rights, about human rights, not about imposing moral values. As the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) pointed out earlier today, it is about the difference between a sin and a crime. I will illustrate this point further by making some valid comparisons. As I said, many people, due to their religious beliefs or for other reasons, do not approve of certain lifestyles or certain forms of conduct, including sexual conduct. For example, there are still people in our society who do not approve of sexual intercourse or any sexual activity marriage. Indeed, up until the early 1960s it could be argued that this was a prevailing majority view of Australians. If one had conducted a survey in, say, 1960, one may have found that a majority of Australians did not approve of sex before marriage at that time. I doubt whether you would get such an outcome today, of course. But there would still be some people, especially older folk, who would not approve of sexual conduct before marriage. It is their right, in our democracy, to hold those beliefs as long as they do not attempt to force others to conform to their views, especially through draconian laws. The whole point here is that, even in past decades when more people may have disapproved of what might have been termed sexual conduct, that did not make such conduct illegal. I am not aware that sex between consenting heterosexual adults in private has ever been against the law in this country, no matter what the prevailing social, religious or moral views of a particular time might have been. So this debate is ultimately about the difference between moral values which, by nature, differ between individuals and can be subjective and legal human rights which, by definition, have to be the same for everyone in an egalitarian democracy like ours. I will give another example. Most religious denominations disapprove of sexual activity outside one's own marriage, commonly referred to as adultery. When I went to school we were taught that one of the Ten Commandments stated, 'Thou shall not commit adultery,' and many people believe this to be an appropriate community standard, whether or not they are religious people. It could be argued, if a survey was carried out today, that a majority of Australians would say that they do not approve of adultery. Apart from religious beliefs, many would consider that the term 'adultery' implies deception or a breach of trust between partners which is therefore morally unethical or undesirable. Notwithstanding this, nobody ever says that it should be illegal, at least not in a democravalues cy like Australia. I will take this argument a step further. Some religions take the view that sexual relations even inside marriage should occur only when a married couple is attempting to have children. This may seem like an extreme view to take in the 1990s-or some may consider it an extreme interpretation on my part-but it does form the basis of the long standing opposition to contraception expressed by some religious organisations. How could anyone seriously imagine how a government could possibly make laws, let alone enforce them, which would outlaw sexual conduct which is not intended for reproduction purposes? How would we monitor sexual activity to determine whether it was for pleasure or procreation? As I have said, people with the moral or religious views that I have mentioned have every right to hold those views. It would clearly be ludicrous for any government to try to enforce them in legislation, even if they did represent the views of the majority of people-which, in this case, they would not. It is just as clear in my opinion that it is ludicrous and wrong for the Tasmanian government, or any other government, to try to enforce its draconian laws that have become the subject of the public debate leading to the introduction of this bill. While people may have very strong personal views about homosexuality, or various forms of sexual conduct, it is not the place of governments or law enforcement agencies to interfere in the private affairs of consenting adults. When a colleague of mine was asked what he thought about homosexuality his only comment was that he had no problem with it as long as it was not made compulsory. That might be a throwaway line, but it certainly sums up the whole essence of this bill and what democracy is about-freedom of choice. I believe that is the whole point of this bill. We must emphasise that, while all Australians have a right to their own moral beliefs, values and standards and to apply those standards to their own behaviour, none of us has the right to impose our own beliefs, or standards on those who have different views. Nobody has a right to intrude on the privacy of consenting adults-I stress 'consenting adults'-who choose to engage in their choice of sexual conduct. As I have said, freedom of religion is an important feature of our own democracy. The role of the church in our democracy is separate from the role of governments. Indeed, the Australian constitution-the same constitution that we hear so much righteous indignation about from the conservative side of politicsprovides that a government shall not establish a religion. This is a clear statement of the importance in our democracy of the separation of the church and the state. This is an important principle; just as important, in my view, as the Westminster doctrine in relation to the separation of powers of the legislature, the administration and the judiciary. It is a principle which further underlines the points I have been making about the distinction between moral values and human and legal rights. But what do we hear from those opposite? What do we hear from the Liberal Party and the National Party in this place? The Liberal Party, of course, claims to be the party of the individual; the party whose very creation by Sir Robert Menzies-which I believe will be featured on ABC television tonight-was based on the ideals of freedom of speech and the primacy of individual rights over the power of the state. I acknowledge that on this issue the more moderate members of the Liberal Party have had the good sense to at least not oppose this bill, even if they cannot bring themselves to say that they support it. But what about the rest of them? What ever happened to individual rights? What do we hear about individual rights from those opposite-these peeping toms of Australian politics? Apart from the displays of prejudice and authoritarianism evident from some speakers, we have had to listen to the usual nonsense about states rights. To the Liberal Party, states rights are now apparently more important than individual rights or basic human rights. But, as we have seen in recent times and as we continue to see, to these redneck conservatives, states rights are also more important than Aboriginal rights when it comes to land title. They are also apparently more important than the rights of consumers to an equitable and efficient economic system, or the right of families to access government funded child care-particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, apparently-or access to other community services or health services. Apparently, states rights are more important than the rights of public housing tenants to receive adequate public housing in many states of Australia. In so many policy areas at the moment Australians are being denied the benefits of the social justice initiatives and programs of this federal Labor government because of the obstructionism and petty power politics of conservative state governments asserting their states rights. States do not have rights; people have rights. Indeed, no government at any level has the right to interfere with the basic human rights and individual freedoms and lifestyle choices that this bill seeks to protect. Until the coalition parties learn this basic tenet of democracy and social justice, they will continue to be where they are right now-on the opposition benches. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Taylor) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Johns) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Aviation: Nomad Aircraft",126
176,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (7.52 p.m.)Several months ago I placed a question on the Notice Paper for the attention of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), representing the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). The question was in five parts: (1) When will the report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman into the fatal crash involving an RAAF Nomad in 1990 be submitted. (2) When was the matter referred to the Ombudsman. (3) Has the report been prepared. If so, is the report highly critical of (a) RAAF maintenance deficiencies and administrative handling of the crash, and (b) the culpability of Aerospace Technologies of Australia. (4) Do the Australian Regular Army and the RAAF continue to operate Nomad aircraft under operational flights. (5) Will the Ombudsman's report be made available for parliamentary debate. Although the minister has· not yet formally replied to these-and I have to wonder whyI read a copy of the Ombudsman's report many weeks ago. It highlights deficiencies and, arguably, culpability on the part of individuals at Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd and of the Civil Aviation Authority, especially of the latter's structural integrity branch. The Australian designed and built Nomad, which operates here and overseas, both in civilian register and defence roles, has had a chequered history of operational constraint, of grounding, of in-flight incident and, in the extreme, of fatal accident in Australia and, unfortunately, overseas. In the latest fiasco I am informed that, arising from a major inflight incident in the West Indies with a Nomad, remarkably like an incident with an RAAF aircraft at Tindal in the Northern Territory a couple of years ago, further bulletins have been issued by Aerospace Technologies of Australia and others which impose additional operational constraints. In particular, these bulletins deal with a maximum of 10 degrees of flap utilisation and further weight and power setting limitations, which make a nonsense of the aircraft's supposed short take-off and landing, or STOL, design characteristics, so important in both the defence and civilian roles. The recent Lord Howe Island bound aircraft accident and the justifiably criticised role of the Civil Aviation Authority and, I have to say, of the responsible minister, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), raised urgent and serious questions not only for the Minister for Defence in the context of my questions but also for the Minister for Transport in his wider role. I therefore ask the Minister for Defence when I might expect a reply to my question and all of its ramifications. However, I understand that a number of Australian Defence Force aircraft are grounded at the moment until the serious deficiencies are resolved. Of course, as a result, a large measure of confusion and operational penalti!!s persist. I ask the Minister for Transport whether he has seen the Ombudsman's report? Has he been briefed by CAA officials on the Adelaide accident and their reaction to the Ombudsman's criticisms? Is the minister fully satisfied that civil registered Nomads areand I emphasise it-safe? Is he going to ground these aircraft in Australia until all operational question marks are resolved, or will he sit back as he did with Aero Commander aircraft similar to the one that crashed en route to Lord Howe Island? Finally, is the minister taking appropriate action with the Minister for Defence and overseas authorities to resolve the aircraft's obvious shortcomings? Near enough is demonstrably not good enough when it comes to aircraft safety, and I raise these issues an important matter of public importance. I hope both ministers in this case will review the situation and fix it as a matter of extreme urgency. Geelong",129
177,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"As you would know, Mr Speaker, the seat of Corio encompasses the great provincial city of Geelong. With your interest in matters of football, you would be aware that the Geelong football side recently played in the Australian Football League grand final. Unfortunately, we were not successful in that contest. In this adjournment debate tonight, I would like to pass on my congratulations to Ron Hovey, to the members of the Geelong Football Club committee and to the coach and players for the magnificent effort of getting into the AFL grand final. That particular committee in Geelong contains a former Labor minister of a former state government in Victoria, Nipper Trezise. I know Nipper was very sad at the defeat of Geelong at the hands of the West Coast Eagles. Let me pass on my congratulations to the West Coast Eagles on their fine performance on the day. To the Geelong Football Club, it was a magnificent effort. We proved to be the best football side in the state of Victoria. We, a provincial football side, proved to be the masters of a state side in South Australia, a state side in Queensland and a state side in New South Wales. So, all in all, it has been a successful season for the Geelong Football Club and the people of Geelong. Certainly, a victory in an AFL grand final would have brought considerable economic benefits to the city of Geelong, but still there were some great spin-offs for us. It gave the city and the region national and international exposure. Indeed, the support that was given by the Geelong community to the side, in its victories leading up to grand final day and in defeat, displayed the sort of spirit that has been the hallmark of this community in coping with some fairly severe economic problems in recent years. But I am pleased to report to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House, that in this very important manufacturing region of the Comas monwealth the economic outlook is becoming brighter indeed. I refer to an assessment made by the City of Grellter Geelong in the quarterly survey that was produced for the June quarter of this year. Some of the major statistics incorporated in that survey show significant improvements in economic activity. For example, retailing is up 21.8 per cent; manufacturing production is up some 12.6 per cent; and service production is up some 22.8 per cent. There were 1,690 new vehicles registered. The important thing about those registrations was the significant improvement in commercial vehicle registrations in the city. Building activity is continuing to show strong growth, with factory and shop developments surging in those statistics. As far as employment growth is concerned, I would like to refer you, Mr Speaker, to an article in the Geelong Advertiser of 11 October 1994. The headline was 'Region surges ahead in job figures'. As far as the ANZ Bank job survey is concerned, in Geelong the job vacancies advertised rose by some 60 per cent over the last 12 months, which compares with a Victorian average of 49 per cent. This confirms the trend data from the CES and Social Security, which also measures a significant decline in the number of unemployed in the region. I am pleased to say that one of initiatives that the government recently announced in the white paper was the jobs action Geelong program, which has received widespread support from the community and business groups in the Geelong region. In some couple of months of operation, it has yielded in excess of 350 new jobs. If we look at car manufacturing-honourable members would be aware that Geelong has within its boundaries a significant motor vehicle production facility in Ford-we see that there is a very strong demand for cars nationally. This has spilled over to Ford. After the release of the new EF model Falcon, some 7,547 units were sold in a record performance. This has spilled over to the motor vehicle automotive component manufacturers, who have done very well indeed. (Time expired) ABC Regional Radio",130
178,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening in the adjournment debate I bring to the attention of honourable members some changes that are taking place in my area in the management of ABC regional radio as it relates to journalists. I note that the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) is in the chamber. Part of his area is also affected by these changes. The position filled by the journalist who had been stationed at Taree in my electorate on a part-time basis-it is considered as half a job by the ABC-has been relocated to Coffs Harbour. I believe that the journalist who was servicing the area of Taree, Forsterrruncurry and Gloucester has gone on and found other employment in Newcastle. The important point is that we have lost the services of a resident journalist in that region and that position, as a result of a decision taken by management at whatever level, has been relocated into the Coffs Harbour area. ABC regional radio in the region is based at Kempsey. That base services Kempsey and Port Macquarie. Until this move was made there had been outposts, as they call them, at Coffs Harbour and Taree. Now there is nothing at Taree, so we have to be serviced by the journalists at Kempsey, which is really not satisfactory. The Taree outpost services the biggest ABC audience in this region in an area which includes the fastest growing town in New South Wales-Forsterrruncurry-the population of which grew by 30 per cent in the period 1986-91. The city of greater Taree grew by 25 per cent in that period. In contrast, Coffs Harbour grew by only 14 per cent. Audience response on 2KPTR is by far greatest in the region encompassing Forster/ Tuncurry, Taree and Gloucester. As I said, Gloucester is in the electorate of Paterson. About 60 per cent or a little more of the quiz calls and community announcement requests and other random contact have come from this area. There appear to be two main reasons for that: a good signal from 2TR, a relatively new AM transmitter, and two supplementary FM services; and the fact that competitive media does not perform perhaps as well as it should. By contrast, audience response from Coffs Harbour is not as strong. It is a highly competitive electronic market, with ABC Lismore sending its signal down into the Coffs Harbour area. I have been led to believe by people within the ABC that all discussions about upgrading the position in Coffs Harbour to a full-time position have been carried out entirely in the context of the closure of the Grafton outpost and the reallocation of part of its resources. The understanding that was given at that time was that Lismore agreed with this course of action and would contribute half a position to top up Coffs Harbour and use the other half to establish an outpost in the Tweed. At no stage during those discussions was it ever mooted that the Taree outpost should be closed. Some interesting statistics have been brought to light by the research that has been undertaken following these actions. The information coming from the Department of Planning indicates that the Coffs Harbour outpost covers Coffs Harbour and Bellingen, with a population of 70,400. The Kempsey newsroom covers Nambucca, Kempsey and Port Macquarie, with a population of 91,500 people. The Taree outpost, as it was, covered Taree, ForsterfTuncurry and Gloucester, with a population of 71,900. New population projections about to be released by the Department of Planning give the following population estimates for the areas in the year 2001: Coffs Harbour, 79,000; Nambucca, Kempsey and Port Macquarie, 112,000; and Taree, Forster, Tuncurry and Gloucester, 89,000. The actual urban centre populations are: Coffs Harbour, 20,326; Forster and Tuncurry, 14,578; and Taree 16,300. So between the base of Taree, Forster and Tuncurry there are over 30,000 people in the urban centres and in Coffs Harbour only 20,000. I want to bring that matter to the attention of the House. I will be writing to minister concerned about this change, pointing out that we are leaving a large section, geographically and population-wise, un serviced by ABC regional radio on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. I will urge the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to look at the situation and attempt to do something about it. Workers' Rights",131
179,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (8.06 p.m.)Tonight, on the adjournment, I wish to touch upon a resolution that was successfully passed at the ALP National Conference at Hobart in regard to workers' rights. The motion proposed by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) asked the party to broaden and deepen its efforts to achieve greater workers' rights including the following ILO conventions: Nos 87 and 98, freedom of association and rights to organise collective bargaining; Nos 100 and 111, equity and non-discrimination; Nos 29 and 105, forced labour; No. 138, child labour and the right to work in a safe environment. It called upon the government to enhance its development of technical assistance in efforts to support the development of workers' rights particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. It also called upon the government to involve itself in the establishment of a well-resourced, high level tripartite working party which would have representatives from the ACTU, Australian industry and government. It comes at a time when these issues have been highlighted throughout the parliament. In the Senate there was a motion on the subject of child labour. A month ago in this place there was a private member's motion on the subject of child labour. That is the aspect of the motion that was passed in Hobart that I wish to touch upon. To his credit, in a speech in Melbourne on 6 September, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) had this to say: Of all the forms of exploitation and abuse which the ILO strives to combat none is more serious than child labour. The minister went on to talk about the program that the ILO had in place to tackle the the problem of child labour. There was a threepronged approach to this program: firstly, the adoption of measures to end the employment of children who are in hazardous occupations or working under conditions of slavery, that is, forced labour; secondly, measures which would raise the information and awareness and therefore attempt to change attitudes; and, thirdly, targeting the underlying causes of child labour, namely, poverty, unemployment, inadequate social protection and educational systems. In this speech, the minister said: I have asked my Department to closely monitor the ILO's program of eliminating child labour and consider possible means by which we may be able to contribute to the program. Mr Speaker, as you are well aware, I was fortunate to lead a parliamentary delegation to south Asia last year. One of the issues that that delegation took particular interest in was the question of child labour. One of the disappointments that the delegation expressed was that, in the briefings that we received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade before we left, the issue of child labour was not raised. Apparently, at that time it was an issue that our diplomatic missions were not monitoring. I hope that, as this becomes an issue-and the ACTU and this parliament are raising it as important-we will find that departments such as DFAT take a more particular interest. It is not to say that in those three countries child labour is not acknowledged as a problem. Whilst we were in Nepal, English language newspapers had two editorials on child labour. The Kathmandu Post of 8 December talked about Nepal being a signatory to both the UN and the SAARC resolution on the protection of children's rights. Its editorial concluded: Moreover, the exploitation of children has assumed chronic proportions and the Task Force may just be fighting a losing battle. With children employed in all walks of life involving menial labour, the alleviation of their plight may be easier said than done as its roots lie in poverty and the child's labour no doubt contributes to the family income in a significant way. Poverty is acknowledged by the ILO strategy as a great cause of child labour. On 5 December, whilst we were there, there was another editorial on child labour in another English newspaper in Kathmandu, the Rising Nepal. It commenced: Child labour is indeed pathetic touching upon the soft comer on the human mind. It talked about a group under the chairmanship of the President of the Nepal-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce which had 'decided to check the exploitation of child labour in the production of carpets exported from Nepal'. These are significant developments because in Nepal, Bangladesh and India child labour is an important problem. We also had the opportunity to talk to trade union bodies. Again, I hope DFAT will take more trouble to get to know about industrial relations matters in those countries.",132
180,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"Menzies) (8.11 p.m.)This year I inaugurated in my electorate an essay competition for secondary school students in year 11. There were many entries to that competition. Given that this is the International Year of the Family, the question posed was 'How should government treat families?' The two winners of that competition are in the gallery tonight, partly by the generosity of Ansett Airlines, which I acknowledge publicly. I wish to take this opportunity to read some extracts from both essays. The first essay is by Amy Walker, who is in year 11 at Strathcona Baptist Girls Grammar school in Melbourne. Amy writes: The family unit is central to society because it is the place in which the new generation is nurtured and where social behaviour is demonstrated, interpreted and transmitted from one generation to another. It is the basic social unit of any society and is vital for understanding how societies operate. She goes on to draw an analogy between families and small business. She says: Families are like a small busin.ess. A family must manage its resources and income in order to provide for its members' needs. Not only does the family do this but they undertake other roles and activities that noone else can fulfil. Parents provide for and take responsibility for their children 24 hours a day. They look after their children's physical needs such as food, clothing and shelter as well as emotional needs such as love, comfort and understanding. Parents play a major role in the transmission of socialisation skills, and in the development of relationships and attitudes. Parents provide encouragement and a protected learning environment for their offspring. The changing requirements of the family have meant that couples are having to choose dual careers which can create conflicting priorities within the family unit. The elderly are today not as likely to be living with their families when they get too old to look after themselves. They are more likely to be in a home, providing them with special care or in a retirement village. To help the aged the Government could develop a system whereby families could look after their relations in an environment in which they are supported by professionals 24 hours a day. Young people under 20 now have a high degree Families of dependency on their parents. To help them become more independent, the Government should introduce paid training and working schemes as well as increasing eligibility for AUSTUDY. Amy concludes: The family is the centre-piece of society and the Government should support, encourage and assist families in every way possible. The other winner of the competition was Duncan Speller, who is also in the gallery tonight. Duncan is also in year 11 and attends Ivanhoe Grammar school. He writes: The family has traditionally acted as the foundation of Western civilization. The family is a tangible manifestation of the shared destiny of people united by blood or marriage. In this regard, families consisting of two married parents must be considered an ideal because marriage epitomizes the social unity that is the underlying benefit of family. The National Commission on America's Urban Families observed that the two parent family is ""the best model for overall societal well-being."" Moreoyer, there is a strong correlation between the fragmentation of the traditional family and wider social decay. Between 1964 and 1994, as divorce rates increased from eight per cent to 42 per cent, the incidence of juvenile crime increased six-fold in Australia. Any government intent on unifying Australian society needs to acknowledge the pivotal role that families play in developing social cohesion. In this regard, government should provide moral support for the family by mediating in family conflicts. This active support for families could begin with government sponsored pre-marital education. When families are on the verge of disintegration, governments should bring family members to the negotiating table and mediate a compromise that will salvage the family. The unparalleled success of the 'Families First' programme in Britain attests to the benefits of family liation programmes. Duncan concludes: In 1994, the International Year of the Family should provide the impetus for Government to acknowledge what the Australian Social Welfare Commission terms ""the innate social desirability of two parent families."" After all, the family manifests a sense of cohesion and continuity that can unify all Australians in a world ravaged by social upheaval. I congratulate the two winners, Amy and Duncan. I thank the judges-the Mayor of Doncaster and Templestowe and Meriel Cooper, a Melbourne radio broadcaster-for acting in that capacity. I hope the aspirations of Amy and Duncan will be fruitful in the future. Question resolved in the affirmative.

(2) What is the cost to the Commonwealth of retaining the officers. (3) Has the APS expanded recently; if so, why have the officers not been absorbed into productive employment. (B) $20,000 (C) The Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage (QDEH): the grant was subsequently returned to the Department by QDEH, which had decided not to proceed at that time. Citizenship Certificates (Question No. 1450) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 29 August 1994: How many certificates of Australian citizenship were conferred in (a) 1986-87, (b) 1987-88, (c) 1988-89, (d) 1989-90, (e) 1990-91, (1) 1991-92 and (g) 1992-93 in the (i) Queensland Shires of (A) Maroochy, (B) Caboolture, (C) KiIcoy, (D) Nanango, (E) Kingaroy, (F) Esk and (G) Rosalie and (ii) City of CaIoundra, Qld. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that the numbers of certificates of Australian citizenship conferred in these areas are: 1987-88 1988-89 1989-90 1990-91 1991-92 1992-93 145 304 339 280 310 424 130 188 298 220 248 348 I 3 4 2 3 6 15 17 21 12 22 20 7 8 15 26 15 10 9 27 31 26 23 28 2 4 8 II 9 9 61 175 228 240 203 272 Mr Johns-The answer to the honourable Officers member's question is as follows: (1) The concept of 'surplus to position requirements' is not one that is formally recognised under the Public Service Act 1922 or the APS Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987, and statistics on officers who are surplus to position requirements are not readily available. Under the Award, where it appears that APS staff are likely to become 'excess to a department's requirements', the Secretary of the department must provide details to, and arrange discussions with, the relevant union. When those discussions have been completed, the Secretary may formally advise the affected staff that they are excess to the department's requirements. There is no central collection point in the Australian Public Service for information 001 the number of staff who have been fonnally advised that they are excess to departments' requirements. However, under the 1992 APS Workplace Bargaining Agreement, there is provision for departments to refer to the Central Redeployment Unit (CRU) officers and employees who have been declared excess and who do not wish to pursue voluntary retrenchment. The Unit's functions have now been assumed by the APS Labour Market Adjustment Branch in the Public Service Commission. As at 9 September 1994 that Branch had 59 referrals of excess officers and employees on hand. (2) Award arrangements allow for staff who become excess to be retained in employment for seven months (or thirteen months for staff who are over 45 years of age or have more than 20 years' service). The majority of the 59 excess staff are in the thirteen month category. The fortnightly cost of salary for the 59 excess staff is approximately $71,700. The full salary cost of employing them cannot be estimated because it is not known how many will be redeployed before the expiration of the relevant retention periods. (3) According to the most recently published statistics, contained in the Department of Finance's Australian Public Service Staffing Statistics Report 1993, the number of staff in the APS declined by 0.8% in the calendar year 1993. Final statistics for the 1993-94 financial year are not yet available. The Labour Market Adjustment Branch was set up to assist in the redeployment of excess staff across the APS. Together with its predecessor, the CRU, the Branch has assisted in the successful redeployment of 40 excess officers and employees since 1 July 1993. Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales: ANL Ltd (Question No. 1459)  Finance, upon notice, on 31 August 1994: Further to the answer to question No. 713 (Hansard, 22 December 1993, page 4649) relating to the Australian National Line, what information is he prepared to provide on the (a) number and nature of requests for information made of ANL by the Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales and (b) number of task force officers who were located in ANL's offices for more than one day.",177
203,Mr BEAZLEY,PROGRAMIRECIPIENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Infonnation in respect of the matters referred to in the honourable member's question is not readily available. It would be a lengthy task to assemble the information and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of money and effort which would be involved. (b) None. During the recently completed due diligence process officers of the Task Force, along with their consultants and officers of the Department of Transport, attended presentations by, and meetings with, ANL management, which in the case of some of the presentations extended across a number of days. ANL also made self contained office space (with phones, and tables and chairs) available to the same parties, but this was only used on an ad hoc and intennittent basis, before or after meetings or presentations.
